"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,2004-03-25,"—It is important for the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 to be considered in detail. I am delighted and surprised that the Minister for Education, Science and Training looks like he might now participate in this debate after our encouragement yesterday. We said that, if the government was so strongly of the view that this was an education matter, maybe it would be appropriate for the minister for education to actually have something to say on this matter.
Unfortunately, in the summing-up from the government, not only did the issues that were raised by the opposition not get adequately addressed but also a couple of other issues were raised which throw some light on the desperation that the government has in trying to find other examples to justify its case. I think it is important that, whichever minister is responding, the issue of the recent suggestion by the Attorney-General that the Western Australian government has been offering male-only scholarships be addressed. It is quite absurd. A statement has been issued by the Department of Education and Training itself. It clearly states that it was issued by the Western Australian Director-General of the Department of Education and Training, Mr Paul Albert, on 21 March, which was, I think, at the time that the government started asserting that the Western Australians had offered these scholarships. The specific, direct quote is that the Department of Education and Training does not offer teaching scholarships exclusively for males.
The Attorney yesterday tabled a six- or seven-page information guide about these scholarships that are offered to students and had the audacity to say that this supported his claim that the government of Western Australia offered male-only scholarships. The section he has highlighted actually specifically says that the department is seeking applications from people who qualify in various areas. This is under the title, `Areas of need', and there are six areas of need, of which male primary teachers is one. Obviously, it is an important one, but the suggestion that calling for technology and enterprise teachers, Indonesian teachers, special needs teachers, mathematics teachers and physical science teachers as well as male primary teachers is somehow offering exclusive scholarships to men is, I think, completely bizarre. Obviously the government is quite happy to go around and misrepresent other governments and departments for the way that they are trying to deal with this as a practical issue and area of need.
Let me lay out clearly for the minister the issues that we have. We agree with the government that it is important to get more men into primary schools. We agree that the aim and stated objective of the government is a good one. We think that there are many initiatives that can be taken to encourage more men into teaching and to make sure that we are getting quality teachers of both genders into our schools. But Labor do not agree that this is the right mechanism. Labor's opposition is not about protecting the Sex Discrimination Act for the sake of it. The Sex Discrimination Act is there for a purpose. If there is some social reason that everyone supports for it to be changed, we accept that. We just do not believe that this is the reason or the opportunity to do that, because we do not believe that the government has made out the case for why this particular change to the act will deliver an outcome that everybody says is a decent one. Even though the minister is here to participate in this debate now, I do not think that he will be able to present a more convincing argument than any of the people who spoke in support of this bill, who seemed much more interested in talking about affirmative action in the Labor Party and all sorts of other issues but not very interested in talking about how this bill will actually deliver the objective that the government has.
We have already gone through what we think would be more effective measures, but it is important to lay on the record clearly that our objection is that we believe the existing act does provide sufficiently for sensible measures to be taken. This has been proven by the fact that the Catholic Education Office and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission have been able to resolve their particular issue. We do not believe that this bill is necessary anymore. We think that the existing exemption provisions are flexible and that the special measures provisions can also be used for a multitude of other initiatives that people might want to pursue in this area. We do not believe that you should narrow the Sex Discrimination Act and introduce permanent exemptions lightly—particularly not, as I say, in a situation where the instance which gave rise to this bill is now resolved. We do not think that the bill is necessary any more. (Extension of time granted)
The exemption that would be introduced by this bill is not one that would operate in the same way as other exemptions granted by HREOC under the existing act. It will be universal, permanent and unconditional, and we do not know how it will be used and what it will be used for in the future. I am interested to see whether the minister can answer this question. Yesterday, when the Attorney was in a press conference with the human rights commission on another matter, he was asked whether this type of exemption or another change like this would be introduced in other areas in the future. The Attorney answered: `Well, the fact is we've been asked to do this and we haven't been asked to do other things, so we don't need to.'
I am sure that the minister will have seen this article. His photo is in this particular edition of Catholic Weekly, so I am sure he will have seen it. On the front page, Dr Kelvin Canavan emphasises that, contrary to recent media reports, the Catholic Education Office had not requested a change to the Sex Discrimination Act. When I said to the Attorney, `You just said that you have been asked to do this, but you have not been asked in other areas,' the minister at the table will be interested to know that the Attorney answered, `Oh yes, I was asked to do this.' I then asked, `Who were you actually asked by, Attorney, when the Catholic Education Office is on the public record saying that they did not ask for this change?' and he had to admit that he had been asked by the minister for education. So we now have ministers of this government saying, `We've been asked to introduce legislation, therefore we are doing it. We're being really responsive to the community,' when in fact the minister was asked by his colleagues to do it. `We have been asked by the community' is an extraordinary excuse for the need for this legislation when it turns out that they have actually been asked by the minister for education himself.
Let us get some honesty into this debate. The government has decided to do this of its own initiative. We would like the minister to tell us what else this provision could be used for and whether he has any views on questions that were not answered in the minister's summing up, which include: will this have a negative impact on the general provisions that exist in the act, and will having a specific exemption in this area narrow the application of the other provisions? The latter question is a serious consideration that should be taken into account if you are going to change general legislation which prohibits discrimination. I am sure the minister for education, who is at the table, does not want the Sex Discrimination Act to be weakened in any of the other ways that it applies in areas that he oversees. I am sure that he does not think it is appropriate for students, teachers or others at universities to be discriminated against in their employment or in a whole range of things that are covered by this act. I would like to know whether the minister is comfortable with the fact that this bill could weaken the other provisions of the act. If he wants to be the minister responsible for introducing a bill that will weaken the rest of the Sex Discrimination Act, obviously that is an issue for him.
There has been no evidence presented for, and there is not any logic to, the argument that the Sex Discrimination Act itself is what is preventing men from entering the teaching profession. It is not the barrier. It is not the cause. The real issues of why men are not entering the profession are not being addressed by this legislation. It is like saying—and I am sure the minister for education would be familiar with this from his previous life—there are not enough doctors in the country, so we will legislate to give all doctors free train trips to the country so that they can get there. That free train travel might be nice, but it is not going to be enough to change their minds about wanting to live in the country to practice medicine, and certainly the cost of the train travel is not what is deterring them from going there.
The logic is just not made out for why the initiative that is being supported in this bill will deliver the outcome that everybody agrees is important. I think that it does highlight that there is a personal agenda and some posturing that is going on in this area. The minister wants to look good about doing something to help get men into teaching, which we think is important, but we would like to do something more than look good—we would like to actually deliver on this. We do not believe that this bill is going to deliver, so it is really important that the minister substantiate how it is that he believes this bill will deliver anything. Given that the minister is here at the table, I would like him to answer how he can pretend that the government is acting on a parliamentary report called Boys: getting it right, when that full, detailed report and its 24 recommendations do not make a single suggestion that it is the Sex Discrimination Act that should be changed and those recommendations—I think bar one—have not been acted upon by this government, even with 18 months to two years time to consider doing them. (Extension of time granted)
We ask that the government withdraw this legislation based on the fact that the driving reason, the particular circumstance that the government was looking at, has been resolved and that the existing legislation gives plenty of flexibility for other educational organisations who might want to pick up similar or possibly different initiatives that would deal with providing some incentive to get men into teaching. We urge the government that, rather than pursue this legislation, they actually revisit the report that the minister for education was involved in drafting as part of the Boys: getting it right report and look at the range of initiatives that could have some serious impact in this area and result in better educational outcomes for boys. We urge the government to stop playing games with this important issue. Do not use the Sex Discrimination Act as a diversion; let us get involved in a cross-party way in initiatives that will really make a difference to get men into schools and might have an impact on boys' education rather than use this as a diversion for the fact that a lot of money, energy and resources are not being put into real measures that could deliver something for our boys in schools.",REPS,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,5,1
"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,2004-03-25,"—The member for Gellibrand has put a number of questions which she wants me to answer on behalf of the government. One thing she said was that the government had taken its own initiative. Yes, as Australia's Minister for Education, Science and Training, I did take this initiative following four years of close examination of the issue of boys and boys' education in Australian schools and on behalf of not only Australian parents, mothers in particular, but future generations of Australians who will be done a great disservice by young men who leave the education system ill prepared for life and ill prepared for their relationships with others, including and especially their relationships with women.
The AttorneyGeneral said that he or we had been approached. He meant that he and his predecessor, the member for Tangney when AttorneyGeneral, had been approached—by me. What happened was that the Catholic Education Office on 30 August 2002 applied to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for an exemption from the Sex Discrimination Act for something that the average Australian would think quite unremarkable: in order to get more men into primary school teaching, they would like to offer male-only scholarships.
Why is this amendment being proposed by the government and why is it so important? I can assure you that it relates to a number of things. The first is that our boys, our sons, are falling seriously behind where they were 35 years ago educationally in key literacy benchmarks, especially in adolescence. They are behind girls somewhere between three to four percentage points in operational literacy right across the cognitive curriculum from early primary school to the end of secondary school. We should not be concerned about the fact that girls are exceeding the educational outcomes of boys in year 12 in more than 90 per cent of courses that are assessed at the year 12 level. It is long past time that girls be able to fulfil and meet their own educational potential and in many cases exceed that of boys; noone should be concerned about that. But the fundamental concern is that boys are not doing as well as boys were 35 years ago and that boys are represented by more than two to one in the bottom 25 per cent of educational outcomes throughout school.
To add to that, boys are represented in close to 100 per cent of disciplinary programs in coeducational schools. Nationally they represent 80 per cent of students in school disciplinary programs and expulsions. They are more likely to be involved in assault and in drug related incidents; they are three times more likely to suffer injury and death in a motor vehicle accident; they are more likely to suffer spinal cord damage; and, for a variety of reasons, they are five times more likely to take their own life. 
Education is about many things, and many speakers have said throughout the debate that a quality, well-trained, enthusiastic and committed teacher, irrespective of gender, is at the heart of a good educational outcome—and they are right: in terms of achieving pure educational outcomes, it is about the quality of the teaching. But education is much more than simply transferring a thirst for learning to young people and the transferring of skills and knowledge; it is ultimately about building well-rounded human beings. Both men and women bring to the classroom qualities specific to their gender which are critically important to build character and personal development into the lives of our sons and our daughters.
I will give an example of the reality that we face. I had the privilege to chair the boys' inquiry, the parliamentary inquiry, for its first eight or nine months. (Extension of time granted) Amongst the many things that stood out during that time were two men with a lot of life experience and I think psychology degrees who ran a consultancy called COOL—and I cannot remember what that acronym stands for. These fellows were called into schools to deal with problems with adolescent boys in middle and secondary school. At the time of giving evidence, they had dealt with 160 boys in government and non-government schools. They described in some detail the problems that were besetting—I realise that this is of some humour to the opposition—these boys, which went from disengagement in education right through to self-harm. I asked them, `Of the 168 boys with whom you have now dealt, how many have a father or a father figure in their lives?' They paused for a moment before answering and then said, `None, not one.'
The reality we face in this country is that only one in five primary school teachers today are men. Only 18 per cent of those who are training to be primary school teachers are men. In Catholic education, only 14 per cent of those who are teaching in Catholic schools in the state of New South Wales are men. In fact, 15 per cent of public primary schools in New South Wales do not have a single man on campus other than a gardener, and in many cases they do not even have that. Through no fault of their own, one in seven Australian children are living in fatherless families. There are many causes of fatherlessness—for example, death, divorce, separation or abandonment.
There are also children growing up in fathered families. Do you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the average father spends six minutes a day with his son and 14 seconds in meaningful conversation? The average teacher, however, spends 30 hours a week with those same children. In other words, whether they come from fatherless or fathered families, it is critically important that our boys—and our girls—have role models in the formative years of their education because, if they do not, what they are doing is adopting the hypermasculine role models that are paraded before them by the media on a daily basis, such as footballers or rock stars. Many boys have a sense of aimlessness—not necessarily educational aimlessness but aimlessness in their own masculinity. The Leader of the Opposition, to his credit, has focused on the issue of boys and masculinity.
What we have here is a practical way—no-one has ever suggested, and I have never suggested, that it is the only way—to address the problem of the inadequate number of men in teaching by amending the Sex Discrimination Act. The response to this emerging crisis needs to be a full suite of measures, and we have put half a million dollars into examining, for example, the way in which exams are structured at school. Boys often know the answers but they do not understand the questions. I will be announcing shortly that we have also established, on an ongoing basis, 30 clusters for school education which are models of best practice in boys' education throughout Australia. I have also asked the Australian Council of Deans of Education what they think ought to be done to get more men into teaching.
I will run through the sequence of events leading to this bill, because it is helpful. On 3 March 2003 the application by the Sydney Catholic Education Office was rejected by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. I noticed a report on this in the Sydney Daily Telegraph. I did not contact the Catholic Education Office; I recall asking one of my staff to make some inquiries to confirm that the media report was accurate and I was informed that it was. I then raised the matter with the then Attorney-General, the member for Tangney, and I said, `I think that this is absurd.'
I explained the situation: the Catholic Education Office wants to offer 12 scholarships to attract more men to teaching, and there is a very important point in this. The proposal is that a young man who is thinking about going to university—who might be thinking about doing science, engineering, arts or some other course—might then, because a scholarship is being offered to get men into primary school teaching in Catholic schools, decide to apply for teacher education training at UTS, Sydney University or some other university. (Extension of time granted). That male student would then be accepted or not accepted into teacher education purely on the basis of merit. In other words, if his tertiary entrance score were inadequate, he would not get a place. But if on merit he did get a place then he would have a scholarship provided by the Catholic Education Office for which he would then be required to teach in a Catholic primary school for a number of years.
The average Australian—who is following Guy Sebastian and Delta Goodrem or the guys that are going to be up at Mount Panorama in October—looking at the footy results in the Herald Sun today would say, `Yes, that sounds pretty sensible to me.' But, blow me down, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission says, `No, you can't do that.' This was reported in the media on 3 March. I spoke to the then Attorney-General and then on 20 March 2003 I wrote to the Attorney-General officially to ask what options we had under the Sex Discrimination Act to overcome what is an absurd proposition and a problem for which our sons are paying an enormous price. The Attorney-General then corresponded with me and set out the options. In the West Australian on 20 May 2003 there is a report on page 6 which says:
Federal Education Minister Brendan Nelson wants the Sex Discrimination Act to be changed to address a shortage of male primary school teachers.
This was 20 May 2003; that is some time ago. Rather interestingly, in the same article the Western Australian education minister, Alan Carpenter, is quoted as saying:
... he welcomed any move that would complement the Government's—
his government's—
recruitment policies over male teachers.
So we found out that the Western Australian government had been offering scholarships for men. This is very interesting, because the member for Gellibrand sought to present this material as evidence that the Sex Discrimination Act does not have to be changed. The Western Australian government—what I am about to present—did this because it thought it was plain commonsense. Unlike the Catholic Education Office, it did not actually go to the human rights commission for an exemption because it thought no sane person would be opposed to it. So in the information guide for final year teaching scholarships for 2003-04 put out by the Western Australian Department of Education and Training—it covers farming and teaching scholarships, physical sciences and mathematics, with a closing date of August 2003—it says:
2004 Final Year Teaching Scholarships:
A. Areas of need ...
B. Physical sciences and mathematics
This is the information for students about scholarships that are available. There are six categories, as the member for Gellibrand helpfully points out. The department is seeking applications from people who will qualify as: technology and enterprise teachers, Indonesian teachers—presumably teachers of Indonesian, not Indonesians—special needs education teachers, mathematics teachers, physical science teachers and male primary teachers. What qualifications might you have to have to apply for a scholarship to be a male primary teacher? I do not want to reduce the standard of debate in the House, but I present this question to the opposition and certainly to the gallery: what would be a fundamental criterion to be eligible for a male primary school teaching scholarship? You also have to meet the character and other recruitment requirements of the department.
Presumably, a part of the requirement for a male primary school teaching scholarship would be to be a man—in other words, to have a Y chromosome. That is what is being promoted by the Western Australian government. No-one complained about this. The reason this has not come before the human rights commission is that no-one complained about it, and no sane person would. The education minister in Western Australia has actually pointed out that it is working. For the first time this year more men are going into Western Australian public primary schools as a result of these scholarships. It is actually working. It is interesting that the member for Jagajaga, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, put out a media release on Sunday 21 March 2004, which says:
There are no male only scholarships for teaching offered by the WA Education and Training Department.
I beg your pardon? Of course there are. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,5,1
"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,2004-03-25,"—I have to rise in this consideration in detail stage to ask that the Minister for Education, Science and Training try to address the questions that have been raised by the opposition during this debate and that he bother to get the detail right if he wants to contribute to the debate. It is an absolute disgrace that the government would use as an argument to change the Sex Discrimination Act the fact that the Western Australian government did not seek an exemption. It shows that the minister has no idea that state governments are not bound by the Commonwealth Sex Discrimination Act. It is a basic `Sex Discrimination 101' issue and it raises the complete lack of attention to detail that this government has brought to this entire issue.
If the government wants to change the Sex Discrimination Act to deliver an outcome, it should at least bother to find out what the act covers, what is already included in the act, who is bound by it and who is not. Do not, minister, stand up here and say that the reason that the Western Australian government did not seek an exemption is that no-one complained about it. The reason is that they are not covered by the act. The minister is quite wrong. This highlights the lack of detailed attention that the government has given to this issue.
A statement from the WA department of education clearly says that they do not offer teaching scholarships exclusively for males. Of course, some of the people who are going to receive scholarships under these six categories will be men and some will not. Some will be both male teachers and Indonesian teachers. Some will be technology teachers and male teachers. Some will be females who fit into the other categories. It is wrong to pretend that this system is aimed exclusively at males. I seek leave to table that document.
Leave granted.
—It would be useful if the minister read that document before replying on this issue to see that it is the department, not the politicians who are entering this debate, which is explaining that it does not offer exclusively male scholarships. It highlights a point that the minister has made that we are in serious agreement on—this is a complex issue and there are a range of measures that could be taken. The government will have the opposition's support for measures that are actually going to deliver some benefit.
The minister said in his reply that he has been studying this issue for four years and he has been committed to it for a long time. He would know—perhaps I will have to table this too—that his own report, Boys: getting it right, has 24 recommendations in it, none of which suggest that the Sex Discrimination Act should be amended or that that would even deliver any benefit. The Sex Discrimination Act is discussed in this report. It is not as if the committee did not deal with the issue. It dealt with it and made a decision that it was not going to recommend changing the act.
Perhaps the minister might explain why the government would start with this measure when there are a whole lot of other recruitment strategies and a whole lot of other things that could be done without us changing the Sex Discrimination Act. Surely we should have some resistance to changing it as a first measure rather than a last measure. Surely we should seek to do things that are within our existing laws if we possibly can and if they are going to be effective, especially when we have not even been asked to change it by anybody. As we now find out, the only person that has asked is the minister, perhaps from a well-motivated interest in trying to get more men into schools, which we have encouraged him in. He has even acknowledged the Leader of the Opposition's interest in this.
To rush to change the Sex Discrimination Act as one of the first things you would do is completely absurd. The government and the minister must give us a reason why this would deliver any outcome. As the minister says, it might encourage some men to go into teaching instead of into other courses. This report goes into great detail about the problem being retaining men in classrooms. So what is going to happen with these young men who are attracted to teaching if no other measures are put in place to keep them there? We know that men are more quickly being appointed as principals and therefore being moved out of the classroom.
Why won't the minister for education withdraw this bill? I hope that he will answer this in his next response. Why won't he talk with us about initiatives that would really make a difference to meet an objective that we all agree is an important one? Let us get serious about what we can do. Let us look at the sorts of detailed recommendations and initiatives that are in this report that the minister knows would make much more difference. Let us forget about posturing and changing or narrowing the Sex Discrimination Act when it is not going to deliver the outcome that the government seeks.

"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,2004-03-25,"—I will respond to a couple of the specific points made. Firstly, the Australian government Attorney-General has received advice on the male only scholarships being offered by the Western Australian Department of Education and Training that it may have in fact contravened the federal Sex Discrimination Act. That is ultimately a question for the courts. If a complaint of discrimination were to be made, if someone were to complain about the male only scholarships—apparently in the world of the member for Gellibrand and the Labor Party, women are eligible to apply for male only scholarships, but I will deal with that in a moment—the question is going to be resolved by the courts. Section 22 of the Sex Discrimination Act makes it unlawful to discriminate against a person on the basis of their sex in the provision of goods and services.
In fact, as a result of this I have actually had to ask my department to seek advice from the Australian Government Solicitor as to whether we, the Australian government, are contravening the Sex Discrimination Act because we are offering specific bonuses to attract women into non-traditional trades—$1,100 per employee to take on female apprentices in specific trades.
As far as the Boys: getting it right report is concerned, it recommended scholarships for both men and women. The Deputy Chair of the committee that conducted the inquiry, the Labor member for Port Adelaide, was asked why they had done this, because the journalist who wrote the story for the Sydney Morning Herald on 20 March 2003 thought, `This is odd: why would you offer scholarships for women as well as men when you actually want to get men?' The report says:
Rod Sawford, deputy chair of the inquiry, acknowledges the male only scholarships would have been preferable.
He acknowledged it would be preferable and he said:
We thought the discrimination laws would be a problem. That's why we said 50 per cent.
In other words, the committee recommended what it did not because that is what it really wanted to recommend but because it quite rightly perceived that otherwise it would be in breach of the Sex Discrimination Act. So what we are trying to do here is make an amendment which would allow a bipartisan committee that had spent the best part of two years looking at boys' education to make the recommendation that it thought it ought to make.
Last Friday I had one of those surreal experiences and I said to myself, `What kind of country are we living in?' The Sex Discrimination Commissioner, the Catholic Education Office and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission made an announcement. They said that the problem with the Catholic Education Office had now been resolved—that the 12 male only scholarship problem had been resolved. I thought, `Oh, that's great,' and I said to my staff, `What have they resolved? How have they resolved it?' Apparently the way we get more men into primary school teaching in Australia is that we have to get more women as well. So we have the Leader of the Opposition, Mark Latham, running the greengrocer's shop in Green Valley. The Catholic Education Office turns up and says, `We need 12 apples.' He says, `Great, no worries. Here's 12 apples.' But then he says, `By the way, you've got to take 12 oranges as well.' And Brother Canavon says, `Oh, thanks a lot, mate, but we've got plenty of oranges at home. We don't need any more oranges, but only 14 per cent of the fruit at home is apples. We need apples.' And Labor says, `No, you're not getting out of the shop unless you take 12 oranges as well.' What kind of madness is this? 
The member for Gellibrand talks about surgeons, for example. All of us, me included, would like to see more women surgeons in Australia, but do you seriously think that the way to get more women into the surgical profession is to get more men as well? That is the absurdity of what the Labor Party are saying. They are saying that we must spend the next decade hand-wringing while fatherless boys get from birth to the end of primary school without ever having had a man in their lives because, apparently, we have to get more women into primary schools as well as more men. What kind of inspiration would that provide to John Cleese? It is the sort of thing that prompts you to go back and have another look at Life of Brian. What kind of nonsense is it? This is well-intentioned but crippling ideology, and our sons and women who will suffer because of this will pay a very high price.

"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,2004-03-25,"—It is very hard in this debate not to respond to the complete absurdity of the arguments that the government is putting. We have just heard that scholarships being offered to women to go into teaching are not an appropriate thing, even though I would have thought—in question time the minister gives us a lot of homilies about people who cannot afford to go to university or TAFE or get a further education—that the prime objective of a scholarship that pays for students to do their teaching course is to assist those who are financially disadvantaged. That is actually the purpose of a scholarship. These scholarships are designed in that way. As the minister well knows, the Catholic Education Office already offers large numbers of scholarships, which by chance—or not by chance, because we know that this is a problem—do primarily go to women.
To say that requiring an extra number of scholarships to go to women is somehow an outrage, when we know that there are a lot of talented and capable men and women who may go into teaching if they had some financial assistance, and to disparage us in doing that because it does not fit with the sort of initiative that the government is talking about, is a nonsense. I do not want to get stuck in a tit-for-tat debate on this but I want to put on the record that we believe it is important that students who are financially disadvantaged should be able to access support to undertake whatever courses they want. We actually think this is an important issue. It highlights our view that this particular initiative, whether it is changing the Sex Discrimination Act or the offering of scholarships, is not the one that will necessarily resolve this problem.
The human rights commission's initial rejection of the scholarship application was based on the fact that there was no evidence that it was the financial disadvantage of being a student that was stopping men going into teaching; in fact, it was possibly a range of other things, particularly the financial disadvantage they would suffer in the long term by teaching being seriously underpaid. It is those issues of the status of the profession, the pay rates and issues relating to child protection—all of these complex matters—that are putting men off going into teaching.
Scholarships may be one way of dealing with it, but let us not pretend that we are causing some problem by also offering scholarships to women—who may be financially disadvantaged, who may be fantastic teachers, who may be just as entitled to support as men are. The outcome that has been reached between the Catholic Education Office and the human rights commission is actually the opposite of what the minister asserts. It is a sensible way of getting extra men into teaching and of also providing assistance to women who might be able to get into teaching, might want to do it, might make fantastic teachers and might need that financial assistance too. Whatever provocation the minister raises in his next response, I will promise not to rise in this debate again. I think we have traversed all of these issues in great detail.
The opposition do not believe that this legislation is the most effective way of delivering an outcome that we support, and we call on the government to withdraw the bill and talk to us sensibly about the sorts of initiatives that could really deliver an outcome to those boys that the minister talks so passionately about—who are not going to have everything in their lives resolved just by getting men into schools. That will not happen if we do not make sure that we always have quality teachers in schools, if we do not make sure that we support the mix of skills that people need, if we do not make sure that we get the best people by improving their pay and conditions over time—all of those things that a government can have an impact on. I call on the minister to withdraw this bill and allow those discussions to be undertaken, rather than have this diversion of amending the Sex Discrimination Act.",REPS,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,5,1
"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,2004-03-25,"—If you think Labor's position through logically, you cannot accept the absurdity—obviously the government does not. Of course scholarships should be available to women. They should be available to people of all genders. But, when you are trying to deal with a specific problem, which is a lack of men in primary schools—as the Western Australian government has done, as the Catholic Education Office is trying to do—you should be able to offer specific male-only scholarships. I say to the Labor Party: for obvious reasons, I will not be a mother. Despite having watched Life of Brian and understanding where Cleese gets a lot of his inspiration from, I am not going to be a mother. That is pretty obvious. But could I plead with the Labor Party, could I plead with the Leader of the Opposition to listen to the mothers of Australia who are terribly distressed about their boys not having fathers or men in their lives.
It also ought to be pointed out to the Labor Party that this is the kind of nonsense that we have to put up with in this country. The United Trades and Labour Council in the state of South Australia successfully got an exemption to put women into workplaces to train them to be union officials. I have no trouble with that; that is sensible. They have got a desperate shortage of women union officials. At the University of Melbourne, they offer women-only scholarships for postgraduate engineers. Why? Because we are desperately short of female engineers who have advanced training. I have got no problems with that. I understand the logic of that. The human rights commission said, `Yes, no problems.'
The Victorian government has announced that it will be giving at least half of its legal work to women at the Victorian bar because, apparently, only 18 per cent of lawyers in the state of Victoria are women—coincide-entally, the same percentage of men who are training to be primary teachers. No-one is up in arms about that. Some of my colleagues will not agree with that, but at a personal level I think, `Okay, if that's what we've got to do to give women a better break in the legal profession, I'll have a go at that.' But what we are trying to do here is to bring qualities that are specific to the male gender to primary school classrooms in order to inform the personal development of our sons and our daughters, particularly those who come from fatherless families.
The Catholic Education Office might have sufficiently deep pockets to engage lawyers and so on to deal with the human rights commission and all this sort of business, but if you are running a small Christian school, a Montessori school or an Aboriginal community school, you have not got the resources to do that. You cannot do that. You cannot be fearful that every time you try to apply a bit of commonsense you have got to run a cake stall, a raffle and all sorts of fundraising to employ an army of lawyers to go through this nonsense. This bill is sensible. The amendment is clearly defined as applying to teacher education. Entry into the education profession is, and will be, still entirely merit based.
I ask the well-intentioned but misplaced ideologues on the other side: say, for example, that only eight per cent of people on boards in Australia are women—which is the situation at the moment; would we then say, `Right. The way we are going to deal with that is that we are now going to attract more women and we are going to attract more men'? John Cleese and the people in Life of Brian would say, `Yes, that's terrific. Good on you, Stan. That's what we're going to do.' The Labor Party's position here is nonsense, and it is irreconcilable with the attitudes and views of many on the Labor backbench—
—with which you, in particular, would be only too familiar.
Question put:
That the bill be agreed to.",REPS,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,5,1
"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2004-03-25,"—The Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004 provides an opportunity to set out Labor's position on the reforms necessary to address soaring insurance costs, particularly in relation to public liability. Over the last two years there has been widespread public concern about rising public liability premiums and the threat they pose to the operation of many small businesses and community activities. In a bid to address these concerns, the states and territories embarked on a range of reforms to their negligence laws to reduce claim costs and bring damages into line with community standards.
Labor has consistently stressed the need for Commonwealth action to support the efforts of the state and territory governments to reduce public liability premiums. Labor supported amendments to taxation laws to facilitate structured settlements which reduce costs to insurers. Labor supported amendments to the Trade Practices Act to allow people who engage in high-risk recreational activities to waive their right to sue. Labor also supported legislation to remove the personal liability of volunteers performing work for the Commonwealth.
Unlike the government, Labor tried to ensure that the benefits of tort reform were passed on to consumers. The latest ACCC price-monitoring report shows that insurers are again making profits on public liability business. While claims costs are falling, premiums are continuing to rise. Claims costs for personal injury and death fell by 14 per cent in the first six months of 2003. Public liability premiums rose by four per cent over the same period. In September 2002 Labor introduced legislation to enable the ACCC to ensure that cost savings generated by the state tort law reforms were passed on to consumers in the form of lower premiums. But the government refused to debate the bill. Labor believes the government should ensure that consumers, not just the insurance companies, benefit from tort reform.
I now turn to the detail of the bill we are debating today. This bill is intended to address concern that the state and territory reforms will be undermined by forum shopping—that is, that plaintiffs will seek to avoid the restrictions imposed under the state tort reforms by bringing actions under the Trade Practices Act. This is possible because, in theory, the same conduct may form the basis of action in tort for negligence as well as under the provisions of the Trade Practices Act for misleading and deceptive conduct, unconscionable conduct or defective products.
The bill inserts a new part VIB into the Trade Practices Act to deal with those parts of the act which could be used as a basis of action for damages for personal injury. These provisions include part IVA, which prohibits unconscionable conduct, and part VA, which establishes standards in relation to defective goods. Part VIB introduces a range of restrictions and limitations on the award of damages for personal injury for breach of the TPA. It provides that, as a general rule, proceedings must be instituted within three years of discovering an injury. Damages for pain and suffering will be capped at $250,000, and this amount will be indexed by the consumer price index. The bill inserts a threshold to avoid the proliferation of small claims, which have been driving much of the increase in total claims costs. Damages will not be awarded if the court assesses that the non-economic loss incurred by the plaintiff is less than 15 per cent of the most extreme case. The bill also caps damages for loss of earning capacity at twice the level of average weekly earnings. Another major component of claims costs is damages awarded for gratuitous attendant care services, which are defined in the bill as:
... services that one person provides to another person:
	(a)	that:
	(i)	are of a domestic nature; or
	(ii)	relate to nursing; or
	(iii)	aim to alleviate the consequences of a personal injury; and
	(b)	for which the other person has not paid or is not liable to pay.
The bill imposes caps and thresholds on the award of damages for these services. In order for damages to be paid, the services must have been provided, or are to be provided, for at least six hours per week over six months. Damages for payment of the services are capped at average weekly earnings. The new part VIB also proposes that a discount rate of five per cent apply to future economic loss in determining the present value of lump sum payments. The bill also prohibits the award of exemplary or aggravated damages. The new part VIB is broadly consistent with the approach applied by the states and territories in their negligence reforms. Because in some respects it is tougher than previous provisions applying under state laws, it will deter forum shopping. Labor supports the damages regime proposed by the bill.
The House should note that the government's approach in this bill is in stark contrast to the approach it adopted in relation to the first tranche of trade practices reform. In the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003 the government sought to remove the ability of consumers and the ACCC to recover damages for personal injury and death sustained as a result of conduct which breaches the unfair practices provisions in division 1 of part V of the Trade Practices Act. The key provision in part V is section 52, which prohibits corporations from engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct.
Following a Senate inquiry, Labor moved amendments to the bill consistent with a proposal which had been made by the ACCC. The Senate supported these amendments, which picked up state and territory caps and thresholds on damages to ensure that a plaintiff could not receive a higher judgment under the Trade Practices Act than if they sued for negligence under state law. The government refused to accept these amendments. As a consequence, damages for personal injury under division 1 of part V remain uncapped and are not subject to any of the thresholds that apply under state civil liability laws, so the potential for forum shopping remains. 
I would like to briefly discuss some of the reasons advanced by the government for opposing Labor's amendments. The government's position is that there should be no liability under section 52 for personal injury and death, because section 52 is a no-fault provision. By that the government means there is no requirement to prove that a person acted negligently or dishonestly in order for liability to arise under section 52.
The government's position on related issues is inconsistent. Soon the House will debate the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Professional Standards) Bill 2003. This bill seeks to support state laws which cap the liability of professionals. Once again, the government argues that it is necessary to amend the misleading and deceptive conduct provisions of the TPA to support the state reforms. However, in the professional standards bill, damages under the TPA for misleading and deceptive conduct are capped to an amount set by state law. The right to bring an action is not abolished. The government's preferred approach therefore gives rise to the following anomaly: where a consumer loses thousands of dollars as a result of misleading and deceptive conduct by their accountant they will be entitled to compensation under the Trade Practices Act; in contrast, when a company's misleading and deceptive conduct causes personal injury or death, consumers will not have a remedy under the Trade Practices Act. The government may wish to explain the inconsistent treatment it proposes in relation to these two types of events under the no-fault provisions.
Under section 74D of part VA, consumers have a right to bring an action for damages where goods are not of merchantable quality. This is also a no-fault provision. A consumer does not have to show that the manufacturer of the goods knew, or should have known, that they were flawed. In this bill the government accepts that a breach of section 74D can be a basis of action for damages where the breach resulted in personal injury. Again the government may wish to explain the difference between its proposed treatment of the no-fault provisions under section 74D and section 52. So far the government's only explanation is that the parliament never intended section 52 to cover personal injury damages. However, in the 12 months since the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003 was introduced, the government has produced no evidence to support this assertion. That assertion is contradicted by the presence of section 4K, which makes clear reference to loss or damage in the act, including by injury.
In making its case to abolish the rights of consumers to seek personal injury damages under section 52, the government has repeatedly argued that doctors' exposure to the Trade Practices Act is driving up medical indemnity premiums. However, there is no evidence that liability under the TPA is a major contributor to medical indemnity claims costs. The report of the Medical Indemnity Policy Review Panel to the Prime Minister last December did not make one reference to liability under the TPA. Senator Coonan said that a doctor who recommends that a patient undergo an operation to have a growth removed on the basis that it could be malignant may be found to have misled the patient if it were later discovered that the growth was benign and the operation unnecessary. However, the case law on section 52 suggests this is not so. The case law indicates that a prediction or opinion is not misleading or deceptive merely because it does not come to pass or is incorrect. An opinion will breach section 52 if the person making it knew it to be false and misleading or was reckless. If a doctor can show that he or she acted reasonably, he or she will not be held liable. That is what the case law says. The minister should exercise more caution when commenting on the effects of a provision that has been in force for 30 years.
Labor's efforts to maintain broad application of section 52 are supported by the ACCC. In its submission to the Ipp review of the law of negligence, the ACCC argued that it would be both economically inefficient and morally unjustifiable to expose consumers to greater risk and relieve suppliers of their existing obligation to fully inform consumers of those risks. Last December the Deputy Chair of the ACCC, Louise Sylvan, said that `serious harm would flow from any proposal that narrowed the scope of provisions prohibiting misleading and deceptive conduct'. The argument that it was unfair to impose liability on companies because section 52 is a no-fault provision was also rejected by the commission. ACCC commissioner Jennifer McNeill, in giving evidence before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, said:
In a situation where a business misleads or deceives a consumer and the consumer suffers damage—in this case, personal injury—as a result, the commission thinks that, as a matter of principle, they should be held accountable and liable for that damage, irrespective of intention. In part, that is because it is much more within the control of the business involved whether and how the representations are made; it is not within the control of the consumer whether and how the representations are made.
Last year the Senate Economics Legislation Committee heard evidence of several plausible scenarios where the removal of the right to bring an action under part V, division 1 could result in consumers being left without a remedy. The examples included cases where defendants had destroyed crucial evidence. Section 52 of the Trade Practices Act serves as a safety net in these rare cases. More broadly, witnesses emphasised the contribution made by the Trade Practices Act in creating a culture of care in the business community.
While Labor supports the continued application of section 52 to personal injury cases, we believe that action is required to support the state and territory reforms. In an effort to achieve this, my colleague Senator Conroy wrote to Minister Coonan earlier this month, suggesting a solution to the current impasse. Labor proposed to the government that, in order to ensure a consistent approach applies to all cases where personal injury results from a breach of the Trade Practices Act, this bill should be amended to ensure that the constraints on damages and limitation periods imposed by this bill should also apply to actions brought under division 1 of part V. This would only require a simple amendment to proposed section 87E of the bill. Unfortunately, the minister rejected the proposal. The opposition is disappointed by the minister's response. The only conclusion the community can draw from it is that the government is not interested in achieving any workable compromise. Labor supports the objective of this bill to restrict the damages available under the Trade Practices Act in order to deter forum shopping. This can be done while preserving the application of fundamental consumer protection provisions of the act. I urge the government to reconsider the merit of applying the scheme contained in the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004 to the other provisions of the Trade Practices Act that can be used as a basis for action for personal injury.",REPS,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"King, Peter, MP",LP,2004-03-25,"—In a case that has become known as a seminal decision on the Trade Practices Act and its operation, Brown and the Jam Factory Pty Ltd, reported in the Federal Law Reports in 1981 at page 340, the Federal Court, which has over time had primary responsibility for the administration of this statute, in the Full Court, in relation to the primary provision in division 1 of part V of the statute currently under consideration in the amendments proposed in the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004, which is currently before the House, said:
Section 52 is a comprehensive provision of wide import, which does not adopt the language of any common law cause of action. It does not purport to create liability at all; rather, it establishes a norm of conduct ...
At the heart of the discussion in relation to the expedient provisions that are currently before the House in terms of amendments and counterproposals from the opposition is the question as to whether or not the provisions of part V, division 1 should be amended to undermine that basic standard. My basic point in relation to that question is that the amendments before the House do not; rather they address a different question—that is, whether or not the Trade Practices Act in its current form has utility in the context of the insurance crisis that this country has faced over the last few years.
There are two issues that struck me as being important in the context of the issue of principle. The first is whether the provisions before the House might in some way undermine the general standard that the Trade Practices Act sets out in relation to consumer provisions. I suggest that they do not, because the mere fact that there may be some curtailment on recovery of damages does not necessarily undermine the general principle or standard for which the act provides.
The second criticism, which is inherent in some aspects of the comments of the member for Kingston's observations, is that different standards in place for different forms of loss under the Trade Practices Act—for example, economic loss versus loss for personal injury or death—would arise from the amendments brought by the government. At the end of the day, that does not really bite as a criticism, because the legislation before the House is seeking to limit the types of recoverability so as to retain a general regime such as found in part V, division 1.
The specific terms of part V, division 1 deserve some consideration before going to the terms of the amendments and giving some detailed consideration to those. Division 1 contains key consumer protection measures, the most commonly used ones being those that deal with misleading and deceptive conduct—and I have already referred to section 52—and false and misleading representations in section 53. There are other provisions in part V, division 1 of the act, including provisions dealing with bait advertising, harassment and coercion and pyramid selling, which are affected by these amendments.
Provisions in part V, division 1, where breached, give rise to a right to recover damages for any loss that has been suffered as a result of a contravention. In addition, consumers can seek injunctive relief, punitive orders—and, indeed, non-punitive orders—and remedial orders. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission can take legal action on behalf of a person who has suffered loss, as can individuals claiming such loss where provisions have been breached. It is even possible for criminal proceedings to be brought against persons who have breached any one of the requirements, other than section 52, which does not give rise to a criminal offence. It is important that the Commonwealth takes a lead in these matters—as it did as a result of the Premiers Conference, which was referred to in the minister's second reading speech. This legislation is replicated by all states and territories in their own consumer protection legislation.
The proposed amendments are a second tranche of amendments supporting the reforms that have previously been brought before this place. They introduce into the act a new part VIB, which establishes limitations and caps on maximum amounts that can be awarded for different heads of damages in relation to personal injuries and death. It will also apply to personal injuries and death claims brought pursuant to unconscionable conduct under part IVA; product safety and information provisions under division 1A of part V; supply cases against manufacturers or importers of unsatisfactory consumer goods under part V, division 2A; or importers of defective goods, under part VA.
These are extensive amendments which will have the effect of impacting across the board on all claims of this type in relation to personal injuries or death. I heard from the member for Kingston that one of his criticisms was that the proposals before the House were insufficiently extensive and did not cover all possible claims of this type under the statute. It seems to me, having regard to the matters that I have just addressed, that they are sufficiently extensive. Part VIB will provide a framework for phasing in damage for a non-economic loss depending on the severity of an injury. The bill will also introduce new arrangements for limitation periods and limiting claims in respect of attendant care services.
These reforms are really a response to the claims by the general community, and particularly the insurance community in this country, over the last three years of what has been seen as a crisis. A culture of blame was referred to, I think, by the minister in a speech that she gave to the University of New South Wales law faculty in 2002.
But it seems to me that it is important to give some consideration to the precise basis on which the legislative amendments have been brought. It is fair to say that there is debate about that matter. The collapse of the HIH Insurance group was the starting point for this whole problem. That insurance group collapsed as the result of an unfortunate set of circumstances, to say the least—a bad deal between FAI and HIH, the origins of which are still the subject of investigation and possible criminal proceedings. Many thousands of people were hurt by that shocking series of events. A number of them in my electorate have complained to me that they are still unable to get insurance, which they once had through HIH, to ensure that their family businesses can operate effectively and properly, especially small builders, plumbers and so on. That had a disastrous effect on the Australian economy outside the insurance industry. Terrorist bombings and 11 September 2001 were also said to be an influence upon the insurance crisis that occurred at that time. No doubt, in terms of international travel and tourism there was a very adverse effect. As a result, there was possibly a loss of insurance premiums in the market generally across the country.
On the other hand, it has to be recognised that unwise business practices by insurance companies have had an impact upon the worsening position of insurers in this country. When taking into account the proper response by government to claims made by a market that it has fallen into a situation which requires government intervention, I would not encourage governments to intervene in any marketplace, particularly the insurance marketplace. It is perhaps arguable that one of the reasons the insurance industry has got itself into trouble is that there has been too much interference by government over time. For example, at a state level, the amount of government interference, regulation and prescription in respect of motor vehicle insurance policies or builders insurance policies, forcing people to insure when they would not necessarily do so, makes insurance companies lazy and it makes adjusters, underwriters and loss assessors uncompetitive in certain respects and possibly even, as I have said, lazy. This is a problem which I think, at the end of the day, has to be addressed on a broader scale than the current legislation before the House.
A poor investment climate has also been identified as part of the problem. The size of personal injury claims has also been identified as a key contributor to the problem. It has been suggested, perhaps unkindly, that current market conditions have affected the issue and that insurers have been caught up in a cycle. If that is the case then legislation such as this would seem to be unnecessary. It ought not to be ignored that some comments have been made on the report which is the foundation of the legislation before the House. For example, Mr Henry Ergas said in the Australian Financial Review in October 2002 that the assertions made by Justice Ipp and his colleagues were `fact free'. Another comment in that particular article referred to a `dearth of hard evidence' and said that the recommendations in the Ipp report were `based primarily on the collective sense of fairness of its members'.
Notwithstanding those criticisms of some of the conclusions in the Ipp report, it seems to me that the report required a government response and deserved public attention. The Trade Practices Act is a statute that has given rise to a culture of blame and a culture of complaint, in terms of litigation; to increased insurance costs; and, most importantly, to a negative impact upon community groups affected by the resulting higher premiums. I think every member of this House has at some stage in their addresses on this issue in this place referred to community groups that have been affected by significantly increased premiums—the pony clubs, police boys clubs, RSL clubs and so on.
So, at the end of the day, these reforms are necessary. It is appropriate that they be addressed. The culture of complaint that is at the heart of the problem that is being addressed by these amendments is one that we need to look at in the longer term. You might ask: have Aussies gone soft, have they moved on from accepting responsibility for their own actions to simply litigating every time a problem arises? I do not think that is the case. But, on the other hand, we do have to ensure that where legal remedies are available for people they are remedies which this society can afford. It is on that ground that I support the legislation.",REPS,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2004-03-25,"—As earlier contributors have indicated, the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004 is part of the government's response to the huge increase in public liability insurance premiums and, in many cases, the inability of small businesses and community groups even to secure any insurance coverage at all. There has been no shortage of examples of this in my own electorate. For example, this year we almost did not have a touch football competition in my home town because of the organising committee's inability to secure any insurance whatsoever. 
—How did you keep fit, then?
—The Upper Hunter Eisteddfod—an important cultural event of long standing based in Muswellbrook—has almost been forced from existence. The member for Wentworth asked me how I kept fit in the absence of a touch football competition. He knows only too well that I am pretty good at being injured. On that basis, I no longer participate in the touch football competition.
The Richmond Vale Preservation Society, which rehabilitates steam engines in my electorate and runs tourism type train rides in the area surrounding Kurri Kurri, has had to fold its tent on those activities because of insurance concerns. The Singleton Cancer Support Group would have had to cancel its 2002 fundraising activities if Hunter Health had not intervened and extended its own coverage to indemnify them. Like most members of this House, I have had numerous representations from various small business people who are struggling with either spiralling premium costs or indeed an inability to secure insurance at all. In response to all of this, all states and territories have moved to reform their tort laws and as part of that they have imposed caps on general damages, amongst other things. 
As the member for Wentworth was saying, many forces have been cited to explain why the insurance crisis in Australia has reached such dizzy heights. The most obvious is the collapse of HIH. There was not only the removal of one of our biggest insurers from the market but also the fact that HIH was making most of its money on reinvestment rather than from premiums per se, and on that basis a heavy discounter was taken out of the market when HIH collapsed. The various terrorist events around the world, which have had a devastating effect on so many cities and countries, have had an effect on the assessment of risk and, therefore, insurance premiums.
The interpretation of the courts of various questions of law—such as the standard of care, the concepts of causation and the remoteness of damage—have also had an impact, as has the general move towards a more litigious society. There is an Americanisation of our society, you might say—a willingness and preparedness of people to take action for seemingly any event. Even my own children, who are aged only 12, 13 and 14, have a propensity to look to the law when they are aggrieved by some matter. I recall that one afternoon there was a foreign dog in my backyard—
—What was it doing?
—It was spying for the Liberal Party, I suspect. It was drinking from our own dog's dish. My then 11-year-old suggested that we should sue the owners of that dog for its having the audacity to enter our property and drink our dog's water. There is a changing culture in Australian society. As I have said, there is an Americanisation of Australian society, and it is of concern and something that we all should strive to keep in check.
—Did you sue?
—No, we did not sue. I can assure the member for Wentworth that no legal action was taken—mainly because I cannot afford the legal costs. As people involved in such events and the member for Wentworth will know only too well, the cost of legal representation is also spiralling, which is another reason we have these matters coming before the House. I am pleased that the member will find a comfortable income when, sadly, he departs this place.
The principal aim of the law of torts is to provide compensation for a civil wrong. That compensation can take many forms. For example, it could be payment for pain and suffering or, alternatively, repayment of money that was inappropriately gained. But, while tort law is about transferring loss from one party to another, the advent of insurance has rendered our tort law more about spreading loss across the community. That fact inevitably leads us to the interplay between legal concepts and economic theory. On that front, the question arises as to whether tort law should not only be fashioned to ensure that losses are spread but also be designed in a way that maximises economic efficiency.
That brings us to the role of deterrence as a function in our tort law. No doubt the ACCC partly had deterrence in mind when it raised its concerns before the Senate committee about the provisions of the first tranche of these reforms—in other words, the provisions in bill No. 1—which sought to totally remove the ability of the consumer to seek the recovery of damages for death or accident under the provisions of the Trade Practices Act. 
Labor accept that forum shopping is a risk. It is of concern that, in the wake of state tort reform, people seek to shop around and gain access to more generous damages under the Trade Practices Act, so we certainly support the concept of closing those loopholes to prevent forum shopping, but in doing so we believe that the amendments in the bill should be in general uniformity with what is taking place in the states and, therefore, that damages should be limited on the basis of general standards amongst the states. That is why we raised objections to the first bill, and we maintain those objections. 
Now, with respect to the second bill, which takes a much different approach, we ask why the government should see fit to limit damages under one part of the Trade Practices Act but to remove them in their entirety under a second part of the act. For some explanation of this, I went to the second reading contribution of the member for Parramatta, who introduced the bill. I cannot say that I took any great comfort in his words, because the key point he made was this:
In contradistinction it is open to serious question whether parliament intended the provisions that relate to unconscionable and misleading or deceptive conduct—that is, the relevant provisions in part IVA and part V division 1—to provide causes of action to individuals who suffer personal injury and death in the absence of any element of fault required to establish misleading and deceptive conduct.
The thing that concerns me is the words `it is open to serious question'. They are hardly reassuring for a member trying to determine what the correct legal position on these matters is. In any case, whether or not the issue of fault is required, I still cannot understand why the government would not take a safer and consistent approach to the whole of the act and limit the damages in line with what one would secure under various state acts. I know that in the past the government has argued for consistency across the act. When we were dealing with the insertion of representative actions in the Trade Practices Act—that is the ability and capacity of the ACCC to take action for an injured party in the context of big businesses abusing market power over small businesses—the government argued in the face of our resistance to extending those provisions to 45D and E that there should be consistency across the act. I think the same principle should apply here. I invite the government to fold its tent on its resistance to our amendments to bill No. 1 so that we can get on with these important reforms.",REPS,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2004-03-25,"—I am very pleased to speak to the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004. This is an important debate that is taking place in this chamber, because it deals with an issue of great concern across the community at large. That is the issue of insurance premiums, in particular insofar as it is having a detrimental impact on all of those volunteer organisations and community groups that play such an important role in ensuring that the social fabric in our communities remains strong. All those volunteer and community groups play an important role in ensuring that the services that many have come to expect are there. For example, such a group is the surf lifesaving movement, which I know many people in my electorate on the Gold Coast have come to expect to be there when they go to the beach with their families.
In the same way, this is an important debate because it deals with the very serious issue of the way in which not only federal government but all tiers of government are dealing with the exponential growth in premiums that seems to be occurring as a result of Australia's society becoming more litigious. I heard the member for Wentworth earlier reflecting on the fact that Australian society does seem to have become more litigious, and I wonder whether it is because of some high-profile incidents in which significant people in Australia's history have sought legal action. I am reminded of the member for Watson. The member for Watson, in a very high profile case, brought action against the Commonwealth government after he fell off his bike. I cannot help but wonder whether the member for Watson is one of the reasons why we see this growth in personal injury lawsuits taking place with respect to not only negligence but also the various courses of action open to people to pursue under, for example, the Trade Practices Act if they engage in forum shopping.
The reality is that over the past two years the Commonwealth government has been leading the initiative with respect to ensuring that the states and territories are on a program of reform to make liability insurance more available and affordable. There was clearly a perception in the community that the way the courts were deciding on negligence cases was unclear and unpredictable. I turn my mind to two high-profile cases of the recent past which have led to grave concerns being held in the community. One was an instance on the Gold Coast. A young man who was at a party and had had several drinks dived off a back fence into the canal behind the home, which was on one of the extensive canal properties available on the Gold Coast, and in the process injured himself. He then successfully brought a lawsuit against the owners of that property, arguing that the owners of that property had a duty of care—and that, if they were having a party at their place and someone had had too much to drink and, in an inebriated state, decided to climb onto the back fence and dive into the canal and injure themselves, that was reasonably foreseeable to a certain extent and the owners of the property should have taken measures to ensure that that did not occur. I find that farcical, and I know most of the community finds it farcical. That example operated perhaps as an ancillary to another ridiculous decision by the courts with respect to an individual who dived into the ocean at Bondi Beach and hit his head on a sandbar that had arisen under the surf. In that particular instance the courts ruled that, when that individual who was swimming between the flags dived into the ocean and hit his head on the sand underneath the waves, that was in some way reasonably foreseeable and the local council—and of course, through the council, all ratepayers—had a duty of care to that particular individual and were in some way liable for the fact that this was not foreseen.
They are two shocking examples of the way in which negligence law in Australia seems to have completely run off the rails. I am very pleased that the Howard government has been leading the program to ensure that we move away from this increased sense of litigiousness that is taking place in Australian society—that we move away from people's first reaction if they get injured being: `Who can I sue?'—towards a society that no longer looks to blame someone but recognises that some accidents do occur and if you are walking down the footpath and you slip or if you are elderly and you catch your foot on a broken footpath and you trip, you cannot always automatically seek to sue someone in relation to that event occurring. Until society in Australia at large recognises that we are all adversely affected by this increased sense of litigation taking place in the community and that we all bear the cost of this increased litigiousness, we will all continue to pay the price associated with that.
I had a discussion recently with a good friend of mine, Dr Darryl Gregor. Dr Gregor is a well-known ophthalmologist on the Gold Coast and runs a very successful clinic there. He described to me the great sense of unease that exists among the medical fraternity, not only on the Gold Coast but Australia-wide, as a consequence of people's first reaction if there is a problem being: `Who can I sue?' The reality again is that, in large part, this is brought about by changes and escalating premiums with respect to liability insurance. In that regard it is very important that we undertake reforms to ensure that not only, for example, the medical fraternity has its costs brought under control but also community groups—and again I would highlight the surf lifesaving movement—are not stung by the burden of exponentially growing premiums for their insurance.
The reality is that it had become too easy for plaintiffs in personal injury cases to establish negligence, and the payouts were seemingly too high. The whole system was rapidly falling out of balance. Again I would cite the case of the medical insurance industry to highlight the social costs associated with what took place there and in particular the fact that Australian taxpayers had to bail out UMP to the value of $400 million or so. Again, that was a social cost borne by all Australians as a consequence of the general affliction in the Australian community of automatically thinking, `Who can I sue?' if something goes wrong.
As I have mentioned, the federal government has been leading the charge to ensure that there is a national uniform set of reforms to tort law. All ministers across the country have agreed that tort law reform is the area in which governments can have the greatest impact on the insurance crisis. As a consequence of these discussions, the Ipp review was appointed in May 2002. It handed down its report in September 2002, which included a number of recommendations about how to deal with the escalation in insurance premiums.
The bill before the chamber today is the second tranche of Commonwealth reform, the first being the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003, which was passed and which I also spoke on. That bill dealt with forum shopping and in particular the use of part 5 of the Trade Practices Act to sue in cases of personal injury and death. Once both tranches have been passed by the parliament, the Australian government will have met its commitment to implement the recommendations flowing from the Ipp review.
The Ipp review itself concluded that, for many cases, a damages action under the Trade Practices Act is a real alternative to a damages action in negligence. Therefore, it can be plainly seen that any reform by the states and territories of common law negligence which are aimed and directed towards slowing the rise of public liability and professional indemnity premiums, and making such insurance more readily available, would fail unless it was done in cooperation with the Commonwealth making complementary changes to the Trade Practices Act. In fact, studies have been conducted and commissioned regarding the economic benefits that would flow as a consequence of complementary reform, both of the states and territories and the Commonwealth. PricewaterhouseCoopers conducted an actuarial assessment of the economic impact of national reforms to negligence law on both the affordability and availability of public liability insurance. The assessment noted that, if key quantifiable elements of the review were implemented, an initial reduction in public liability premiums of 13.5 per cent could be expected. The assessment also made the suggestion that, over the longer term, the behavioural effects of adopting the suite of recommendations not only on the definition of negligence but also dealing with duty of care as well as the other Ipp review recommendations on liability reform should result in significantly larger cost savings.
So right here I would highlight to my constituents in Moncrieff and my local community groups the savings that will arise as a consequence of this second tranche of legislation being passed. Only two days ago I had an email from the Main Beach Progress Association, a very important and very committed local community organisation in my electorate. The organisers and executive members of the Main Beach Progress Association raised with me their concern that there had been significant increases in their public liability premium. Likewise, there is a litany of examples of community groups in my electorate that have suffered as a consequence of this escalation in premiums. I would highlight to each and every one of them that there are benefits of as a consequence of this law being passed. Whilst I am pleased that the opposition is broadly supportive of the principle of tort law reform, the reality is that its arguments about why it is opposed to this piece of legislation simply do not stack up.
There is a clear distinction between the operation of, for example, section 52 of the Trade Practices Act and the provisions that this bill is aimed and directed towards. There is a clear distinction between whether or not section 52 originally was intended to have application with respect to courses of action for personal injuries and death over misleading and deceptive conduct versus the courses of action available and that this bill here is directed towards—for example, bringing an action against a supplier of a product—somewhere that it was originally envisaged there would be a course of action arising should there be personal injury or death. That is the reason why the government is committed to these reforms.
The opposition might be unclear and say, `Well, we'd like one blanket uniform rule to apply both to part 4A and part 5.' But this government's position is quite distinct from that, and it is a recognition that originally it was envisaged that there be some application under the provisions that this bill deals with versus the use of, for example, section 52—which, quite frankly, was not intended to be used in the way that it has become increasingly common for it to be used. It has become increasingly common because people are engaging in forum shopping. They think that if they can be successful with a section 52 claim they would like to pursue that. That is the reason why there is a very clear distinction—and a need for there to be a clear distinction—between the first bill that this government passed and this second bill dealing with those other provisions not contained within part 5.
So, what are the new caps and limitations for personal injuries and death actions under the act? Under the new rules, claims for damages for personal injuries and death actions under the relevant sections of the act must be made within three years of the date of discoverability and no more than 12 years—the long-stop period—after the event on which the claim is based. Special concessions to these rules apply, for example, in the case of minors or incapacitated persons. There will also be discretion available to the courts to extend limitation periods in appropriate cases, having regard to the justice of the case.
The amendments also establish a tariff, cap and threshold for the award of general damages. The maximum amount of damages for non-economic loss will be set at $250,000 and will be indexed to the CPI. This amount will only be awarded if the injury represents a most extreme case. In cases where the extent of the injury is between 15 and 100 per cent of the most extreme case, a pro rata scale has been built in that works off that cap of $250,000. Damages for non-economic loss will not be awarded if the extent of the injury is less than 15 per cent of a most extreme case.
The amendments also establish maximum amounts for the award of damages for loss of earning capacity. These damages are capped at twice average weekly earnings. The amendments also apply a threshold and a cap to damages for gratuitous attendant care services as well as for the loss of a plaintiff's capacity to provide gratuitous attendant care services. Damages will only apply if the gratuitous attendant care services are provided for at least six hours per week over a period of at least six months. These damages cannot exceed average hourly earnings for each hour the services are provided or average weekly earnings per week. Other changes incorporated into this bill limit damages for loss of superannuation entitlements and interest on damages, give courts the power to approve personal injury damages in the form of a structured settlement, and abolish exemplary or aggravated damages for certain proceedings.
Some organisations may put forward the argument—incorrectly, in my view—that reducing these payouts will create hardship. I would say to those organisations—for example, the Plaintiff Lawyers Association—that the restrictions on limitation periods and quantum introduced by the bill reflect the recommendations of the Ipp report, which have been endorsed and followed by state and territory governments. The Commonwealth, state and territory ministers agreed at the ministerial meetings on insurance issues on 4 April and 6 August 2003 that further opportunities to harmonise tort law reforms should be pursued, and this bill does just that. The Commonwealth government is of the view that the amendments introduced in this bill provide a nationally consistent position on limitation periods and the quantum of damages for the states and territories to move forward. The reality is that the Ipp review took a principled approach to the quantum of damages.
If this bill passes, I would simply highlight to the people of the Gold Coast and right across the nation that the community groups that they love—those community groups that they volunteer their time to—will be beneficiaries of the tort law reform that has taken place in the states and territories as well as the law reform that the Commonwealth government is introducing as a way to offset some of the burden that is being realised as a consequence of the forum shopping taking place. Those that engage in the patrolling of our beaches, the surf lifesaving movement and those that might be involved in the conservation of an area, such as the Southport Spit, through the Main Beach Progress Association, will all benefit as a consequence of a reduction, we would hope, over the longer term in the cost of premiums associated with personal and professional liability laws. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,2004-03-25,"—In considering the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004 it is extremely important that our starting point be a genuine awareness and understanding of the circumstances that face people who have suffered serious injuries. One of the things that often gets lost in the debate on these issues is the reality that far too many Australians suffer very serious injuries at work, in car accidents, in public places and in other circumstances that in some cases cripple them and in many cases affect them for the remainder of their lives.
There are many Australians who have suffered injuries in employment or other circumstances where it is not an exaggeration to say that their lives have been all but destroyed. Serious back injuries that lead to operations that lead to chronic pain can lead to an inability to perform a whole range of very basic human activities and functions. Many people are no longer able to work in the areas that they have traditionally been involved in; people suffer lives of continual misery, loss of opportunity and in some cases a marriage breakdown or loss of amenity of life. There are all sorts of quite often very tragic consequences for people who suffer injuries.
It is important to make the point that often in this type of debate the people who are central to the debate are overlooked. So in this debate everybody is worried about insurance premiums and everybody is worried about legal interpretations, but many tend to overlook the people that these issues concern; that is, the injured workers, injured citizens and others whose lives have been blighted by accidents that were not their fault.
The core question under this legislative proposal and some of the others that we have considered in recent times is: how should our society deal with people who suffer such injuries; how should we make provision for those people? It is essential that we remember that our primary objective has to be to ensure not only that we minimise the incidence of such injuries but also that we as a society make provision for people who suffer these injuries to live as fulfilling and worthwhile lives as possible, in spite of the fact that their lives have been changed by the injuries that they have incurred. The existing systems that we have throughout Australia do not do this; they do not achieve that objective. They could be a great deal better.
It is unfortunate that these issues only come into the public domain—only attract media attention—when there are concerns about insurance premiums. We have had thousands upon thousands of Australians who have been injured, suffered very serious loss, both economic loss and personal or social loss, yet the only time that these issues get much public attention is when insurance premiums go up and people paying the premiums complain about it. It is an indictment on our society that we all too often overlook the interests of people who have suffered serious injuries and we all too often neglect them. We all too often fail to understand that their lives have been either totally wrecked or very severely impaired and that we as a society have a responsibility to ameliorate their suffering.
The legislation before us today relates to the Trade Practices Act and the capacity of individuals to make statutory claims against those who have caused or contributed to their injuries as well as common law claims. One of the standard things that occurs in the legal process is that if there is a cause of action between a plaintiff and a defendant then those representing the plaintiff will always look for alternative means of pursuing that claim. It is quite common to plead a cause of action in the alternative where different themes, different legal foundations, are provided for a particular claim. Obviously, a person cannot be compensated twice for the same loss, so the magnitude of the outcome is generally not affected by this approach, but the capacity for the individual plaintiff to succeed is clearly affected. That is really at the heart of the legislation before the House today.
It is one thing to cap the available damages. Labor governments throughout Australia have been doing this bit by bit in recent times, restricting the capacity of individuals to succeed in common law claims arising from personal injuries. I have substantial reservations about that, but it is understandable why governments have to act to restrict those damages, to restrict the quantum of what is available to a person who successfully sues for personal injuries under common law. It is an entirely different thing to reduce the chances of that person succeeding in a common law claim by taking away an alternative basis for a statutory claim. Rather than restricting the magnitude of a financial payout, the government is proposing to diminish the ability of a plaintiff to succeed in establishing liability—to succeed in prosecuting and winning their case. That is an entirely different thing, and it is of much greater concern.
The question of capping damages payouts is a legitimate matter, a legitimate concern. Although I have some differences of view with the various state governments over some of the things that they done, I understand why they have acted in that way. In many cases a fairly respectable argument can be advanced that there is a need to impose some of the limitations that have been opposed. But it is a very different thing to take away a right of action and thereby diminish the chances of a plaintiff succeeding. That is something of a more serious magnitude, in my view.
Why are these things happening? In part, there is an understandable overreaction to the perceived crisis in insurance, which in many respects is of the insurance industry's making and largely reflects the substantial reduction in the stock market, particularly internationally, that has occurred since 2000. Insurance companies tend to make their money on investments, turnover and cash flow, so a downturn in the stock market will affect their financial position. It also reflects a period of unsustainably low premiums on many insurance products and loss-leading competition by companies like HIH and various segments of the insurance market.
We have a crisis to some degree, but in part it reflects both the normal dynamics of the insurance industry and an element of irresponsible behaviour. The tragedy is that it will be injured people, including injured workers, who will have to pay the price for these problems. They will suffer the double whammy of seeing insurance company profits return to pretty rude health in the very near future, if they have not already, at the same time as these changes are being made to restrict the magnitude of payouts.
One of the problems with the insurance approach to injuries and the individualised approach to injuries is that deep down there really is not much of an incentive for insurance companies to reduce the incidence of injuries, because that is their business. Their business is to insure against injury and death, and liability on the part of individuals whose actions contribute to or cause those injuries or death. Although the insurance industry can point to many programs and activities that they undertake and premium structures that purportedly are designed to diminish the range of injuries, in reality there is no strong driving vested interest inherent in the system pushing for a reduction in injuries, death and accidents, because ultimately, were we hypothetically to have no injuries, there would be no insurance industry covering this area and nobody would be employed or earn profits insuring against these kinds of things. In the system there are drivers for reductions to a degree, but there is not a very strong inherent driver of economic self-interest pushing for substantial reductions in injuries and accidents.
The fundamental weakness of the system is that it is based on 19th century British tort law and concepts of individual rights that emerged from the Manchester school and the Industrial Revolution and which really are antiquated and out of date in modern society. These rights entail the notion that your entitlement to compensation should be based not on need, not on the magnitude of your injuries, so much as on the circumstances in which you were injured.
Rather than the society saying to an individual, `You've suffered loss. You've suffered an injury that has affected your capacity to earn income and has affected the quality and amenity of your life. We will compensate for that in a particular way and we will judge you in the same way we would judge anybody in the same circumstances,' the society effectively says, `Tell us how the accident happened. If we can attribute blame to somebody and they are insured then you are in luck. If not, if the circumstances of the accident are different, sorry, you lose out.' That is the effect of the current system.
If you have a common law claim—if you were injured at work and you can demonstrate negligence on the part of your employer—things are not too bad. If you were injured at work but there was no negligence, you still have the workers compensation entitlements. They are not as good as common-law claims in net overall terms, but they are still significant. If you fall off your roof at home on a Sunday afternoon while you are trying to fix the tiles, all you have is the social security system. You cannot sue anybody, but you are in precisely the same position as somebody who has suffered the same injuries and who has a workers compensation entitlement or a common-law claim to pursue.
So there is an inherent inequity in the system—an inherent inability to focus on need and on our society's obligation and responsibility to individuals to ensure that they have the capacity to live full, decent lives. If they suffer injuries that are no fault of their own or where society does not impose criminal blame upon them, in some way, by some mechanism, we should compensate at least partially for that.
There have been recent instances that illustrate the downside of the common law system, but this is nothing new. I can remember being a lawyer doing common law 20 years ago. At that time I was getting settlements of $5,000, $7,000 and $10,000 for people who had suffered a bit of neck pain and headaches for a few weeks when somebody had run into the back of their car—no permanent injuries, no serious disabilities, a bit of time off work and you get them $5,000, $7,000 or $10,000. Twenty years ago that was quite a significant amount of money. That was all based on the common law system as it then was.
That opportunity has, thankfully, been removed, but still with public liability you have similar kinds of situations. The problem is that you are seeing compensation going to some where it is less important and many others missing out altogether. That is the inherent problem with a system that is based on a notion of individual rights and fault and blame. It is also important to recognise that, in the United States in particular and increasingly in our society, the capacity of an individual to sue is becoming a de facto means of regulating the behaviour of major companies. It is clearly a means of redistributing power, influence and wealth in the United States—not all of it good given the role that certain kinds of lawyers tend to play. Nonetheless it has become an important de facto regulatory mechanism to restrain the power and activities of major corporations. It is not the best way of doing that but, nonetheless, that is how it has evolved.
There are certain elements of that in Australia and I suspect that those elements are increasing. In my view it is not the best way to go about regulating large corporations and protecting the rights of individual consumers and citizens, but we should be very wary about abandoning such mechanisms that already exist without compensating for that abandonment by developing alternative mechanisms for protecting the rights of the ordinary citizen in our society. The problem with the approach the government is taking to this is that it is trying to have it both ways. It is trying to maintain an individual rights based system where substantial numbers of people miss out—where some win the lottery, where some can establish negligence, where some have got claims—but at the same time reduce the entitlements of those who are fortunate enough to have a claim to pursue. In other words, it is robbing from Peter but it is not giving to Paul.
I would be very happy to support curtailing the common law system. In fact, personally—not making a statement on behalf of the Labor Party but personally—I would abolish it. I am a strong supporter of the New Zealand national compensation scheme. I was very pleased to see the Minister for Small Business and Tourism float the proposition some time ago. Unfortunately, he scuttled away from it very quickly. But I am a strong supporter of that model. I think it is the most just, fair and appropriate way of providing compensation for all people who are injured in our country—to ensure that need is the basis for compensation, not the arbitrary serendipity of individual circumstances where, if you can establish negligence or if your job is involved, you actually have got some entitlement to compensation but, if not, you are out of luck.
We should move to a needs based system. Unfortunately, there are very powerful vested interests on both sides of the political fence that do not support this proposition and it is unlikely to become the law in the foreseeable future. I have not given up on it, though. It is something that I believe would be a very important reform for our society and it is pleasing to see that not all members on the other side are absolutely opposed to this kind of idea either. To me it is a commonsense thing that would be a fairer, more just and ultimately less costly way of dealing with injuries in our society.
The primary argument that is put against this kind of proposal is the threat of governments using direct budgetary control of this kind of system to cut back entitlements, so that when you have a statutory system there is always a fear that government budgetary constraints will lead to compensation payments being diminished, whereas when you have independent courts making decisions about these payments you will have a greater degree of sympathy for the rights of individual victims of injuries and therefore the risk of cutbacks in entitlements is lower. The legislation that we have seen from the government on these issues, and indeed from state governments, suggests that, although this argument probably once held some merit, it does not any more, because we are seeing precisely the same thing occurring via government legislation anyway with the existing system built on common law individual rights—hence my observations that the government is trying to have it both ways.
I think it is time we return to the proposition of the possibility of a national compensation scheme built on need not fault. Broadly speaking, although it has had problems from time to time, the New Zealand system has worked, and in my view that approach, with appropriate modifications—you would not adopt it identically—is right for Australia. I would like to see us pursue an interest and pursue the development of those models and that kind of approach, and ensure that we can eventually get to a point in this country where all people who suffer injuries and therefore suffer loss of income, loss of future opportunity both economic and social and loss of amenity of life can be compensated appropriately for their injuries and loss based on their need—based on the magnitude of the loss, not on whether or not they have the good fortune to be able to demonstrate negligence on the part of another party who happens to have insurance.
That is a major reform agenda that I would like to see us pursue. I suspect it is unlikely to eventuate in the near future but, nonetheless, it is an important component of this debate. What is unacceptable is to retain a system built on individual rights where some do miss out—and many miss out in very unfortunate circumstances—and at the same time chip away at the magnitude of entitlements that those individual rights lead to. There is a need for reform, but sweeping reform not piecemeal reform. I look forward to the day when our parliament will be debating that kind of sweeping reform and we will move beyond the 19th century and look at a comprehensive scheme for ensuring that our society is genuinely inclusive and that injured workers and injured people generally get decently compensated on an equal basis.",REPS,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"Prosser, Geoff, MP",LP,2004-03-25,"—I rise to support the amendments proposed in the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004. This bill amends the Trade Practices Act 1974 to ensure a nationally consistent approach in relation to the Trade Practices Act limitation periods and constraints on damages arising from personal injury or death and also ensures that the Trade Practices Act cannot be used to undermine state and territory civil liability reforms for personal injuries and death.
As the overall objective of the Trade Practices Act is to enhance the welfare of all Australians through the promotion of competition and fair trading provisions for consumer protection, reforms were undertaken by the state and territory governments to help contain the cost of liability claims in an effort to make liability insurance more available and affordable. Commonwealth, state and territory ministers agreed on a package of reforms implementing key recommendations of the review of the law of negligence at the November 2002 ministerial meeting on public liability insurance. The review of the law of negligence was established to assist governments to address the issue of increasing premiums for and reduced availability of public liability insurance. Ministers agreed that the key review recommendations that go to establish liability should be complemented on a nationally consistent basis and each jurisdiction agreed to introduce the necessary legislation as a matter of priority.
The review terms of reference noted that the award of damages for personal injuries had become unaffordable and unsustainable as the principal source of compensation for those injured through the fault of another. It was desirable to examine a method for the reform of the common law with the objective of limiting liability and quantum of damages arising from personal injury and death. The review was requested to consider a number of areas—in particular, the interaction of the Trade Practices Act with the law of negligence. The review was asked to develop and evaluate options for amendments to the act that would prevent individuals from commencing actions in reliance on the Trade Practices Act in order to recover compensation for personal injuries and death.
This bill is the second tranche of the amendments forming the Commonwealth's response to the review's recommendations in relation to reform of the act. The purpose of the bill is to ensure that a nationally consistent approach is taken so that limitation periods and constraints on damages arising from personal injury or death apply consistently across the country.
The first tranche of legislation amends the Trade Practices Act to prevent individuals, and the ACCC in a representative capacity, from bringing actions for damages for personal injuries and death resulting from contraventions of division 1 of part V, which prohibits unfair practices by corporations in trade and commerce, including misleading and deceptive conduct. This bill, in concert with the first tranche when it is passed by this parliament, will complement the Commonwealth reforms to the Trade Practices Act as recommended by the review of the law of negligence.
I am most concerned that over recent times insurance premiums have skyrocketed, which has severely disadvantaged small business and charitable groups. Unfortunately, Australia has become more litigious than ever before, with compensation and public liability claims that have contributed to the exponential rise in insurance premiums. I fully support the government's policy objectives of addressing the issue of ever-increasing premiums for, and reduced availability of, personal liability insurance. I am happy to note that commonsense has prevailed during this time, with innovative approaches to insurance cover for events, such as festivals in my electorate of late, with organisers contracting with exhibitors and performers that they exhibit or perform at their own risk, with no litigation or compensation being sought.
However, against the background of diverse state and territory responses to the implementation of review recommendations, it has been difficult to formulate an optimal approach that will achieve the full potential of the reduction in the cost for business at the same time as providing a nationally consistent response to the review recommendations. The Commonwealth has considered two possible approaches for the implementation of the review's recommendations. Option 1 is the introduction of caps and limitation periods whereby the Commonwealth could amend parts of the Trade Practices Act to introduce constraints on damages and limitation periods consistent with the review's recommendations on these matters. 
Option 2 is to link state and territory civil liability laws by the Commonwealth amending parts of the Trade Practices Act to provide that the rules relating to the quantum of damages and limitation of actions for personal injury or death be determined in accordance with relevant state and territory civil liability laws. This would involve characterising claims for personal injuries and death under the relevant provisions as actions in negligence for choice of law purposes; disapplying the existing relevant provisions setting time limits to the extent an action to which they apply seeks damages for personal injury and death; and making it clear that the law of the relevant state or territory governs matters such as quantum of damages and limitation of actions under the relevant parts of the Trade Practices Act.
This approach would ensure that these parts of the Trade Practices Act are linked to relevant state and territory civil liability reforms. Any contravention of these parts of the act that does not involve a claim for personal injuries would not be affected by these reforms. All other remedies for conduct in contravention of these parts of the act would remain. The benefits for business with this option are that it would provide clarity in the text of these parts of the Trade Practices Act in relation to quantum of damages and limitation periods by setting a benchmark at the Commonwealth level. In addition, by encouraging nationally consistent reforms, this option may result in compliance cost savings for business by reducing the divergence between various legislative regimes.
As potential exposures under these parts of the act will be certain, this option may make it easier for insurers to set premiums. However, full benefits are contingent upon states and territories enacting nationally consistent reforms. This option would constrain the ability of plaintiffs to undermine state and territory liability reforms in relation to quantum of damages and limited actions, though to a lesser extent than option 2. By constraining the ability of state and territory reforms to be undermined, this option may reduce the potential for businesses to withdraw from the provision of goods and services due to inadequate insurance cover. The benefits for the community under the second option are that it may reduce pressure on insurers to increase insurance premiums and thereby ensure that adequate insurance protection is available for consumers. This option may allow the community to take maximum advantage of state and territory civil liability reforms.
This option should remove the need for plaintiffs to assess differences in the rules relating to quantum of damages and limitations of action in different jurisdictions and should lead to a reduction of plaintiffs' legal fees. The recommendation under option 2 would provide a clear statement that matters relating to the rules for the quantum of damages and limitation of actions are matters of state and territory law. This may in some cases make it easier for insurers to set premiums.
Option 1 would provide greater certainty for insurers as to exposures under the Trade Practices Act and this may encourage insurers back into the marketplace, thereby placing downward pressure on insurance premiums. However, unlike option 2, option 1 has the additional benefit of putting pressure on the states and territories to enact nationally consistent reforms. Option 1 provides a national benchmark on these matters. Given that not all states and territories have enacted reforms, this benefit is considered to be significant. On this basis, it is considered that the potential overall benefits of option 1 exceed the benefits of option 2. Accordingly, it is recommended that the Commonwealth follow option 1 in relation to the proposed reforms in this bill.
It is therefore recommended that the Trade Practices Act 1974 be amended so that—to the extent that damages arising from personal injuries or death are sought in an action under the act relating to a contravention of the unconscionable conduct provisions, part IVA; a contravention of the product safety and information provisions, division 1A, part V: a supply by a manufacturer or importer of unsatisfactory consumer goods, division 2A, part V; or a supply by a manufacturer or importer of defective goods, Part VA—action is subject to a nationally consistent approach so that limitation periods and constraints on damages arising from personal injury or death apply consistently across the country.
At the May 2002 ministerial meeting on public liability insurance, the Commonwealth announced that the ACCC would monitor the impact of these reforms. In July 2002, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer requested the ACCC to monitor costs and premiums in the public liability and professional indemnity sectors of the insurance market on a six-monthly basis over the next two years. In particular, the ACCC was asked to give consideration to the impact on insurance premiums resulting from measures taken by governments to reduce and contain legal costs and to improve the data available for insurers to evaluate and price risk. To the extent possible, the ACCC's monitoring will inform the assessment of the impact of the changes introduced by these reforms.
I support the amendments proposed in this bill to ensure the establishment of liability on a nationally consistent basis so that the Trade Practices Act cannot be used to undermine any state and territory laws in relation to claims for damages for personal injuries or death. I champion the steps that have been taken at the state and territory level to improve the affordability and availability of insurance to all concerned. I commend the bill to the house.",REPS,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2004-03-25,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004 because it deals with a very serious issue—namely, the right of those who have suffered injury or death to gain help, redress and/or compensation. Despite what the member for Moncrieff would have us believe, this bill will not solve the public liability crisis currently facing this country. 
At its core, this bill introduces limitation periods and other constraints upon the payment of damages that can be awarded under the Trade Practices Act as it currently stands. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer informed the House in his second reading speech on 19 February 2004:
This approach can be distinguished from that taken in the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003 of last year, which prevents claims for damages for personal injuries or death under part V division 1 of the Trade Practices Act 1974.
This bill will amend the Trade Practices Act to provide that the rules relating to limitation of actions for damages claims and the quantum of damages that are awarded are both reduced. This bill had its genesis in a 2002 review of the law of negligence in Australia, undertaken by a committee chaired by Justice David Ipp. The final report of that committee was presented in September 2002. Unfortunately, the so-called Ipp report could be said to have had a predetermined result if ever there was one. Justice Ipp and his committee were forced to work with terms of reference that can only be described as narrow. For instance, they were asked to develop and evaluate:
... options for amendments to the Trade Practices Act to prevent individuals commencing actions in reliance on the Trade Practices Act, including actions for misleading and deceptive conduct, to recover compensation for personal injury and death. 
As a consequence of these limiting terms of reference and the content of the final report, on 20 September 2002 the Australian Plaintiff Lawyers Association was moved to issue a press release arguing that the Ipp report was tainted from the outset. In a press release headlined `Ipp Report a waste of taxpayers money', it stated that the Ipp report's recommendations will be `forever discredited'. It said:
It is not surprising to some that the Ipp Committee watered down the test for professional negligence to a point where the patients who suffered injury from the now discredited deep sleep therapy at Chelmsford would be hard-pressed obtaining a verdict under the Ipp recommendations.
What a disgraceful outcome. The concerns of the Australian Plaintiff Lawyers Association did not apparently bother the government, though. The evidence is in the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill now before us.
The Trade Practices Act in its current form allows defendants to claim damages from corporations and other business entities involved in trade. These damages can be claimed for loss, including personal injury or death, flowing from, firstly, unconscionable conduct, under part IVA; secondly, a contravention of the product safety and information provisions, under division 1A of part V; thirdly, a supply by a manufacturer or importer of unsatisfactory consumer goods, under division 2A of part V; or, fourthly, a supply by a manufacturer or importer of defective goods, under part VA.
In opposition to these sections stands the bill before us today. The bill is aimed at making it harder for plaintiffs—or injured people, as they are in all respects the same thing—to successfully sue corporations when those very same corporations cause injury or death. Is that fair? Is that just? I think not. Then, to add insult to injury, this bill provides that, when these injured people are successful in the courts, the payments that these corporations must pay to these injured people will be reduced.
This bill is clearly designed not only to reduce the opportunity for individuals to succeed in the courts but also to reduce the payments that they are able to obtain if they are successful. As a consequence, this bill makes it easier to for corporations to avoid liability and, if liability is established, it allows them to reduce the cost of meeting that liability. That is a very significant outcome of the legislation before us.
Tort law reform has been championed by the state government in New South Wales and elsewhere throughout the Commonwealth. This bill marks one of the federal government's contributions to such reform. But in my view the way tort law reform has been interpreted and applied by this government is a classic example of blaming the victim, with an equal measure of sheltering the perpetrator thrown in for good measure. That is why I oppose this bill.
I am the first to recognise that increasing public liability insurance premiums are causing hardship for many small businesses and community organisations throughout my electorate of Cunningham and beyond. For example, my local Sandon Point Surf Club, as a member of the New South Wales Surf Lifesaving Association, was recently faced with a $1.5 million increase in public liability insurance premiums across the state for 2004. This is an extremely large figure for what is basically a voluntary association. Likewise, local events such as community fairs are really under threat at the moment because of this public liability crisis. I could go on.
That said, the solution to this problem cannot be to simply reduce the rights of injured people, who deserve and need to be taken care of and/or compensated, especially when the injury is caused by a company that can afford to compensate an injured person and when that very same company engages in unconscionable conduct, contravenes its own product safety information, sells or supplies unsatisfactory consumer goods, or sells or supplies plainly defective goods. Alternatives to this all-or-nothing approach are required, and this is what the government should be putting its mind to, not to diminishing the rights of Australian citizens.
To continue along the path laid down by this bill has the effect of the government saying that injured people do not matter. This bill erodes consumer protection laws that were established way back in 1932 in the infamous case of Donohue and Stephenson—the case of the snail in the ginger beer bottle. The passage of this bill will send a message to the public that they should receive less compensation, if any at all, for every snail they choke on and get sick on that they find in a ginger beer bottle they may have the misfortune to buy. These sorts of things still happen. I remember a couple of years ago my sister was chewing on a meat pie one day and hit something crunchy. When she opened the top cover of the pastry, a cooked rat's head was revealed in amongst the meat. So these things do still happen, and we need to have in place mechanisms against such occurrences and protections for members of the Australian community.
This bill is not such a mechanism. This bill is a green light to tobacco companies to pretend that cigarettes do not cause cancer and are not harmful to one's health—for we must remember that it has only been as a result of expensive law suits and large punitive damage awards in recent years that those companies have become more open and honest about the real health effects of smoking. This bill is a green light to food distributors who sell polluted wares or goods that do not meet acceptable health standards. It is a green light to car manufacturers who sell cars that do not handle safely.
Who can forget the tragic case involving American car manufacturer Ford and its Pinto sedan back in 1972? I think that case is very relevant to this debate. The company was aware that the petrol tank on the car was subject to explosion in the event of a rear end collision and could result in the death of the occupants. Ford calculated that it would cost $137 million, or $11 per car, to fix the design fault. It also calculated that the new design would result in 180 fewer deaths. Ford then put a price of $49.5 million on the possible death, injuries and car damages that would result if it did not fix up the problem. The value of a life at the time was apparently set at $200,000. As a result of these calculations, termed a risk-benefits analysis, Ford decided not to fix up the problem and to save a possible $87.5 million. It was a commercial decision.
This was nothing less than unconscionable conduct—the type of conduct which is at present covered by the Trade Practices Act and the type of conduct which the people of Australia must be protected against. Ford's commercial decision with regard to the inherent safety of the Pinto was to have tragic consequences. In May 1972 Lily Gray and 13-year-old Richard Grimshaw were travelling in a new 1972 Pinto when they were involved in a collision. The impact ignited a fire in the car which killed Lily Gray and left young Richard Grimshaw with devastating injuries. A judgment was rendered against Ford, and the jury awarded the Gray family $560,000 and Richard Grimshaw $2.5 million in compensatory damages. The jury then awarded $125 million in punitive damages—and rightly so.
This bill also gives a green light for pharmaceutical companies to dispense drugs which could have adverse health impacts and perhaps ruin people's lives—all because this bill reduces liability in circumstances where these corporations behave below the standard expected of them by the courts and by the community. This bill is aimed fair and square at letting dodgy manufacturers off the hook, and the community will suffer as a result. Frankly, this just is not good enough. Australians deserve effective consumer protection laws, and a component of such laws is effective remedies.
On Tuesday of this week the member for Calare raised the issue of carcinogenic nitrofurans being introduced into Australian honey. This is illegal and should not be happening. But it is happening, and measures must be put in place, and enforced, to make sure it is stopped. There are also increasing concerns over contamination associated with GM food crops and a slackening of our quarantine regime as a result of the recently signed US free trade agreement. Other measures are also causing concern in the community about long-term health impacts. We need to remain vigilant. We need strong laws to protect Australians and to encourage corporations not to do the wrong thing in the first place. The Trade Practices Act as it currently stands offers such protection, but there is no doubt that the proposed amendments contained within this bill will reduce the level of protection available to Australian consumers.
Let us look at the more specific effects of this bill, should it become law. This bill, in introducing a date of discoverability, provides that a court cannot award a damages claim more than three years after a plaintiff was aware, or ought to have known, of his or her injury. This is problematic from the outset. One negative outcome which the government would not welcome is that this aspect of the bill may lead to an increase in litigation and a corresponding reduction in the impetus for injured people to settle out of court. As a result of this amendment, injured people will be forced to lodge claims in the courts in order to avoid the limitation barring their action in the future as a result of the three-year cut-off point. Additionally, these new provisions provide for the concept of `constructive knowledge' to be imported into an injured person's rights. In other words, a person ought to discover that they are injured by taking all reasonable steps to find out. But when ought one to know? If I have my arm chopped off whilst working in a coalmine because the roof caves in, then I know straightaway that I have lost my arm. I may not know immediately if there is any negligence involved, but I do know that the injury has occurred. But what if I have eaten honey laced with carcinogenic nitrofurans and I do not know that I have been injured? This is a legal minefield. Oddly, this provision will place the burden on injured people to make sure that they are not injured. How will they do that? They will have to get expensive medical tests that will have to be paid for by Medicare, from the individual's wages or assets or, worse, from their miserly disability payments. This seems to make it unnecessarily difficult for injured people to claim damages in a practical sense.
That is not all. In addition to failing to provide a useful public policy outcome, this bill seeks to limit personal injury awards from corporations which can afford to pay for insurance. In effect, this bill limits the amount of damages claims that injured people can receive for non-economic loss to a maximum of $250,000—money that could be used to pay for the costs of medical expenses, rehabilitation and the renovation of property for a wheelchair ramp, for example. It also prohibits the award of damages for non-economic loss where the loss the plaintiff suffers is less than 15 per cent of the most extreme case. The bill also reduces the circumstances where damages awards will be made for gratuitous attendant care, or the plaintiff's ability to provide gratuitous attendant care, and superannuation contributions.
At the end of the bill it seeks to abolish exemplary and aggravated damages payouts. Exemplary and aggravated damages have a very useful public policy purpose, as we saw with the Ford Pinto case. The aim of these damages is to provide a disincentive for corporations and others with deep pockets from engaging in reprehensible conduct. In 2001 an Alaskan court decided that Exxon Mobil Corporation should pay punitive damages of $5 billion for the Exxon Valdez oil tanker disaster of 1989, which damaged some 2,000 kilometres of Alaskan coastline and surrounding marine environment. The company reckoned they should pay only $40 million. I quote a 2002 comment of the Australian Consumers Association about the removal of exemplary and punitive damages in New South Wales personal liability law. It said:
ACA is very concerned about the potential impact of this provision. The award of these sorts of damages is rare in Australia, in the case of gross negligence, recklessness, criminal disregard for the safety of others or other appalling conduct. These damages uphold community standards of care, and reflect the outrage with which such conduct is generally greeted. CHOICE magazine regularly conducts safety tests of various products, and it is the availability of these sanctions which have driven improvements in safety standards over recent decades. In the same way, prominent community debates over the care of our most vulnerable—children and the sick, require the retention of these sanctions, to be used in the extreme cases to punish such practice, and reinforce our community's commitment to promoting the highest standards of care.
Most insurance policies do not provide cover for punitive or exemplary damages, so the implementation of this provision will have little impact on insurers' costs.
I can see no reason to differ from this point of view in the federal sphere. That alone is reason to oppose this bill. Frankly, this parliament should be addressing the issue of a no-fault scheme to deal with these matters. Such a scheme has the potential to be cheaper and fairer and, most importantly, to provide for the care of our injured citizens regardless of fault. The current system of adversarial litigation is, by its very nature, `winner takes all' and one where the loser can get stuck with a debilitating injury and massive legal costs. It is just not good enough. We cannot have the sick and wheelchair-bound in our society left out on the street, relying on charity to survive, especially if their condition is the result of negligence.
As a civilised, technically advanced and wealthy society, we in Australia have the capacity to look after all our citizens who have been injured, regardless of fault—yes, everyone, even the unfortunate people who jump off hotel balconies and those under the influence of alcohol or drugs who may happen to do damage to themselves. It is not how the injury happened that is important; it is society's response to it that is of concern to the Australian Greens.
Even though we have the capacity to do better we do not. Why? Because we lack the political will. That is why a no-fault scheme deserves investigation and why this bill must be opposed.  Accordingly, at the end of this debate I will be moving a motion circulated in my name that requires the establishment of a select committee to consider the merits of a no-fault scheme. I call on the government to support this amendment for the benefit of the injured, their families and all of the small businesses and community groups reeling under the weight of public liability insurance premiums. This is an issue of major concern to ordinary Australians which the government should be addressing, instead of the miserly, miserable bill currently before us, which reduces the level of protection available to Australian consumers. I therefore cannot support this bill.",REPS,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"Smith, Anthony, MP",LP,2004-03-25,"—As previous speakers on this side of the House have indicated, the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004 forms part of a package of critical reforms to the Trade Practices Act to address the crisis in public liability insurance.
Listening to the previous speaker, the member for Cunningham, you would think that the federal government on its own had dreamt up these changes, that somehow we had decided without any consultation that these changes to the Trade Practices Act were necessary. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. These changes come as a result of extensive consultation with all of the states. The states themselves—and I will come back to this through the body of my speech—after confronting the crisis in insurance have amended and changed their own state laws, which of course cover the bulk of the legislation in this area, and after extensive consultation have agreed to the changes that we are making. To have the federal and state governments agreeing is something that does not happen every day.
For the previous speaker to oppose this legislation for opposition's sake—to get some cheap publicity or to try to differentiate himself—is a sad commentary. Whilst he has extensively researched and adequately diagnosed the problem, at the end of the day, his solution is to do nothing. That is not what community groups throughout Australia want. That is not what the battling small businesses of Australia want. That is not what the Australian people want. They know that insurance premiums are too high and they instinctively know that some of the Tattslotto style payouts have been ridiculous, and they look to their levels of government to do something about it. That is why the state governments have acted and that is why we are acting to hold up our end of the bargain and to make change where we can.
As the member for Moncrieff and some others on this side of the House indicated earlier, the changes in this bill and, just as importantly—in many ways more importantly—in the previous bill in this same package seek to jointly implement the very reforms I just spoke of that have been developed by the federal government in close cooperation and conjunction with the state and territory governments right around Australia.
In recent years, the insurance story—the blow-out in premiums and some of the crazy results—have received extensive media coverage. We have all seen the headlines. The headlines really do tell the story: `Insurance no laugh for comedy festival'; `Grab for compo: Council coughs up for city spills'; `Fire refuges closed'—fire refuges closed in areas like my electorate, which covers the Dandenongs, the most fire-prone area in Australia, because of this insurance crisis; `Decking the town hall proves risky'—community groups that cannot even deck their town hall; and `Liability puts an end to swim classes'. The reasons for this justifiable media interest indicate the importance of public liability insurance in its various forms for our community.
Community groups and small and medium sized business right across Australia have borne the brunt of huge premium increases in recent years. Recently the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, Joe Hockey, cited a number of examples—two of them quite telling—that I will use just to remind the House. One was a premium increase for a small battling adventure tourism company in regional Western Australia. The premium went up from $940 in 2002 to $1,380—a rise of $440. That is a typical sort of rise where the company itself will have done nothing different in its year of operation than in previous years yet is hit with a massively escalating premium. Another example is that of a $5,200 premium increase for an engineering business. The premium went from $800 last year to $6,000 this year.
Even though the bulk of the relevant law is in the state and territory domain, as I indicated earlier, the federal government, through the active involvement of Senator Coonan, the Assistant Treasurer, has sought to work cooperatively to resolve this problem. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has been tasked to monitor premiums and insurance payouts. A recent report found that the average size of personal injury and death claims settled increased quite markedly. The statistics on this issue really do tell the story. There was an increase from just over $17,000 in 1997 to more than $35,000 in 2002—an increase of 102 per cent. The report noted that there was a marginal decrease in 2001 and a reduction to $30,000 in the first six months of 2003. Between 1999 and 2002 average public liability premiums increased greatly—10 per cent in 2000, 19 per cent in 2001 and 44 per cent in 2002. For the first six months of 2003, the average premium increased by four per cent. In dollar terms, premiums were stable at around $600 between 1997 and 1999. The ACCC found the average premium to be just over $1,100 in 2002 and about the same in 2003.
A Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry, VECCI, survey in 2003 found that public liability insurance premiums had significantly affected all sectors of the Victorian economy. The survey found that the average premium increase on 2002 was 60 per cent. Eighty-nine per cent of respondents reported that they have experienced an increase between 2002 and 2004. The increase in premium amounts was sizeable—more than $4,500 for the average small business. That is a small business with between one and 20 employees. The survey concluded that 49 per cent of respondents considered the increases as being a `major concern' to the viability of their businesses and 11 per cent considered the issue `critical' to their continued survival.
Against these developments, as I indicated at the outset of this speech, it is incumbent on all levels of government to act—and that is precisely what this bill and the other bills in this package seek to do. Our community, as I indicated, has a right to expect that government should act: it should expect and demand no less. This bill, together with the earlier bills, seeks to complement the state and territory reforms to the law of negligence and seeks to make liability insurance more affordable and available. With the states and territories, the Commonwealth has sought to address these concerns and ensure that there is a degree of balance to the laws that compensate people for death and injury.
A panel of experts chaired by Justice David Ipp brought down a series of recommendations, and this bill implements some of them. The Ipp review concluded that the federal Trade Practices Act needed to be included in any proposed changes to state and territory laws—and that makes sense. The Ipp review determined that reforms must apply equally around Australia—that is, in each of the states and territories as well as at the federal level. The bill seeks to introduce the sorts of changes that have already been legislated, in the main, by many of our state jurisdictions.
Australia's new negligence laws would be undermined if lawyers and their clients were allowed to forum shop between state jurisdictions or between state and federal jurisdictions. This potential loophole would only introduce new difficulties and prevent the problem from being solved. For that reason, the government is acting to fix the loophole in this bill and, to an equal or perhaps larger extent, in the earlier bill that has passed through this House. Of course, the Trade Practices Act allows a person to claim damages for loss, including personal injury or death, following from unconscionable conduct or contravention of the act's product safety provisions or for the supply, by a manufacturer or importer, of unsatisfactory or defective consumer goods.
Once this amending legislation is passed, the Trade Practices Act will include, in specified sections, limitations on time periods for actions arising from personal injury and death and limitations on the quantum of damages that may be awarded. Such claims will have to be made within three years of the date of discoverability and no more than 12 years after the event. As Australians would rightly expect, special concessions will apply where children or adults are incapacitated or involved. The court will also have discretion to extend limitation periods in inappropriate cases. The maximum amount of damages for non-economic loss will be set at $250,000 and will be indexed to the CPI. For less serious injuries, proportional damage limits will apply.
These and other amendments will harmonise Australia's negligence laws, as I have said. A nationally consistent approach will reduce the number and cost of smaller claims and reduce the uncertainty associated with the outcome of actions. It is important to note that these new rules do not reduce the deterrence against undesirable conduct. Protection under the TPA remains—only the rules relating to the limitation of actions and the quantum of damages are being changed. Australians would see that as a sensible, pragmatic and appropriate response to try to fix this problem that has arisen. The Ipp review included an actuarial assessment of the economic impact of the national reforms—that is, the benefits that can be derived, to the best that they can be calculated, from moving down this path in cooperation with the states. It was determined that the initial reduction in public liability insurance premiums could be in the order of 13.5 per cent with, of course, more savings flowing in the future years as the laws settle in and the new regime takes place.
I hope that Labor members and senators are able to support these amendments and this bill. They should do so, as their counterparts in the states and territories have done. The business and community groups across all of our electorates—including mine in the outer east of Melbourne and the Yarra Valley—expect the parliament as a whole to pass these laws so that there can be some relief and some light at the end of the tunnel. The amendments in this bill, like other related changes to the Trade Practices Act, are needed and they are needed now. Up until now, that has been recognised everywhere, except by some people on the other side. The Financial Review, in a very good editorial on 10 March—and a good editorial does not happen every day in the Financial Review—exhorted federal Labor to take a responsible stance. It highlighted the comments of the Labor Treasurer in New South Wales, Michael Egan, urging Labor senators to back the insurance reforms in the previous bill and in this bill. It said that unprincipled obstruction would cost the business community. The editorial said:
But the rest of the country couldn't care less about the politics; it just wants a solution and Labor is holding it up.
Whilst, unfortunately, that is sometimes an opposition's natural instinct on so many matters, on this matter of community concern, where the community is crying out for sensible, pragmatic solutions to a very real problem that affects business, community groups and everyone in their daily lives, I urge those opposite, for the good of the country, to overcome that natural instinct and support this bill and the other bills that form part of this package of changes to the Trade Practices Act. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2004-03-25,"—I rise to speak very briefly on the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004. It is great to see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer here to listen to my pearls of wisdom. Labor believes that victims of negligence due to another party's culpability should be adequately compensated and that public liability insurance is one of the best ways to ensure that compensation is available. For the last few years the rising cost of public liability insurance has been of great community concern as some community groups and businesses have had difficulty in obtaining insurance for a fair price. In response to those concerns all states and territories have introduced tort law reforms, including caps on general damages, thresholds to prevent the commencement of actions in relation to minor injuries and measures to allow the voluntary assumption of risk. 
While responsibility for tort law reform rests predominantly with the states and territories, Labor has stressed the importance of Commonwealth action to support the process—particularly in ensuring that the intended savings to insurance companies are reflected in lower prices for consumers. I will discuss this issue in more depth later in this speech. This bill is intended to address a concern that the state and territory reforms will be undermined by plaintiffs forum shopping—that is, by attempting to evade restrictions imposed under state and territory tort reforms through bringing actions under the Trade Practices Act. There is at present little evidence that the Trade Practices Act is being extensively used as the basis for personal injury claims. Despite this, Labor has agreed to support the bill before us today. 
This bill is the second bill introduced by the government to implement the Ipp report's recommendations regarding amendments to the Trade Practices Act. Specifically, this bill implements recommendations 17 and 21 of the Ipp report. Recommendation 17 of the Ipp report reads:
The TPA should be amended to provide that the rules relating to limitation of actions and quantum of damages recommended in this Report ... apply to any claim for negligently-caused personal injury or death brought under Part IVA in the form of an unconscionable conduct claim.
Recommendation 21 of the Ipp report reads:
The TPA should be amended to provide that the rules relating to limitation of actions ... and ... quantum of damages ... recommended in the ... report ... apply to any claim for negligently-caused personal injury or death brought under Part V Div 1A, Part V Div 2A or Part VA ...
Currently, the Trade Practices Act does not contain provisions that limit the size of damages payouts, nor are there instructions for calculating how damages should be assessed.
In relation to general damages the Ipp report recommended that a cap of $250,000 should be placed on general damages. With respect to damages for loss of earning capacity, the Ipp panel recommended that a cap be placed on damages for loss of earning capacity of twice average full-time adult ordinary time earnings. Labor supports the damages regime proposed by this bill. However, reforms to the Trade Practices Act to improve the affordability and availability of insurance can only be of real benefit if the savings to insurers as a result of these reforms are passed to consumers. There is real concern that the savings brought about through recent tort law reforms are not being passed on to consumers in the form of lower premiums. Labor believes that there needs to be improved monitoring of insurance premiums, and powers to force the insurers to pass on savings may also be required. The government has, to date, not acted on these concerns. 
In February this year the second ACCC monitoring report on public liability insurance showed that insurers will reap substantial windfalls from the state and territory tort law reforms. Despite claims costs for personal injury and death falling by 14 per cent in the first six months of 2003, as the state tort reforms began to take effect, public liability premiums rose by four per cent. In addition, public liability premiums are expected to rise this year—by up to 15 per cent in some cases. This poses an interesting question: if claims costs are going backwards, how come premiums continue to rise?
On two occasions—firstly, in 2002, by my colleague the member for Fraser; and, secondly, in August last year, by me—Labor introduced legislation that would have granted the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission the power needed to protect consumers and ensure that savings were passed on. These powers would have allowed the ACCC to take action against insurance companies that exploited the savings from the law reforms and did not charge premiums for public liability insurance which reflect the impact of the law reform. On both occasions the government refused to support this legislation which would have helped to ensure that consumers received the savings that tort law reforms should have provided.
While Labor support the Bill that is before us today, we once again call on the government to support Labor's call for the ACCC to be empowered so that the benefits of reform are passed on to consumers. That is the sort of reform we need to make sure that this reform actually works in the way it was intended.",REPS,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2004-03-25,"—I want to make some brief comments on the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004, which flows from recommendations in the report of the Ipp committee, of which the outgoing Mayor of Bathurst, Ian Macintosh, was a distinguished member. The task of that committee, in the wake of the HIH debacle and the collapse of affordable insurance, was a very difficult one and, by and large, I support the recommendations that they made and the amendments included in this legislation, but I have some reservations that I will detail.
The earlier bill, which was introduced last year—the 2003 bill—was designed to address recommendations 19 and 20 of the Ipp report. That bill proposed that the Trade Practices Act should be changed to prevent a person from recovering damage for personal injury or death where part V division 1 of the act has been contravened. The aim of that bill is that such damages be pursued only within the parameters of state tort law reform, and it certainly made clear that the Trade Practices Act is to be an area of law quite separate from ordinary laws of negligence. 
The opposition did not divide on that bill in this place, from memory, yet both the Labor Party and the Democrats now contend that the earlier bill denies the right of a person to recover damages for personal injury and death where part V division 1 of the Trade Practices Act has been breached. As I understand it, both parties are arguing for a cap to be placed on damages recovered under part V division 1 of the Trade Practices Act, but a court may still issue an injunction or make punitive or non-punitive orders where the provisions of the act have been breached and this leads to personal injury or death. The ACCC may still represent individuals to recover damages for economic loss. For those reasons I supported the earlier bill but, as I said then and maintain now, my strong reservation is that an adversarial faults system, the bounty it provides for lawyers and the wastage that is inherent in a lump sum payout still stand out as massive weaknesses in the path we are treading.
While I am prepared to accept the thrust of the Ipp report and the amendments reflecting these recommendations in this bill in the interests of reining in exorbitant claims and payouts and making insurance affordable, I continue to have problems with assertions in the Ipp report and in commentary from the government and industry that obscene rises in insurance premiums can be fixed through changes in federal and state laws—especially changes of the sort that we have been debating in this place in recent months and today. While the reforms in this bill are supposedly aimed at containing the cost of litigation while maintaining a just access to damages, we do run the risk of protecting major corporations from justifiable damages claims, as the member for Cunningham alluded to in his speech. But there has to be a balance between just outcomes and unjust claims.
The government refuses to countenance a no-fault scheme similar to New Zealand's, and until we do embrace such a scheme we are attacking this problem from the wrong direction. For instance, we are placing a cap on damages for non-economic loss at $250,000, which begs the question of how such a figure is fair under all circumstances. On the other hand, the cap on loss of earning capacity to twice average full-time adult ordinary time earnings seems quite reasonable, although no doubt there are some who would argue their earning capacity was seriously reduced by far more than that ceiling. But one also has to consider contributory negligence. Again, the New Zealand scheme appears to offer formulas that account for all such contingencies far better than these provisions and this approach do.
I see, again, references in this debate to the circumstances of the young man who dived off the fence of a property into the Coolangatta waters and the young man who, with a belly full of grog, dived into the surf at Bondi and sustained terrible injuries. It is no good blaming the victim in all circumstances, because someone has to care for that person no matter what the circumstances of the injury. It seems to me that we need a process in place that takes account of the care, perhaps long term, and living circumstances of the victim. But the massive lump sum payments we have seen based on actuarial assessments of the person's loss of earning capacity and potential life expectancy seem to pluck figures out of the air that really bear little resemblance to the cost of the person's longterm care. I will point out an example of that in a moment. The provisions in this bill surrounding personal injury and gratuitous care services therefore do seem reasonable, given the deficiencies of this approach to solving the problem, as do the limitation periods.
In reluctantly supporting the bill—it is a case of being grateful for small mercies—I draw the House's attention to a motion I placed on the Notice Paper in June 2002. It has long since lapsed, but it is interesting to restate it. It said:
That this House:
(1) recognises that there is no Constitutional impediment to Commonwealth regulation of insurance claims procedures and the magnitude of insurance claims;
(2) recognises that the Commonwealth has the power to prescribe conditions upon which any person may carry out insurance business of any kind and establish any mechanisms for the supervision of such person and corporations and to regulate their affairs, under section 51(xiv) of the Constitution;
(3) recognises that the Commonwealth uses this power to regulate the Insurance Act 1973; the Life Insurance Act 1995 and the Insurance Contracts Act 1984;
(4) calls on the Commonwealth to order an inquiry by the Australian Law Reform Commission into the feasibility of a Commonwealth legislative scheme for the insurance industry ... 
That call remains valid despite the Ipp inquiry and any legislative changes made to date at either a state or a Commonwealth level. Indeed, I contend that the impasse over bill No. 1—the 2003 bill of this federal process—only underlines the need for another approach. I said at the time of the HIH disaster and the associated crisis that has affected so many community groups in my electorate, and indeed in all electorates, that the Commonwealth needed to take a lead, not leave it to the states, and that a no-fault scheme similar to New Zealand's needed to be introduced, where everyone pays a premium through a variety of processes and lifelong stage payments, and costs of care and rehabilitation are provided.
I have mentioned several times in this place the case of a young lady in my electorate who was totally disabled after a car accident. The case is still the subject of debate and argument, even though the young victim quite tragically passed away a few weeks ago. The result of that accident was a $16 million payout, with Evans Shire Council still waiting for the state and federal governments to cough up their share of the agreed payments to local government caught out by the HIH coverage default. I was pleased to hear yesterday from the office of the Assistant Treasurer that the federal government has finally signed off on the agreement between the state and federal governments on the payout that will go to Evans council and, I think, a council in the electorate of my colleague the member for New England, which was not under the HIH umbrella but which was still left high and dry in terms of coverage after a significant payout. After much politics which I believe had more to do with the amalgamation agenda of the state government than it had to do with any reasonable, fair and timely payout to the affected council, it seems at last as though this memorandum of understanding is on the desk of the Treasurer of New South Wales, Mr Egan. I urge him to facilitate that payment to Evans council, notwithstanding the agenda of the state government to wipe Evans Shire Council off the face of the earth with a forced amalgamation with Bathurst City Council. But that is another matter.
As with so many monumental payouts, in this case the victim is now deceased and that money will no longer be available for the purpose for which it was intended: the lifelong care of the victim. How much more sensible would it be for staged monthly payments to be made for the term of the victim's life—based on a fair formula taking into account the cost of care; the loss of earnings; a no-fault scheme covering accidents of all kinds, including medical; and allowing always for criminal negligence to be pursued where the evidence is overwhelming. A no-fault scheme similar to New Zealand's has much support in the general community, especially from medical practitioners that I have spoken with; but it obviously does not enjoy support from the legal and insurance fraternities, whose interest this government seems so much more eager to represent.
If the government argues that the New Zealand scheme has a significant unfunded liability—which, by the way, is now far less than it was while it was briefly tendered out to the marketplace and out of government control—one might ask what the unfunded liability of Medicare is and why ordinary policyholders should pay premiums that reflect the massive payouts that are made, such as were made in the case I have documented, with most of the money being wasted and never used for the purposes for which it was intended. Perhaps a process of insurance industry premiums could be legislated for—if, indeed, that is necessary—to contribute to the rehabilitation and respite care processes that are so desperately needed in this community as an ancillary and complementary factor in the costs of injury and disability. Injury and disability impacts not only on the victim but also on the family and on the very community, largely because of the facilities that have to be made available, often by local government and charity groups and by dint of voluntary contribution, for the welfare of that person.
How much more sensible would it be if we were to treat insurance as an area that should be under the legislative control of our national government to ensure the maximum application of the insurance dollar, the premium dollar and the payout dollar for the benefit of the victim and the community—the small community in many cases—that surrounds that victim to offer support? That is where we should achieve maximum outcomes, not in the pockets of the legal profession or the insurance profession. As I think the previous speaker, the member for Bruce, pointed out, there is a lack of correlation between the premiums charged and the increase in the payouts. Having said that and having urged the government and this parliament to revisit the whole issue of the insurance industry—the market, the most affordable premiums and the way in which we achieve the sorts of outcomes that I have detailed—I will take great pleasure in seconding the motion of my colleague the member for Cunningham, who I understand will be detailing that motion after we have dealt with the second reading vote.",REPS,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2004-03-25,"—This is possibly one of the most important issues confronting many of our communities but particularly our country communities. I had my office send down a list of recent inquiries in relation to the insurance issue. I know that this particular bill, the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004, is only about the Trade Practices Act, but the insurance issue generally is one of concern to very many people. I have two pages of names of various people in my electorate who just in recent months have written to my office. I have written subsequently to the appropriate minister in relation to those concerns, and I am pleased to see that the government has reacted with this particular piece of legislation. 
I will go through a few of the issues that have been raised—and I will not go through each issue but will just give some idea of the extent of the problem. One constituent runs a wilderness retreat and another runs a hunting and target club and there are tennis clubs, painting clubs, motorcycle sports clubs, a Catholic women's league, churches, accommodation services and a whole range of ecotourism providers that are very concerned about the financial impacts of this insurance issue on their businesses and its potential to actually ruin them. Unfortunately, a couple of years ago we did see some rather massive increases in premiums which did erode the profitability of some ecotourism businesses, particularly those that had horse events and those sorts of things. In one particular instance in my electorate one business failed, which was unfortunate. 
The legislation that we are dealing with is part of a much broader package which also embraces state tort law reform. As the member for Calare mentioned a moment ago, there has been much debate over the last few years on where we are going with public liability insurance. Workers compensation insurance and medical indemnity insurance are other issues that obviously come to mind, and the government is moving in some way to try and cap some of the claims in those areas as well.
Key features of this particular piece of legislation are that general damages will be capped at $250,000; the threshold will be 15 per cent of a most extreme case—which is similar to that in New South Wales—with a deductible operating to 33 per cent of a most extreme case. Damages for gratuitous services will be limited on a similar basis to that of the state of New South Wales. Damages for future economic loss will be capped at two times average weekly earnings and a discount rate of five per cent will apply. Other key features within the legislation are that structured settlements will be permitted and the limitation period will be three years from the date of discoverability. A briefing note of the Insurance Council of Australia says:
The new provisions will apply to claims for personal injury and death under the following parts of the TPA:
	unconscionable conduct (Part IVA)
	product safety and information provisions (Division 1A of Part V)
	supply by a manufacturer or importer of unsatisfactory consumer goods (Division 2A of Part V)
	supply by a manufacturer or importer of defective goods (Part VA).
There has been much comment over the last few years on what role the Commonwealth could or should play in the insurance dilemma facing the country. There was some debate as to the constitutionality of the Commonwealth's position in relation to insurance generally. I cannot remember the specific provision within the Constitution—
—Section 51(xiv).
—It is section 51(xiv), I am told by the honourable member for Calare, who has a photographic memory for most acts that have gone before the parliament in the last century and is a worthy source of advice to many members of parliament, I gather, from the number of people coming in and out of his door! I thank him for that. With regard to current and future insurance issues, the Commonwealth does have the power to operate within the Constitution.
There is an argument put from time to time that most of the problems with the insurance industry are state based and should be rectified at a state level. I am not raising that to blame anybody, but I do not think this issue is going to go away—and I do congratulate the government on making a whole range of adjustments not only to the Trade Practices Act but also to the medical indemnity arrangements. But I think the overall issue of insurance and the cost of premiums is one that will plague us into the future, and maybe the Commonwealth has to look at embracing some of the schemes that have been mentioned today.
I know the member for Cunningham is going to be moving a motion in a moment which I unfortunately will not be able to agree with because part of the motion, as I understand it, is that this piece of legislation we are debating today be referred to a select committee and I would not be supportive of that. I think the current legislation has to be passed. I think there are a number of people in the community waiting for it to be passed. Having said that, I agree wholeheartedly with the content of the member for Cunningham's motion, particularly the part—I hope he does not mind if I mention this; the member for Calare did the same thing a moment ago—that calls for a comprehensive national no-fault scheme to be examined. I think that is an issue that this parliament, perhaps through the process of a select committee, should be looking at in terms of the future of this issue, and I think it does relate to the constitutionality of what the Commonwealth can and cannot do on the insurance issue.
In short, I support the legislation before us today. I think it is a step forward. I would urge the opposition and the crossbenchers in the Senate to have a very close look at the other trade practices legislation that is before the Senate at the moment. It is pointless to embark on a campaign with all the states to get them to put in place a whole range of tort law reform processes and then have those overruled by Senate changes to the Trade Practices Act. Essentially, some of the tort law reforms would be negated if the other bill on trade practices before the Senate were not given the nod.",REPS,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"Cameron, Ross, MP",LP,2004-03-25,"—in reply—It is my pleasure to sum up the debate on the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004 and to thank members for their contributions. We are in a fortunate position in that I understand the second reading will pass on the voices because of the support of the Australian Labor Party and the Independents.
This bill is part of the national framework to support the state and territory laws of negligence reforms and was developed as a result of extensive consultation with the Australian state and territory governments. The reforms are supported by each of those jurisdictions and have been applauded by industry and stakeholders, both here and overseas. We should not forget that reforms undertaken to implement this framework have already begun to make liability insurance more affordable and more widely available to community groups and businesses throughout Australia.
Australia was facing a liability insurance market where the cost of cover was rising at the same time that policies were becoming harder and harder to obtain. Some community groups and small businesses simply could not obtain insurance at any price. Members in the House will be familiar with the problems of community groups running festivals and events—principally on the strength of volunteer commitments to neighbourhoods—and finding that those efforts were becoming increasingly difficult as a consequence of the insurance costs.
The bill before the House today is a key component in implementing the resolution of state and territory ministers, the Commonwealth, industry representatives and other stakeholders to develop a national solution. Central to the development of the bill were the findings of a review panel established at the May 2002 ministerial meeting on public liability insurance. The panel, chaired by the Hon. Justice David Ipp, was established to assist the Australian government and state and territory governments to formulate a consistent and principled approach to reforming liability laws. Among other things, the panel was asked to develop and evaluate principled options to limit liability and the amount of damages awarded in a given case in order to rebalance Australia's liability insurance system.
In addition, the panel was asked to consider the interaction of the Trade Practices Act 1974 with the common-law principles applied in negligence. The review concluded that in many cases a cause of action under the Trade Practices Act is a real alternative to a cause of action in negligence. Thus any reform by the states and territories of common-law negligence could be undermined unless the Commonwealth made complementary changes to the Trade Practices Act. We have already seen evidence of that undermining taking place. In view of this, the review recommended that the act be amended to prevent claims from being brought forward for personal injury and death under division 1 of part V and to apply rules relating to the quantum of damages and limitation periods to other sections of the act.
The Australian, state and territory governments have taken action to implement key recommendations of the review. The Australian government has introduced the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003. When enacted by this parliament, the bill will prevent claims being brought forward for personal injury and death under division 1 of part V. The current bill, the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004, continues this reform agenda. Specifically, this bill will implement recommendations 17 and 21 of the review. The review recommended that the act be amended to apply rules relating to limitation of actions and quantum of damages to personal injury and death claims brought pursuant to an unconscionable conduct claim, under part IVA; a contravention of the product safety and information provisions, under division 1A of part V; a supply by a manufacturer or importer of unsatisfactory consumer goods, under division 2A of part V; or a supply by a manufacturer or importer of defective goods, under part IVA.
The approach in this bill of limiting the quantum of damages and establishing a new limitation period for personal injuries and death claims can be distinguished from that taken in the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003, which prevents claims for damages for personal injuries or death under part V, division 1 of the act. The approach taken in the first government bill reflects the view that the Trade Practices Act was not originally intended to provide causes of action to individuals who suffer personal injury and death as a result of misleading or deceptive conduct in the absence of any element of fault. Allowing claims to be made under the Trade Practices Act in these circumstances could undermine the reforms of the state and territory governments. The member for Kingston suggested that the ALP would prefer the government to apply its damages regimes from this bill to section 52 of the act as well.
The government is dealing with different parts of the Trade Practices Act in different ways, because that is consistent with the recommendations of the expert panel, the Ipp review. The government's 2003 bill relates to part V, division 1 of the act. The review took the view that this part of the act was not originally intended to apply to claims for personal injury or death. Moreover, unlike a common-law claim for negligence, part V, division 1 does not require a plaintiff to establish fault on the part of the defendant. These two factors and the recommendations of Ipp support the approach the government is taking.
This second government bill takes into account parliament's intention that the provisions relating to product safety and information, claims against manufacturers and importers of goods and product liability should provide a cause of action to individuals who suffer personal injury and death. Moreover, it is not necessary to remove personal injury and death claims under part IVA as the element of fault required under these provisions will limit the potential for personal injury and death claims. The government agrees with the review that limitations on actions and quantum of damages should apply to personal injury and death claims under these parts of the Trade Practices Act. The review panel made a number of specific recommendations on the nature of the limitation periods and the quantum of damages that should apply for different heads of damage in relation to personal injury and death claims across all jurisdictions.
The bill being debated today will introduce a number of review measures into a new part VIB of the Trade Practices Act. Part VIB will apply these measures to personal injury and death claims brought pursuant to an unconscionable conduct claim, under part IVA; a contravention of the product safety and information provisions, under division 1A of part V; a supply by a manufacturer or importer of unsatisfactory consumer goods, under division 2A of part V; or a supply by a manufacturer or importer of defective goods, under part IVA. Part VIB will establish new limitation periods for claims and thresholds and caps on awards for various heads of damages. The bill will provide a framework for phasing in damages for non-economic loss, depending on the severity of an injury, a mechanism for calculating damages for loss of earning capacity and gratuitous attendant care services. The bill will also introduce a number of other limits on personal injury damages and will clarify the powers of courts in relevant proceedings to approve structured settlements.
The government has chosen to incorporate the review's specific recommendations on limitation periods and quantum of damages into the act rather than referring the court to the relevant state or territory legislation. This approach, which is supported by other jurisdictions and industry, provides a clear and transparent national benchmark for the limitation of actions and quantum of damages in personal injury and death claims. National benchmarks on these matters will facilitate the implementation of nationally consistent reforms, giving effect to the resolutions developed and agreed to by ministers. This approach will provide greater certainty and reduce complexity for insurers and will minimise the incentive for perverse jurisdiction-shopping behaviour by plaintiffs.
The Australian government's proposed amendments to the Trade Practices Act close a loophole that would allow people to sidestep the state and territory reforms intended to restore some balance to the system and would once again drive up the cost of premiums for ordinary Australians. Like the reforms implemented by the state and territory governments, the bill balances the real needs of people suffering as a result of personal injury and death with the need to restore affordability and availability to the public liability and professional indemnity insurance markets in Australia. 
My colleague the member for Melbourne suggested that there was a lack of balance in the debate to date in that it focused too much on the cost of insurance premiums and not enough on the injury and quality of life issues for those recovering from injury. Frankly, I cannot accept that argument. What we are looking at here is the wiping out of a whole stratum of community and small business activity because the cost of conducting business or voluntary activity as a result of rising premiums is making that activity nonviable. The consequences for the community as a whole are very serious indeed. It was an awareness of the urgency of responding to that problem that caused the state, territory and Commonwealth ministers to act in concert in this conspicuous example of the strengths of federalism. Getting all those players singing from the same hymn sheet is a testimony to the leadership of my colleague the Assistant Treasurer. It is an outcome which we can celebrate today. 
Like the reforms implemented by the state and territory governments, the bill balances those needs effectively. It will restore affordability and availability to the public liability and professional indemnity insurance markets in Australia. Overall, the bill will secure the resolutions developed and supported by all Australian governments, removing costly distortions between jurisdictions and promoting clarity and certainty for insurers and policyholders. Most importantly, the bill will deliver more affordable and more readily available insurance to community groups, professionals and businesses Australia wide while continuing to recognise the needs of injured parties. I commend the bill to the House.
Question agreed to.

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2004-03-25,"—I note that in the last two minutes five bills have been passed by the House of Representatives, proving the point that where good legislation is presented in this parliament Labor will support it. But on this occasion, with the Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill 2002, good legislation has not been presented in the parliament and Labor will oppose it. We assess bills on their merits; this bill has no merit.
In this bill the government is yet again seeking to tear away the safety net of employment conditions that has been assembled for working Australians over more than 100 years. The bill would further reduce from the current 20 to 16 the matters that can be included in awards and would put limitations on some of the remaining 16 matters. It follows the 1996 first wave of industrial relations amendments that restricted allowable matters to just 20. The government is always chanting the mantra of `choice', but when it comes to choice for employees and choice of matters that can be included in awards, the government wants to restrict choice. Do not take any notice of what the government says about choice. It is what the government does that counts, and the government is consistently trying to restrict choice for working Australians. After reducing to just 20 the number of matters that could be included in awards back in 1996, the government tried in its failed 1999 second wave of industrial relations legislation to further reduce the number of allowable matters. The Senate rejected that second wave legislation in its entirety.
The attempt to remove picnic day holidays from awards, which is in this bill today, was also in the Workplace Relations Amendment (Tallies and Picnic Days) Bill 2000. The picnic day aspect of the bill was also defeated in the Senate. In his second reading speech for that bill, the then minister—now the Minister for Health and Ageing—acknowledged that these provisions have been tried before. He said:
The government is now in a position to introduce a further single issue bill drawn from the More Jobs, Better Pay Bill 1999.
That was in fact the failed second wave bill. Now the government is at it again, obsessed with tearing away at the safety net of awards that prevents the working conditions of vulnerable Australians from falling to the floor. These provisions were unacceptable to Labor in 1999, they were unacceptable to Labor in 2000 and they are unacceptable to Labor now.
I want to spend a few moments talking about the award system. Australia's award system has been established over a period of more than 100 years. Awards ensure that conditions of employment cannot fall below a decent level. They ensure that employers cannot compete on the basis of reducing employment costs below an acceptable community standard. It is all part of Australia being a fair country. Awards are traditionally made and varied by the relevant industrial relations commission, which makes an assessment of what is fair in all of the circumstances of each case, following submissions by the affected parties.
The bill before us today subverts that whole process by simply taking away the award standards through legislation rather than giving the parties the opportunity to explain their respective cases before the commission. By doing this, the bill further weakens the role of the independent umpire, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. This is part of the government's concerted attack on the commission. In 1996 the government took away the commission's powers to settle disputes and to require parties to bargain in good faith. The commission's power to make awards was limited to 20 allowable matters in that first wave of legislation. The commission was required to undertake a complex and time-consuming process of stripping awards of non-allowable matters. This process would have to be repeated if this bill were to be passed by the parliament.
In the last few years, the government has blatantly disregarded the convention of making balanced appointments to the commission, stacking it with commission members drawn almost exclusively from business backgrounds. This bill continues the process of undermining the commission, by effectively saying to the commission: `It doesn't matter what you decide or what you think is appropriate for inclusion in awards; we the government will delete the bits we don't like through legislation'—a heavy-handed intervention by the Howard government.
The bill would remove a number of very important matters from federal awards, and I will go through them. It would remove skills based career paths—an absolute scandal. It would remove bonuses, long service leave, notice of termination, and even jury service. In addition, some allowable matters would be restricted. These include training or education matters, the right of unions to take part in dispute settlement procedures and transfers of one type of employment to another. Allowances would no longer include accident make-up pay. Cultural leave would be limited to ceremonial leave for Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, and other similar types of cultural and religious observation. Public holidays would only include government-declared public holidays, and therefore not union picnic days. The scope for awards to contain matters incidental to specific allowable matters would be narrowed.
I will now speak a little bit more about the removal of some of these matters. I turn to skill based career paths and training. Removing skill based career paths and training and education matters from awards is the Liberals' latest step down their road to a low-skills, low-wage Australia. In the 21st century the key sources of productivity growth are skills and ideas. Today's productivity growth is tomorrow's prosperity. What has this government got against skills formation? What has it got against the high road to high skills and high wages? Why does it want to strip out skills formation from our award system? I will explain exactly why it wants to do it: because this government supports the low road to low skills and low wages. The Howard government has failed to invest properly in skills formation in this country, jeopardising future productivity growth and the prosperity that flows from it.
This was neatly summarised by the Labor senators in their report from the Senate inquiry on similar provisions in the 1999 second wave of industrial relations legislation, where they said:
4.63 The proposal to remove training and skill-based career paths from awards indicates that the Government has not properly considered its amendments to allowable award matters, or is simply motivated by an unreasonable ideological desire to downgrade the Commission and its awards. As witness after witness pointed out during this Inquiry, it would be insane to remove training provisions from awards. It is not in the interests of the Australian community or the economy.
4.64 The amendment would send the wrong signal to employers and employees about the importance of training and skills formation. Many employers and employees have spent a great deal of time establishing industry-wide training frameworks. If these industry-based structures were removed, many employers may not have the time, resources or inclination to renegotiate training and career path structures for their own workplaces.
I note that business organisations such as the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry have identified the need for greater skills formation in this country, and yet the government that says it represents business wants to strip skills formation and training out of the award system. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot on the one hand support the idea—which is a great idea—that skills formation is essential to future productivity growth in this country, and then strip skills formation and training out of the award system, as the Howard government seeks to do.
The Productivity Commission has found that skills formation failed to accelerate during the 1990s, making no significant contribution to productivity growth. A recently released report of the Productivity Commission, by Dean Parnham, revised in December 2003, called Sources of Australia's productivity revival, said:
... the weight of evidence suggests there was a slower rate of accumulation of human capital in the Australian workforce in the 1990s, which all else equal would have detracted from a productivity acceleration in the 1990s.
So the situation is that, during the 1990s, not only was productivity growth not assisted through skills formation but deceleration of skills formation would actually have detracted from productivity growth. So we have had a decade of record productivity growth, but there is a need to identify and invest in new sources of productivity growth, of which skills are probably the most important—and the government wants to strip skills formation out of the award system. It wants to consign Australia to being a low-skills, low-wage society, competing on wage costs against the countries of East Asia. 
The government has entered vulnerable working Australians into a race to the bottom. It is a race that we should never have entered and it is certainly a race we would never want to win. Stripping skills out of the award system is callous and heartless, but it is the Liberal way. In doing so, the government is sacrificing the future living standards of working Australians by jeopardising productivity, the source of tomorrow's prosperity.
I now move to the second matter that would be stripped out of awards if this bill were to pass the Australian parliament: the ability to transfer from one type of employment to another. The bill would make non-allowable any provision dealing with transfer from one type of employment to another type such as full-time, part-time or casual work. We know the government's agenda here. Job security is a big issue in the Australian work force today. It is causing a lot of work related stress. More than 27 per cent of our work force is in casual employment. That amounts to 2.2 million Australians. Of those 2.2 million Australians, more than 60 per cent have been employed in the same workplace for more than one year.
Casual employment can play a valuable role in seasonal work by ensuring that there is ready availability of a seasonal work force, whether it is in agriculture, hospitality, retail or other industries. Casual work can also play an important role in the entry or re-entry into the work force of the unemployed. But casual employment has been abused in this country in circumstances where employees have been with the same workplace for five, 10, 15 and even 20 years at a time. Some casual workers—in fact many—may choose to receive a loading to compensate for having no job security or leave entitlements.
The government says it is all about choice, but when Labor says, `Let's give casual employees who have been employed on a long-term regular basis the choice to ask reasonably for a conversion to permanent employment,' the government says that that is crazy and should not be allowed. The government wants to make that choice unavailable for long-term regular casuals and yet it has the hypocrisy to say it is the government of choice. It chants the mantra of choice but it means choice for employers, not choice for employees. It does not want casuals to have the choice to at least make a reasonable request to convert to permanent employment in situations where they have been in the same workplace for a long time and have been employed on a regular basis.
Many of these casuals who have been employed on a long-term regular basis cannot get the job security that they want and need for both peace of mind and, importantly, access to a home loan and other bank loans. When casuals in these circumstances go to banks, they find they are confronted with the realities of what is called a low-doc loan, meaning a low-documentation loan. If a casual cannot provide a work history and an appropriate assurance in the documentation that they provide for the bank then they are consigned to a low-doc loan. The low-doc loan is offered at a higher interest rate or for a smaller amount than would be offered to someone who is employed as a permanent.
Consequently, if a loan is available at all to a casual it is restricted to low-cost housing—that is, only to housing which a casual can afford. That is the idea that this government loves: two Australias—one which has people who can afford to get into a home on a higher income and another which has people who are consigned to low-cost homes in outer suburban areas and rural and regional Australia. That is what this government supports: two Australias—one Australia that is affluent and another that is underprivileged and consists in part of casual workers who cannot even get a proper bank loan.
Last week the Senate Community Affairs References Committee brought down its report on its inquiry into poverty and financial hardship. That inquiry was bipartisan. It is very important to understand what it had to say about casual work and the prevalence of the working poor. The report says:
The prevalence of working poor households in poverty is due simply to low-wage employment. Driving this change has been a casualisation of the workforce in the last two decades and a more recent weakening of the industrial relations systems. Between August 1988 and 2002 total employment of casual workers in Australia increased by 87.4 per cent ... By August 2002 casual workers comprised 27.3 per cent of all employees, an increase of 7 percentage points since August 1991.
The report went on to say:
... because of the precariousness and uncertainty of  their employment, career progression and  training is  often unavailable. 
It says:
... the rise in workforce casualisation is the result of attacks on Australia's traditional industrial relations system.
Who has launched those attacks? The Howard government has, of course. The Howard government has launched those attacks and that is creating the problem of job security for long-term casuals.
The Industrial Relations Commission is currently in the process of putting provisions into awards to allow long-term regular casuals to ask to transfer to permanent employment if they so desire. Employers can refuse such requests if it is unreasonable for their business to agree to them. This provision is already in a number of awards, including the metals award and the hotels award. I do not see the metal industry collapsing under the weight of this light touch regulation. I do not see the hospitality industry collapsing under the weight of this light touch regulation.
The regulation is in existence in this country at this moment, but if this legislation were passed then that light touch regulatory approach would be removed and, along with it, the choice for long-term regular casuals to at least be able to formally request a conversion to permanent employment—so much for the government chanting the mantra of choice and flexibility. This bill would take the provision right out of awards that already have it. It would stop the commission from putting it into any more awards. Again, it involves the government removing choice for employees but, of course, not for employers. When the Liberals talk about choice they mean choice for employers. When they talk about flexibility they mean downward flexibility for working Australians.
The Industrial Relations Commission, with its skills and expertise in workplace matters, has decided that these casual conversion provisions provide an appropriate response to modern workplace issues. Not only is the government negligently ignoring modern workplace issues; it is stifling efforts by other bodies with innovative solutions to these issues and challenges.
Equally ridiculous is the proposal in this bill to remove long service leave from federal awards. Removing long service leave would mean that workplaces would revert to relying on state long service leave laws, which obviously vary from state to state. This could have adverse consequences for both employers and employees, depending on each particular award provision and state law. It is totally inconsistent with the government's own stated objective of having a unitary industrial relations system, which it sought to use to justify its Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2] that was defeated in the Senate earlier this week. That bill would have effected a hostile takeover of the state unfair dismissal systems and replaced them with a weak federal system. The government said that the reason it wanted to do that was that it valued a unitary system. And yet in this legislation it is totally contradicting that position by wanting to take long service leave out of federal awards and make it a matter for the state systems.
As Reg Withers once said, `Consistency is the sign of a small mind.' The government certainly has a small mind here. The removal of long service leave from awards would particularly affect employers operating in more than one state, making it much more difficult for them to operate. It would mean that a multistate business that currently has one award standard for long service leave would instead have to apply several different long service leave standards, depending on which state the workers were in.
There is a proposal to change the allowable matter on public holidays to remove union picnic days from awards. I notice that the member for Canning is chuckling about this, because obviously he is someone who is not too committed to public holidays, as I will explain in a moment. The government is obsessed with this particular provision. As well as trying it on in 1999 it bowled it up again in 2000 with a bill specifically targeted at removing union picnic days and tallies in the meat industry. There is no logical reason to exclude this holiday from awards. I can only assume that the government does not like it because it contains the word `union'. Union picnic days are not only available to union members, so the member for Canning and all members of the government want to deprive working Australians of a public holiday. 
In many awards it forms part of the core 11 public holidays to which all employees are entitled. So, if it were removed, would it be replaced by another public holiday? I doubt it. Maybe this is part of the government's solution to the ageing of the population: reduce the number of public holidays from 11 to 10. Not only work until you drop but, when you are of working age, do not take holidays—or take one less holiday. Is that the government's agenda? I will be interested to hear from the member for Canning. Does he believe that the Australian work force should receive one less public holiday? He probably does, because that is the Liberal way. Perhaps this is part of the government's work until you drop strategy. Perhaps it is some formula relating to productivity growth. But it is a mystery to me and an insult to working Australians who would be deprived of a public holiday if this provision were to go through. I will just point out, in relation to working until you drop—
—It is a rort!
—The member just said it is a rort, so he does want one less public holiday for the Australian people. Let that go on the record. The Treasurer warned the Australian people on 26 February this year that:
There's going to be no such thing as full-time retirement.
It sounds like there is going to be no such thing as 11 public holidays if this legislation gets through, as confirmed by the member for Canning. I will move on to jury service. Is that a rort too? Does the member for Canning support the removal of jury service from the award system?
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The member opposite asked me a question. Can I answer it?
 (Ms Gambaro)—The member for Canning knows the appropriate forms of the House. It is not in order for him to answer a question. It is the member who is on his feet who has the call.
—Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. He is getting a bit bristly now that he has been outed for supporting one less public holiday and he obviously has concerns about the provision for jury service in the award system. The government wants to remove the provision for jury service from awards. This provision ensures that employees are not out of pocket if they are called to serve on juries. Are the member for Canning and other members saying that Australians who are called to serve on juries should pay their own expenses, that they should pay their own way and be out of pocket? Is this part of working until you drop? Is this part of the government's agenda? Obviously so. Removing these provisions would make the administration of our justice system considerably more difficult and would place an unfair burden on those called to serve on juries. It simply shifts costs onto working Australians—again, the Liberal way.
The government says in its explanatory memorandum that the matters to be taken out of awards are `more appropriately dealt with at the enterprise or workplace level'. So you would have to go and get your public holiday reinstated at a workplace level. You would have to ask the boss if it was all right to have a public holiday. Labor supports enterprise bargaining, but it has to be underpinned by a fair award safety net. Continually tearing away at this award safety net is not the basis for fair bargaining. The changes proposed in this bill are clearly designed to reduce the bargaining power of employees in negotiations for agreements by reducing the base from which they start negotiating—by tearing away at that safety net. The changes will also have the biggest impact on those vulnerable employees with little bargaining power, who are not able to negotiate an enterprise agreement with their employer. That is again targeting the legislative changes to the most vulnerable of working Australians—the working poor.
If the government's other bill, the Orwellian-titled better bargaining bill, were passed, the bargaining power of employees would be greatly reduced as they would be severely restricted from taking any effective lawful industrial action. So on the one hand the government is reducing the capacity of employees to bargain and on the other it is taking away award conditions and saying, `If you want these back, you have to try and bargain with your employer, but we are going to make sure you do not have any bargaining power.'
In conclusion, the pattern of the government is quite clear. It wants to tear away at the safety net protecting the working conditions of vulnerable Australians. It is the same callous behaviour that is being displayed in its unfair dismissal bill, which is already a double dissolution trigger. It is the same callous behaviour that the government is displaying in the termination of employment bill, which seeks to take over the states' unfair dismissal systems and replace them with a weak federal system. That bill is also, as a result of its rejection earlier in the week, a double dissolution bill. This is the same callous behaviour that the government is displaying with its Orwellian style protecting the low paid bill, which would make it harder for the Industrial Relations Commission to grant minimum wage rises to the poorest working Australians in this country. These and other bills that make up the Howard government's dirty dozen bills are designed to keep vulnerable working Australians in this race to the bottom of low skills and low wages, and here is the government seeking legislation that would further deskill the Australian work force.
It is an absolute disgrace that we are even debating this legislation. How members of the government can come in here and argue for a further deskilling of the Australian work force when the Productivity Commission has found that skills formation decelerated during the 1990s and probably detracted from productivity growth is an absolute scandal. But they will do it without any shame—be assured of that. They will worsen the plight of the working poor in Australia and increase their numbers. 
The Senate inquiry that I referred to earlier found that 21 per cent of households—or 3.6 million Australians—live on less than $400 a week, which is less than the minimum wage. It found that there were children aged eight to 10 who were regularly sent off to school without breakfast or lunch. It found that a Chinese migrant outworker was receiving $6 an hour to support her two children. Is this the Australia that we want? Is this the nirvana of a fully deregulated labour market, to which the Howard government is so committed?
It just astonishes me that this government can come into this place with this legislation and advocate a further deskilling of the Australian work force. The government's own Intergenerational Report forecast that productivity growth will slump back to its mediocre long-term average by the middle of this decade, which is only a year away. Australia's faltering productivity growth is hardly surprising when the Howard government has no modern economic reform agenda. It is hardly surprising when, over the last decade, government investment in education in Australia has fallen from 4.3 per cent of GDP to 3.8 per cent. That itself is a scandal. It is short-sighted. The reality is that this government, instead of apologising for the deskilling of the Australian work force, has brought legislation into this parliament to further deskill the Australian work force; to increase the number of working poor in this country; to take away any remaining bargaining capacity; and to take away a public holiday from the working poor. How much more heartless and how much more callous can a government get?
—You're a disgrace!
—The member for Canning has just used the word `disgrace'. He is absolutely right: this government is a disgrace. To bring in this legislation to deskill the Australian work force shows the true colours of this Liberal government—a government that wants to make health care available only to those Australians with enough money to buy it; a government that wants to make sure that only the sons and daughters of wealthy Australians can go on to university; and a government that wants to ensure that there are more working poor, that they have no bargaining power and that they have no skills to be able to go to an employer and command some decent wages. The government wants to tear away at that safety net. I can assure all decent Australians that Labor will oppose this legislation vigorously and use every resource at our disposal to make sure that this bill never sees the light of day on the parliamentary statute books of this country.
—What a disgraceful effort!

"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2004-03-25,"—Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker Gambaro—welcome to the Navy! I was on the HMAS Newcastle last year for a week and had a fabulous experience; but I do represent Townsville, which is Australia's largest army base, and have RAAF Townsville in my electorate. In relation to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill 2002, we need a dose of reality in relation to what the Labor Party is saying. When you look at the track record of industrial relations reforms that we have been able to get through in this House, there is no doubt that every measure that has been passed has had an extraordinarily positive result. The doom and gloom that we hear from the opposition and have just heard from the member for Rankin simply do not occur in reality.
The most significant reform was the reform of the waterfront in this country. Everyone listening to this debate will understand and know about the huge debate that went on about waterfront reform. It was a very vigorous debate. Australia was told that you could not reform the waterfront and that you could not improve the crane lifting rates on the waterfront. After the bill went through the parliament—because the government was determined to take the hard decisions—Australia moved to world competitive crane rate movements. But no-one's wages got cut. In fact, wages on the wharf increased. Not only Australia benefited; the workers on the wharf benefited, the farmers and exporters in the country benefited and the employers of the workers benefited. Everybody had a win. But Labor told us it could not happen. Labor predicted doom and gloom. And so it is with this bill and a number of other bills that have been presented to the parliament: Labor continues to oppose much needed change and much needed reform in industrial relations.
Having a productive workplace with happy staff is the best way to ensure job security for workers and a strong economy. No worker needs to be concerned about these measures. A minimum wages safety net stays and minimum award conditions stay, but the result is a streamlined system—something that benefits both workers and employers. The result is fewer strikes, lower inflation, higher productivity and lower interest rates. I can tell the opposition that, when you talk to the workers of this country, they want to make sure that interest rates stay low, that inflation stays low and that prices on supermarket shelves do not rise rapidly, as they did when Labor were last in control of the government.
The government is not about shafting workers; the government is about building a more robust employment outcome and a world-class economy, because under a world-class and robust economy everybody benefits. It is not just the employer or the employee who benefits; it is the country that benefits. The Labor Party focuses on the casualisation of the work force. I am puzzled at that, because many workers tell me that these days that is the way they want to work. Things are changing. We live in a different world today from that which we lived in 30 years ago. The Labor Party apparently wants to take us back 30 years to the way industrial relations used to work in those times. That is not the way forward for Australia.
I ask the Labor Party to think very deeply about what employees actually want, because the government does. The government wants employees in the workplace to be able to negotiate the outcome that they would like to see and that suits them specifically, wherever they are in Australia. The Labor Party, on the other hand, wants a rigidly controlled central award system that does not deliver the flexibility needed across the country. The government's view is that what is okay for Melbourne may not be okay for Townsville. In general, Townsville employers and employees alike tell me that they want to be in control of their own destiny and employment conditions. This bill is about simplifying award conditions and facilitating local agreement making. That results in a more productive workplace, which means employer and employee are happier, and it results in a more competitive Australia.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (AWARD SIMPLIFICATION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2004-03-25,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill 2002, which is currently before the House, is looking to target the most vulnerable workers in this country. This bill, if enacted, would undermine the capacity of up to 700,000 or 800,000 workers who now enjoy the minimum standards under the federal award system. The irony of this bill being introduced by this government is that it will effectively target those people who have not been collectively bargaining at their workplace. If this bill were to be enacted, it would strip away minimum entitlements that are currently available pursuant to section 89A of the Workplace Relations Act. In effect, it will target those employees who have not been collectively bargaining, most of whom are not members of employee organisations or trade unions, because they are not bound to enterprise agreements. It is a known fact that enterprise bargaining in the main is undertaken by agents of employees—in effect, registered organisations of employees.
The employees who will be affected by the enactment of this bill are those whose employment is covered by minimum award standards. When this government two terms ago introduced the Workplace Relations Act and diminished the entitlements of employees under the federal jurisdiction, it allowed for only 20 allowable matters to be inserted into the federal award system. That was a limitation on employees who were not in a position to collectively bargain for themselves. So it is somewhat ironic to find that the government is targeting those employees who are not organised, who are not members of unions and who are the most vulnerable employees in the system. It is quite extraordinary that we have a government that boasts that it wants to look after battlers and yet this bill, if enacted, will attack those so-called battlers, the people who work under the lowest award standards acceptable under Commonwealth law.
I ask the minister to come clean with respect to this matter. He gets up every question time in this place and rails against the Labor Party for opposing his bills. This bill, if enacted, will target 700,000 or 800,000 employees who are working under minimum conditions as set down by law. I think people should understand that. It is quite clear: in effect, it would remove those entitlements and limitations that were enacted in 1996. Skills based career paths would no longer be an allowable matter. If we were to remove this entitlement in an award, if we were to stop parties negotiating skills based jobs, what message would that send to the employers of this country? Effectively, we would be saying, `We no longer need to consider skills and the acquisition of skills and knowledge in order to elevate under an award.' 
In effect, the government are sending two messages: firstly, they are saying that they are happy to target those who are not organised and who are not capable of having their entitlements collectively bargained; and, secondly, they are undermining the need for workplaces to focus on skills in order for employees to elevate through the classification structure. To deny employees who are under the minimum award system a skills based award and, indeed, at the same time to target the most vulnerable workers in the federal jurisdiction is an absolute disgrace. If the Prime Minister were concerned about the battlers—and he keeps pretending that he is—he would concern himself with this matter and tell his minister to withdraw this bill, because it is an outrage.
—Order! It being 2 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 101A. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member for Burke will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (AWARD SIMPLIFICATION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2004-03-25,"—by leave—One year ago, before this House, the government tabled the final report of the royal commission into the building and construction industry.
One year ago, the government committed to restoring the rule of law in this industry.
One year ago, the government put this industry, employers, employees, unions and governments on notice. The time has come for this industry to bite the bullet. The time has come for this industry to abide by the same laws that apply to all industries and all Australians.
Some in the industry claim the royal commission was established to attack the union movement and that it was biased towards employers. This is not true. The findings of the royal commission present a compelling and unassailable case for reform. The evidence presented before the royal commission cannot be ignored. It is the responsibility of government to ensure that this industry abides by the same laws that apply in other workplaces.
The royal commission found the building and construction industry is characterised by illegal and improper payments, threats of violence, chronic failure to honour legally binding agreements, contempt for commission and court rulings and has a culture of coercion, harassment and intimidation. This industry has been and continues to be crippled by lawlessness.
The royal commission called on all parties in the industry—employers, employees, unions and governments—to clean up this important industry.
This government is determined to pursue the reform necessary to assist this industry to reach its economic potential. This industry is vital to the Australian economy and the illegal conduct of unions and employers is forcing up costs, which, at the end of the day, are borne by all Australians.
The `rule of law' must be returned. The unions and the Labor Party have ducked and weaved and obstructed the efforts to reform this industry. They say there are no problems, things have got better and the industry can fix itself up.
The Labor Party has said it will ignore the findings of the royal commission, the highest form of judicial inquiry. Instead the Labor Party, including those Labor senators on the Senate inquiry, side with the CFMEU union bosses and turn a blind eye to the illegal and unlawful conduct in this industry.
Today I will table proof that what the royal commission uncovered (and what those in the industry know) is true.
I have received a report from the interim building industry task force on the state of the building and construction industry and the work of the task force. The report is not good news. It paints a very disturbing picture. It shows that there are still problems. Things have not got better and the industry, one year on, has been unable to fix itself.
The report which I am tabling today, Upholding the law—one year on: findings of the interim building industry taskforce, should be a matter of concern to all Australians. The report shines a light on the dark side of the building and construction industry. It highlights that unlawful and inappropriate behaviour continue to beset the building and construction industry.
It provides a sad indictment on the industry, which has the potential to be great but which is hamstrung by endemic, illegal and improper conduct. The task force has:
	conducted almost 400 investigations, resulting from some 1,500 complaints to its hotline;
	initiated 13 prosecutions; and
	had five cases finalised in the courts, a 100 per cent success rate, including successful prosecutions against employers.
As the case studies cited in this report clearly demonstrate, the Cole royal commission did get it right. Let me just quote from a few. In relation to this industry's contempt for the law:
On 8 October 2003, there was a mass union meeting held to discuss the Building Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003. Approximately 10,000 construction workers were in attendance. Commissioner Harrison, of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, had already handed down a return-to-work order on the previous day, 7 October, expressly stating that all workers were to return to work upon the conclusion of the meeting. When this order was read out at the meeting, the assembly simply laughed and proceeded to pass a motion to take the remainder of the day off. The Taskforce is currently investigating 22 head contractors and substantially more subcontractors who appear to have unlawfully paid strike pay on that day.
In relation to violence, thuggery and intimidation:
In March 2004, the Taskforce received a complaint from a glazier being threatened that, if he did not sign a union-endorsed EBA, all of the glass he had already installed on a building site would be smashed. At the time of writing, the glazier was still considering whether to proceed with his complaint.
In another recent report, a head contractor was assaulted by five officials from different unions for not succumbing to union demands. As a result of this assault, the State police attended the scene. The head contractor subsequently surrendered to the union demands because of the economic reality that if the dispute continued, he would become bankrupt.
In relation to donations to the union:
In the latter part of 2003, a subcontractor was required by a union official to purchase t-shirts, bearing the union logo, at a cost of thousands of dollars per item. The subcontractor provided payment in return for access to the site where he could continue his work. This type of activity is common on sites throughout Australia. The clothing company awarded these clothing contracts is owned by the wife of a union organiser.
In a matter investigated by the Taskforce in February 2004, a subcontractor was charged $1,000 by a union for each of the seven days he worked on a site. The official demanded this payment because the subcontractor did not have a union-endorsed EBA. The subcontractor was issued with receipts that indicated the payment was for t-shirts.
If this report is not enough to convince the Labor Party to stop their mindless opposition, to get out of the way and let the government get on with reforming this industry, I also draw to the attention of the House that this sector continues to have one of the worst records of industrial disputes.
In 2002, the building and construction industry had a strike rate almost seven times that of all other industries combined and accounted for about 40 per cent of industrial disputes across the country. Figures for the 2003 year suggest a slight improvement, and I believe this is in no small part due to the efforts of the task force. However, it is still unacceptably high: six times the strike rate of all other industries combined and accounted for 30 per cent of industrial disputes across Australia. This industry is still the worst affected by industrial disputes.
The occupational health and safety performance of the building and construction industry continues to be something of which all Australians should be ashamed and which the Australian government, for its part, is determined to improve. The construction industry ranks in the top three of all industries for the number of injury and disease related fatalities in the workplace. It also ranks in the top five for incidences of workplace injuries and disease. All employees, especially those in the commercial construction industry, have the right to expect a safe workplace. To improve occupational health and safety performance in this industry, behavioural and cultural change is vital and should be a priority above all else. Unfortunately, the industry's continued inability to deal with safety issues effectively means there are many accidents and injuries that could have been avoided. The Australian government, as a major client of the building and construction industry, is well positioned to drive such change.
The building and construction industry is critical to the welfare and prosperity of this nation. Everything we buy, consume or use has a building cost component. If we can improve the building industry's culture, we can reduce the future costs for every Australian consumer and improve the productivity of our economy. 
In 2002-03, the building industry was a $46 billion-a-year industry, accounting for nearly six per cent of Australia's gross domestic product and employing over 730,000 people. 
Independent research has estimated that the construction sector is up to 40 per cent more expensive than the housing sector to do the same building jobs.
Costs of building are higher in some states than in others. Last week, Daniel Grollo, the managing director of Grocon, was quoted in the Australian Financial Review as saying that Victoria's industrial climate had put the local construction industry behind the rest of the nation and that Victoria's construction times were about one-and-a-half times those of New South Wales.
Mr Grollo said `...this can clearly be targeted at the culture that exists in Victoria and the work practices.'
These extra costs, borne by all Australians, present one of the most compelling reasons for reform in this industry. In fact, independent research has shown that improving this industry's workplace practices would boost Australia's economy by $2.3 billion a year.
Econtech, the respected analyst, has found that if labour productivity in the commercial construction sector matched that in the domestic housing sector, the CPI would be one per cent lower, GDP would be one per cent higher and consumers would enjoy an additional $2.3 billion in economic benefits each year.
The time for talking is over. If these economic benefits can be grasped through a process of regulatory and cultural reform, it would deliver real and ongoing benefits for all Australians. Reform must be structural and cultural, and directed to the specific problems of this industry.
The Labor Party has walked away from the need to reform the building and construction industry. The Labor Party has the luxury of not having to act in the interests of all Australians. It would be irresponsible of the Australian government not to tackle the problems of the construction industry.
If the Australian government could save just one per cent of its annual $5 billion construction bill, there would be $50 million more each and every year to spend on schools, doctors, roads and national security.
Beyond the manifest economic benefits, all industry participants will benefit from being able to work in an industry that is free from coercion and intimidation—an industry where they are allowed to exercise genuine choice about whether or not to join a union or to enter into a particular type of employment agreement.
As the West Australian said this week:
A worker's ability to negotiate directly with the employer is a simple democratic right which should be protected at all costs.
All industry participants, including workers, will benefit from working in an environment in which laws are respected and obligations are complied with. No-one is above the law. Laws must apply to all citizens whether they be union officials, employers or workers.
Reform of the building and construction industry is something the Australian government cannot and will not ignore.
The government has moved swiftly to implement the royal commission's recommendations. In recognising the real need for reform this government, following the royal commission recommendations, introduced specific legislation aimed at reforming the building and construction industry.
This legislation was passed in this House on 4 December last year, but is now stalled. It is the subject of a Senate references committee inquiry consisting of five Labor senators who have all been given their orders by Labor's shadow cabinet, which has already resolved not to implement any of the royal commission recommendations. The double standards are breathtaking.
This government, however, will not stand still on reform. This government is committed to genuine cultural and structural reform that this industry so desperately needs. Federal and state governments from both sides of the political fence have made attempts in the past to reform the industry, but all have failed. This government will not repeat the same mistakes. Having separate industry specific legislation is the key to bringing about the changes long overdue in this unique industry.
The industry does want change but is ill-equipped to initiate and deliver it on its own. The government will not allow the tactics of delay and misinformation by the Labor Party and its union bosses to distract us from the need to bring the much needed change. 
The task force is one such way to give the industry a helping hand. Some people have the view that as the task force is titled `interim' there is no need to take it seriously—that it will go away in the same way as other attempts to reform this industry have in the past.
So that there is no misunderstanding, no confusion, no mixed signals, so that it is clear to all that the government is serious about reform, the interim task force will now be established as the `Building Industry Taskforce'. It will continue to operate until the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill (and the establishment of the ABCC) is passed by this parliament.  
The task force with a strong contingent of inspectors will continue to make its presence felt in the building industry. The task force will use all of its powers to uphold the law. The task force which will continue to shine a light on the dark side of this industry is another step toward achieving lasting and long overdue reform in this industry.
If the Labor Party continues to delay the passage of the bill, the government will also pursue the use of alternative arrangements to establish the federal safety commissioner to address the significant occupational health and safety issues within the industry. For too long safety matters in this industry have not been taken seriously with bogus claims being made by unions to force illegal industrial action on employers. Safety is a serious issue and this government is serious about improving safety outcomes. We will do this by requiring best practice on Australian government construction sites.
This government is also concerned with evidence that suggests employee entitlements are being neglected by cowboy employers. Employers are and must be legally responsible for their employees' entitlements. Employees need to be assured that if they go to work these entitlements will be paid to them.
To deal with rogue employers who do not meet their obligations, the Office of Workplace Services will target the building and construction industry firstly in Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia with education and compliance programs to ensure employers meet their and employees get their legal obligations.
This is in addition to action already taken by this government, across all industries, to protect employee entitlements. This government has been the first to seriously address the issue of employee entitlements lost on insolvency. To date more than $168 million has been paid to over 29,000 employees under this government's GEER scheme.
In addition, I will be writing to small and medium size businesses to ensure they are aware of assistance available to them on any workplace issues, wages and conditions, health and safety, taxation or training.
This industry is in desperate need of reform. The government is doing and will continue to do its bit to clean up this industry.
The Labor Party do not want to acknowledge the problems that exist within this industry. Their hands are tied by the union bosses.
It is not a very hard choice for this government—a choice between continued unlawful behaviour costing all Australians billions of dollars and a commitment to lasting reform.  
This government has made its choice.
We say to the Labor Party: stop allowing this unlawful behaviour to continue. The challenge for the Labor Party is to start acting in the interest of all Australians and pass the BCII Bill. 
One year ago the royal commission prepared case studies from evidence heard of unlawful and inappropriate behaviour in each state and territory. Many were cases where serious breaches of the law had been identified. 
One year ago the Attorney-General's Department referred these matters to relevant state and territory governments for investigation and swift and appropriate action.
It is a matter of grave concern that, one year on, the state and territory investigations on these matters have still not provided a finalised outcome.
Why have state and territory governments failed to act upon these referrals when they committed to do so?
I am urging the state and territory governments to do what they said they would and finalise these matters as it is in the best interests of good government to do so.
I will be writing to all relevant state and territory ministers and asking them to advise the Australian government and the Australian people why they still have not done anything about the matters referred to them.
I would like to end today by quoting someone who some 14 years ago recognised that this industry desperately needed reform. He said:
Friends, this industry is going to have to bite the bullet at last. If this country wants to be efficient and productive, everybody has to undergo the reform process—and most especially an industry which has such pressuring and demonstrable need for it.  So reform in the construction industry starts now ...  Let me make it clear that the Government is committed to real microeconomic reform in the industry.  The aim of reform is to produce real savings in productivity and efficiency to encourage greater investment in the industry.  It entails taking on issues long regarded as too hard but who settlement is crucial to the performance of the industry.  By this I mean issues as poor employment relationships, restrictive work practices, lost time, the adversarial approach to industrial relations in the industry ...
This is not a statement from a coalition minister. This is a statement from Senator Peter Cook, the Minister for Industrial Relations in 1990. If only he and the Labor Party had still had the moral courage to stand by this commitment.
Unlike the Labor Party, this government will not resile from the need to ensure that the rule of law must apply in this industry as it does everywhere else.
I present a copy of my ministerial statement and the following paper:
Upholding the law—one year on: findings of the interim building industry taskforce

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2004-03-25,"—The government's agenda in the building industry is not about jobs or productivity or supposed lawlessness. The government's agenda in the building industry has its genesis in the political strife it found itself in following its defeat in the Ryan by-election in early 2001. It needed a union-busting agenda as a diversion from its political woes. This agenda is about taking away bargaining power from workers in one of Australia's most dangerous, and most productive, industries. It is not about deregulating the industry but about regulating it.
Labor acknowledges that employees in the building industry do have a strong bargaining position in their negotiations with employers. In the tough, dangerous industry of commercial construction, unionisation rates are traditionally very high and workers are quick to defend their terms and conditions of employment. Workers in this industry are highly sensitive to health and safety concerns and quick to react if they see themselves or their colleagues at risk of harm. This is totally understandable in an industry where there is, on average, a workplace fatality each and every week, often in terribly careless circumstances. For instance, young Dean McGoldrick and Joel Exner, aged 16 and 17, fell to their deaths while working without proper safety harnesses and equipment. But the tragedies on building sites do not stop with fatalities. Anthony Hampson was working for Joel Exner's employer in October 2001 when he fell from a roofing job. Mr Hampson suffered spinal injuries and was wheelchair bound for six months. With young workers dying and being seriously injured as a result of poor safety practices, is it any wonder that the unions that represent these workers are so resolute in their protection of their members? Is it any wonder that these workers are vigilant in defending their own? But the Prime Minister hates strong unions.
I want to spend a bit of time speaking about true reform. I am not saying that this industry is perfect and that there is no room for improvement—far from it. There are serious issues in this industry that need to be addressed, but most of these were glossed over by the $60 million witch-hunt that the government calls a royal commission. That is why Labor, along with the Democrats and Greens, felt the need for a more balanced investigation into the industry and established a Senate references committee inquiry. This inquiry has already held hearings in Canberra, Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide and is proceeding to Darwin and Melbourne in the coming weeks. The inquiry has broad terms of reference to enable it to investigate areas glossed over by the Cole royal commission, including underpayment of employee entitlements, tax evasion, use of sham corporate structures and, of course, health and safety. The inquiry has also questioned whether the government's proposed legislation provides an appropriate way forward for this industry, or, to use the government's own criterion: will weakening the role of building unions make the cost of building a wall in a high-rise building the same as that in a domestic building? For a brighter future, does this industry need new government appointed and directed task forces whose primary role is to police building unions?
I agree with the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations on one thing: the same laws should apply to all industries and all Australians. On that basis, the government should withdraw the so-called Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003, which provides a separate set of laws for the building and construction industry. The government's 200-page bill, with 30 pages alone on compulsory secret ballots for industrial action, is not the way forward for this industry. It is legislation that was prepared for political purposes and designed to fail. It is complex, conflict-driven legislation based on false assumptions that will not assist the industry or its consumers.
The minister claims that this industry is crippled by lawlessness. Far from being crippled, the industry is booming. In May 1997 there were 575,000 people working in the building industry; in May 2003 there were 737,000—an extra 160,000 jobs in this industry. According to the Productivity Commission, the construction industry is the fourth most productive industry in Australia. The government's claim that commercial construction is 40 per cent less efficient than domestic construction is just wrong. The Senate inquiry has heard evidence from many witnesses on why there are significant cost differentials between commercial and domestic construction—none of these had anything to do with union activity or industrial relations. Factors cited include different engineering and material standards, different safety standards—given that high-rise buildings are more dangerous to work on—and different cabling and scaffolding requirements. These factors were perhaps best summarised by Mr Greg Packer of the Walter Construction Group in the Brisbane hearing:
... it is reasonably hard to get the right picture for comparison between the domestic sector and the commercial sector.
Nevertheless, the minister is yet again using this false comparison to justify this expensive union-busting exercise. We are dealing here with a one-sided regulator. The Queensland Master Builders Association told the Senate inquiry what it perceived to be the key issues facing this industry, one of which was the need for streamlined processes for the recovery of unpaid employee entitlements.
This is one of the most glaring omissions in the government's plan for this industry. The underpayment or nonpayment of employee entitlements will not be assisted by the government's proposed legislation or by its permanent building task force. We know this not only from the bill but also from the track record of the existing interim building industry task force. The interim task force was established in September 2002. Since then it has focused almost entirely on union activities and has not even attempted to take a balanced approach to investigating breaches of law in this industry. The charter of the task force provides:
The Taskforce has prime responsibility for the following matters in respect to the building and construction industry:
	alleged breaches of awards and agreements.
A reasonable person would assume that this meant that the task force would investigate all noncompliance with terms and conditions of awards and agreements, such as underpayment of entitlements to employees, but that is not how the task force sees its own duties. At the most recent Senate estimates hearings in February 2003, Senator Wong questioned the director of the task force, Nigel Hadgkiss, on this very issue. She said:
I understand none of the cases that you currently have before the courts relate to any nonpayment of any employee entitlement. Is that right?
Mr Hadgkiss—That is my recollection.
Senator WONG—You say in this answer that it is not part of your remit to investigate instances of underpayments. Is that right?
Mr Hadgkiss—That is correct.
So much for investigating underpayment of employee entitlements. So much for assurances from the minister that that is what this permanent task force would do. Mr Hadgkiss's frank evidence confirms what we already knew: the government has spent millions of dollars on the royal commission and the interim task force, acting as a private police force and legal representative for employers in the building industry. This is unashamedly biased, unashamedly one-sided—and now permanent as well.
The work of the task force will be continued with the bodies outlined in today's statement—the Australian Building and Construction Commission and the Federal Safety Commission. There is no doubt that these new agencies would only be there to help employers. The health and safety commission would not be about health and safety; it would be about keeping unions out of health and safety issues and about policing disputes about health and safety. This is the approach taken to health and safety by the interim task force, as was also admitted by Mr Hadgkiss at the February estimates hearing. Mr Hadgkiss admitted that his officers would investigate health and safety matters only if they suspected that a health and safety dispute was not genuinely about health and safety. Anything else would not be their problem.
Let us discuss the matter of lawlessness. This year the building task force had an annual budget of $6.8 million. Last year it was $5.9 million. That is a total so far of $12.7 million. Yet with almost $13 million the task force has only managed to carry out 400 investigations, resulting in only 13 prosecutions in the 18 months since it was established. Of those 13 prosecutions, only five are characterised as `successful'. One of these prosecutions was brought to the attention of the Senate inquiry by Doug Cameron, Secretary of the AMWU. It involved a phoenix company—one which shut down operations under one name and restarted under another, slightly different name. The task force was not concerned to check if any payments or obligations were avoided by this sham corporate structure. Its investigations instead centred on a notice for protected industrial action by the AMWU, which used the previous company name.
When asked about this matter, again at the February estimates hearing, Mr Hadgkiss said the matter was pursued because of the task force's `zero tolerance' policy. On 24 February 2004, New South Wales Chief Industrial Magistrate George Miller found that the union's breach could be described as `an inadvertent error' and fined the union $2,000. Unfortunately, as I have already pointed out, the task force's zero tolerance policy seems to apply only in respect of union related breaches of laws and obligations. Even when prosecutions are brought against employers they are about issues such as the payment of strike pay, as in the case finalised against Baulderstone Hornibrook last night and referred to in the minister's statement today. The task force will investigate and prosecute employers for paying employees during periods of industrial action but will not investigate and prosecute employers who fail to pay employees.
The task force has spent $13 million and brought just 13 prosecutions. Of the five finalised cases, one was about a technical paperwork breach and another was about a company deciding to pay its employees while they took industrial action. This is hardly evidence of rampant lawlessness. It is also an astonishing amount of taxpayers' money spent for so few cases. Compare this to the Commonwealth Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Its latest annual report tells us that in 2002-03 it spent $61.3 million, about five times the amount spent by the task force so far. For this amount of money the DPP launched 4,726 prosecutions, of which 4,608 resulted in convictions. I understand that there are some differences between the way these two bodies function, but this is an astronomical difference in getting results from the use of taxpayers' money.
Let us talk about a way forward. A number of submissions to the Senate inquiry have spoken about the need for cultural change in this industry and the need for greater cooperation. Labor supports this position but, sadly, today's government statement does nothing to progress it. The value of the trust model was highlighted in the construction of the Sydney Olympics. That great project was delivered on time and under budget, under a memorandum of understanding agreed by all the relevant parties. There was one fatality on that site—which is one too many—but there was a  pretty good health and safety record through the trust model, the cooperative approach.
The need for trust was most acutely highlighted by Dr John Buchanan, a pre-eminent industrial relations researcher from the University of Sydney. When asked by Senator Cook at the Sydney hearing of the inquiry about trust in the industry, Dr Buchanan replied:
That is the essence of the problem here. It seems to me that that is the better place to start. If you are thinking about how you get through the problems in the construction industry, do you send in the Scuds and the Exocets or do you think a little more laterally and ask, `If we want an industry that is high trust in 10 years time, what do we have to do?' You get a completely different set of answers if you ask that question.
I agree with Dr Buchanan: we need to consider better ways forward. But trying to beat one party—unions—into submission is not a way towards trust and cooperation. Setting up a new, powerful, minister directed police force is not the way towards trust and cooperation. We need instead to investigate truly cooperative mechanisms that could be used to establish an environment of trust.
Cooperative mechanisms exist and have successfully existed in various states in this and other industries. The state governments have endorsed a 10-point plan for the building industry, which includes introducing good faith bargaining provisions and giving the Industrial Relations Commission the power to settle intractable disputes. This is a far more constructive approach than that proposed by the federal government. We strongly support the need for good faith bargaining provisions and we have introduced legislation to insert such provisions into the Workplace Relations Act. But Labor does not support the establishment of private police forces or spending millions of dollars of taxpayers' money pursuing technical breaches of paperwork by unions. The government's whole approach to the building industry represents a terrible waste of money and a missed opportunity to move the industry towards a more positive future.
The minister quoted Senator Cook at the end of his statement. That is ironic. Senator Cook's statement was made in the lead-up to the establishment of the Construction Industry Development Agency, a cooperative body of exactly the type that might be useful in restoring trust in this industry. Of course, the minister conveniently failed to mention that. And what did the Howard government do when it came to office? It abolished this agency. It abolished the cooperative approach and instead has pursued a confrontationist approach. It is the government which is being the industrial dinosaur here, playing its old game of conflict and division. Labor will not be part of this game. Instead, we will be looking for cooperative solutions to the issues that challenge the building industry.
Debate (on motion by Mr Ross Cameron) adjourned.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry</title>,Ministerial Statements,16,1
"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2004-03-25,"—This is a government in disarray over national security; a government that has compromised the independence and role of the Australian Federal Police; a government that is always putting the Liberal Party's political interests ahead of our national security interests; a government that is defying the obvious—that, while Australia was a target at the time of September 11, the war in Iraq has made things worse; a government that sent young Australians to war in Iraq for a purpose that was not true. As Senator Hill said on Tuesday, at least for an hour or two, Iraq has no weapons of mass destruction. It is a government that has diverted effort and resources away from targeting the terrorists and put them into Iraq, and now it is a government that does not know how to get our troops out of Iraq. It was easy to race in but now it is a government that does not know how to get out—a government with no exit strategy, no way of getting the troops home for the defence of Australia. It is a government that, in this regard, is in total confusion and total disarray.
In May of last year in New York the Prime Minister was asked about the commitment of troops in Iraq. The journalist asked `Do you see it as months or years'? And the Prime Minister replied `Well, I certainly don't see it as years', implying that he saw it as a matter of months. Then in the parliament yesterday he was asked the clear question by the member for Griffith about the extent of Australia's ADF deployment, whether it should be months rather than years, and the Prime Minister's answer:
I am very happy to say it should not be years ...
There was the Prime Minister defining the government's own commitment. Given the fact that Australia has had a deployment in Iraq for over 12 months already, for the Prime Minister to honour that commitment of saying it should not be years, he is obliged to withdraw our troops from Iraq by the end of 2004 or the beginning of 2005. But in the same answer he says he is not in favour of a time line, implying that he believes in an open-ended commitment to our troops in Iraq. So, in the same parliamentary answer, within the space of a few minutes, the Prime Minister actually has two positions: one a position of saying it should not be for years, implying that the troops should be out at the end of 2004 or the beginning of 2005, and then a position of saying there should be an indefinite commitment—a government that is totally confused on the key question of national security. The poor chap is just spinning around, totally confused and in total disarray about what should happen to the Australian commitment in Iraq.
Labor's position has always been clear and principled. We want our troops back as soon as possible after Australia has discharged its international responsibility. It is of course logical and right to use the change of sovereignty, the new Iraqi government, as the turning point. That is why a Labor government elected, say, in September will ensure, and certainly has the intention of, having our troops home by Christmas. That is the Labor position. Our intention is to have our troops home by Christmas if a Labor government is elected in September. This builds on the announcement made by the member for Griffith, the shadow minister for foreign affairs, from Baghdad, on 14 November last year. This is what he said:
The early establishment of an interim Iraqi government would also provide Australia with an appropriate exit strategy from its current formal responsibilities as an Occupying Power under the Fourth Geneva Convention.
At present, we do not have such an exit strategy.
Australia does now. Australia does have such a strategy. It is Labor's strategy of having our troops back by Christmas. What we are doing is holding the government to their original position when they said `months, not years', when the Prime Minister said he did not believe in a commitment that ran into years, that would not go beyond two years—a commitment that would have our troops back by Christmas. All this chopping and changing by the Prime Minister and the government is plain bad for the defence of Australia. It is not good policy to be chopping and changing so comprehensively on such a key issue of national interest and national security. 
As for all these coalition MPs accusing me of being on the side of al-Qaeda, we know that slur; we have heard it before. It is the same thing that the Minister for Foreign Affairs said about the Police Commissioner, Mick Keelty. He said that the Police Commissioner was talking in a way that associated him with al-Qaeda propaganda. It is their standard slur. When someone does not agree with them, they do not argue the point in the national interest but put the slur out about al-Qaeda. I do not care too much what they say about me; it washes over me totally.
—The Minister for Foreign Affairs pipes up. I think he has a ladder in his stockings he is squirming there so much, but I know one thing: it sure ain't the ladder of opportunity running up his leg. He can say these things about me—he has the member for Parramatta next to him—it does not worry me in the slightest; it washes over me. The thing I get worked up about is when they slur and slander a good man like Mick Keelty. That is when I get worked up. I am willing to defend him against the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I will defend him against this government's intimidation of his position and the way in which he was slurred by the members opposite. If they want to do something about al-Qaeda other than issue slurs at the doorstops of Parliament House, they should recognise that diverting resources from the real task of attacking al-Qaeda, the real task of targeting the terrorists, diverting resources into Iraq, has not produced the best result. If all the effort, time and resources that have gone into the war in Iraq actually went into targeting the terrorists, then the world would be a safer place today; the world would be a better place.
We found out in question time today that, in terms of one of the front-line engagements against the terrorists in Afghanistan, this government have one troop, one soldier. They are waging a one-man war against terrorism in Afghanistan. So with all the resources, time and effort that has gone into Iraq, on that real front line, an active front line, against terror in Afghanistan they have actually got one person—a one-man war against terror. It is the misallocation of resources that this government should be ashamed of.
In terms of our commitment to bringing the troops back by Christmas, we are interested in and committed to the defence of Australia—the defence of Australia always, not the misallocation of resources. There is a public concern in this country that follows the war in Iraq. The government themselves have said that Australia's commitments around the globe are quite stretched. We put the defence of Australia first. Putting the defence and security of Australia first has always been the Labor way and it always will be in the future.
What we see from this government is policy failing after policy failing. But they never admit it; they always say it is a matter of context. So when Mick Keelty speaks the truth that terrorist activity is linked to participation in Iraq—a statement of truth—the government make him go out and say, `No; it's out of context,' and make a clarifying statement drafted under the direct supervision of the Prime Minister. When Senator Hill says that there are no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq—an outbreak of truth—a couple of hours later, there is another clarifying statement saying that he has been quoted out of context. What was the context of Senator Hill's remarks on Tuesday? He said:
We went to war in Iraq to support the Security Council which had to be assured that Saddam Hussein had got rid of his weapons of mass destruction. Now we are confident that there are no weapons of mass destruction and there is no dictator that will use them against his own people or his neighbours.
What `out of context' could there possibly have been? The context was crystal clear. It was as plain as the nose on the face of the government members opposite. The context was absolutely clear: `Now we are confident that there are no weapons of mass destruction.'
Then there was the shameful comment by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, trying to associate Mick Keelty with al-Qaeda propaganda. Again he says he was quoted out of context, but again the context is totally clear. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said:
I think he was just expressing a view which reflects a lot of the propaganda we are getting from al-Qaeda.
A shocking thing to say—and something for which he should have apologised publicly in this House of Representatives.
If they say it is a government out of context, we know the truth: it is a government out of time. It is a government that is in an absolute shambles when it comes to the good national security policy of this country. Yet at the end of these debates, at the end of the disarray on national security, the Tories have the hide to say, `Trust us on national security; we're the only ones who can handle it.' Where in Australian history was that proposition ever proven or valid? Not prior to World War II, when the Tories left this country underprepared; not during the folly of Vietnam; not in the misallocation of resources and the difficulties caused by the war in Iraq; and not after the Keelty affair this week. The Tories have a shocking record on national security. It is only ever Labor that gets it right in the defence of Australia, in the best national interest for keeping our people safe and sound against threats.
So it is time for the Australian people once more to look to Labor—to look to the future and to look to Labor. We have no time tunnel we can go down to undo the government's mistakes, but we have a positive agenda for this nation's national security. Our first priority is to target the terrorists themselves and to break up their networks—not repeat the mistakes of Iraq; not fight a war for the wrong core purpose; not divert resources from finding and destroying the terrorists. What we need is the real strength of breaking up their networks and targeting them—having a stronger commitment to targeting the terrorists, not waging wars against nation states for the wrong purpose. We need a lot better than the one-man war in Afghanistan.
Our second priority is to abandon the doctrine of pre-emption. It did not work in Iraq, because there was nothing to pre-empt. It was a failure of intelligence and government decision making. If this government are so competent on national security, why do we have a major inquiry under way into the failings of pre-war intelligence for Iraq? If they are so competent, why do we have this major inquiry under way proving the mistakes that were made in intelligence and government decision making prior to the commitment?
Our third strategy on the Labor side is to build up Australia's self-reliance. We support the American alliance absolutely. We founded it under John Curtin during World War II, and Labor is proud of its founding work and long-term support for the American alliance. But we also believe in self-reliance for Australia within the terms of that alliance. We want to be an equal partner with the United States, not be a deputy sheriff. You will never hear me describing Australia as a deputy sheriff. I am too proud of this country and too proud of what Labor governments have achieved in the past to undersell and underestimate the contribution we can make. Always Australia's self-reliance and an equal partnership with the United States, and never to neglect the home front. Always the defence of Australia first and foremost, not expeditionary forces. Always the defence of Australia in terms of strategic planning for our national defence.
Our fourth strategy is to establish a department of homeland security—an integrated, coordinated model; a one-stop shop where the states and territories can interact with not a dozen federal agencies but one federal government department to get it right—along the lines of the United States model. This is particularly vital for addressing threats to our transport system. We need the strongest possible federal, state and territory cooperation to make this country safe and sound for the future. We urgently need a department of homeland security.
Our fifth strategy is to upgrade our airport and port security. I have visited regional airports in Australia with 70,000 to 80,000 passenger movements per annum and no screening devices for passengers or luggage. We see it at Burnie and in other parts of Tasmania in the electorate of Braddon—no screening devices. Tens of thousands of passengers going through and there are no screening devices for the passengers or their luggage. We have to build up our regional airport security.
So too we have to build up our port security. What has been the government's response? Two and half years after September 11, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Anderson, announced a security review on the weekend. That is all this government is good for—reviewing things 2½ years after the event. Two and a half years after the alert was sounded, the government can produce nothing more substantial than a review. This alarming statistic remains with us today: almost a third of the crew aboard visiting foreign cargo ships entering Australia do so without facing passport checks. So a third of the foreign crews on these boats visiting Australia do not have to face passport checks. We need more than a review; we need action. We need government action to build up our port security as we also build up our regional airport security around Australia.
When it comes to national security, you cannot trust the Howard government. They are always playing politics, always looking for the spin and the control and the opportunity to manipulate information—not for the public interest, not for honest statements that the Australian people can consume and understand, but for narrow political purposes. They are always putting their narrow political interests ahead of our national interests. It is time for the government to go. The government are spinning around confused. Less than two years after the engagement in Iraq they still do not know what they are going to do with the withdrawal of our troops. The government are confused about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq—Senator Hill says one thing in the morning and something else in the late morning. The government have vilified and tried to diminish the role of a great Australian in Mick Keelty. The government have gone bad on the doctrine of pre-emption. The government should go, and it should hand over to a Labor administration.

"Downer, Alexander, MP",LP,2004-03-25,"—The first point I would like to make is that I have noticed over the years that the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa, has made these points about coalition governments in the lead-up to World War II. Let it be put on the record that in 1938 the Labor Party national convention passed a resolution saying that Australia should play no part in confronting the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler should it come to war. So let us not try to pretend that the coalition was a great supporter of appeasement: that was the Labor Party's policy in 1938.
The Australian government are unashamedly committed to taking a strong stand on national security. We have taken many tough decisions but we believe they have been necessary to protect Australia at home and abroad. In order to protect Australians at home, we clearly have to make substantial contributions to the international security situation. As a government, I think we have responded decisively to the `Islamo-fascist' attack on our value system, on the things that we all believe in—on our way of life and on the way of life of moderate Islam as well. We know that you have to be strong and that you have to be determined. We know that you have to try to lead in terms of public opinion and that you cannot afford to just look at an opinion poll and take a populist position; you have to be prepared to argue your case over a period of time. We have done some things which have been popular and we have done quite a lot of things which have been unpopular. One thing we have never been is weak. We have always been determined to do the right thing by this country, and I think we have been very successful in doing the right thing by this country.
After September 11, we invoked the ANZUS treaty; the ANZUS treaty was actually a coalition achievement. We were part of the coalition in Afghanistan. The SAS went to Afghanistan and they did a simply outstanding job. When their job was finished, they left. We contributed to the destruction of al-Qaeda's home base. We overthrew the vile sponsors of al-Qaeda, the Taliban regime, and we seriously degraded the capacity of the Taliban. We contributed to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. We are proud of the role we played; we disarmed the regime and we freed its people. We transformed the international counter-proliferation agenda. Iraq will never again be able to use weapons of mass destruction against their own people or its neighbours. They will never be able to do it again. They will never be able to threaten their neighbours and the world again, either directly or indirectly.
We know that terrorist organisations are looking for weapons of mass destruction. The enormous success we have had in aggressively countering the proliferation of those weapons systems is now yielding some results in Libya, Iran, North Korea and Syria. To one degree or another—and it varies a bit from country to country—we are beginning to achieve things. We are proud of the role Australia has played, often quite a leading role, in prosecuting this agenda and prosecuting it very successfully. In terms of al-Qaeda, 3,000 terrorist suspects worldwide have been either detained or killed. Sixty-five per cent of al-Qaeda leaders—not Osama bin Laden or Mullah Omar but others—have been detained or, in some cases, killed. We have contributed to the detention of around 200 Jemaah Islamiah suspects. Hambali, the chief executive officer of Jemaah Islamiah, the South-East Asian counterpart of al-Qaeda, has been captured and $US200 million worth of terrorists' assets have been frozen.
Domestically, the government have strengthened our counterterrorism measures. Very importantly, we work very closely with our friends and neighbours in the region. I co-hosted with the Indonesian foreign minister the counter-terrorism meeting in Bali on 4 February. We set up the Jakarta centre for law enforcement cooperation. Since 9-11, we have signed nine bilateral memoranda of understanding on counterterrorism with Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Fiji, Cambodia, East Timor, India and Papua New Guinea. The Leader of the Opposition did not mention any of those things in his speech. He never mentioned them—as though those things had never happened and are of no importance. To be fair, I would not have thought he would have a clue that those things had happened. The work that was done in the Bali investigation was an outstanding achievement.
Australia's leadership on these issues must remain. More than that, there must be great unity in the international effort to counter terrorism and terrorists, wherever they may be—Afghanistan, Iraq, Europe, as we saw in Madrid, or in South-East Asia. The only way to deal with these terrorists internationally is from a position of unity, and we all have to be prepared to make a contribution. I think that view is recognised around the globe. I think it is recognised by many people in the Australian Labor Party, but I do not think the Leader of the Opposition understands the issues. That gets to the heart of the Leader of the Opposition; I do not think he really understands what the issues at stake really are. Michael Howard, the opposition leader in the United Kingdom, said:
Countries cannot insulate themselves from terrorist attack by opting out of the War on Terror. We cannot buy ourselves immunity by changing our foreign policy. Apart from the moral cowardice of that position, it can never work in practice.
I think that is a very important statement, because Michael Howard is making it clear that, for all the disagreements he may have with Tony Blair, the opposition and the government in Britain are sticking together on these issues.
It is a very sad thing that, apparently without even consideration by the shadow cabinet, on the Mike Carlton show on 2UE, the Leader of the Opposition suddenly decided that that is not such a good idea. In the wake of the Madrid bombing, I would not have thought that that showed good or wise judgment. As I have said on many occasions over the last couple of days, we ask that the Leader of the Opposition think through the issues a bit more and get himself properly briefed. He has refused to have briefings. He has now decided to dig in; he definitely does not want any briefings. But he should get himself briefed and get to understand the issues. Once he understands the issues he will be able to develop his arguments and thoughts more coherently rather than stand at the dispatch box with the usual fusillade of opposition abuse about the government. You have to make an argument, not just tell everybody what fools people in the government are. You have to have an argument to put together. Mrs Yoriko Kawaguchi, the foreign minister of Japan, said:
Caving in to threats will be just what the terrorists want. The international community needs to show that it is united in facing this threat.
I thought that Andrew Sullivan from the Sunday Times of 21 March made a very important point. I quote it to the House because it is worth considering. He said:
Nothing threatens al Qaeda or the Islamo-fascist terror network more than the possibility of ... constitutional democracy in Iraq. If Iraq succeeds, the entire dysfunction in the Middle East on which al Qaeda relies for its recruitment and growth would be in danger of unraveling. If Iraqis can achieve a semblance of a free and democratic society—with economic growth, political pluralism and religious freedom—then the al Qaeda model of theocratic fascism will lose whatever appeal it now has in that part of the world. Losing Afghanistan was bad enough for the Jihadists. 
That is a very important, significant statement by Andrew Sullivan, and the House should reflect on his words. Afghanistan and Iraq are great examples of what can be achieved in the Middle East. Islamo-fascism and dictatorship have been overthrown in those countries. Democracy is now beginning to be put in place in both of those countries. There is a way to go but democracy is on its way. I think we should do everything we can to support that and to resist the terrorists, particularly al-Qaeda and al-Qaeda related terrorists in Iraq—they are attacking not just coalition troops but also Iraqis—in order to ensure that the democratic processes in Iraq can take root so that those people can have what they want to achieve. If we can be successful, that will be an enormous strike against terrorism.
That brings me to what the Leader of the Opposition has been doing in the last few days. I think it is very sad that he has decided to try to politicise our troops in Iraq. I do not think that is necessary. I do not think that is going to be a great election-losing or election-winning position. This is not something that we should debate in the context of elections, particularly after what we have seen happen in Madrid. This is something we should think about very carefully. But it is part of a pattern in the way the Leader of the Opposition handles international relations issues. I accept that he does not know much about them—in which case I would have thought that he would tread carefully—but when we announced that we had negotiated a free trade agreement with America, his knee-jerk reaction was that he was opposed to it and would vote against it. In relation to Hicks and Habib, he floated the idea—he got away with this a bit, I thought, in the media—of retrospective criminal law so that Hicks and Habib could be prosecuted for a crime which is retrospectively applied. He now thinks that we should have a great big party political debate about our 850 or so troops in Iraq who are fighting off terrorists, or at least are contributing to those who are fighting off terrorists there, and protecting Australians who are in our embassy there.
I do not think that any of us will forget 3 December last year. It is a day that will go down in history. On 3 December the Leader of the Opposition had a press conference in the Labor Party caucus room and wrapped himself in the American flag. I think it is the first time in either the coalition party room or the Labor Party caucus room that the American flag has appeared. After all his anti-Americanism he decided that it was doing him political damage so, with the American flag there, he had a press conference, saying he loved America. Interestingly, it was also the same day that he went on the radio and, when he was asked about the troops in Iraq, said:
Well I have got to get briefings from Foreign Affairs and from the Defence department about the detail. I can't fly in with a top of the head assessment, I have got to base my judgments on fact ... I have obviously got to get those sort of briefings before I can make any sort of considered judgment about what needs to be done.
But he never sought the briefings. Why didn't he seek the briefings? He wanted briefings from Foreign Affairs and Defence. He didn't even ask for them. Then he came up with a policy. By the way, I do not know whether the policy has even gone to the shadow cabinet or to the caucus. 
—Don't they tell you?
—The member for Griffith does not support it—we know that from his letter. On 17 November the member for Griffith said:
We should put our shoulder to the wheel in an effort to build a new Iraq.
But the Leader of the Opposition says that we should cut and run. 
Let me finally make this point: there are 35 countries which have troops in Iraq. Australia is an important country—Australia is not a little country; it is a significant country. New Zealand is one of the countries that have troops in Iraq. There is a debate about Spain, the Spanish election and the commitment of the Spanish Socialist Party to withdraw troops. As the Leader of the Opposition probably does not know but as many in the House will know, during the state funeral for the victims of the Madrid bombing, people like Colin Powell and Tony Blair had been meeting with the Prime Minister designate of Spain and pleading with him to reconsider his position on withdrawing troops from Iraq. He says that he will keep them there if there is a new UN resolution. That is an issue that needs to be played out. One of the key countries out of those 35 has an opposition leader who says, `We will withdraw the troops unconditionally.' The Leader of the Opposition's position on this issue is very untimely. It will play out internationally—people will notice this internationally. It will not be well received, not just by the Americans or the British—we can make jokes about them and how bad they all are and make jokes about the way they speak and the comments they make—but by other countries—
—We make jokes about the way you speak.
—Okay, you make jokes about the way I speak. We used to be a multicultural society, but now the Labor Party says that you have to speak in a particular way. How very childish.

"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,2004-03-25,"—Mr Speaker, you would no doubt have noticed that I was absent from the House on the last two days of the previous sitting week. In what I hope has created a precedent, I was most grateful that the Chief Opposition Whip granted me what I would like to call grandparenting leave. On 26 February, my daughter Rebecca gave birth to my first grandchild—a healthy baby boy, Liam Geoffrey Hunt. Rebecca's husband, Chris, helped out for the first week after the new baby came home from hospital, but like many young couples with a mortgage to pay he needed to get back to his workplace.
The first few weeks after giving birth can be a difficult time for a new mother, and extended family support is often needed at this time. Grandmothers are usually the first to offer assistance and, from my own experience as a new mother, they have a critical role to play. So it did not surprise me to read of the findings of a study by a Finnish university that grandmothers do play a vital role in improving the chances of grandchildren surviving to adulthood and having children of their own. Deborah Smith, the science editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, described the findings as helping to solve the puzzle of why humans are rare among animals in living well beyond child-bearing age. She said:
They provide the first strong evidence for an explanation of the mystery known as the “grandmother hypothesis”—that life after menopause evolved because older woman can pass on their genes more effectively by helping raise their grandchildren, than by having more children themselves.
The grandmother hypothesis, developed by the University of Utah's Professor Kirsten Hawkes, observes that human babies are unusual because they cannot feed themselves at weaning age. We grandmothers—and I should on behalf of my own mother, Lois Welsh, add great-grandmothers—know that we are important, but here we have scientific proof that we are the saviours of the human species. That makes us responsible for the ageing population and the need for the Treasurer's intergenerational reports.
The Treasurer has found a way to solve the problem. Instead of allowing grandmothers to help out with the raising of children, he wants us to work until we drop. But, as the study published in the journal Nature observed: if a woman over 50 was still alive when her children were producing, they had more children and they produced them about 2½ years earlier than families without a grandmother. So, at a time when we are concerned about Australia's declining birthrate and the older age at which Australian mothers are having their first child, we might consider the role of grandmothers.
We should remember that we are increasing the pension age for women to 65 and that family friendly work practices are rarely extended to grandparents. The present trend for grandparents to move up the coast and leave their grandchildren behind cannot be helpful either. It is time we took stock of our family relationships and how important for society these relationships are. We need to see ourselves as members of society, not as units of the economy, and to see the importance of these relationships. Fourteen per cent of Australian mothers suffer significant postnatal depression and a further 30 per cent suffer milder distress. Extended family can provide vital support to children and allow more effective treatment for sufferers of postnatal depression. I am pleased to add that the family and community affairs committee's recent report on children of separated families called for a greater role for grandparents in the child's relationship. So, before calling on grandparents to work until they drop, the Treasurer should consider the vital role of grandparents. The survival of the species depends on them. Welcome to the world and to our family, Liam Geoffrey Hunt.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Health and Ageing: Grandparents</title>,Adjournment,19,1
"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2004-03-25,"—I rise on a very important matter, not only to my electorate but also to many country electorates—and I notice that there are a few representatives from country electorates here today—and it is the fuel increase that is going to occur in the next couple of years due to the promise by the government to remove the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme. The Fuel Sales Grants Scheme was put in place to alleviate the inequity of the application of the GST back in 2001 and to compensate country people for the iniquitous application of the GST.
I will just give a very brief example. In some country towns the price of fuel would have been about 90c a litre and in some cities the price of fuel would have been around 70c a litre, so obviously a 10 per cent application of the GST would make a discrepancy of 2c a litre. At that time the government quite rightly put into place a grants scheme which removed that inequity. A number of comments were made at the time which, just for the record, I would like put into Hansard. The President of the National Farmers Federation at the time, Ian Donges, who is a friend of mine—and I am very disappointed to hear that the National Farmers Federation are actually supporting the removal of this scheme at the moment; I cannot believe that an organisation such as that would be in favour of higher prices of fuel for country people, as they have recently suggested—said:
The effect of high fuel excise taxes has long been an impediment to rural businesses and rural communities, so the new grants scheme—
that is, the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme—
will be a significant commitment by the government.
He said it:
... will help reduce the unfair price differential between metropolitan and rural prices.
The Treasurer, Peter Costello, was interviewed at the time by John Laws. Mr Laws asked:
Do you still believe that there are limits to compensating country people for the GST hike in fuel?
The Treasurer said:
No, no. What I've said in this, the Government policy is, the excise will be reduced so that with the application of GST the price is the same. And that has to be done according to the Constitution, that's what I said. That has to be done according to the Constitution. But I'm pretty confident that we have now got a Constitutional scheme which will accomplish that.
What he is referring to is the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme. Also at that time, when questioned on this on a Brisbane radio station, the Prime Minister said:
Yes but the subsidy scheme—
meaning the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme—
that we introduced last year—

"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,2004-03-25,"—The Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Electronic Delivery) Bill 2004 provides for the electronic receipt of many communications with the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Veterans' Review Board, the Repatriation Medical Authority and the Specialist Medical Review Council. The bill gives those electronic communications legal status. At the same time, the bill regularises and standardises the form, language and processes of those communications.
Until this bill, all communications with respect to claims and lodgment of documents with DVA and its agencies had been exempted from the provisions of the Electronic Transactions Act. This act required the electronic communications with the Commonwealth to be given legal status. In making the provisions needed to bring veterans' matters in line, the opportunity has been taken to standardise processes, form and language in the principal act. These changes affect claims for most benefits, advice, applications for reviews, change of circumstances, withdrawals and most other communications between veterans and DVAs. The bill is therefore purely technical with significant housekeeping by way of simplification and standardisation. It is therefore supported.
As we know, the Veterans' Entitlements Act is a very complex piece of legislation. It has many unique characteristics which have evolved over 85 years of operation. Needless to say providing for electronic communication in an act designed only for pen and paper is a dramatic change. However, it is not only the act which needs to be changed. Changes such as this dramatically affect internal departmental processes. It assumes that all electronic systems have the capacity to handle electronic communication—which some do not. It assumes that record keeping of electronic communications is also possible. It assumes that the veteran clients also want to do business this way—which some do. Certainly, in the modern world, this type of communication is very efficient. In the future we can expect the majority of business to be transacted in this way. So to that extent this bill is an inevitable sign of that process. It is also a sign that veterans' business is not going to diminish. While ever we have defence forces we will have conditions of service providing for those unfortunate enough to be injured or to require treatment as a result of their service. It is important that they be delivered as efficiently as possible.
It is important for another major reason: record keeping and access to records from Defence are notoriously bad. Many ex-service people have been thwarted in their claims for benefits because paper records have been lost or mislaid. In fact, the keeping of personal health records by Defence is a disaster. It can only be hoped that, as the electronic route becomes established, with agreed and standard protocols, it will cease to be an issue for the future.
Having dealt with the technical aspects of the bill, I want to touch on another issue of importance to the veteran community. I want to bring before the committee the case which is being pursued by retired Lieutenant Colonel Jim Bourke, who heads up an organisation called Operation Aussies Home. He has recently written to me, and I want to read part of the letter into the committee records and make a plea to the government, and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs particularly, to have a look at what this organisation is about. 
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Cowan, there are other forms of the House  in which to read a letter into the Hansard. I am wondering what that has to do with the bill before the House.
—This is an issue relating to the veterans community. Traditionally, debates in this place on veterans' issues have been very wide ranging, and I would think that you would at least give me the opportunity to introduce this matter.
—I am not denying the member the right, but I am saying that, under the rules of the House, you have to be relevant to the bill before the House. There are other forms of the House.
—This is a veterans' issue and I would argue strongly that it is very relevant to veterans' legislation.
—I have to tie it in. Is it to do with the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Electronic Delivery) Bill 2004?
—It is to do with communication. It is interesting: if you are going to apply a very narrow interpretation of how we deal with this bill to me, then you are going to have a lot of difficulty with the other members who are due to speak on this issue because I know that the issues they want to raise are very wide ranging and of interest to the veterans community.
—The member for Cowan can rest assured that every member will be dealt with the same. I will listen to what you have to say, but I remind you that there is a bill before the House and you have to be relevant to the bill.
—I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for that very narrow approach and very narrow ruling.
—If the member for Cowan wants to reflect upon the chair, then I will deal with him.
—I might say it is not the first time you have tried to curtail me in this place when we are debating legislation to do with veterans.
—The member for Cowan can put what reflection he likes. I am dealing with the standing orders—
—What I am saying to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that you are dealing with this in a very narrow way, which will inhibit, in my view—
—If the member for Cowan wants to debate the chair, I will sit him down.
—I am already sitting down.
—He will continue to speak on the bill and he will connect what he has to say with the bill.
—I very much want to connect this to the bill because it does indeed go to communication and it relates to a problem of communication which this group of veterans working under Operation Aussies Home is having in communicating with the government and with the minister. I might say it is a very non-contentious issue which I am seeking to deal with. There are other forms by which it can be dealt with and other more political forms by which it can be dealt with, but I do not want to do that. I simply want to bring to the attention—
—I remind the member for Cowan: if he thinks he is going to threaten the chair, he should think again. I am just dealing with the forms of the House at the present time. If he wants to threaten the chair, I will sit him down.
—I have no intention of threatening the chair. What I am simply trying to do is to state a case for a group of veterans who are having problems communicating with the government. I will read the letter and you can make your own mind up, Mr Deputy Speaker:
Dear Mr Edwards,
...	...	...
I am writing to you for your advice as to how I may be able to encourage the government to take action to engage the US agencies to carry out some in-country investigation re our six men left in Vietnam. We, OPERATION AUSSIES HOME, have done some in-country work and may have had some success regarding one of the six cases—further details to follow once we have confirmed a few items. 
As you are aware, I do not want this issue to become a political football ... but I have given up trying to progress this issue logically and quietly with the government ...
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on point of order. As much as I respect the member for Cowan and what he has to say, there are other places in the House where you can do that sort of thing. You can put it in the adjournment debate or put it in a question on notice. I do not believe that this legislation—
—I have the point of order. Member for Cowan, I have just been looking through the schedule and the bill and really it has nothing to do with what you are trying to put into the record. You can do it in the adjournment debate or in a grievance debate. There are forms of the House, if you want to get it into the record, which are quite relevant, but this particular bill is not.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I accept your ruling with some concern because I have listened to many debates in this place—indeed I have taken part in many debates—on veterans' issues and there has always been a licence to allow members, when they are bringing issues of concern to the veteran community, to do that in what has always been considered a fairly wide-ranging debate.
—It depends on the title of the bill. Some bills are wide ranging.

"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,2004-03-25,"—I am pleased to speak on matters pertaining to the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Electronic Delivery) Bill 2004 and I am disappointed that the member opposite chose to raise those other issues. The letter that he quoted said that the people writing the letter did not want the matter to become a political football, so I do not know why the member opposite chose to make it a political football by bringing it to this occasion.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order that goes to relevance. I wonder exactly what the member is saying has to do with the bill.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—I do not think it has much to do with the bill, but in fact the member for Cowan did raise the issues and he is replying. I ask the member for Blair to get back to the bill.
—As I said, I do want to speak specifically in relation to the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Electronic Delivery) Bill 2004. This government is committed to ensuring its services are kept up to date with modern technology and it has long demonstrated this commitment. This bill is designed to facilitate the provision of veterans' entitlements and veterans' services via the Internet so that veterans can pass their queries through a system that is very convenient. 
I would like to point out just how convenient the Web can be, not only for veterans but also for the general community. This is a system that enables people to complete and lodge forms from their own lounge room or bedroom or wherever they have those facilities. I do not think it would displease members to think that veterans should be entitled to this kind of service too. As the member opposite discussed in the early part of his speech, many veterans do avail themselves of access to the Internet. I have quite a few people in my electorate who do that—for example, Don and Ronda Herrmann. Ronda, in particular, has some illnesses that make it very difficult for her to go outside. This is the case for many vets too. If that is the case, how do you then go in and complete all these forms, get all this paperwork done and access the services of the department? Ronda is not a veteran, but she is an older member of the community who likes to be involved in community activities. She is able to use the Internet to contribute to the community and be practically as active as she has ever been in her life, and the veterans community is able to do that too under this bill.
The idea that you should have to pick up a piece of paper and scribble your name, your submission and everything on it in order to access government services is really an outmoded view, I think. We now have a situation where plenty of people can do it simply by tapping on a couple of keys and that submission goes immediately into the system. You do not have to hop into your car or, if you are disabled, call up your neighbour, get in their car, go all the way into town and make your submission; you can do it instantly. One of the immediate advantages that flows out of that is that your form is lodged straightaway. The time that it takes you to get into town or post the letter is not part of the issue. Through this, you get immediate lodgment. This is, of course, a much improved situation.
In December 1997 the Prime Minister released a statement entitled Investing for growth: government commitment to online services, and this bill is another example of the government's modernising and updating of the system to make it as convenient and practicable as possible for Australians. It is the next step in upgrading technological delivery of government services. I welcome this application of technology. The Veterans' Entitlements Act may be 85 years young, but it can be improved all the time. This is another way in which we do it. In my community of Ipswich, Dr Hilda des Arts, who has unfortunately passed on, really pioneered the application of IT and its benefits in the seniors context. She was a pioneer of the group known as SeniorNet—
A division having been called in the House of Representatives—
Sitting suspended from 10.13 a.m. to 10.24 a.m.
—I was saying before the suspension that really this is a step in a process where we are providing greater technological delivery of government services. It is an important opportunity not only to communicate better with the community but to ensure that government is provided in a more efficient way. The efficiencies that are created when, for example, we move to electronic lodgment are quite significant. It is something that we must keep very closely focused on. Every time we move from all this paper shuffling to an electronic document that is able to be filed directly, we create an opportunity for savings in effort by the public servants whom we employ to carry out these duties. I think it is important that we continually review, review and review to ensure that the benefits of that are then passed on.
As the member for Cowan said, there are people who seek to lodge documents electronically, but there are also people who do not. We do not want those people to be disadvantaged by the fact that they are still tied to paper documents. Perhaps they are in a more remote location or are on a tougher wicket. What I am saying here today is that by making savings through the use of electronic lodgment we can then redirect those savings to provide better services to the ones who need it. They are the ones who are more disadvantaged. They are the ones who do not have a computer and probably will never own one. They probably would not want one if we went and gave it to them. That is a fact.
We need to continually review and take those savings. It is not just a matter of having a bureaucracy that remains constant or continues to grow in size and continually taking away work from it by providing for electronic lodgment and improved technology. We have to look at it and say, `Do we need such a big bureaucracy? Can we reduce or can we redirect that to provide a better service?' Veterans definitely demand good service. They have provided services to our country and they expect services in return. I think that, by engaging in this good practice, the government is providing that improved service.
The services, the range of opportunities that veterans are able to access through the government, are getting larger all the time. We have seen another example of that in the new entitlements that have just been provided by the government in response to the Clarke report. They will be accessible through electronic lodgment. The government is now moving to index above the general rate component of the disability pension by MTAWE—that is, male total average weekly earnings—or CPI, whichever is the greater. There are 45,000 beneficiaries of that. Half of them, about 28,000, are TPI veterans. The rest include 14,500 veterans on the extremely disabled adjustment rate and 1,000 on the intermediate rate. So there you are. I think it would be difficult to say that increased efficiencies are totally responsible for providing the money that is available to the TPI people in those categories, but they are a factor. By providing increased efficiencies we are improving the capacity of the government, of the taxpayers, to make things better for veterans.
It is likewise with rent assistance. Recommendation 83 of the Clarke report stated that rent assistance should be provided in addition to the existing war widows pension and income support supplement. The number of widows affected by that is 11,500. Some of them will be able to access that through the use of electronic forms on the Internet, and that will make it much easier for them. By engaging in that process and realising the savings, there will be more opportunities down the track to extend benefits such as rent assistance to a wider number of people.
Similarly, in recommendation 91 of the Clarke report, it says that the maximum funeral benefit should be increased to $1,000. The government has moved on that and it has moved on rent assistance. All of these things will be able to be accessed by people using the electronic measures that I have spoken about. This is not inconsequential. The member opposite might laugh—
—No, I am just laughing about the wide-ranging debate we are now having.
—No, it is not a wide-ranging debate—I am talking about the ability of people, through electronic lodgment now, to access a wider range of government services. Why is there a wider range of government services? Because we have achieved greater efficiencies by providing things such as electronic lodgment. I welcome this. I think that it is significant. I am pleased that the government are providing that increased range of services and it is important that we continue to do so. So, by being more efficient, we are able to provide a better range of services.
One thing that concerns me is whether or not we are able to continue doing that. It is most important that the government remain focused on the needs of veterans. As I said before, these are people who have made their contribution to Australian society. They have helped to make Australia a much better place and, for that, all Australians are greatly appreciative. It is important that the government maintain the focus and I am pleased that I am part of a government that does that. Long may that be so and long may we keep that focus.
This bill will allow veterans the flexibility that comes with the technology of online lodgment. The government is expanding the options available to our veterans and making the processes as simple as possible. It allows for the better delivery of repatriation services. It allows our veterans to have online access to information and services. This is particularly important in regional areas such as those that I represent. It breaks down the distances and gives people immediate access to information and services. As I said, by providing savings, it also creates the opportunity for us to improve services to those who are unable, unwilling or whatever to get involved in the electronic age. It does mean that we can reach out to everyone by using these devices. Applications, claims and other documents can be lodged electronically or by mail or in person.
The bill builds on a successful trial held in Tasmania, which I know will be very much of interest to the member for Franklin. That trial conducted by the government demonstrated the efficacy of electronic lodgments. So, even in Tasmania and every other rural part of Australia, we are able to take advantage of this change. It is an important one. Our repatriation system is keeping pace with online technology. It is another example of the government's commitment to improving service delivery and technology. As I said, the Veterans' Entitlements Act has been in operation for 85 years. The government is focused on the need for continuous reform in this area and for providing improved benefits and improved means of delivery. For that I am very appreciative. I commend the bill to the House and urge members and those within the veteran community to maintain their focus on improving the process of service delivery to our veterans.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (ELECTRONIC DELIVERY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Quick, Harry, MP",ALP,2004-03-25,"—I was not intending to speak on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Electronic Delivery) Bill 2004 but I had a father who was an original Anzac and a mum who was a war widow, who passed away recently. Also, I have a few veterans having a few hassles. So I thought I would take this opportunity firstly to congratulate the government on this initiative. As the honourable member for Blair said, it is the result of a successful trial in Tasmania with the Department of Veterans' Affairs. As representatives of that state, the honourable Deputy Speaker Adams and I are always of the mind that lots of things should be trialled in Tasmania. We have a population of 470,000 and it has been a pretty sedentary population up until recent times. Things can be trialled rather successfully down there because of the networks. So I congratulate the Tasmanian Department of Veterans' Affairs.
I would also like to compliment the department on the level of service they provide to the many veterans and war widows in Tasmania. They do an excellent job. Occasionally there are a few concerns about communication, which I hope to raise in this brief speech today. The second reading speech of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs stated:
This bill marks the next step in the government's ongoing program of improvements to the delivery of services to the veteran community. It builds on the commitment to the use of new technologies in veteran service delivery ...
It goes on about lodging information electronically. I would be interested to hear from the minister what percentage of information is lodged electronically currently and what percentage is expected as a norm and average once this has been up and running for a few years. As we journey through life we will see veterans age and pass away. I would like to know whether there is an expectation on the part of DVA that total communication with veterans will be done electronically. The young veterans who served in the gulf wars of 1991 and 2003 are used to having computers at home and at work. Will this be the modern trend? 
I ask this question because, as I said, my father was an Anzac veteran and amongst my collection of memorabilia is his very first RSL badge. He told me of the hassles and trials and tribulations of veterans when they came back from the First World War and how that built up to the successful and wonderful movement that we all acknowledge today, the RSL. Those were a couple of questions that immediately came to my mind.
Talking of communication, which is mentioned in great detail in the act, one of the things that does worry me about the service for veterans, especially in remote rural and regional areas such as the ones that the member for Lyons and I represent, is that quite often communication with government departments is through 13 numbers and 1800 numbers. I know that my late mother, who lived over 300 kilometres from Melbourne, had to communicate with the Department of Veterans' Affairs in Melbourne. I am interested to know how all this is going to change. 
Senators and members have a way of bypassing that by having the direct numbers of state managers of various departments. If we come across blockages in the system or see inequities or injustices, we can pick up the phone and ring the state manager of DVA, Centrelink or the Child Support Agency, and we can weave our way through the bureaucracy. But many of our veterans from the Second World War are now in their 90s and I know that people of that age have a fear of administration and bureaucracy and they are reluctant to push themselves forward. They have come from a different generation. I am thinking of a couple of 91-year-old veterans who are very close to me—almost second fathers—who have had hassles with DVA about getting taxis, changes to payments, access to the gold card and those sorts of things. Rather than pursuing things with DVA, they will say: `Okay, that's life. I have been used to hardship. I won't really push it any further.' We have a couple of groups—we have the old diggers from the Second World War, as I said, in their late 80s and early 90s; we have the Korean, Malaysian and Vietnam veterans, and now we have the Gulf War veterans.
What I am trying to say is that, if there is going to be a simplification of information one way and information the other way, I think it is a wonderful idea. As I said—and I am not sure whether the departmental people heard me before—for lots of people the 13 and the 1800 numbers are a bit of a turn-off. Communication is a two-way thing, and veterans expect nothing less, and I think they deserve nothing less, than the best.
I want to raise a couple of issues that relate to this whole communication thing. Just recently I congratulated the government for their recent announcement, when they sorted out the mess over the Clarke report, that the 13 Korean POWs, or their widows, have got their $25,000 ex gratia payment. I congratulate the government for that initiative. But I would also like to raise the issue of those World War II veterans who were in the European theatre, who were POWs and who still have not got anything. The 91-year-old I have been talking about today is a real person who spent 4½ years in absolutely appalling conditions in German POW camps. As someone with a wife whose family is Lithuanian, I have heard first-hand about the conditions that even the local people experienced in the latter part of the war, with German and Russian involvement in those critical areas. I know for a fact, having spoken to Jack Shepherd and his cobber, that they did experience things—not as bad as the Japanese POWs but, I can assure you, just as bad and horrific as the Korean POWs. They are not going to be with us much longer, and I think they deserve the $25,000 ex gratia payment.
Finally, in relation to this idea of communication and the introduction of electronic disclosure and consolidation of information, I would like to talk about the Smith family who were overpaid. I have spoken to the minister personally about it, but there was nothing she could do. The Smith's failure to notify of an overpayment was a genuine mistake on their part, but they did the right thing when the DVA came to them and said, `You owe us a whole lot of money.' They sat down with the DVA and said: `We can't pay it; we're pensioners. I'm a veteran; my wife doesn't work. We've got medical conditions. Take some money out of our pension. That's the only way we can repay you.' The DVA said, `Yes, fine.' So they signed an agreement and it was put into the system. The Smiths were able to relax and think: `We're going to live off less. We've made a genuine mistake. There has been a failure to notify on our part, but we feel happy that the matter has been resolved.' Then, out of the blue, the DPP sent them a notice to appear at the Magistrate's Court, and they are going to be sentenced next week. God knows what is going to happen. As I said, their health is poor. I went to the minister and the minister said, `I can't intervene,' and I can understand that. But, if there has been a genuine mistake—and, following an arrangement, a communication, between the department and the recipient of the DVA benefit, money is being taken out to repay the debt—why in the name of creation are we going to punish a veteran and his wife by dragging them through a court in Hobart and potentially jailing them? Communication is a wonderful thing. If we get it right, everybody benefits.
The communication trial in Tasmania worked wonderfully well. I compliment the minister on the initiative. This is a simple bill but, as I said at the outset, it is part of this progression. We are now moving on to information stored on wonderful computers. I hope that the DVA does not experience some of the things we experienced a couple of weeks ago in this place when the whole system fell apart and we could not communicate with our offices, nor our offices with us, and we could not access speeches and documentation or recall information; the whole world fell apart. I am delighted to speak on this bill. I congratulate the minister and the government on the next step in the process. If the few queries I have raised today have been noted by departmental officials and can be addressed, I would be delighted. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (ELECTRONIC DELIVERY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2004-03-25,"—It is a pleasure to speak in the debate on such an important piece of legislation as the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Electronic Delivery) Bill 2004. I have the home of the 10th Light Horse Brigade in my electorate. The brigade has a wonderful history and those wonderful people are keeping those traditions alive. It is always a great privilege for me to be able to stand and speak in the chamber on any bill to do with veterans.
The debate on this bill comes very soon after the government's response to the Clarke report. I notice that my honourable friend the member for Franklin referred to the good outcome of that—finally. It was a good outcome. I know that the veterans in my electorate are very pleased with the response of an additional funding of $267 million and with the acceptance of many of the 109 recommendations in the report.
I particularly welcome the decision to link the portion of the TPI and disability benefits of the general rate to the male average weekly earnings in a similar fashion as for the service pension. I suppose that has to do with the bill in that these new programs—the electronic transaction programs—can deliver services to veterans much more efficiently online. That applies to lodgments and assessment, and people will have plenty of access via these services. 
The member for Blair mentioned a point that relates to me as well. I have an electorate of 25,000 square kilometres or so, much of which is in rural, regional and certainly outer metropolitan areas. Being able to use online services is a great boon for many veterans. While I acknowledge that some of them are still a little uncertain about this new method of accessing services, many of them are embracing it in increasing numbers. It reminds me of my dear late father who passed away last August. He embraced the new technology in his 80s with great enthusiasm. He could do everything and he could teach us lots about how to access services online. My dad passed away last year. He was 89. He had just the most wonderful time. He could not stay away from the computer. He was doing absolutely everything on it. I think lots of people in the community are getting involved and, through the Minister for Ageing, I know that we have federal programs to help older people learn to use the new computer technology. In that respect, this bill is very timely. People in the rural, regional and outer metropolitan areas of Pearce will have a much easier form of access. Being able to transact by email and perform other functions on the computer is a boon, especially to some of the older veterans or those who have mobility problems, of whom there are quite a few. It is a great thing. 
To return momentarily to the government's response to the Clarke report, Clarke recognises those veterans who can no longer work because of service disabilities. As I said, some of those with service related disabilities have mobility problems and this bill goes to the heart of making access to services much easier. There is an economic loss component in disability pensions. Because of the disability, there is loss of potential earnings and so on. The Clarke report recognised this when it decided to change the way the pensions were indexed for the TPIs and people with a disability. In addition, 11,000 war widows and widowers will receive increases in their income support payments as well. Now they will be able to manage this on line. There are many benefits arising from the response to the Clarke report. I must say they are very welcome changes.
Over the summer break I had the pleasure of meeting with Mr Bill Gaynor, the President of the RSL in Western Australia, and Mr Ross O'Connor, the Vice-President of the RSL in WA. They contacted me with regard to the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill 2003, which I think is currently in the Senate. We discussed that, the Clarke report and matters of general concern to the veteran community. I greatly value the kind of representations that were made. They were constructive and they went to the heart of matters, and there were many sensible suggestions made to improve the outcome of both the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill and the Clarke report.
We have a very active veteran community in Pearce. In fact, on Australia Day this year the 10th Light Horse Brigade put on a fantastic display in one of my little country towns, which is basically a one-pub town, called Spencers Brook. They keep that tradition alive. It is really fantastic. They have a museum, which they tour around country shows so that some of our young people can gain a greater appreciation of our history and of what happened in those times. An enormous effort goes into liaising with schools and local communities to ensure that the tradition of Anzac Day is observed. I very much value and appreciate my relationship with our veterans and those who are leading the veterans in Western Australia.
In our contemporary world, we now operate substantially, both commercially and socially, via electronic media. People of all ages, from all parts of the globe, now communicate socially or for business via the Internet. Many of us are resistant—and I have to confess I was one of them—to making the changes. I suppose it is through fear. Our children and grandchildren now grow up around computers. It is nothing for them. My six-year-old and my eight-year-old can teach me a thing or two on the computer, I can tell you! But, although there are those who have resisted the change, especially those from the older generation, because they do not understand the technology, there are still a lot in the older generation who have embraced this new technology and who feel quite liberated being able to communicate widely. I have quite a few people in my electorate who belong to the University of the Third Age. I know they use the computer to study, to shop, to do their banking and so on. So they are pretty up with it.
Many have recognised the great benefits that come from electronic communication. In 1997 our Prime Minister released a policy statement called `Investing in growth', which outlined the Australian government's commitment to putting all appropriate services online. This gave rise to the parliament passing the Electronic Transactions Act 1999. The Electronic Transactions Act removed legal impediments that may have prevented people from using electronic communications in conducting business with the Commonwealth. It essentially gave validity to transactions that took place via electronic communication.
There did, however, remain a number of exemptions. In 2001, the Repatriation Commission advised the minister that certain provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act would require exemption from the effects of the Electronic Transactions Act 1999. The exemptions entitled the Department of Veterans' Affairs not to accept claims delivered to the department electronically. As with any major technological change, it really is important to ensure a smooth transition and have adequate time to make necessary changes so that the electronic claims and documents can be developed appropriately. There are good legal reasons for it, but also it is important that the community have time to adjust to a new system. 
Under this legislation, a unified system is designed to allow both electronic and physical delivery of documents into the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I think it is very important that we allow time for people to become accustomed to electronic transactions and allow both systems to operate together for the foreseeable future at least. So those people who are not comfortable with electronic communications are still able to lodge their documents personally.
As with most transactions, there is a need to have clarity as to what makes lodgment effective. Subsection 5T(3), for example, provides that a claim, application, request or other document that has been approved for electronic lodgment will be taken to have been lodged at the office of the Department of Veterans' Affairs if it is transmitted electronically in the approved manner. The document received at the electronic address will be taken to have been lodged on the day that it has been received. These are the kinds of technical aspects to this bill that are important in a legal sense. The amendments will apply to the lodgment of claims, applications, requests and other documents under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and will not apply to any other information that is received by the department.
The successful trial has already been talked about. It happened in Tasmania, the home state of our colleague the member for Franklin. This bill is another step forward in implementing the government's program of improving service delivery and ensures the repatriation system keeps up with electronic services. The member for Franklin asked whether the Minister for Veterans' Affairs was able to provide any figures on how many people make electronic lodgments to the department. Of course, that has not been possible in the past because they have not been offered electronic transactions. This bill will give effect to an ability to do electronic transactions, but I understand from the department that, during the voluntary trial, 22 per cent of people volunteered to use electronic transactions. I think that is a very positive number for a first-off trial of electronic transactions within the veteran community. I am sure we will see that number grow.
As I said, I know that our Minister for Ageing has programs operating to provide funds to train and teach older people how to use computers to transact business electronically. As those kinds of programs become more available and older people take advantage of them, they will be much more comfortable in using the service. The delivery of services to the veteran community is enormously important. I think that whatever can be done to improve the ease with which veterans can lodge documents and conduct their affairs with the department will be very welcome by veterans whether or not they wish to take advantage of the electronic service.
In Western Australia, we deal quite a lot with the WA Department of Veterans' Affairs, because we have quite a big veteran community within the electorate. I have to say that, in all the time I have been there, which is now just over 11 years, we have had nothing but the best of service from the staff. I think they work very hard to provide a really good service. You get the odd hiccup but, by and large, it operates pretty smoothly. So I am very grateful to those people in the WA department.
As I said, we have come a very long way in ensuring a high standard of care for veterans over the years. Some papers that Bill Gaynor gave me contain a quote from Sir George Pearce, after whom my electorate was named. Former senator George Pearce was once the Minister for Defence, and I have Pearce air base in my electorate. His quote takes us back and shows us how far we have come. At the turn of the century, probably just after the First World War, he said: 
One of the saddest spectacles in the past has been to seen men who have been willing to risk their lives in the defence of the country left destitute and the dependants of men who have laid down their lives for the country having to live on charity. ... It would be an eternal disgrace to this young and rich Commonwealth if any of the relatives of those who are going to war had to beg for a living. We desire in this Bill—
he was talking about the first bill that was ever passed—
to make such modest provision as will keep the wolf from the door of those who are unfortunately bereaved of their breadwinners. ... This Bill also provides for a Pension for any man who is disabled or incapacitated so that he cannot earn his living or a living for his wife and family or others dependent on him. 
It is good to read that, because it shows us how far we have come and how important it is to discharge our obligations to people who are prepared to lay down their lives for their country. They are people who, in the course of their duty, may become injured or incapacitated in some way or may lose their lives. I am proud that we have dealt with these benefits in a bipartisan way and that we are all committed to ensuring that our veterans and their families can live their lives with considerable dignity.

"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2004-03-25,"—I am sorry that the member for Franklin had to leave, because I think he would have appreciated the comments that I am going to make. But Deputy Speaker Adams, the member for Lyons—another fine member from Tasmania—is present. I am pleased to see the success of the trial that the Department of Veterans' Affairs undertook in Tasmania. I am pleased because I would like to announce that I am about to become an honorary Tasmanian. On 12 June, my daughter Kylie is going to marry a very fine Tasmanian architect, Hobart's leading up-and-coming architect, Chris Jacobson. On the occasion of their marriage, as Chris's father-in-law, I will become an honorary Tasmanian. Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, I am looking forward to that. 
Back in Townsville, which is my home city, there is no doubt that the veterans' community is electronically literate. Over the past several months veterans have had their voices heard through electronic communication with their federal member of parliament and indeed with members of parliament and governments right across the country. They are no strangers to the use of electronic technology. They are very good at talking among themselves. They have web sites and chat rooms. They have their own groups in which they talk to each other. They are very comfortable with using computer equipment, computer technology and electronic means of communication. It is therefore fortuitous and proper that the government is now moving to enable electronic communication between our veterans around the country and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Because of the provisions in the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Electronic Delivery) Bill 2004 wherever veterans might be throughout the world they will have access to the DVA in a timely manner.
I would like to pay tribute to Kevin Bycroft, the local manager of the DVA in Townsville. I appreciate the assistance that Kevin gives me, my office and my staff with respect to difficult matters that arise. The advice he gives is particularly important. Kevin is able to clear away some of the bureaucratic red tape that sometimes exists when veterans—who, understandably, sometimes do not understand the rules, regulations and procedures—lodge claims with the DVA. Kevin and his people at the DVA in Townsville are just magnificent in their can-do attitude to dealing with problems that arise. Nothing is a problem; there is always a solution. I can say very confidently that my office and the veterans who we all serve and look after very much appreciate the help from that office.
This bill achieves two purposes. It is good to see that it has the support of all the parliament. It is going to unify all the existing lodgement provisions within the VEA, and that can only be a good thing. It is going to allow for both electronic and physical delivery of documents to the DVA. The member for Pearce outlined the importance of maintaining physical delivery of documents, but also the importance of now allowing electronic delivery of documents. The existing provisions require that for a claim, application or other document to be lodged, it must have been sent to the department at an approved address or delivered to a designated person. These amendments will include provisions for such documents to be lodged electronically at an approved address. In my view, the date of lodgement of the document is a very important point. The date that the electronic communication is received is virtually instantaneous from when it was sent, and the date that is recorded in DVA records forms the basis for calculation of benefits once a claim is accepted.
Information provided to the department by telephone will not be subject to these amendments—that is also understandable. The VEA contains a number of provisions that refer to oral communication of information in response to a notice issued by the department. Other provisions will allow for the oral withdrawal of various written applications, and these are unchanged. This bill marks the next step in the government's ongoing program of improvements to the delivery of services to the veteran community. It builds on the commitment to use new technologies in veterans' service delivery and the successful trial in Tasmania to allow veterans to lodge information electronically.
I certainly have put a lot of effort into making sure that we get the best deal for veterans in Townsville and Thuringowa. In the last several months there has been significant interest in changes to entitlements and the way the VEA works. I certainly have had a strong part in all of that and played my role in standing up for veterans in the community. I give a commitment to Townsville veterans that I will continue to stand up for them in the Australian parliament.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (ELECTRONIC DELIVERY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2004-03-25,"—It gives me great pleasure to rise today to speak on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Electronic Delivery) Bill 2004 and to follow the member for Herbert, Peter Lindsay, who does a great job for his constituents in that part of the world who are involved in the armed forces. I know Townsville well and I know that the work he does up there is greatly appreciated by members of the Australian Defence Force. This is an important bill that aims to further develop the delivery of repatriation services to the Australian veteran community. We are in the age of information technology and it is important that we acknowledge and participate in this era. This bill provides for the electronic communication of claims, applications and other documents to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Under these amendments, claimants will now have greater options when lodging forms with the DVA. Instead of using existing methods such as normal mail, telephone, fax or lodgment in person, claimants may now choose to email claims, applications and other documents to an approved electronic address. Veterans will be able to submit forms at any time from their own home or anywhere else where they can access the Internet. Veterans will be able to apply online for services such as a disability pension or a war widows or widowers pension. In addition, veterans may apply for an increase in the disability pension and notify DVA of changes to their circumstances that may affect their pension.
For the purpose of calculating benefits once a claim is accepted, the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, the VEA, relies on the date of lodgment of a document, which is why the amendments are vital. Through online submission, the delivery time of claims will be decreased. Both the electronic and physical delivery of documents into the Department of Veterans' Affairs will be provided for by the amendments inserting a new general lodgment provision. The general lodgment provision grants that a document will be regarded as having been lodged on the date that it was received at an approved place or delivered to an approved person. The electronic communication of all claims, applications and other documents will be possible due to the inclusion in this bill of amendments to all of the lodgment and delivery provisions of the VEA.
Through the amendments, the government is building on the success of the NOVEL program—the networked online veterans electronic lodgment program. The trial pilot offered online services to Tasmanian veterans from September 2002 and was then extended beyond the original four-month period due to the excellent way in which it was received. This bill is consistent with the Australian government's commitment to putting all appropriate government services online and improving the access of all Australians to government information and services at all levels. By providing this online service to the veteran community, we are increasing the availability of online access to information and services, and this will assist in removing the constraints of distance and mobility experienced by regional and rural communities, older Australians, the disabled and the home-bound.
The Howard government is committed to providing for Australian veterans, and this will allow the DVA to better meet the needs of the veterans' community as a whole. Veterans will be able to access a service on a scale previously unimagined. This is not about removing a veteran's right of choice to lodge documents with the DVA using conventional methods such as normal mail, telephone, fax or delivery in person; it is about providing more options to make that choice. The service of online delivery will complement, rather than replace, the traditional means of delivery services.
Importantly, the security risks of providing the service have been addressed. The DVA has developed a secure online communications system which will allow the DVA's service providers and the veteran community to communicate with the department via secure email. Veterans will now have access to a service which is provided outside normal hours—whether it be in the evening, at the weekend or on public holidays—and this will result in many claims, applications or other documents being lodged on and therefore benefits being calculated from an earlier date than if the lodger had waited for office hours to physically deliver the papers, telephone or send them by conventional snail mail.
I also want to take the opportunity today to talk about this government's proud record in relation to veterans affairs. This is just the latest example among many of how the government is committed to addressing the needs of veterans. Since coming to office in 1996, the Howard government has increased spending on veterans affairs from $6.4 billion to more than $10 billion in the federal budget for 2003-04. By increasing spending on veterans affairs, the Australian government is acknowledging that as Australian veterans, war widows and widowers become older so their needs change and grow. The Howard government is certainly demonstrating this recognition of the ageing veteran community through the increase in spending in veterans health, where funding has risen from $1.7 billion in 1996 to a record $4.1 billion this year; the extension of the gold card to Australian veterans over 70 years old with qualifying service; and the introduction of veteran partnering contracts with private hospitals to broaden the availability of hospital care. Through programs such as HomeFront and Veterans Home Care, we are helping veterans and war widows to continue living at home.
The government's recent response to the Clarke report gave an additional $267 million over five years for veterans and war widows or widowers. The main aspects of the government's response to the Clarke report included the exemption of recipients of a DVA disability pension from the means test at Centrelink, at a cost of just under $100 million. This benefits 19,000 veterans and can mean up to an additional $257 per fortnight for a single TPI recipient. It also ensures equity amongst veterans, regardless of whether they receive their income support from DVA or Centrelink.
Forty-five thousand veterans will benefit from the indexation of above general rate, in the same way as service pensions, at a cost of $66 million. This ensures that the most disabled, those who cannot work or who can work only part-time, receive the maximum level of support through appropriate indexation. We have also granted to war widows and widowers rent assistance of up to $94.40 per fortnight in addition to the income support supplement at a cost of $73 million. This government has also provided at a cost of $27 million the funeral benefit, which will increase from $572 to $1,000 and will benefit 14,500 people each year.
The Howard government has done more for war widows and war widowers in eight years than Labor ever managed. In addition to the recent announcement following the Clarke report, we have also indexed the war widows and widowers pension to male total average weekly earnings, or MTAWE, in 1998-99 at a cost of $163.7 million. In 2001-02 we restored benefits to widows and widowers who remarried prior to May 1984 at a cost of $86.6 million. We removed the freeze, initiated by Labor in 1986, on the ceiling rate of the income support supplement for war widows and widowers in 2002-03 at a cost of $84.7 million. The new Australian Ex-Prisoners of War Memorial in Ballarat was also a beneficiary of government funding, receiving a grant of $50,000 in 1999 at the launch of the public fund-raising appeal and an additional grant of $150,000 in 2002 as part of the government's commemorations program.
Veteran and Community Grants announced in February delivered Australian government funding for organisations which provide care and support to the veteran community: in my own state of Queensland, over $125,000; in Victoria, over $386,000; in New South Wales, over $265,000; in South Australia, almost $153,000; in Tasmania, $86,000; and in Western Australia a touch over $24,000. Veteran and Community Grants offer important assistance to projects that aim to improve the quality of life for veterans, war widows and their dependants. Organisations such as the Pine Rivers RSL sub-branch in my own election of Dickson have been worthy recipients of the grants. Projects have received Veteran and Community Grants for health education, lifestyle enhancement, community activities and support for carers and independent living at home. Veteran and Community Grants will assist projects across Australia with more than $2.7 million of funding during 2003-04.
In our government's response to the Vietnam Veterans' Health Study we have also recognised the health needs of younger veterans and their families. One of the great aspects of my job is that I remain in constant communication with the veterans and their ex-service organisations and will continue to work hard to deliver to those who served the defence of our nation so well. Labor's silence and lack of policies on veterans' issues has not been left unnoticed by the veteran community.
This bill will allow the veteran community to participate in the electronic age. Information technology is the way of the future and it is important to provide the services which are associated with this age. The amendments proposed in this bill are relatively minor; however, they are vitally important in relation to keeping pace with the electronic age. The changes made by this bill will improve the delivery of repatriation services to the Australian veteran community and therefore I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (ELECTRONIC DELIVERY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Georgiou, Petro, MP",LP,2004-03-25,"—I wish to support this bill and I am pleased to see that at last the Department of Veterans' Affairs will be authorised to accept information from its customers and clients via the Internet. We have a very real obligation to do our utmost to help our veterans' community and this bill does serve that. It is very pleasing to note that it has bipartisan support for bringing the DVA into the electronic age.
The bill is designed to assist veterans and their families by providing better access to government services through the electronic communication of claims, applications and other documents to the department. At present, the law requires documents lodged with the department to be physically sent to the department at an approved address or physically delivered to a designated person. Modern communications have now overtaken the need for what are at present anachronistic provisions in the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The amendments proposed in this bill will help to bring veterans' dealings with the department into the modern era—and it is a modern era that veterans are, by and large, astonishingly well equipped to move into. My colleagues have mentioned some of the advances in the utilisation by veterans of contemporary computer technology.
The bill provides for the Repatriation Commission to determine the methods by which information is to be delivered to the department. It specifically includes for the first time the power for the commission to approve that a claim, application, request or other document may be lodged electronically. Under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, the date on which a document is lodged with the department in many cases assumes a critical importance. It often forms the basis for the calculation of entitlements and can make a significant difference to the enjoyment of life for a veteran and their family. The bill therefore provides that, in the new section 5T of the Veterans' Entitlements Act, to be regarded as having been lodged, a document that is approved by the Repatriation Commission for electronic lodgment not only must be sent to an approved electronic address but also must be received at that address. Under section 5T the document which is lodged electronically will be taken to have been lodged on the day on which it is received at that approved address. A document that has been sent electronically to the department but has not been received at the approved address will not be regarded as having been lodged. These may seem to be pedantic points but, as I said, the date of lodgment and receipt are of fundamental importance in a number of cases to the ability to get the full measure of veterans' entitlements.
The Repatriation Commission will be able to determine which claims, applications, requests or other documents will be approved for electronic lodgment under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Claims, applications, requests or other documents which are not approved by the commission for electronic lodgment must continue to be lodged at a place or delivered to a person approved by the commission for this purpose. It is worthwhile noting that the commission has a degree of discretion over what it will accept and not accept, but I do believe that the commission will use its power to the maximum extent possible to facilitate electronic lodgment.
There are 127 items in the schedule to this bill. All of them relate to the Veterans' Entitlements Act and are about facilitating electronic communication. As just one example of the improvements made by the legislation, I would like to focus on items 4 and 5 of the schedule to the bill. Items 4 and 5 amend a particular paragraph of sections 14 and 15 respectively of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Section 14 deals with the requirement for a claim for a disability pension. Section 15 deals with the requirement for a claim for an increase in the disability pension. Under the old sections 14(3) or 15(3), a claim for a disability pension or for an increase in that pension was required by paragraph (a) to be in writing and by paragraph (b) to be accompanied by such evidence as is available and relevant. Under paragraph (c) the claim was required to be made by forwarding it and any accompanying evidence to, or delivering it at, the office of the department.
Paragraph (c) has been amended, and the new paragraph (c) in each of these sections provides only that a claim is to be lodged in an office of DVA in Australia in accordance with section 5T and will be taken to have been made on a day determined under that section. This will mean that, once the commission gives approval for electronic lodgment of such a claim, a person wishing to claim a disability pension or an increase in such a pension under the Veterans' Entitlements Act will have the additional option of lodging the claim by email at an approved departmental email address and the date of lodgment will be the day on which that email is received at the address. Any evidence required to be lodged in support of a claim may also be lodged by email if it lends itself to that process. This will clearly be to the benefit of disabled veterans and will be welcomed by those concerned with veterans' wellbeing. The bill will not change the existing arrangements covering the provision of information to the department by telephone, such as information provided orally in response to a notice or the oral withdrawal of various types of written applications.
These amendments are in line with the government's commitment to putting all appropriate government services online. Until now, the DVA has had an exemption from this general trend. This bill will bring the department into line with the bulk of the public service. I wish to conclude by saying that I believe some very important steps have been taken in terms of the government's response to the Clarke review to improve the situation of our veterans. I think that an important aspect of that was that the cabinet was willing to review the matters that had arisen under the response to the Clarke committee and to adopt a very effective response to the issues raised by that report. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (ELECTRONIC DELIVERY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2004-03-25,"—The Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Electronic Delivery) Bill 2004 brings together two very important themes. Firstly, it addresses the questions of care, attention, concern and simplification of life for our veterans. Secondly, it does that by bringing to pass some of the government's initiatives in relation to electronic delivery of services. It is a very simple combination and it is the latest in a series of different initiatives to help the veteran community. In particular, this initiative will help veterans from RSLs such as Hastings, Crib Point, Dromana, Rosebud, Rye, Sorrento and Cowes within my electorate, all of whom play not just a social role but also an important role in ministering to the pastoral and personal needs of many of the veterans who suffer and have significant problems with which they need to deal.
In looking at that, I want to deal with three things. Firstly, I want to deal with the background of Australia's response in relation to veterans' affairs and the needs of our veterans. Secondly, I want to deal with the importance of these changes, specifically in relation to the electronic delivery of services. Thirdly and very briefly, I want to deal with some of the provisions. Under existing provisions for a claim, an application or other document must be properly lodged by having been sent to the department at an approved address or delivered to a designated person. In other words, it has to go physically to the right person. People need greater access to essential government services. The physical barriers for some veterans mean that it is more difficult to access these services where it involves postal or personal delivery. It is just a fact of life that, for veterans with real, severe physical challenges, sometimes it is simply not possible to take those steps.
These amendments seek to ensure that there will be electronic lodgement of claims, applications and other relevant documents to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. It is about making life simpler and easier. It does not cut off any options; it simply opens up a new electronic delivery channel which is a way for veterans to communicate with the Department of Veterans' Affairs and access their entitlements. Not all veterans are in a position yet to be able to do that—that is absolutely the case. But there are many who can do that. One of the things that we should be doing is trying to educate, inform and encourage our veterans so they will be able to use electronic services.
This bill comes against a particular background. I am delighted that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is in the Main Committee because, in particular, I want to refer to the government's response to the Clarke review and the major amendments and outcomes from that. The recommendations that the government has accepted from the Clarke review of veterans' affairs can largely be grouped into five broad areas: firstly, service eligibility; secondly, access to the gold card; thirdly, benefits for totally and permanently incapacitated veterans and access to disability benefits for recipients; fourthly, rehabilitation; and fifthly, a selection of other measures.
In particular, I want to commend the government's action in providing an additional $267 million over the next five years to implement these recommendations. Perhaps the most important of the recommendations, and one on which I particularly commend the minister on the advocacy and the fight that she showed within the cabinet, was ensuring that the TPI benefit would be calculated in future not just against the CPI but against male total average weekly earnings, known as MTAWE, or the CPI—whichever is the greater over a time frame. That is a very important practical issue and a very important symbolic issue for veterans. I am delighted that we have been able to deliver that. It is a big step forward. It was a challenge. I spoke in the House only a number of weeks ago advocating this. I am pleased that the cabinet and, in particular, the minister have been able to take steps on that front. I think it is a very important step.
In addition, under the Clarke review we have seen an increase in funding, with a rise in pension rates from 20 March this year of $11.40, to $464.20 a fortnight, with the maximum rate for couples to increase by $9.60, to $387.60 per fortnight per person. The TPI pension rose this year by $8.40, to $771 a fortnight. However, veterans in need, such as a single TPI recipient on an age pension with no other income, will be eligible to receive an additional $257.60 a fortnight. These are all practical and real improvements, along with the fact that more than 19,000 disability pensioners who receive their income support from Centrelink will benefit from the change and on average will receive an additional $40 a fortnight.
Perhaps a very important thing, because I know that I have some people with strong connections to former Korean prisoners of war, is that the government has accepted the committee's recommendations to extend an ex gratia payment of $25,000 to all surviving prisoners of war held captive during the Korean War and the widows or widowers of prisoners of war held captive during the Korean War. This is in particular in recognition of the extremely inhumane conditions they endured. They served Australia. They were captured. They suffered. It is critical that we recognise the extraordinary level of suffering they went through.
The benefits in the Clarke review are not one-offs. They follow on from a consistent pattern of recognising and caring for the veterans community in the period since 1996. In particular, since coming into office in 1996 we have increased spending on veterans affairs from $6.4 billion to $10 billion in the federal budget for 2003-04. That is an increase dramatically in excess of the CPI rate. It is a real and tangible increase in the benefits available to our veterans community. In addition, the Howard government has shown its commitment by increasing spending for veterans' health from $1.7 billion in 1996 to a record $4.1 billion this year. It has more than doubled the amount of spending over that eight-year period. Furthermore, as of 20 March 2004, dependants of Australian Defence Force members killed in compensable circumstances on operational service will be entitled to a range of indexed compensation benefits which will be significantly increased. I hope that the need for this is negligible but I recognise that, where there are service men and women who have given their lives, it is utterly incumbent upon the government to ensure that their families are compensated in a real, meaningful and significant way.
That brings me finally to the questions in relation to the government's commitment to electronic resources under this particular bill. The bill is in line with the government's commitment to putting all appropriate government services on line since the passage of the Electronic Transactions Act 1999. This act aimed to remove the existing restraints which prevented a person from utilising online resources in order to fulfil obligations under federal law. It is recognition of the fact that, as a society, our means of communications have evolved, are evolving and will continue to evolve.
The Electronic Transactions Act applies to all Commonwealth laws after July 2001, unless they have been specifically excluded from the legislation. What that means here for veterans is that we will be able to simplify and make easier the way in which they can submit their claims, their applications and their documentation. I think those steps, whilst we do need to educate, provide information and give teaching to the veterans community, are important steps forward. I believe that this bill, whilst largely technical in nature, is a continuation of the decisions we have made since 1996 to dramatically increase the benefits available to the veterans community and, most recently, under the Clarke review, with the most important decision being the change to increase the rate for TPI by calculation against not just the consumer price index but also male total average weekly earnings—whichever is the greater over the time period. Finally, this bill helps with these simple changes to allow electronic lodgement of documents, which will assist our veterans and make their lives easier. I commend this bill and wish it speedy passage through the House.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (ELECTRONIC DELIVERY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Vale, Danna, MP",LP,2004-03-25,"—I welcome the comments and the support this morning for the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Electronic Delivery) Bill 2004 from the member for Cowan and the member for Franklin, and I also acknowledge the government members who spoke on this bill and recognise their very strong commitment and support for the veterans in their own electorates. These members were the members for Blair, Pearce, Moncrieff, Herbert, Dickson, Kooyong and Flinders. I was lucky enough to visit the electorate of Flinders and meet veterans and hear their concerns directly on a special visit arranged by that member. Members have emphasised the importance of ensuring that our veterans and war widows have efficient and practical ways of contacting and working with the Department of Veterans' Affairs.
As members have stated, the circumstances and ages of our veterans span a great range. Ensuring that services are delivered in a way that meets the needs of all our veterans is a priority for our government. We are committed to maintaining a comprehensive repatriation system that recognises the special standing and the special needs of the veteran community. This bill is further evidence of the Australian government's recognition of the need for improvements in the delivery of repatriation services to Australia's veterans and their dependants. The repatriation system provides a range of benefits to compensate veterans and their dependants for injury, disability or death resulting from their service during wartime or other conflicts. The changes made by this bill will improve the efficiency of the delivery of those benefits and the other services that are provided to veterans and their dependants under the Veterans' Entitlements Act.
The bill is designed to achieve two purposes: the unification of all the existing lodgement provisions within the Veterans' Entitlements Act and provision for both the electronic and physical delivery of documents into the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The bill contains a series of amendments that will enable the electronic lodgment of the documents required by the Department of Veterans' Affairs for the provision of benefits under the act. In providing for the electronic communication of claims, applications and other documents to the department, the amendments will not impact on the existing arrangements that provide for the physical delivery of those same claims, applications and documents.
I would like to address some of the issues raised by the members for Cowan and for Franklin. The member for Cowan has implied that the introduction of this legislation will compound issues concerning the handling, retention and storage of all electronic records by the department. I wish to assure the Main Committee that the department and the other authorities established in the Veterans' Entitlements Act will ensure that all electronic documents will be handled and stored in accordance with the advice and standards promulgated by the National Archives of Australia. The member for Franklin raised issues concerning current practice and expectations about future usage of electronic means of lodgment. At the moment, it is not possible for the department or the Repatriation Commission to accept electronic claims. The trial in Tasmania involved the issuing of passwords and electronic access to both veterans and members of the ex-service community. Approximately 22 per cent of the claims lodged during the trial period were lodged electronically. I would expect that the use of online services will be an increasing feature of the way veterans, ex-service organisations and their families interact with my department. I remind members that, under TIP and the BEST program, the government provides funding to assist ex-service organisations with their role as advocates and pensions officers, including funding for information technology.
This bill will assist both veterans and their families directly, as well as the hardworking volunteers who assist as pension officers and advocates. This government has demonstrated a commitment to veterans and their families to improve the repatriation system to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of those who have served our country. The passage of this bill provides another step forward in the government's ongoing program of improvements to the delivery of services to the veteran community by building on our government's commitment to the use of new technologies in service delivery to veterans. It will ensure that the veteran community continues to enjoy the high standard of compensation and care that is provided by the repatriation system.
I also take the time to point out that this commitment is reflected in the $10.1 billion allocated to this portfolio in the last budget, 2003-04, and a further $267 million in the government's response to the Clarke review, which was of great concern to the veteran community. This is very important legislation for the future for the delivery of our relationships with our veteran community and their families, and I commend the bill to the House.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2004-03-25,"—I rise to continue my contribution to this debate on the report of the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD into Iraq. As I indicated yesterday, this is a very important report. I indicated also that I think the members of the committee did a sterling job in being able to bring down a report that highlights deficiencies in our intelligence-gathering capacity without the use of any intemperate language. Given the nature of the matters that have been considered by the committee, it was very important that that was the way things were handled. So I commend the committee and its secretariat. 
But I do think it is important for the record that we note the government's deficiencies in handling this matter. It is fair to say that, arising from this report, we will have a better understanding of what we need to do to ensure that we have intelligence agencies that are fully competent and well resourced to undertake their mission. However, it is also important to reflect upon the government's conduct in receiving information, the manner in which they used that information and on some occasions, it has to be said, distorted the information, the advice received, for, it would appear, their own political purposes. I do believe that, just like with the Mick Keelty affair, the government are in denial in this area if they believe that they did not in any way distort or exaggerate the assertions that have been made by our intelligence agencies. 
If the Prime Minister believes that he and other ministers did not distort and exaggerate the information received, he has certainly lost touch with the public perception of what has happened. As is now clear, axiomatic and overwhelmingly supported by most Australians, Australia is a greater target of terrorism as a result of our involvement in the Iraq war, and it is something that the Prime Minister seems unable to comprehend. Again, he and the government fail to understand that this report sheets home blame to him, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the government at large due to the way in which they have conducted themselves. As we know, and it is on the record for everyone to see, the primary basis upon which we prosecuted a war against another sovereign state was to remove alleged weapons of mass destruction. That was the prime reason given by the Prime Minister, the foreign minister and the executive to prosecute a war. There has been an attempt at historical revisionism by this government; it appears they now want to find reasons post facto to justify the decision to go to war.
Whilst there is a unanimous view held by members in the House that the regime in Iraq was awful, autocratic and violent, the fact is that the removal of that regime was not the basis upon which we went to war. Whilst that is a beneficial consequence, that was not the explanation given by the Prime Minister to Australians for sending our young men and women so far away to fight. It is important that when a government makes such an important decision—and there is no more important decision than the decision to send young Australians to war—it analyses not only Australia's intelligence capacities but indeed the conduct and motives of the government in involving itself in this matter. This report clearly indicates the Prime Minister's failure to do that. There were a number of what I assert to be misleading comments by the government in the lead-up to the war. The report concluded:
The statements by the Prime Minister and Ministers are more strongly worded than most of the AIC judgements ... In particular, in the 4 February 2003 speech to the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister quoted the findings of the Joint Intelligence Committee of the UK and the key judgements of the National Intelligence Estimate of the CIA. In both of these documents the uncertainties had been removed ... These dossiers comprised stronger, more emphatic statements than Australian agencies had been prepared to make.
We now know that the information in those dossiers was in fact wrong, that it was overstated and, further to that, that the Prime Minister exaggerated those claims. I would have thought that, when it came to such an important decision, a strong leader, a leader with integrity, would place the lives of Australian soldiers and Australia's security at home before everything else. This report, handed down by the committee, has indicated that there are some areas in the intelligence agencies that we have to rectify. But, more fundamentally, the conduct and behaviour of this government has to be challenged: it should never be able to use the excuse for war for its own political purposes. The committee's report underlines the misconduct by this government in that regard. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>ASIO, ASIS and DSD Committee</title>",Committees,23,1
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2004-03-25,"—In rising to speak to the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD into Iraq, I would like to join with the member for Burke in commending the work of the members of the committee and congratulating them for putting together such a fine report—a report in which the committee would have found it very difficult to come up with any unanimous recommendations. Also, the inquiry was limited in its scope—and that is noted in the report—which impacted on the members of the committee.
This report confirms what everyone in this parliament and everyone in Australia knows—that is, our Prime Minister and this government are loose with the truth, particularly when it comes to the war in Iraq, the need to send Australian troops to Iraq and the causes in relation to this war. This government has a philosophy: `You never let the truth stand in the way of doing what you want.' In this particular circumstance, it was: `You never let the truth stand in the way of committing Australian troops to war.' Our troops—young men and women—had to go and put their bodies on the line for the purpose of this government misleading the people. As I said in my speech on the war in Iraq on 10 September 2003: 
Truth has been a victim of this government for a long time.
The Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and many members of the government unleashed a tirade of propaganda and justification for sending Australian troops to Iraq. Underlying this, first and foremost, was the need to eliminate the weapons of mass destruction that this government constantly emphasised existed in Iraq. However, not everyone in the Liberal Party was convinced by the argument that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. The Liberal Party national president, John Valder, in the Sydney Morning Herald on 27 January, said:
Does anyone seriously believe that Iraq constitutes the greatest problem confronting the world?
Even Major General Alan Stretton said that he was `unconvinced about the veracity of the US intelligence reports presented to the United Nation's by the Secretary of State Colin Powell'. Unfortunately for us here in Australia, our Prime Minister and our government were not prepared to question. They accepted the most extreme intelligence reports that were given and at no time sought to find out what the real truth was. 
The foreword to the report said that the United States and the United Kingdom argued that the war in Iraq was necessary because it was important to disarm Iraq, as it was believed that weapons of mass destruction existed in Iraq. They argued, the report detailed, that intelligence had revealed that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and therefore we should go, gung-ho, into Iraq. There was no questioning whether or not these weapons existed, and there was plenty of information available to raise the antennas of a government that was really watching the situation and was seeking the truth. A government that was not loose with the truth would have asked questions about these reports that were coming in about weapons of mass destruction. The reports were not really verified by our own intelligence agencies—but I will talk a little more about that in a moment.
The report recommends that we need to have independent assessments. It questions the accuracy of assessments and mentions the need to look at that. It also recommends that there should be an independent assessment of the performance of intelligence agencies, so it is looking at the performance of intelligence agencies. I note that the committee also recommends that there should be a more comprehensive inquiry into the issue of weapons of mass destruction.
When we look at how this government, which is so loose with the truth, seeks to get out of our commitment of troops over the fact that no weapons of mass destruction have been found, we find that the government argues that it did not doctor or sex up the documents and intelligence reports that it received. I would argue very strongly that it was just very selective about those that it chose to read and those that it chose to accept, and that there was no checking of the veracity of any reports that it received. Our Prime Minister went to a barbecue with the President of the United States, back in July 2002, I think it was—
—The cookout.
—Yes, the cookout, as the member for Burke says. And the Prime Minister made a decision there that he was going to back his mate President Bush in a war in Iraq. He did not look at the consequences, he did not look at the impact that it would have on the Iraqi people and he had no long-term plan about when the troops would be removed from Iraq. He admitted yesterday in parliament that it is a long-term commitment. Who knows how long we are going to have troops in Iraq—two, three, five, 10, 20 years? Look at the situation that existed in prewar Iraq and at the situation that exists in postwar Iraq: there was a functioning society in Iraq prior to the intervention and, subsequently, there is ongoing conflict and constant terrorism.
That brings me to the government's attack on the head of the Federal Police, Mick Keelty. I have to put on record that I think it is absolutely deplorable—a disgrace—that a government would attack the head of its law enforcement agency in the way that this government has, simply because he stated a fact that is quite obvious to all Australians: as a result of us committing troops to Iraq, we are a higher terrorism target. It has got to be so. You cannot get around the fact. If you commit Australian troops to this type of a war, if you take the line and direction that this government took, you have to place yourself as a greater target of terrorism—end of story. But the government chose to shoot the messenger, as it often does; we have seen many examples of the government shooting the messenger.
Another defence that this government have used for being in Iraq is that it does not matter if they were wrong about the fact that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction; they got rid of a dictator. But I would argue very strongly that it does matter. Time and time again, this government told us that we were going to war in Iraq purely and simply because we wished to eliminate the weapons of mass destruction that existed. It is important to turn to some of the statements that were made by the government prior to Australia committing troops to Iraq. On Lateline on 18 July 2002, our Minister for Foreign Affairs said:
... I don't think there's any doubt about Saddam Hussein having stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons.
I put it to this House that, if the Minister for Foreign Affairs had sought to find the truth—if he had really been interested in whether or not there were weapons of mass destruction—he would have allowed the weapons inspectors to continue their search. Rather, he was more interested in political spin. He was more interested in the justification of a war that his Prime Minister had committed Australia to at a barbecue with the President of the United States. As such, I would say he was not putting an honest picture to the Australian people. Once again, he was being loose with the truth. The Prime Minister, on 7 August 2002 on Radio 5DN, stated:
Iraq does have weapons of mass destruction. It is believed they have the capacity to develop a nuclear strike capacity within the not too distant future.
Once again, we have a Prime Minister who did not seek to verify the statement he was making, who was obviously loose with the truth and who was determined to honour his commitment to the President of the United States at the barbecue the previous month. The government also said, on 12 August 2002:
We have ... indications that in the last four years he has expanded his chemical and biological weapons ...
This is not backed up by the Australian intelligence agencies. The Australian intelligence agencies provided `hardly any explicit assessment on the question of the immediacy of the threat'—that is from the committee's report, at paragraph 2.40. Once again, we have the Prime Minister being loose with the truth and not seeking, in any shape or form, to verify the statements that he was making or allow full investigation of whether or not there were weapons of mass destruction. On 9 September 2002, once again we have the Prime Minister, on AM, saying:
There's no doubt, on the evidence of intelligence material available to us, that not only does Iraq possess chemical and biological weapons but Iraq has not abandoned her nuclear aspirations.
Where is the evidence, Prime Minister? That is what I ask. I might add that the report that we are debating in the Main Committee today does not provide the evidence or verify the statement that the Prime Minister made. It demonstrates very clearly that the Prime Minister and the government were loose with the truth and that there was no substantial evidence to support this argument. Once again, on 9 September, the Prime Minister reiterated that same statement.
On the evidence of the report we have before us today, I think this government should apologise to the Australian people, it should apologise to the head of the Federal Police and it should immediately put in place a strategy to withdraw our troops from Iraq. This report shows once and for all that this government has been loose with the truth, that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that the government did not seek to verify their existence.

Underlying this, first and foremost, was the need to eliminate the weapons of mass destruction that this government constantly emphasised existed in Iraq. However, not everyone in the Liberal Party was convinced by the argument that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. The Liberal Party national president, John Valder, in the Sydney Morning Herald on 27 January, said:
Does anyone seriously believe that Iraq constitutes the greatest problem confronting the world?
Even Major General Alan Stretton said that he was `unconvinced about the veracity of the US intelligence reports presented to the United Nation's by the Secretary of State Colin Powell'. Unfortunately for us here in Australia, our Prime Minister and our government were not prepared to question. They accepted the most extreme intelligence reports that were given and at no time sought to find out what the real truth was. 
The foreword to the report said that the United States and the United Kingdom argued that the war in Iraq was necessary because it was important to disarm Iraq, as it was believed that weapons of mass destruction existed in Iraq. They argued, the report detailed, that intelligence had revealed that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and therefore we should go, gung-ho, into Iraq. There was no questioning whether or not these weapons existed, and there was plenty of information available to raise the antennas of a government that was really watching the situation and was seeking the truth. A government that was not loose with the truth would have asked questions about these reports that were coming in about weapons of mass destruction. The reports were not really verified by our own intelligence agencies—but I will talk a little more about that in a moment.
The report recommends that we need to have independent assessments. It questions the accuracy of assessments and mentions the need to look at that. It also recommends that there should be an independent assessment of the performance of intelligence agencies, so it is looking at the performance of intelligence agencies. I note that the committee also recommends that there should be a more comprehensive inquiry into the issue of weapons of mass destruction.
When we look at how this government, which is so loose with the truth, seeks to get out of our commitment of troops over the fact that no weapons of mass destruction have been found, we find that the government argues that it did not doctor or sex up the documents and intelligence reports that it received. I would argue very strongly that it was just very selective about those that it chose to read and those that it chose to accept, and that there was no checking of the veracity of any reports that it received. Our Prime Minister went to a barbecue with the President of the United States, back in July 2002, I think it was—
—The cookout.
—Yes, the cookout, as the member for Burke says. And the Prime Minister made a decision there that he was going to back his mate President Bush in a war in Iraq. He did not look at the consequences, he did not look at the impact that it would have on the Iraqi people and he had no long-term plan about when the troops would be removed from Iraq. He admitted yesterday in parliament that it is a long-term commitment. Who knows how long we are going to have troops in Iraq—two, three, five, 10, 20 years? Look at the situation that existed in prewar Iraq and at the situation that exists in postwar Iraq: there was a functioning society in Iraq prior to the intervention and, subsequently, there is ongoing conflict and constant terrorism.
That brings me to the government's attack on the head of the Federal Police, Mick Keelty. I have to put on record that I think it is absolutely deplorable—a disgrace—that a government would attack the head of its law enforcement agency in the way that this government has, simply because he stated a fact that is quite obvious to all Australians: as a result of us committing troops to Iraq, we are a higher terrorism target. It has got to be so. You cannot get around the fact. If you commit Australian troops to this type of a war, if you take the line and direction that this government took, you have to place yourself as a greater target of terrorism—end of story. But the government chose to shoot the messenger, as it often does; we have seen many examples of the government shooting the messenger.
Another defence that this government have used for being in Iraq is that it does not matter if they were wrong about the fact that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction; they got rid of a dictator. But I would argue very strongly that it does matter. Time and time again, this government told us that we were going to war in Iraq purely and simply because we wished to eliminate the weapons of mass destruction that existed. It is important to turn to some of the statements that were made by the government prior to Australia committing troops to Iraq. On Lateline on 18 July 2002, our Minister for Foreign Affairs said:
... I don't think there's any doubt about Saddam Hussein having stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons.
I put it to this House that, if the Minister for Foreign Affairs had sought to find the truth—if he had really been interested in whether or not there were weapons of mass destruction—he would have allowed the weapons inspectors to continue their search. Rather, he was more interested in political spin. He was more interested in the justification of a war that his Prime Minister had committed Australia to at a barbecue with the President of the United States. As such, I would say he was not putting an honest picture to the Australian people. Once again, he was being loose with the truth. The Prime Minister, on 7 August 2002 on Radio 5DN, stated:
Iraq does have weapons of mass destruction. It is believed they have the capacity to develop a nuclear strike capacity within the not too distant future.
Once again, we have a Prime Minister who did not seek to verify the statement he was making, who was obviously loose with the truth and who was determined to honour his commitment to the President of the United States at the barbecue the previous month. The government also said, on 12 August 2002:
We have ... indications that in the last four years he has expanded his chemical and biological weapons ...
This is not backed up by the Australian intelligence agencies. The Australian intelligence agencies provided `hardly any explicit assessment on the question of the immediacy of the threat'—that is from the committee's report, at paragraph 2.40. Once again, we have the Prime Minister being loose with the truth and not seeking, in any shape or form, to verify the statements that he was making or allow full investigation of whether or not there were weapons of mass destruction. On 9 September 2002, once again we have the Prime Minister, on AM, saying:
There's no doubt, on the evidence of intelligence material available to us, that not only does Iraq possess chemical and biological weapons but Iraq has not abandoned her nuclear aspirations.
Where is the evidence, Prime Minister? That is what I ask. I might add that the report that we are debating in the Main Committee today does not provide the evidence or verify the statement that the Prime Minister made. It demonstrates very clearly that the Prime Minister and the government were loose with the truth and that there was no substantial evidence to support this argument. Once again, on 9 September, the Prime Minister reiterated that same statement.
On the evidence of the report we have before us today, I think this government should apologise to the Australian people, it should apologise to the head of the Federal Police and it should immediately put in place a strategy to withdraw our troops from Iraq. This report shows once and for all that this government has been loose with the truth, that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that the government did not seek to verify their existence.

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2004-03-25,"—I would like to congratulate Rod Batten, State Director, ABC Tasmania and all his crew, both national and Tasmanian, for the excellent roadshow that they brought to the north west coast from 14 to 19 March. It was an extraordinarily well-organised and very successful roadshow. It aimed to provide a platform for local and national performers to entertain regional communities and encourage musical and performing arts, with assistance from ABC Radio's Regional Production Fund and Tasmanian Regional Arts. Further, it aimed to demonstrate the ongoing commitment of the ABC to regional communities. I believe it was also a test case to see if there was potential application to other states. On behalf of the community of the North West Coast, I say that it was a resounding success. I encourage other communities to urge the ABC to take this roadshow—this veritable road caravan of entertainment—to their regions. 
There were outside broadcasts by ABC local radio, including the ever-popular Country Hour. ABC Television's Stateline was presented directly from Devonport. There were free evening concerts in Burnie, Smithton and Devonport. The ABC exhibition trailer featured interactive displays of ABC Television, ABC Online, ABC Radio and ABC Enterprises. There was a demonstration of the new digital television outside broadcast van, which is worth a cool $7 million. I believe it passed the application test, because hundreds and hundreds of schoolchildren went through it, pushing all the knobs and turning all the handles. I believe it came through with flying colours. There were also appearances by B1 and B2. Gardening Australia—now there is a program—recorded local segments for national replay. As you all know, the place I come from is so fertile that if you planted a toenail it would grow a foot. That will be demonstrated on Gardening Australia. 
The ABC's Managing Director, Mr Russell Balding, visited all the centres. I had the great privilege of meeting Russell and his lovely wife. Twenty-one staff from around Tasmania and some from Sydney went on the road, along with our local ABC presenters, who do such a fine job. The tour commenced in Burnie then went to Smithton, which is in the magnificent Circular Head part of my region, and ended up in Devonport. ABC Radio broadcast 30 hours of information and entertainment from our three centres. I am told that 65 local people were interviewed. They did a terrific job. As we all know, you can get a bit nervous if you are speaking on the radio or speaking in public; but they did an excellent job, because everything they say in the electorate of Braddon comes from the heart. 
The concerts featured 20 local performers, ranging from a comic to a nine-piece band, which gave a wonderful heartfelt performance. People were able to participate in the roadshow through the ABC's excellent online services. Stateline, which is a very popular program in Tassie, went live from Devonport, with three local stories and two interviews on location. About 3,000 people, including the school students I mentioned, inspected the ABC's exhibition trailer and digital outside broadcast van during the three-day roadshow. About 2,000 people attended the three concerts. In fact, they were sell-outs—you could not get in. Those concerts, which were broadcast across Tasmania, were excellent. Apart from Beccy Cole and Adam Harvey, who record with ABC Music, the highlight of those shows was our local entertainers. The standards were so high that even I was not good enough to get a spot to present a song or two. 
Importantly, through this roadshow, ABC staff have become a lot more aware of community dependence on the ABC. I think it is very good that they get community feedback so that they can truly appreciate how important the ABC is to rural and regional Australia. The local print media provided extensive, positive coverage of the roadshow. The possibility of having a roadshow—a veritable caravan of delights—will be put to other ABC branches throughout Australia. I urge every local community that has the ABC, which is so important these days, to look at this roadshow and invite the ABC to join their community.
