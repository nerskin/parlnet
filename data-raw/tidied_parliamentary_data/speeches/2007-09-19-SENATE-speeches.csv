"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-09-19,"—If I may, I will make just a few brief comments and put on record my apology for last night not being here to sum up on the second reading debate. At least one person dropped off the speakers list, for which we as a government in fact are thankful—albeit I think it was an oversight by that senator. Nevertheless, we are thankful. As a result, I was not able to answer some of the questions that were raised during speeches on the second reading. I thought, rather than have all those questions raised again in the committee stage, I would seek—and I thank my staff, as they have compiled a list of those questions—to answer some of those now. I will do that in a bid to truncate some of the questions that will undoubtedly have to be repeated if I do not.
Having said that, I understand that Senator O’Brien raised a question about the protections provided to people involved in the inquiry, and we had a bit of a discussion about that last night. As I mentioned yesterday, the bill ensures that witnesses appearing before the commission of inquiry will have the same protections as witnesses appearing before a royal commission. For example, the provisions under the Royal Commissions Act make it an offence to injure a witness or to prevent a witness from attending et cetera. These protections do not provide a blanket immunity against self-incrimination. Indeed, section 6A of the Royal Commissions Act specifies that the possibility of self-incrimination does not excuse witnesses from answering questions. However, section 6DD of the act does provide that specific statements made by a witness in the course of giving evidence to an inquiry are not in themselves admissible in subsequent court proceedings against them.
I understand questions were raised by Senators O’Brien and Milne in relation to the tabling of Mr Callinan’s report and that the suggestion was made that the government should be required to table Mr Callinan’s report once it is completed. We as a government cannot support such a requirement, as it could actually narrow the scope of what Mr Callinan can include in his report. For example, the report might contain personal information or commercially sensitive material that could not be made public without unfairly disadvantaging individuals involved in the inquiry. Tabling has never been a legal requirement for the reports of royal commissions. It could effectively limit reports to including only information that can be made public. In relation to the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry, this flexibility meant that the government could act on the recommendation that one volume of the report be kept confidential, as its release might have prejudiced possible future criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, the government remains fully committed to making the findings of this report public, as Minister McGauran made clear when he announced the inquiry. There was some comment about the potential narrowness of the terms of reference, but I think we covered that off in the discussion last night. Without delaying the committee further, I look forward to further questions.",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT (COMMISSION OF INQUIRY) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-09-19,"—To clarify one matter: I think the minister said that section 6DD of the Royal Commissions Act provides that specific statements are not admissible in proceedings seeking to prosecute a witness. I did take some comfort from that. To be clear: does that exclude all the evidence taken from the royal commission or just the witnesses’ statements to the commission, and does that include a witness statement prepared for the commission rather than their evidence to it?",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT (COMMISSION OF INQUIRY) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-09-19,—The answer to the first question is yes. I think I have confused myself in relation to Senator O’Brien’s questions. Would he mind repeating them?,SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT (COMMISSION OF INQUIRY) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-09-19,"—My question was about statements in relation to section 6DD of the Royal Commissions Act where you said specific statements were not admissible. I was taking it that that meant that the specific evidence of the particular witness was not admissible. But would statements taken for the purposes of the royal commission’s inquiry—for example, by an investigator—be protected in the same way as the actual evidence before the royal commissioner?

(Senator Lightfoot)—I see the minister is consulting with his advisers. I call the minister, now that he is fully informed.",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT (COMMISSION OF INQUIRY) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-09-19,"—I was indeed, thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman, and I now have the benefit of having section 6DD in front of me. It states:
The following are not admissible in evidence against a natural person in any civil or criminal proceedings in any court of the Commonwealth, of a State or of a Territory:
a statement or disclosure made by the person in the course of giving evidence before a Commission;
the production of a document or other thing by the person pursuant to a summons, requirement or notice under section 2 or subsection 6AA(3).
Subsection (1) does not apply to the admissibility of evidence in proceedings for an offence against this Act.
So, that is, if you have offended against the Royal Commissions Act—
—What about the Quarantine Act, given that you have transported the commission into it?
—That would remain the same because, if there are offences against the Quarantine Act, that would be covered by (1)(a) and (b)—if there is a statement or disclosure made in those circumstances.",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT (COMMISSION OF INQUIRY) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-09-19,"—I am not sure if that clarifies one of the points I made, and that is this: if a person were to come forward and speak to an investigator and sign a statement for the purposes of ultimately giving evidence at a hearing, is the original statement protected rather than the evidence?",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT (COMMISSION OF INQUIRY) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-09-19,"—That is covered in section 6DD(1)(a), which I read before:
a statement or disclosure made by the person in the course of giving evidence before a Commission;
and:
the production of a document or other thing by the person pursuant to a summons, requirement or notice ...
So that is my advice.",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT (COMMISSION OF INQUIRY) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-09-19,"—I am not certain that that does cover my area of concern, but let us move on. In relation to material that the minister introduced yesterday, about the post 24 August security and quarantine arrangements introduced at Eastern Creek: one matter that was raised was the requirement for persons to shower upon arrival at the horse quarantine facility and upon leaving, and to wear an AQIS supplied protective overall or some such. Isn’t it the case that the AUSVETPLAN states that personnel handling horses in a quarantine station must shower before leaving the station to minimise the risk of transmission? And was that provision in place prior to 24 August and observed?",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT (COMMISSION OF INQUIRY) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-09-19,"—As I understand it, that was the procedure that should have been adopted at the time.",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT (COMMISSION OF INQUIRY) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-09-19,"—So was that showering provision observed? I am not sure if you said that, so I am raising that question again. Was that provision observed? Obviously, that is a critically important question. Or is the minister unable to assure us that that was the case?",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT (COMMISSION OF INQUIRY) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-09-19,"—There is always a distinction between provisions that are in place and whether those provisions are actually observed. I am not going to trample on the ground of whether the provisions that existed at the time were or were not observed because if we knew the answers to that, or thought that we were fully acquainted with all the information, there would be no need for us to be debating this legislation for an inquiry to be conducted by Mr Ian Callinan QC. They are the matters that are best left for Mr Callinan to inquire into and then advise us of what his determination is as to whether the procedures were in fact observed or not.
—The question is that the bill stand as printed.",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT (COMMISSION OF INQUIRY) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-09-19,"—I move opposition amendment (1) on sheet 5388:
(1)    Schedule 1, item 5, page 3 (line 28) to page 4 (line 11), omit subsection 66AY(1), substitute:
         (1)    The Minister must, in writing, as soon as practicable after the commencement of this section, appoint a person to:
              (a)    conduct a Commission of inquiry into:
                    (i)    the 2007 outbreak and spread of equine influenza in Australia;
                   (ii)    the causes of the outbreak and spread, and, in particular, any protocols, measures or practices that may have contributed to it;
                  (iii)    the nature of protocols for the importation of horses and the policy settings upon which they are based, including the role of ministers in the determination of policy settings and the appropriateness of those policy settings;
                  (iv)    quarantine requirements and practices relating to the outbreak and spread;
                   (v)    any matters incidental to the matters referred to in subparagraphs (i) to (iv); and
              (b)    report to the Minister on the matters (including any recommendations relating to the matters) as soon as practicable, and, in any event, on or before a day specified in the instrument of appointment.
That amendment proposes to replace 66AY(1) with a new provision. This provision deals with what we are concerned may be inadequate terms of reference as contained in the bill.
The amendment would have three effects. Firstly, it would require the minister to appoint a person to conduct a commission of inquiry rather than being couched in permissive language, so the parliament would require the minister to conduct that inquiry or appoint a person to conduct a commission of inquiry. Secondly, it would require the terms of reference to be as stated in the legislation. And, thirdly, it would make absolutely clear the range of matters which should be investigated.
We had a discussion last night as to what might be the interpretation of the provisions in the bill, and it was suggested that the provisions would cover matters relating to the outbreak and spread of equine influenza in Australia. We believe it would be preferable if this bill required the investigation rather than left that as a matter for interpretation and a matter upon which the commissioner might have to come back to the parliament to seek further authority in the case of a challenge. We suggest that one could not rule out the possibility of a challenge, in relation to the potential breadth of the inquiry, from an interested party or from a potential witness at the inquiry—someone who believed that their position might be prejudiced by the extent of the inquiry going beyond certain matters and perhaps including other jurisdictions.
We believe it is far preferable for the commission’s terms of reference not just to be specified in the legislation but to be as broad as possible. We think that the terms of reference ought to be specific as to the types of matters which should be investigated—for example, the protocols, measures or practices. This covers a range of circumstances, and we have discussed some of those, such as whether there are appropriate protocols established—that is, the rules that have been laid down in relation to the importation of horses.
We have been talking about measures such as those contained in the AUSVETPLAN about showering before leaving the quarantine station, to minimise risk, and we have been talking about practices and whether the observance of such measures has been rigorously followed. We think it is much more responsible of the parliament to be specific that we intend—we expect; we require—this inquiry to deal with all of those aspects, rather than to leave that as a matter for interpretation.
The other matter which we think ought to be specifically spelled out in the legislation as a requirement for the terms of reference is the question of the policy settings upon which protocols are based, the role of ministers in the determination of those policy settings and indeed the appropriateness of those policy settings.
We are concerned, given that this government has form in relation to terms of reference shielding ministers from proper inquiry, that these terms of reference not be constrained by the minister with the discretions which are contained within the language in the bill currently and that it be a requirement that the commissioner look into the relevance of policy settings in relation to their role in the outbreak and spread of equine influenza.
Of course, we agree that there may be matters which ought to be inquired into which arise in the course of those inquiries and which should be open to the commissioner. We therefore agree that what I will describe as the catch-all provision—which is the fifth provision: ‘any matters incidental’ et cetera, which I think is basically the same as the provision in the bill—ought to remain to allow the commissioner to delve into fields that arise from the sorts of inquiries that we have outlined in the earlier provisions.
It is our belief that it is much more preferable that these matters be required by the parliament to be investigated. This bill comes here to equip the minister with the power to commission an inquiry. We think that the parliament ought to be specific about the range and extent of the inquiry it requires, and these provisions would assist in the specification by the parliament of the terms of that inquiry. We do think that, despite the assurances which have been given, there is a risk that this inquiry will not be as broad as it should be, and we do believe, given the form of this government in relation to such inquiries, that there is a serious risk that the terms will be drawn in such a way as to constrain the inquiry and protect ministers from the proper reach of it. I think that would be a travesty, given that there clearly has been an involvement of ministers in policy settings affecting protocols as they apply to the importation of horses. That should be properly investigated and ministers involved ought to be accountable, through the inquiry, to the Australian people. We believe our amendment is important and we urge the Senate to support it.",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT (COMMISSION OF INQUIRY) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-09-19,"—The honourable senator opposite has made the bland assertion that, allegedly, the government has form. We, of course, reject that. The important thing with any royal commission and terms of reference is that there be the catch-all phrase. The fact that Senator O’Brien himself is reduced to using the catch-all phrase indicates that, no matter how clever you think you are at drafting, if you want a genuine inquiry, you need a catch-all phrase, such as the one we are introducing—namely, ‘any matters incidental to the matters referred to’. That is the important part.
Whilst Senator O’Brien has added a few extra words and an extra two paragraphs, he is reduced to also having, at proposed subparagraph (v), ‘any matters incidental to’. In the terms of reference we talk about ‘outbreak’; Senator O’Brien then says ‘and spread’ just in case ‘outbreak’ does not cover the spread. If I wanted to be smart, I could say: ‘How can you have an outbreak without an introduction?’ In that case the wording ought to be ‘introduction, outbreak and spread’. We can keep on adding words ad infinitum, having a great verbal joust and playing word games, but, at the end of the day, we know that the totality of those matters that Mr Callinan needs to inquire into are covered by the final paragraph:
… any matters incidental to the matters referred to in subparagraphs (i) and (ii); …
In Senator O’Brien’s amendment, it would be ‘in subparagraphs (i) to (iv)’. I am sure that Senator O’Brien and I could sit down and draw up a list of potential extra paragraphs that would go for pages and pages about showering protocols and this quite bizarre allegation of ministerial involvement in the setting of the protocols. We could go through chapter and verse and set out in great detail, page after page, things that Mr Callinan should possibly inquire into. Even if we did that, if we had any sense whatsoever we would still be reduced to adding a final paragraph which said ‘any matters incidental to’. I think most people fully accept and understand that that catch-all phrase, which is a description quite rightly employed by Senator O’Brien, is the important part of these terms of reference. We can spend day after day expanding the terms of reference without actually adding anything to it because of that catch-all phrase. Given those circumstances, we do not believe that the amendment will add anything to the terms of reference and to the full extent to which Mr Callinan will be clothed to conduct a very full, wide-ranging inquiry.",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT (COMMISSION OF INQUIRY) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-09-19,"—The provision that both Senator Abetz and I have described as the catch-all can only catch all matters relating to, in the case of the bill, the previous two provisions and, in the case of my amendment, the previous four provisions. The real test of how broadly the inquiry can range is how broad those first governing provisions, if I can put it that way, which establish parameters for the inquiry are. Matters which arise out of or are incidental to those matters are then available, one might say, through the catch-all provision. If we are debating this as a piece of legislation, the matters that are incidental and which can be referred to arise from those specifics contained in the terms of reference. That is the nature of the debate we are having. I have not heard the minister say that all of the matters contained in the four provisions in the amendment are specifically covered in the terms of reference. What I have heard the minister say is that if Mr Callinan thinks he needs broader terms of reference he will ask the minister for them. To that proposition, I say: if the parliament cannot be sure that all of these matters are currently covered in the provisions in the bill, then it would be good public policy for the parliament to require that these matters be inquired into without having regard to whether it would necessarily extend the term of the inquiry, increase the cost to the public or increase the process of the parliament to deal with it.
The other aspect which the minister has not responded to is the question of whether the terms in the bill as they stand guarantee that the inquiry, as determined by the commission signed off by the minister, will even be as broad as the government’s bill, let alone the amendment as contained in sheet 5388. That is within the discretion of the minister. It may be that there are some arcane reasons why these things are normally couched in this way. I suppose it is not surprising that the minister is trying to ignore the fact that the Cole inquiry into the ‘wheat for weapons’ scandal was couched in such a way. The public commentary makes it absolutely and abundantly clear in the public’s mind that the role of the government in the scandal was not able to be properly investigated. The range of questions which could be asked of government witnesses was constrained by the commissioner by reference to the terms of reference. In other words, those intervening parties who sought to question ministers were told that the questions they were seeking to raise did not arise from the terms of reference and so their questioning was constrained. That is something we do not want to see with this. We know that there was an exchange of correspondence between the Australian Racing Board and the then relevant minister, Mr Truss, in 2004 and 2005, which I have referred to earlier, about specific protocols and with specific reference to the potential for the introduction of equine influenza. We know that there were circumstances where the effectiveness of protocols was questioned by industry in relation to the potential for the introduction of the disease, which is now having a very significant effect on horse industries in Australia.
If we are to leave this in the hands of the minister, especially in relation to the discretions that might arise if there is a deficiency, it will be inefficient and inadequate and will necessitate delay. If there is a deficiency in the words the government proposes, for example, the matter will need to come back to the parliament. We seek to make that unnecessary. To suggest that, somehow, we could talk about every possibility and put them in a terms of reference—of course, one can make that claim about any form of drafting that you attempt to draft exhaustively, but, on the other hand, you can attempt to draft away perceived issues so that they are not issues in the sense that the terms of reference will clearly allow those issues to be canvassed in the inquiry. The opposition have sought to introduce specific provisions with specific reasons behind them, which I have outlined, and to make sure that those matters are canvassed. We have not been given the absolute unquestionable assurance that these matters will be pursued, and that is why we are pursuing them with this amendment.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator O’Brien’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT (COMMISSION OF INQUIRY) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-09-19,"—I move opposition amendment (2) on sheet 5388:
(2)    Schedule 1, item 5, page 4 (line 16), at the end of section 66AY, add:
         (5)    The Commissioner’s report must be laid before each House of the Parliament within 5 sitting days of that House after the report is received by the Minister.
         (6)    If a House does not meet within 5 days after the report is received by the Minister, the report must be made available to the Presiding Officer of that House for distribution to the members of that House within 5 days after the report is received by the Minister.
I note that our amendment is similar but not identical to Australian Greens amendment (1) on sheet 5392. I think that we are both on the same page in terms of intent but that we have perhaps slightly different drafting instructions or drafting sources—I am not sure which. I think it is fair to say that what we are about is ensuring that the commissioner’s report is made public. The concern which exists is that there ought be a complete public understanding of the causes or cause of the outbreak and spread of the equine influenza disease in the horse population and that if there are public moneys to be spent on that then the parliament ought to be fully advised as to the findings. The way that the commissioner would write any such report would be, I think, with regard to the terms of reference. I am not certain one can feel that somehow the commissioner would be constrained in responding to the terms of reference because of fears of publication.
This is an examination of, essentially, the implementation of public policy and the adequacy of public policy in the form of our quarantine policies as they relate to the importation of horses. This is not akin to the inquiry that the government has referred to—the inquiry into human practices in the building industry. That, I suggest, was to do with the lawful or unlawful behaviour of individuals in relation to an industry and the practices that existed within it. This is an inquiry into the matters of public policy that determined the protocols that apply to the importation of horses, the practices and procedures that were put in place, the observance or nonobservance of those practices and the performance of ministers, departmental officers, managers and contractors in relation to their obligations to ensure that we did all that we could to keep disease from the Australian horse population—quite a different circumstance.
We were told that the evidence taken in these inquiries could not be used against an individual in relation to any prosecution or civil case. I think the provision referred to for that protection was section 6DD of the Royal Commissions Act. So I am struggling to understand the caveat that the government seeks to place upon the issue of the publication of these reports. If the report is tabled in the parliament but the evidence cannot be used, I struggle to see how the findings of the commissioner based on that evidence could be intruded into any such proceedings.
One would have thought that if these are prosecutions under the Quarantine Act then they are not matters which will go to a jury. So I really do not understand the caveat that is sought to be placed on the publication of the findings. Were there to be a finding that individual A or B completely ignored their responsibilities in relation to a provision of the legislation, one would expect that those proceedings being subsequently considered would be considered on evidence other than evidence before the commission and certainly not on the findings of the commission. Without the presence of a jury trial, a trial in the public arena would, I suggest, perhaps not be the issue that the government has suggested it would be. So we cannot see the problem with publication. We think it is desirable that the information be available to the public. We are certain that the industry would desire the information to be published. We are certain that the public would like to see the result of this inquiry—after all, they are going to pay for it—and we cannot understand why the government would not agree to provisions which would require the reports to be laid on the table in parliament and the outcome of this inquiry to be made public. The minister has said that it is his wish that this matter be made public but that he would leave that in the hands of the commissioner. We think it would be more appropriate for the parliament to determine the outcome at this stage and for the inquiry to commence on the understanding that, at the end of the day, in the mind of the commissioner, the parliament and the public, the report would be made public.",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT (COMMISSION OF INQUIRY) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2007-09-19,"—I rise to support Labor’s amendment and to indicate that the Greens have a similar amendment, the only difference being in the time frame. The Labor Party’s amendment requires that the report be presented within five days. We are saying the report should be presented within 14 days. To save time, I thought that I would speak to my amendment and then, if the amendment is put sequentially when the time comes, it might facilitate the business of the chamber.
The public has a great interest in this issue. Right across Australia, communities want answers on where this disease came from and how it managed to escape the quarantine facility. Many questions are being asked about the compensation payments. We are told they are not compensation payments; they are income substitution payments. Perhaps there will not be compensation. It depends entirely on what the inquiry report finds and how far it goes. Certainly, there are people who argue that they ought to be compensated. We are going to see enormous public interest in the inquiry because it has such far-reaching ramifications throughout rural and regional Australia, particularly for the horse-racing industry. But it is not confined to that; it has ramifications for all horse related industries. I believe the report should be tabled in both houses of parliament.
My only experience of the impact of a royal commission report—and this is the equivalent of a royal commission—was the Carter royal commission into the attempt to bribe a member of parliament in 1989 in Tasmania. That report was full and frank in its assessment of the evidence. The detail was in the report and it was tabled. Royal Commissioner Carter made judgements at the time. He made it clear why matters were being referred to the DPP and where there was not sufficient evidence to warrant a reference to the DPP. If it was possible to make that kind of finding available in that case, I cannot see why it cannot apply in this case. I would expect—as would every member of parliament—that matters that would prejudice the outcome of any criminal proceedings would be dealt with appropriately by Justice Callinan in this report. I have no doubt that that will occur and that he will frame the report in a way that ensures the maximum potential for the success of any criminal proceedings in the event that they are warranted. It would give much more comfort to people around Australia if they knew that the report was going to be tabled in the parliament and that they were going to have an opportunity to read the whole thing from start to finish. They will then be able to determine whether they concur and can take comfort from the fact that (a) the investigation was comprehensive and (b) they were able to make judgements having read the evidence and looked at the recommendations. That is the entirely appropriate way to go.
With the Carter royal commission, which was much more politicised than this inquiry, the report was able to be tabled and made public in full at that time. I cannot see why the same cannot apply in this case. I do not follow the government’s argument in terms of caveats. There is such huge interest in this issue that, as a matter of transparency for the Australian community, not only should the report be made available to the minister but very soon thereafter it should be made available to the parliament. I am prepared to support the tabling of the report within five days, as the opposition proposes. In the event that that is not supported by the government, my amendment seeks a period of 14 days. It is then a question of principle as to whether the government believes it is appropriate for people to read in full what Justice Callinan finds. It is entirely appropriate that, as the representatives of the Australian community, we insist that the whole community has access to the report as Justice Callinan writes it.",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT (COMMISSION OF INQUIRY) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-09-19,"—I thank Senator Milne for her approach to this, which will hopefully shorten the time taken to deal with these amendments. In my heart I was hoping for a while that the Labor Party and the Greens might have a huge argument as to the difference between five and 14 days, but then common sense prevailed and I thought, ‘It will take up a lot of the chamber’s time so hopefully they will not,’ and I thank them that they did not. In announcing Mr Callinan’s appointment, the minister made it clear that the findings of the inquiry will be made public. So there is no argument or discussion to be had in relation to the findings being made public; that will occur. Mr Callinan himself has indicated his preference to conduct as many of his hearings in public as possible.
The government does not, however, support a legislative requirement that the report be tabled in parliament, and for one very important reason—and that is, it could actually narrow the scope of what Mr Callinan can include in his report. I note Senator Milne’s reference to the Carter royal commission. Whilst I have a clear memory of it, my memory does not extend to the legislation empowering that commission and whether it included a specific clause in relation to a period in which the royal commission report had to be tabled. My advice is that not a single royal commission set up has had such a time limitation put on it in relation to reporting. The reason is that the report might contain, for example, personal information or commercially sensitive material that could not be made public without unfairly disadvantaging individuals involved in the inquiry. If required to table his report, Mr Callinan would effectively be limited to including only information that could be made public.
As I said before, it has never been a legislative requirement that reports of royal commissions be tabled—and with good reason. For example, with the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry, the government was able to act on the commissioner’s recommendation that one volume of his report remain confidential as it might unfairly prejudice future criminal prosecutions. Of course, if that occurs, Mr Callinan may well provide his report in two volumes—one that can be made public and which contains findings, and another that cannot be made public, or at least not for quite some time.
Accordingly, without knowing the exact nature of Mr Callinan’s report, it would be inappropriate to include a legislative requirement that the report be tabled. Nevertheless, the government remains fully committed to making the findings of the report public, as Minister McGauran has indicated. Senator O’Brien indicated that it was really only an issue of public policy protocols and other matters. There is the possibility that charges may arise. I have been advised, for example, that if somebody has imported an animal in contravention of the Quarantine Act then that person may be prosecuted under section 67 of the Quarantine Act. If somebody has provided false or misleading information to the Commonwealth, that person may be prosecuted under part 7.4 of the Criminal Code Act 1995. As I understand it, part of the procedure includes, for example, the signing of statutory declarations. So if somebody were to have signed a false statutory declaration in relation to this issue, clearly that is a matter that could lead to prosecution as well.
For those reasons, and because it is a precedent which has been followed by every single royal commission that has been established, the government will oppose the amendment in relation to tabling, whilst absolutely guaranteeing that the findings will be made public and that whatever can be made public of the report will be made public as expeditiously as possible.",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT (COMMISSION OF INQUIRY) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-09-19,"—Just so that we are clear on this, we do prefer our amendment, but in the event—and we know that the government has the numbers in the chamber—that it does not succeed, is the minister assuring the committee and the Australian public that only those matters contained in the report pertaining to identifying individuals who might be prosecuted will be withheld from publication, or is the minister saying something less than that?",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT (COMMISSION OF INQUIRY) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-09-19,"—I have said two things. One was in relation to prosecutions and the other was that the report—and I will repeat this word for word—might contain personal information or commercially sensitive material that could not be made public without unfairly disadvantaging individuals in the inquiry. If required to table his report, Mr Callinan would therefore effectively be limited to including only information that could be made public. We do not want to see such a restriction being placed on the report to government which may in fact be very helpful in undertaking any changes. At the end of the day, what we want is the best possible advice arising out of this inquiry to ensure that we get quarantine in relation to this matter as correct as possible. Given those circumstances, we would want the greatest amount of flexibility given to Mr Callinan so that he can be full and frank in his report without having to constrain himself because of the considerations that I have outlined.",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT (COMMISSION OF INQUIRY) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2007-09-19,"—The problem I have here is that the minister is saying he wants Justice Callinan to bring down a full and comprehensive report. Everybody here is in total agreement with having that kind of inquiry and a report of that kind. My concern is that the minister is saying that the findings will be made public but not the report. The findings could involve 10 points at the end of the report in terms of recommendations about what may or may not happen. That is not going to give comfort to people who want to go through, blow by blow, what actually occurred during a time sequence, who was responsible and how it worked out.
Many people will be concerned about this and will even suggest that there is a cover-up, unless the government releases the report. Otherwise they are going to say: ‘That’s what the findings were but what did they base those findings on? Did they take this or that into account?’ So there must be a way of presenting the whole report. Justice Callinan could decide to have part of the report remain confidential on the basis that it covered incriminating evidence against an individual, but the bulk of the report would cover the detail of what occurred—and that is what the Australian people want to read, not just a two-pager at the end of 10 or 20 recommendations coming out of the report.
That is why both the Labor Party and the Greens are pushing here to have the report tabled in parliament so that the community has access to it, and not just to the findings or the recommendations contained in the report. You are not really giving us much comfort, Minister, and I do not think you are giving any comfort to people who want to know the sequence of events, by telling us that we will only have the findings publicly available. I would like to know how you intend to provide the material I am talking about—the day-to-day sequence, from the beginning, when we knew and what we knew, through to the end. That is what people want to know. Everybody would respect the fact that some information would need to be privileged in the sense that it might influence court cases or incriminate people. That is understood. But there must be a halfway house between having nothing on the table and just having the recommendations made public.",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT (COMMISSION OF INQUIRY) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-09-19,"—If I understand Senator Milne’s comments correctly, we are in heated agreement. She has also—and I do not want to be provocative here—possibly spoken against her own amendment. What is being required in both these amendments is that the report, and you can only read that as ‘the full report’, be tabled within five or 14 days, depending on whether you go with Labor or the Greens. But the report would have to be tabled.
What I have been trying to say—possibly not very well, and so I will try again—is that we as a government will definitely make the findings public. We also want to make as much of the report public as possible. It is fair and reasonable to say that we will be guided by Mr Callinan. A good example was the building royal commission. A number of chapters were made public and one chapter was withheld because of prosecution and other reasons. I would imagine that if Mr Callinan’s report neatly fell into those sorts of categories—and with his judicial mind I am sure he would be able to separate and deal with those matters in an appropriate way—then that is what would happen here as well. What I do not want to do is predict what Mr Callinan might report or how he will report to government.
I think we do need to take into account the considerations that Senator Milne herself acknowledged should be, and would need to be, taken into account. Therefore just the bland amendment of saying that it has to be tabled within five days or 14 days would not cover off the sensitive areas to which Senator Milne herself has alluded. I can say and I can guarantee that this government, as always, is willing to be open and transparent, but there are considerations that sometimes militate against full disclosure, as in the case of the building royal commission. We as a government want—as does the community, of course—to get to the bottom of all the matters to ensure that that which has occurred will not occur again. In those circumstances I think everybody would be well served with as much being disclosed as possible, and that is the government’s intention.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2007-09-19,"—I would like to speak to the second reading of the Higher Education Endowment Fund Bill 2007 and the Higher Education Endowment Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2007. These bills establish the Higher Education Endowment Fund, or HEEF, as announced in this year’s federal budget. Labor support these bills. We do so for the reason that our publicly funded higher education system has been cruelly starved of funds for 11 long years by the Howard government. We support these bills because our university system is languishing in a state of serious decay. Its capital stock is in disrepair. Its research facilities are out of date, shabby, falling apart and, in some cases, dangerous. I will provide a few salient examples of the crumbling research facilities a little later in my remarks.
On the government’s own figures, the maintenance backlog alone of our universities stands at $1.5 billion. That is before we begin to look at the needs of major refurbishment and replacement of facilities and buildings, and it does not include the needs of new facilities. The measures outlined in this bill have been hailed by some as a $6 billion windfall for Australian higher education. It is Labor’s view that it is nothing of the sort. This money is not being handed over to the higher education system at all. It is just the return on the investments that will flow to the system. The government’s largesse is not quite as some people have presented it. However, the government’s own estimates suggest that this new fund will provide a welcome boost of over $300 million per annum. At this rate, it will take five years just to clear the immediate maintenance backlog on university infrastructure, which is hardly overgenerous. This backlog figure, I recall, is a couple of years old, so in fact it will take longer than that to reach any level of equilibrium, on the government’s own figures.
The lion’s share of the funds generated by HEEF will go to university research facilities and infrastructure, and this increase is long overdue. It comes at a time when researchers in the sector are worried about the future of some of the existing programs that have funded universities’ research. In particular, there is concern about the future of the major national research facilities that have been funded under the government’s flagship Backing Australia’s Ability research package.
The National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy, or NCRIS, will terminate in 2011. ‘Terminate’ is the term used by a DEST officer at the last budget estimates. If it terminates, it will leave a significant number of large and expensive but vital scientific research facilities high and dry—facilities like AuScope, an integrated national research system for acquiring and analysing geophysical and geochemical data so that scientists can learn about the geological structure of the Australian continent. This research is vital to managing our environment, developing energy and mineral resources and anticipating natural disasters. This facility is funded at $43 million to 2011.
Another such facility is the Population Health and Clinical Data Linkage. That links and integrates population health data from different datasets across Australia. It facilitates researchers having access to that data. This initially will vastly enhance Australia’s research capacity to undertake health research in fields such as epidemiology. This data facility will be funded at $20 million over five years.
But what will happen when the NCRIS program terminates and the funding abruptly stops? What will become of facilities such as these? That is the question we put to the government: what will happen to these research programs, given the statement that officers have made at Senate estimates that that funding will terminate? If the past is any guide, continued Commonwealth funding for such facilities is in fact far from guaranteed under this government.
The previous large research infrastructure fund, the Major National Research Facilities—or MNRF—Program, was established by the previous Labor government in the 1994 federal budget. When the life of that program came to an end in 2005, a number of expensive research facilities were indeed left high and dry—at least, the universities which housed these facilities were left high and dry. Those universities have to decide whether they will be left with some pretty big white elephants or whether they will try to find some other means of securing funding to keep these national facilities in operation.
Let us take the case of the Airborne Research Australia facility, based at Flinders University in South Australia. It consisted of a series of specialist research aircraft designed to support atmospheric and meteorological research and included a unique high-altitude plane. This is a facility that cost $8.5 million. I understand that this facility has effectively been grounded. This is because the Howard government stopped funding it, leaving the responsibility for its continued operations up to Flinders University. The university tried to keep it running by charging fees for service, but without ongoing Commonwealth support it proved too costly. The last advice I had on this issue was that a very specialised, expensive aircraft is actually sitting in a hangar, completely idle. Of course, it was the university that was left with the responsibilities.
I do not seek to blame the university for this sorry state of affairs, but I do blame the government. I do blame this government for its failure to appreciate the long-term research needs of this country. I do blame this government for the fact that, as the OECD has yet again pointed out, this government has fallen further and further behind our international competitors. I do blame this government for not having the strategic wisdom to understand the significance of national research projects and the strategic wisdom to ensure that our research infrastructure was not allowed to deteriorate under these circumstances. I blame the government because it has failed to set up long-term strategies to ensure the funding of facilities such as this, which of course means that in effect there has been an enormous waste of public money because of the government’s lack of long-term planning and long-term strategic vision.
We could take the case of the H1 Heliac at the ANU nuclear physics department. This is a research facility of national and international importance. I say that for a number of reasons. It was initially funded under Labor’s Major National Research Facilities Program back in 1996. As I understand it, it was the only university based research facility in Australia that had the capacity to train future nuclear scientists. That is a particularly important issue, especially when we understand just how important nuclear research is in this country. I know there are some simpletons around who suggest that all nuclear research is bad and must be somehow or other devoted to the production of weapons or nuclear power stations. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. Nuclear research is critical in this country in a range of industries, from engineering to medicine; in geoscience, for instance in the oil and gas industry; in mining; in water and in waste disposal and sewerage; in the chemical industry; and of course in a host of industries in manufacturing. So the means of teaching nuclear scientists and researchers is quite important, and it is important for a myriad of peaceful purposes which are very much part of modern-day life, from cancer detection to food sterilisation to computer electronics, which are just a few examples.
This is a facility which is at the centre of Australia’s research into nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion has the potential to become a safe form of energy generation, one that does not create dangerous radioactive waste. Of course, it is a long way off and it requires substantive public investment, but, as I am advised by scientists at the ANU and by colleagues around the world, that is what they are seeking.
This facility was built and commissioned years ago and, in the fast-changing world of nuclear science, it is becoming out of date and obsolete. To operate it depends on a radiofrequency generator, a second-hand device sourced over 30 years ago from what was then Telecom. Upgrades are needed for chemical-handling gear and for basic safety. Research facilities are complex worksites, and government’s reluctance to fund the installation of modern occupational health and safety equipment is limiting our capacity to undertake research of critical national importance. I do not know the cost of maintaining and operating this facility, but I expect it would be considerable and I would expect that funding for it, under the national research fund program, will run out. There is no replacement program for funding those facilities formerly funded under the MNRF Program. So far, the Howard government has failed to guarantee to continue funding for this facility. This is the same government that wants to foist onto universities a string of conditions and administrative overburdens to restrict universities’ capacity to make independent judgements about where their funds should be allocated. This is also a government that wants to foist on us a string of nuclear power stations, seeking across the eastern seaboard to find sites for the building of nuclear power stations—a government which, at the same time, will not fund the necessary research for a facility such as that at the ANU.
This sort of short-sighted hypocrisy highlights the lack of vision by this government. There is lack of understanding of the need to prepare for the future and there is lack of insight into what should be a long-term strategic vision of where our research infrastructure should be provided. It means that Australia will look rather foolish when it loses the capacity to train up our own nuclear scientists for the future. Australia will lose its chance to contribute to a safe and, arguably, climate-change-neutral energy source. This situation is similar to our national security. The Howard government cannot seem to be able to appreciate and guarantee the ongoing funding of a facility at the ANU, and the ANU itself is not able to fund the long-term running costs of such a centre. So the question arises: who will fund such a centre as this? It seems that, under the HEEF initiative, using a gesture of this type, the funding cannot be guaranteed either.
The HEEF funding is a strategy the government has pursued, which we see through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy, NCRIS, which runs out in 2011. There is no strategy beyond NCRIS. It is quite obvious that the strategy the government adopted to provide ongoing support to the MNRF funded research facility was simply to pull the plug, and I am yet to see any indication from anyone in the government that there is a replacement strategy for that funding for the national infrastructure programs. The reality is that we have no guidelines yet. This legislation has not passed, and we do not know who are going to be the guardians on this body. We are in some doubt as to what the government’s real plans are. My guess, however, is that when 2011 comes around and, under this government’s model, desperate universities are casting about for a source of money to maintain their expensive NCRIS funded research facilities, there will only be one place to find it—and that will be this source of funding.
So I ask the minister at the table: is HEEF no more than a replacement of NCRIS? I will seek advice from the officials on that basis. Is this genuinely additional money? Can there be a guarantee that NCRIS funding will continue? What we have seen from the minister to date has been nothing but vague statements. She has vacillated on this issue. She was quoted in May at a press conference as saying that the HEEF would eventually replace other capital and infrastructure funds. She said:
I have been concerned that we have in place a number of funds, each with different guidelines and numbers of criteria, and that universities have to put in lots of different applications ... Over time I would like to see that streamlined ...
The Treasurer, however, speaking on budget night, said that the fund would ‘not take over existing education funding’. The minister’s own second reading speech identified the fund as ‘additional to existing programs’ and, more recently, the minister has said that HEEF represented ‘an opportunity for more of our universities to emerge as world-class institutions’. What is not clear from any of these statements is the purpose of this fund. We are not being told what the guidelines are. We have not seen these guidelines. We have no basis for assessment of the criteria for the allocations of moneys under this program. The higher education sector is to be excused for being confused about what the government’s intentions are and, in fact, they have every right to be terribly suspicious about what the government’s actions are.
I put it to the Senate that at least part of the government’s purpose is this: HEEF will, in a de facto way, be there to replace the current NCRIS funding. The scenario is simply this: NCRIS terminates in June 2011, just as the investments from HEEF will be beginning to bear fruit. Universities will be forced to turn to HEEF to replace ongoing running and maintenance costs associated with the sophisticated pieces of research infrastructure that NCRIS currently funds. So, in my judgement, all I can see to date—given what the officials have told us at estimates—is that this money will be used to replace the current research infrastructure programs.
The other problem I have with this bill is the fact that the guidelines have yet to be published. We have no way of knowing how the program will actually be administered. As the minister recently said:
This initiative will promote excellence, quality, and specialisation in Australian universities for years to come.
…            …            …
It is not – as some suggest – a source of recurrent funding to be divided equally amongst our universities.
The minister says:
This is the opportunity for more of our universities to emerge as world-class institutions.
So it is not to be divided equally amongst universities. There is going to have to be some form of allocative mechanism put in place. We are entitled therefore to ask: on what basis will money be allocated? The minister has absolute discretion to make grants under this legislation, and, of course, under this legislation the recommendations of the HEEF advisory board will not be made public. In any case, the minister is free to treat these recommendations as she wishes. She can ignore them, and there is nothing in this legislation to prevent that occurring.
What we have is a government that has failed to provide the parliament and the public with the details of the criteria for the allocations and failed to provide us with any understanding of how money will be spent and for what purposes. Under this arrangement, the government is able simply to enact a sleight of hand to replace existing infrastructure funding under these new arrangements. I think we are entitled to know this and I expect that in this debate we will ask the minister for an explanation. We will ask: where are the funding guidelines? Who will be appointed to run this fund? Who will be there to make recommendations? What access will there be for the public to know what guidelines have been issued?
Since coming to power 11 years ago, the government has pulled the rug out from under the higher education sector by cutting university operating grants. In its 1996 budget it actually cut university operating grants by a cumulative six per cent, which resulted in a cut to the sector of some $850 million. As a proportion of total revenue, Commonwealth grants to universities have decreased from 57 per cent in 1996 to almost 40 per cent in 2004—and that is the point the OECD report makes—while university revenue derived from fees and charges increased from 13 per cent in 1996 to 24 per cent in 2004. It is against this background that we are entitled to assess the government’s performance when it comes to such matters. That is why I now move the second reading amendment in respect of the Higher Education Endowment Fund Bill 2007:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate:
              (a)    welcomes the fact that the Future Fund and the Higher Education Endowment Fund are for investment in Australia’s long-term national interests, including the objective of meeting public sector superannuation liabilities;
              (b)    notes that the Government’s failure over 11 years to invest adequately in Australia’s higher education as illustrated by the following:
                    (i)    on the Government’s own analysis there exists a significant backlog of deferred infrastructure maintenance, estimated at $1.5 billion for the university sector,
                   (ii)    the Group of Eight (Go8) universities estimate in 2006 that the total deferred maintenance liabilities was $1.53 billion across Go8 universities alone,
                  (iii)    the principal reason behind this backlog is the fact that since it came to power more than 11 years ago, the Government has undermined the higher education sector by cutting university operating grants, including in its 1996 Federal Budget which cut university operating grant funding by a cumulative 6 per cent over the forward estimates from 1997-2000, resulting in $850 million in cuts to the sector, and
                  (iv)    as a proportion of total revenue, Commonwealth grants to universities have decreased from 57 per cent of their revenue in 1996 to 41 per cent in 2004, while university revenue derived from fees and charges has increased from 13 per cent in 1996 to 24 per cent in 2004;
              (c)    condemns the Government for the adverse impact this has had on Australia’s universities, including that:
                    (i)    since 1995 student-staff ratios have increased from 14.6 to 20.4 today, with adverse implications for the quality of teaching and learning,
                   (ii)    Australia’s education system now relies more on private financing than all other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries except for the United States, Japan and South Korea,
                  (iii)    university revenue derived from fees and charges has increased from 13 per cent in 1996 to 25 per cent in 2004, with the result that more than half of the cost of tertiary education today is met from private sources,  with dependence on private sources increasing to 52 per cent in 2004 from 35 per cent in 1995,
                  (iv)    the average amount of Commonwealth funding per student in real terms has declined by nearly $1 500, while student Higher Education Contribution Scheme contributions have increased by nearly $2 000, and fees and charges have increased by over $3 000, and
                   (v)    the deferment of essential expenditure on the maintenance of university buildings and facilities has had long-term consequences for the quality of essential infrastructure;
              (d)    further notes widespread concerns that, over time, the Higher Education Endowment Fund could be used to replace existing capital and infrastructure programs in higher education, notably the Capital Development Pool, the Institutional Grants Scheme, the Research Infrastructure (Block Grants) Scheme and the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Scheme;
              (e)    also notes that               despite these belated measures, the Government has not put in place a long-term plan for meeting Australia’s infrastructure needs, including a national broadband network and that instead it has:
                         (i)    produced 18 piecemeal broadband proposals in the past 11 years,
                        (ii)    recently imposed a two tier broadband solution for Australia through the 17th and 18th broadband plans,
                       (iii)    engaged in an election stunt designed to delay the building of a high speed fibre to the node network in the major cities,
                       (iv)    through Broadband Connect Infrastructure Program subjected millions of Australians living in regional and rural Australia to a second class broadband network that is based on an obsolete technology and is only capable of delivering average connection speeds twice today’s average, and
                        (v)    become embroiled in legal action involving preferential dealing in the Broadband Connect Infrastructure Program, after moving the funding goal posts for the program while only informing one participant; and
               (f)    in contrast to the Government, Labor is committed to build with the private sector a national broadband network that includes a fibre to the node network that will deliver minimum connection speeds of 12 megabits per second to 98 per cent of the country – the remaining 2 per cent will receive a standard of service which depending on the available technology will be as close as possible to that delivered by the fibre to the node network”.
We call on the Senate to support this second reading amendment. In government, Labor will retain the Higher Education Endowment Fund. But, unlike the current government, we will guarantee that the money generated from its investments will be allocated to universities in a manner that is open, transparent, accountable and in the overall interests of the nation. That is what Labor is about: rebuilding our national innovation system and ensuring that we have adequate support for our major national research facilities.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION ENDOWMENT FUND BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2007-09-19,"—While I am sure we could have listened to Senator Carr all day on these issues—
—No!
—time is up. I think that suggestion of ‘No!’ came from his own side. This is groundhog day for us. We have been doing this—that is, analysing and commenting on higher education policy—for 10 years at least, so I always enjoy the possibility of a debate with Senator Carr.
I also rise to speak on the Higher Education Endowment Fund Bill 2007 and the Higher Education Endowment Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2007 as the higher education spokesperson for the Australian Democrats. I begin just where Senator Carr ended—that is, that we debate this legislation on the day after a vital OECD report was released which demonstrated that our country is the only developed country apparently to cut public spending on tertiary education in the decade to 2004. When you look at the table in that report, as I have had the opportunity to do, as well as at the media reports today, it is very clear that Australia is lagging behind the rest of the world when it comes to government contributions to university funding. According to the Age article today:
The OECD found private spending soared—
soared—
mainly due to students leaving university with a greater debt after the federal government lifted maximum HECS fees in 1997.
Unsurprisingly, the government has challenged these statistics. I particularly like the comment from the Minister for Education, Science and Training quoted in the paper today:
… the OECD analysis was flawed because it counted HECS and government full-fee loans as money paid by students …
Der! It is money paid by students. Doesn’t the minister get it? People are repaying these loans, these debts—their HECS. The debate takes place today within the context of, yes, 11 years of blatant underfunding; 11 years of fee hikes and increased loans and charges; deregulation and further deregulation of the postgraduate sector; almost total deregulation, it seems at the moment, of the undergraduate sector; and, of course, paltry, miniscule movement on the issue of student income support. As I say every time, we know that this is a fundamental, absolutely vital issue, a key issue, when it comes to increasing participation in education across the board and higher education specifically, especially for those groups that come from traditionally disadvantaged backgrounds.
With that context in mind, yes, the Senate can welcome the legislation before it today, albeit that it is quite skeletal legislation, quite a framework of legislation, but not nearly as detailed or as specific as it should be. It certainly has some key flaws, some of which have been referred to by Senator Carr in his comments, particularly in relation to the powers of the minister—that is, ministerial discretion—and a lack of accountability and transparency in some of the roles of the minister and responsibilities when it comes to the decisions, for example, of the board.
The government’s Higher Education Endowment Fund announcement in the budget was indeed a surprise and a welcome surprise in many respects. The recent announcement, too, of an additional $1 billion to be added to the fund out of the massive budget surplus in this country is also welcome. The two announcements represent a long-overdue investment in the higher education sector in this country, a sector that has been long starved of funds. So no wonder the sector generally and legislators are pathetically grateful for what has been given as part of the budget this year.
As I say—and many commentators have made this point—and as Senator Carr said before me, it has to be seen within the context of 11 years of underfunding of the higher education sector, starting, of course, with some $1.8 billion of cuts back in 1996. As I mentioned, since then we have seen increases in fees, loans and charges—and do not forget the implementation of so-called voluntary student unionism. They have been just a few of the radical reforms under this government, in some cases aided and abetted by Independent senators.
The cost to the sector of inadequate indexation has now blown out to around $1.5 billion. The shortfall has been made up from university operating budgets. VSU has stripped around $160 million alone from annual contributions—funds that we know were used for sporting and other recreational facilities, student welfare and other services, and, of course, representation. These services are now either existing on voluntary student contributions—representing a mere fraction of their previous income—or being assisted, once again, through university operating grants, and there is more and more demand on those particular university operating budgets.
In that context, a regular stream of grants for capital works or research facilities will certainly be put to good use by the higher education sector. There is much support for this initiative—I do not doubt it. But we need to make sure we do not get too carried away with the headline figures. Yes, a $6 billion investment fund sounds very impressive. But it is expected to translate into between $300 million and maybe $450 million per annum in competitive grants, according to the government’s own figures. Do not get me wrong; the Australian Democrats do not oppose the idea of a long-term capital fund that can provide returns in perpetuity. We think the government is definitely getting much mileage out of the overall $6 billion invested in this fund. But I think that is actually quite misleading, and perhaps even more misleading was the minister’s statement from her budget press release, where she indicated that ‘a dividend of around $900 million over three years from 2008-09’ could be expected—and this was with the original investment of $5 billion.
Evidence to the Senate committee from Bruce Gregor of Mercer Investment Consulting suggests that the government’s estimates are quite optimistic, even with the $1 billion extra that has been contributed to the fund. You would know this, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall, because you were there. I sat next to you for the committee hearings while we frantically used our calculators to work out exactly what this would mean on an annual basis. Mr Gregor suggested that an aggressive investment position could be expected to yield inflation plus four to six per cent in returns, which equals a dividend of around $240 million and $360 million for grants on a $6 billion fund. However, due to volatility and the requirement in the legislation to preserve the initial capital first and foremost—an understandable part of the legislation, arguably—a defensive strategy is necessarily required in the short term which is likely to yield a return of inflation plus two per cent.
With the United States showing some signs of heading into recession, and given the recent market volatility, you have to wonder what returns are likely from this fund in the near future when there is a clear and understandable intention to preserve its real value. If the government has reason to believe that the returns over the short term will be higher than those indicated by Mr Gregor then I am happy for them to explain that today. Perhaps the minister would take that on board and give us some of the financial modelling behind their estimates as to whether it will be greater or otherwise. Otherwise, I think we need to conclude that the impact of this fund will be seen further into the future than indeed the government would have us believe.
I also want to sound a note of caution regarding the government’s expectations that this fund will serve as some kind of ideal mechanism through which to attract a greater level of philanthropic donations to higher education institutions. Again, this was another area of debate and questioning during the Senate committee process. I agree with the government that this is a worthy goal and I commend the government’s focus in the area, though I will quickly rescind that if they see any improvement in this area as just another excuse to remove or rescind government funding to the area of higher education. However, as it stands, philanthropic donations need to be donated unconditionally. They will simply disappear into the fund itself, to be disbursed as the respective advisory boards and ministers see fit. For some people that may be fine; that may be how they want their donations to take place. Most philanthropic donors, I might suggest, like to feel some connection to the cause that they are contributing to. Again, this was evidence that we heard at the Senate inquiry. They are often more motivated to donate to specific causes that personally resonate with them. The more general the fund, the less likely, arguably, it is to attract support.
At the moment, philanthropic donations to the fund are handled in what I would describe as a very general fashion indeed. I note the minister’s intention to seek advice on how the management of philanthropic donations could be altered to allow donors more control over how their funds are used. I look forward to any announcements in this regard. But, until these are forthcoming, I do not expect this fund to be the catalyst for philanthropy that the government seems to suggest.
Over the long term, even with a more limited grant stream than the government is advertising, this fund should be more valuable than if the government were to award the whole lot now. The key difficulty, though, for us here is that we cannot really anticipate exactly how it will impact on the higher education sector because, once again, the Senate is being asked to rubber-stamp an initiative when we have been given little information and little detail on how it will actually work. This is a key issue. Even money given with the best intentions can have unintended consequences. This fund is no exception. There are a couple of factors that concern me about the direction in which this fund could go.
Firstly, the media release from the minister said that the HEEF advisory board would ‘take into consideration whether universities had been able to raise matching funds’. There is no doubt that such a requirement would favour the more established universities, particularly the Group of Eight universities, over the smaller regional ones and other institutions. I note the remark by the minister in her media release that proposals which ‘support Australian government policy with respect to diversity, specialisation and responsiveness to labour market needs’ would be favoured.
So there is a clear indication that certain types of projects that fulfil the government’s ideals would be favoured. This was further reiterated by the Department of Education, Science and Training in the submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Education inquiry. Eh? What is going on here? I thought this was supposed to be about infrastructure and research facilities. What does responsiveness to labour market needs have to do with anything in this debate? What does it have to do with the allocation of these particular funds? Does this mean that universities that are more active in putting their staff on AWAs might be frontrunners when it comes to handing out grants under the fund? If not, what does it mean? I implore the government to explain: what does that sentence mean? It has certainly struck a note of caution for some of us. I am very concerned by that statement from the minister. It makes me wonder whether this fund is some kind of stick, disguised as a carrot, with which to bludgeon the sector into adopting a broader government ideology. Before anyone chokes on their Weeties, we have seen blackmail measures through higher education legislation before, particularly in relation to Commonwealth grants and industrial relations. But I digress.
There is a problem here: we really do not have the details to be able to answer some of these questions. I know that the government today will use its numbers in this place to pass legislation with the bare minimum of detail, and legislation that gives the minister incredibly broad powers to implement the program as she sees fit—or, indeed, as does any minister in the future. As read, division 2 of this bill gives the minister the power to appoint the members of the advisory board, to terminate their appointment and to give them written directions about their functions and how they perform them. Under section 45, the minister can authorise grants with little apparent reference to recommendations from the advisory board. Presumably the minister will also hold the authority to determine the all-important program guidelines that will establish eligibility and merit criteria for the competitive application process.
This is an all too familiar trend that we have seen in this place of consolidating power for the executive government. There are not nearly enough protections or safeguards in this legislation. Indeed, the extent of ministerial discretion in this bill was noted by the Group of Eight, by the National Tertiary Education Union and by the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies, whom I note went to the point of stating that the Higher Education Endowment Fund runs the risk of being a significant slush fund for ministerial pork-barrelling. No-one wants that, so why not clean it up? Why not tighten some of the provisions in the act?
That is what the Democrats will attempt to do. I will have a series of amendments that deal with some of these issues of accountability, transparency and the advisory board. That is because I believe this is an important scheme. That is because I am happy to see increased investment in the sector, especially if we are realistically talking about the kind of money that the government has talked about—$6 billion. I want to ensure that it is used in a way that is good for universities, good for the sector and good for the community but that it is done in a way that is completely aboveboard, transparent and accountable. I am happy to speak to those amendments in more detail during the committee stage of the bill. Primarily, what I am intending to do is to amend the bill so that it is more specific about the composition of the advisory board and so that it requires the minister to table the recommendations of the advisory board. I think that is a pretty basic amendment. I would also like to make the program guidelines a disallowable instrument so that the parliament and, through us, the community and specifically the sector will be able to ensure that we are not merely signing off on funding that will have an impact on the sector which was not intended. So it will be making sure that the guidelines are not only public, as they will be, but also disallowable, so that there is a role for the parliament in that process.
The idea of these amendments was supported by stakeholders—those who appeared before the Senate inquiry. Indeed, most of these amendments were recommendations or were called for in the submissions that were put forward by the relevant sector groups who appeared before the committee. So I hope that senators will look at them objectively. They are not particularly radical or unprecedented, but they ensure that there are further safeguards built into the legislation and that there is some check on ministerial power and discretion.
I am happy to state that this is a welcome initiative. There are many unaddressed areas of the higher education sector in relation to funding. Obviously, the big, outstanding one is adequate, appropriate and realistic indexation. Who is tackling that? Don’t tell me that the Labor Party is tackling it. I note the comments in the paper today from Stephen Smith, the education spokesperson for the opposition. He said that the OECD report showed 11 years of underinvestment and neglect under the coalition. Yes, big tick—right on! Mr Smith said that Labor was committed to increasing funding at every level, but he would not give details. Not give details! Isn’t it time we should be getting details?
At least today I know a little bit more about the government’s position on higher education funding. Actually, having said that, I have probably known a lot about the government’s position over the last 11 years and have not necessarily liked it, but at least I have known the position. I say to Labor colleagues in this place: give us a little more detail. What are you going to do on indexation? What is going to happen on income support? Please do not tell me that you are going to emulate the pathetic approach of this government to student income support. Okay, so we have had a little win, and, yes, the Democrats are thrilled that the student income support bill will come before the Senate this week, ensuring rent assistance to Austudy recipients. Yes, I have been working on that for a long time. I am happy to see it. But it is nothing in the context of the broader issues that need to be addressed in relation to income support. When is the government going to respond to the Democrat initiated Senate inquiry into student income support? That was the first Senate inquiry that looked at those issues specifically. Isn’t the convention three months to respond? What are we up to? Three years? That was the last election. This government is not going to touch indexation. Is the next government, whether a Labor government or a coalition government? What are you going to do—either side? What are you going to do about student income support to realistically invest, particularly in those aspiring students who come from backgrounds that are disadvantaged? There are so many outstanding areas and I do not hear the requisite detail from either side.
We are feeling a bit bolshie today and are not going to support the Labor amendment. The Australian Democrats do not just want rhetoric from either side. We want a bit more detail. And I have to say that I am inclined to agree with Senator Carr on a lot of things, including about three-quarters of the amendment, as I recall. The bit about broadband is a bit too propagandish. They are good points, but, no, we are not supporting that today. We are going to move substantive amendments to the legislation that actually back this up with some detail, some transparency and some accountability. I implore colleagues to consider those amendments. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION ENDOWMENT FUND BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2007-09-19,"—Today, as a government senator, I proudly stand here on behalf of the government supporting both the Higher Education Endowment Fund Bill 2007 and the Higher Education Endowment Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2007. I want to say at the outset that government of any persuasion cannot make these sorts of investments and bold policy pronouncements without managing the economy well. You cannot do it without managing the economy well and you cannot do it without eliminating, for example, government debt, which is what this government has done. We have delivered successive budget surpluses and, as a result of that strong economic management, can now make this decision in legislation which is, in my view, vision in action. It is an investment of $6 billion into the future of Australia’s higher education sector. You cannot invest that type of money into any sector—let alone the higher education sector—for the future of our children and for the future of this nation when you are saddled with debt and running budget deficits. That is exactly what the previous Labor government did in this country.
So I want to salute, right up-front, the leadership of our federal Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Hon. Julie Bishop. She has been outstanding and has performed brilliantly in this role. She has taken this bold approach with the full support of the cabinet: Mr Howard, Mr Costello and the rest of the leadership team. She has the full support of the government senators. This is vision in action, where we are planning for the future. We are not dealing with the problems of the past. Many of those have been dealt with. There is still more work to do, but this is visionary legislation. It is planning for the future. As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Education, I want to acknowledge, in her absence, the work of our chairman, Senator Judith Troeth, who is not here, for personal reasons, but who I know would like to stand here and strongly support this legislation.
The government senators’ report is available. It is a public document. In fact, the entire Senate committee report is a public document. I note with thanks that Labor senators—including you, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall, who signed this particular report as deputy chairman—have supported the bills and that Senator Stott Despoja has welcomed the legislation, notwithstanding the various reservations that she has made about it. In respect of the report, I thank the committee secretariat for the work that was done to pull it together and I thank all my Senate colleagues on that particular committee for the work that was undertaken and the hearings that we had, including in Melbourne. The principle of the bill is to provide an additional income stream for universities, and that was widely supported. In fact, I think it was pretty much supported across the board—by all the witnesses and by all the submissions that we received.
The Higher Education Endowment Fund legislation will significantly increase the funds that are available to be invested in the higher education sector. As I said, this investment has been enthusiastically welcomed by that sector. There has been a lot said from the opposition benches and by Senator Stott Despoja in respect of the investment of that fund. I want to touch on that before talking about some other matters in respect of the bill. Yes, it is difficult to predict the returns of the investments under that fund, particularly in the short term, in light of the volatility of the various stock markets and investment regimes around the world. But it is noted that the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies estimated that the HEEF is likely to provide a funding stream of $300 to $400 million per year. Professor Richard Larkins, on behalf of Universities Australia, indicated an estimated potential funding stream of approximately $400 to $500 million per annum. It is noted that the Treasurer’s Budget Paper No. 2 lists a national return of just over $300 million for each year of the 2008-11 triennium.
Of course, there will be ups and downs, particularly in the short term. But in the short term, medium term and long term, HEEF is going to deliver real benefits for the university sector. I want to say right up-front that something that I learnt during the Senate inquiry was that there would be a doubling of funding to this sector of all existing financial investments and endowments currently held in the university sector. Professor Richard Larkins indicated that he estimated that it is currently at around $2.5 billion. So this will be a doubling or, in fact, perhaps more than a doubling of all of the existing financial investments and endowments currently held in this sector. This is fantastic news for the university sector. It is fantastic news for tertiary education in Australia and our future wellbeing as a nation in terms of our productivity and the economy. I say again that none of these decisions could have been made without the economy being well managed. The investment of the endowment fund will be managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians, with operational support provided by the Future Fund Management Agency. Another great initiative of Treasurer Costello and our government was the Future Fund. It is fantastic; it is planning for the future. And the benefits will flow through to our children and, hopefully, their children and on and on. This is vision in action. This is a similar principle applying in that regard.
In fact, this is an unprecedented investment in higher education in Australia. It will be a perpetual fund, so the future capital and research facility needs of the sector will be assured, supported and encouraged for years to come. Further contributions to the fund will depend on whether our economy is managed well. There will be a risk to the economy being managed well if the opposition is successful at the election. The Australian people have a choice of going down the path of risk or having the economy managed well and successfully. The choice we face in the weeks and months ahead is about whether the Leader of the Opposition, with his superficial facade, and the opposition are going to have a chance to wreck our economy or not.
I want to touch on a few of the benefits under this legislation, particularly the philanthropy aspects of the legislation. Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Carr referred to this, but in my view they did not give due acknowledgement to the importance of this theme flowing through this legislation. The endowment fund will send a clear message to the community that we should provide greater philanthropic support to universities. It will send that very important message not only for years but for decades, and that is good. Our higher education institutions have not been as successful as their competitors overseas in attracting philanthropic donations. In fact, Minister Bishop has advised that less than two per cent of the income of Australian universities comes from philanthropic donations. That is a small percentage in anybody’s book. In comparable universities overseas, it can be as high as 15 or 20 per cent.
The Senate committee considered this matter and, in the government senators’ report, we referred to the figures of two per cent of income in Australia coming from philanthropic donations and 15 per cent of income overseas coming from philanthropic donations. At page 20 of our report we say:
… the Minister stated that Australian higher education institutions have not been as successful as their overseas competitors in attracting philanthropic donations.
…            …            …
The Government has therefore created a new avenue for business and the general public to make philanthropic donations to the higher education sector, and signal to the community that greater philanthropic support to universities should be provided.
We discussed this and we asked questions about it in the Senate committee inquiry. It was clear to us that the funding would be not just for research purposes or block funding but could be for strategic purposes. I asked questions about whether it could be targeted towards health services. Other senators asked about other aspects of concern to them. Basically the answer is yes. There are certain parameters and criteria with respect to that funding and tax deductability. In that regard, we are advised that the advisory board and the department will be consulting with the university sector about how to encourage future investments. They will be looking at tax deductions for research into certain areas, including health, diabetes and a whole range of other areas of interest. It was noted that this will be a great boost to the university sector throughout. This government has created a new avenue for business and the general public to make those donations.
In the first instance, the bill provides that tax deductable gifts of money to the endowment fund will only be able to be accepted on an unconditional basis. That was noted, but the government indicated that contributions could be earmarked for particular universities and that universities could choose to have their own philanthropic funds managed along with the endowment fund. This is an important point and I am sure that the universities will themselves look at this possibility, with respect to the management of their own investment funds, to see if they can make a difference and get a better return on funds invested for those particular universities.
According to the minister, these issues will be addressed following more detailed consultation with the higher education sector and the board of guardians, and the government may then consider amendments to the legislation. So watch this space. We are always looking to improve our legislative framework and our policy framework to encourage good policy and to encourage further investment in the tertiary education sector. I think the runs are on the board and this is actually being delivered.
We have had allegations from the other side and the crossbenches with respect to the lack of investment in the tertiary education sector. I reject those allegations out of hand. I want to compare the funding that the Australian government was contributing back in 1995-96 and what it is contributing now. This financial year alone the government will invest $8 billion in universities, a 31 per cent increase since 1995-96. This year the Australian government is providing an investment of $9 billion in education, science and training, including the centrepiece of this year’s budget, the Higher Education Endowment Fund. This builds on an investment of over $56 billion made by this government in higher education, including research infrastructure for the sector. In fact, we have freed up the sector. We have provided an injection of funds, not just from government but across the board, and that is where the benefits will flow.
During the inquiry, I, as a Tasmanian senator, asked whether the Australian Maritime College will have an opportunity to apply for a benefit from such an investment. The answer was yes. The AMC will, of course, soon be part of the University of Tasmania. The University of Tasmania has plans for growth, and I believe the endowment fund will support the University of Tasmania very significantly. They have plans to grow from 12½ thousand full-time student equivalents to 15,000 by 2010 and to 20,000 by 2020. They have already grown from 10,000 in 2000 to 12½ thousand in 2004.
The planned growth for 2020 will result in an estimated total contribution to the gross product in my state by the University of Tasmania of $425 million or three per cent. That is around the same impact as interstate holiday visitors and around half the total impact of tourism. The University of Tasmania is one of the major employers in Tasmania and, for every increase of 100 effective full-time equivalent students at the university, the contribution to the economy is: $1.6 million to the real GSP, with a total of $130 million more by 2020; $1.9 million to real consumption spending, with a total of $138 million more by 2020; and 26 new full-time equivalent Tasmanian jobs, with 800 by 2010, doubling to 1,600 by 2020. Interstate students will contribute $6 million more by 2010 and $14 million more by 2020.
That is a great result. I congratulate Professor Daryl Le Grew and his team at the University of Tasmania on the work that they have been doing in growing the university and on its success. I know that the federal member for Bass, Michael Ferguson, is working very hard on getting further and better support.
—He is a very good member.
—That is right, Senator Cormann. He is a good member for Bass; thank you for that. He is working with the university to see what more he can do on behalf of the Australian government to support them and his constituents in the electorate of Bass. I know that likewise Mark Baker, the federal member for Braddon—
—Another good member.
—Thank you, Senator Birmingham. I agree with you. He works so hard. He is delivering for the north-west coast. I know that he is very supportive of the University of Tasmania and of the infrastructure and students they have on the north-west coast. He is doing everything he can to see if he can better those outcomes for the university.
So there are some things that are being delivered. I believe this legislation will deliver distinct and specific benefits to the University of Tasmania. I know that the Liberal Senate team are right behind and are very supportive of this particular legislation because of its vision and action. It is fully supported.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION ENDOWMENT FUND BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2007-09-19,"—I rise today to speak on the Higher Education Endowment Fund Bill 2007 and the Higher Education Endowment Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2007. Both of these bills were referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Education for inquiry and report. The Higher Education Endowment Fund Bill 2007 establishes the Higher Education Endowment Fund, a perpetual endowment fund to generate earnings for capital expenditure and research facilities in higher education institutions. The Higher Education Endowment Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2007 amends the Future Fund Act 2006 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to support the implementation of the Higher Education Endowment Fund.
The Higher Education Endowment Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2007 provides that investments made by the Future Fund Board of Guardians will be determined by the Future Fund Board of Guardians, not by ministerial direction, and also specifies that responsible ministers cannot direct the Future Fund Board of Guardians to use the assets of the Future Fund to invest in particular assets.
By the government’s own analysis, Australian universities have a significant backlog of deferred infrastructure maintenance. The Department of Education, Science and Training estimated this backlog at $1.5 billion for the university sector as late as last year. When the EWRE committee looked at the HEEF legislation, this exact point was made by several submissions, including by the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies, the Group of Eight universities and the National Tertiary Education Union. The Group of Eight universities went even further than the department, estimating that the total of the deferred maintenance liabilities was $1.53 billion across the Group of Eight universities alone.
The main reason behind this backlog is that, since it came to power more than 11 years ago, the Howard government has undermined the higher education sector. It is not just Labor that makes this point. Numerous submissions to the committee of inquiry hearing into these two pieces of legislation pointed out that the Commonwealth government’s underfunding of the university sector since it came to power is a significant contributor to the current situation.
The submission by the Group of Eight noted that:
While $6 billion is a large amount of money it needs to be viewed in the context of recent funding trends for Australia’s public universities, the recurrent expenses and infrastructure challenges they now face ...
It is worth looking at the Howard government’s record on higher education investments since it was elected in 1996. As the Group of Eight have openly acknowledged, the Howard government’s first budget in 1996 slashed university operating grants by a cumulative six per cent over the forward estimates from 1997 to 2000, resulting in an $850 million cut to the sector. Not surprisingly, this has had significant flow-on effects in subsequent years as universities have dealt with the impact of those cuts. Universities Australia have confirmed that the government’s funding cuts to university operating grants since 1996 have put greater financial pressure on university finances and, following on from this, the services and quality of education they then provide.
Recent work undertaken by Universities Australia has demonstrated that funding shortfalls by the Commonwealth and the inadequate indexation formula have had a direct impact on teaching quality. That work shows that, since 1995, student to staff ratios have increased, with the result that students today receive less time one-on-one with their lecturers and tutors than their counterparts 12 years ago. According to this study, the student to staff ratio today is 20.4 compared to 14.6 in 1995. This assessment was reinforced by the Group of Eight’s submission, which stated that the implications of funding pressures faced by universities today include: even larger increases in student to staff ratios, with implications for quality of teaching and learning; reductions in academic salaries relative to average wages, with implications for the sector’s ability to attract talented candidates; and the deferment of essential expenditure on the maintenance of buildings and facilities, with long-term consequences for the quality of essential infrastructure.
Australia’s education system now relies on private financing more than all other OECD countries bar the US, Japan and South Korea. More than half of the cost of tertiary education today is met from private sources, with dependence on private sources having increased to 52 per cent from 35 per cent in 1995. As a proportion of total revenue, Commonwealth grants to universities have decreased from 57 per cent of their revenue in 1996 to 41 per cent in 2004. At the same time, university revenue derived from fees and charges has increased from 13 per cent in 1996 to 24 per cent in 2004.
The government is often heard justifying this situation by stating that tertiary spending has increased by 25 per cent since 1996. Whilst that may be true, enrolments have increased by more than double that since 1996. As a consequence, the average amount of Commonwealth funding per student in real terms has declined by nearly $1,500, while student HECS contributions have increased by nearly $2,000 and fees and charges have increased by over $3,000. It is a sign of what a clever politician Mr Howard is when he has Senator Barnett stand up in this place to talk about the real increase in funding, but one only has to step slightly behind those figures to see an absolute demonstration of how much money has actually been cut from this sector by this government.
The provisions of the Higher Education Endowment Fund Bill have been modelled on the provisions of the Future Fund Act 2006. The bill provides the Future Fund Board of Guardians with statutory powers to manage the investments of the Higher Education Endowment Fund. The bill also provides that, as per the Future Fund Act, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Administration are the responsible ministers. In this capacity they will issue directions to the board about the performance of its investment functions. The board is therefore accountable to the Treasurer and the finance minister for meeting its obligations to manage the HEEF. The responsible ministers will set rules to determine the maximum amount available for payments from the HEEF and make the determinations to credit government contributions—initially $6 billion—to the fund and any subsequent government contributions.
A HEEF advisory board will be established to provide advice to the education minister on grants. Because of the different nature and intent of the HEEF compared to the Future Fund, the education minister, not the responsible ministers, is responsible for authorising grants of financial assistance to eligible higher education institutions and for appointments to the HEEF advisory board. It is unsurprising that the Higher Education Endowment Fund has been so well supported and welcomed in the higher education sector, given the continued underfunding of the sector by the Commonwealth government.
Putting the favourable reception by a neglected higher education sector to one side, this HEEF proposal is not without some concerns. This is confirmed in the detail of the bills. A central concern is the transparency of ministerial determinations. Under these bills, the education minister determines who sits on the fund’s advisory board and authorises grants of financial assistance to eligible higher education institutions in relation to capital expenditure. There is no direction in the legislation as to the make-up of the advisory board. There are no requirements for sufficient expertise or merit, and many groups have questioned why the responsibilities of the board are not set out in the bills themselves. This provision rings alarm bells, given the history of this government in administering funds on a political rather than a practical basis.
Just recently we saw the Regional Partnerships program used as a pork-barrelling slush fund yet again, although this time it was the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, wanting a slice of the action after watching so many of his National Party colleagues trash due process to reward their own electorate projects. In this latest Regional Partnerships program fiasco, the foreign minister bypassed the standard application process, asked the Prime Minister to intervene and then ignored the relevant department’s advice after an application for funding in his electorate was rejected.
As this government has shown, it falls prey to temptation when it comes to subverting proper process for its own political advantage. These bills must be evaluated on the basis that they will be used for political advantage rather than on the merits of individual proposals. Senator Stott Despoja raised some of those concerns on behalf of the Democrats. I suspect that in future the strategic consideration of Liberal Party and National Party electoral prospects will have more influence than any strategic consideration of the sector’s infrastructure needs. I thought that the FASTS submission put it best when they stated that, in its current form, the fund is in effect ‘a significant slush fund for ministerial pork-barrelling’.
On top of this, there is no requirement that the advisory board’s recommendations or any variations to those recommendations be made public. It is not surprising that the Howard government prefer no public scrutiny when it comes to public money, as they seem to treat it as their own. Such is their arrogance after 11 years in government. The legislation does not even set out in any detail the rules by which funding will be distributed under the HEEF program.
In the event of a negative return for the fund, when there is little or no income, the fund will not release money. This would have the effect that the fund would not discharge any of the $300 million forecast by the Howard government. This has implications for eligible higher education providers that may be relying on being awarded approval for HEEF funds for infrastructure projects. There is little detail provided as to the investment strategy being considered by the board of guardians, including the time frame and scope of investments being made on behalf of the Commonwealth. Are the board of guardians considering an investment approach in the first few years that will not allow for returns to be released to eligible higher education providers? Nobody, at this point, seems to know. If this were the case, it would be at odds with the budget papers, which forecast an estimated average six per cent return per year.
This $300 million forecast is one that deserves to be looked at in detail. While the government is happy to trumpet this announcement, in reality there will be no sizeable return until late 2008, given the transfers to the HEEF will be made at the end of October 2007 and then at the end of January 2008. Based on the evidence presented by the government’s own Department of Education, Science and Training, and by Mercer Investment Consulting, the fund will struggle to deliver $300 million per year in the first years of its operation.
I found it interesting that the provision in the Higher Education Endowment Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2007 specifying that the responsible ministers cannot direct the Future Fund Board of Guardians to use the assets of the Future Fund to invest in a particular asset was commented upon by the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Nick Minchin. He claimed that this amendment was to ‘stop the Labor Party robbing future generations by raiding the Future Fund, taking its annual earnings and dictating to the board that it should invest its money in advancing Labor’s political interests’.
I know that the senator is worried that we may seek to copy their impressive efforts in subverting due process when administering funding. Whether it be aged-care bed licences, Senator Boswell’s mysterious entitlements, the Regional Partnerships program or the shemozzle that is the broadband network tender process, I can assure the good senator that he should not be worried. We will not be emulating such amazing feats of political favour, ignoring process whenever and wherever. We are guided by the concepts of good governance, transparency and accountability—concepts which some government members think belong to another language. When these concepts are talked about by Kevin Rudd, most government members think that he is lapsing into Mandarin, such is their understanding of the principles of good governance.
Should we be entrusted by the Australian people to govern, Labor has given the commitment to restore transparency and accountability to government programs. Labor supports the Future Fund and is committed to the Future Fund objective of meeting public sector superannuation liabilities. The current coalition government has no plans for long-term investment in infrastructure. In contrast, Labor will invest future surpluses in the Building Australia Fund and make earnings available for infrastructure investment, with investment priorities recommended by Infrastructure Australia. Labor is committed to investing up to $2.7 billion in a national broadband network, with earnings reinvested in the Future Fund. Along with contributions from the private sector, the $2 billion Communications Fund will be used to help build the national broadband network which this country so desperately requires.
Labor supports the establishment of the Higher Education Endowment Fund. This is in line with the submissions received by the EWRE committee on the bills and in light of the evidence presented by the higher education sector to the committee. The measure to establish a Higher Education Endowment Fund is a welcome one. Indeed, the measure to increase Commonwealth funding for infrastructure purposes is long overdue and comes after years of neglect by the Howard government of our higher education sector.
We could do with some positive policies in this sector after such a long line of spectacular policy failures. Here are just a few to jog the memory. There are now more than 100 degrees offered by public universities that cost in excess of $100,000, and this has occurred despite the Prime Minister’s promise that ‘there will be no $100,000 university degrees under this government’. There are now degrees at public universities that cost more than $200,000. You can get into a full-fee degree with a mark 20 per cent worse than your HECS counterparts if you have the money to pay the full fee. VSU legislation has destroyed student services and campus amenities. Work Choices is being forced onto universities through funding arrangements, with further restrictions to come as university workers have voted with their feet by rejecting AWAs in favour of collective agreements.
Having brought down the quality of education, services and access across the higher education sector, the government has now firmly set its sights on trade skills and training. Given the current skills shortages, we must take action now. However, for this government action means a poor-quality quick fix, a dumbing down of trades qualifications and a lack of concerted effort to work with the three largest stakeholders in Australia—industry, the states and the Australian people.
The choice is now very clear. Australians can vote for a tired, arrogant and out-of-touch government who believe public money is their own and whose answer to problems with productivity and skills shortages is to slash wages and working conditions of ordinary Australian workers. Or they can vote for a party which believes education is the engine room of the economy, that education is about fairness—a party that believes helping Australians foster and create new skills through education and training is the pathway to prosperity.
Labor sees education and training as being about the economy and about opportunity. We see education as a means not only to learn and earn, but also to inspire creativity and innovation. Education, skills and training are the pathway out of poverty. They are the pathway to a career, security and a decent standard of living. We want education and training to be about lifelong learning. From the cradle to the classroom, from the living room to the workplace, we need to keep investing in ourselves, in our skills and therefore in our future. No matter where you are from, or how much money you have, you should still get a great education. That is our goal. We want education to be for the many and not just the few.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION ENDOWMENT FUND BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2007-09-19,"—I support the Higher Education Endowment Fund Bill 2007 and I seek leave to incorporate my speech on the second reading in Hansard.
Leave granted.

The speech read as follows—

Mr President, I wholeheartedly support this Government’s moves to establish a Higher Education Endowment Fund to secure the financial future of Australia’s world-class universities. I think it is further proof of this Government’s strong economic leadership that it has not only brought about a significant budget surplus for several years running now, but that it has had the foresight to invest part of this surplus in education—one of the most important investments that can be made for Australia’s future.
That said, I wish to make a contribution to this debate on the consequential amendments created by the Higher Education Endowment Fund Bill because there is an important change contained in these amendments, and a change which will potentially affect many thousands of people in my community of the Australian Capital Territory.
This Bill will expand the role of the Future Fund Board of Guardians to include the management of the Higher Education Endowment Fund. This is a sensible move, as it will ensure that this fund is responsibly and appropriately managed by people who have experience in managing big investments on behalf of the Australian community. But more importantly, Section 18A of this Bill will protect both the Future Fund and the Higher Education Endowment Fund from intervention or meddling by Government Ministers of any persuasion, and for that, many thousands of Commonwealth Superannuants in my electorate will be extremely thankful.
Specifically, section 18A prevents the Treasurer or the Finance Minister directing the Board of Guardians to invest in a particular financial asset, acquire a particular derivative or allocate financial assets to a particular business entity or a particular business. The effect of this will be that no Government, of whatever political inclination, will be able to direct how or where the money from these funds is spent. The Future Fund, and with it the Higher Education Endowment Fund, will become a locked box. It is impossible to overstate the importance of this section 18A, particularly when we have an alternative Government who have clearly stated their intention to treat the Future Fund less like a locked box, and more like a piggy bank to be cracked open whenever they hear the ice-cream truck of wild ideas coming down the street.
The Future Fund was set up to meet the unfunded superannuation liabilities of thousands of past and present Commonwealth Public Servants. It was set up so that those who have spent their careers working diligently on behalf of the Commonwealth will receive every cent they are entitled to in retirement. It was set up to allow future governments to meet their legal and social responsibilities to today’s workers, without bankrupting future generations in the process. It was not set up so that future governments could dip into it at will to fund the promises which they are banking on to secure election later this year.
And yet that is exactly what the Labor Party is proposing to do. Despite criticising this Government in the past for not making the Future Fund enough of a ‘locked box’, Labor is now proposing to dip into the fund and swipe $2 billion to pay for their half-baked broadband scheme. They want to take $2 billion out of the pockets of retirees and older Australians to pay for a broadband plan that won’t reach all Australians, won’t deliver services to the bush, and won’t address inherent infrastructure problems with existing telecommunications technology. Our Government has a plan to use a mix of wireless, ADSL and satellite technology—and a mix of public and private investment—to provide high speed coverage to 99% of the Australian population at very little cost, and will have this service up and running within two years. By contrast, Labor wants to drain the $2 billion Communications Fund and take $2 billion from the Future Fund to pay for a plan which will leave many Australians to wallow in coverage black holes, and which won’t even be up and running within this decade.
This is Labor’s so-called ‘Broadband Future’, and Commonwealth superannuants are expected to pay for it with their hard-earned entitlements. Perhaps it wouldn’t be so bad if it were only $2 billion they proposed to spend, but Labor’s Lindsay Tanner has also repeatedly refused to rule out further raids on the fund. He has refused to say what else Labor might use the Future Fund and its interest for, or how much might be left over for its intended purpose of paying superannuation entitlements when they’ve finished frittering it away on pointless broadband plans, consultative committees and advisory groups. This willingness on the part of Labor to pick superannuant pockets to pay for their promises begs a rather serious question: does Labor care about Commonwealth public servants at all?
Perhaps they don’t, Mr President, and perhaps they take these public servants and their roles for granted, and therein lies the problem. From the top of the party down to the local apparatchiks we see nothing but disdain for the public service, and hear nothing but loud rhetoric about big spending cuts which will put jobs at risk and severely curtail the important work our public servants do. Although my colleagues and I on this side of the house seriously doubt Labor’s ability to make these cuts given the dodgy maths their claims are based on, the fact is that they have long had the public service in their sights.
As if it isn’t bad enough that this is the case, as if it isn’t worrying enough that Labor is talking about cutting billions of dollars from the budgets of dozens of Departments, now they also want to rob those public servants who manage to hang on to their jobs long enough to accrue superannuation of this entitlement! Let’s be completely upfront about this: robbing the Future Fund is robbing from Commonwealth superannuants. Labor’s plan to raid the Future Fund amounts to a raid on the secure futures of many thousands of Commonwealth public servants.
There are some senior Labor figures that do not seem to have a problem with this. For example, in August this year in a debate on communications infrastructure, former Labor Leader Simon Crean told the Parliament: “The government’s solution is to put [savings] into the Future Fund, which does what? It meets the unfunded superannuation liabilities of who? Commonwealth public servants. Why should the nation’s savings be used for such a limited purpose? Why should the Future Fund be used to pay only the superannuation liabilities of Commonwealth public servants? Apparently, to Mr Crean, providing for the retirement of many thousands of Commonwealth workers is a “limited purpose”. Apparently, Labor doesn’t think this is a worthwhile way to spend a portion of the nation’s savings.
Well, I do. As Senator for the ACT, the territory where so many public servants are based, I know very well the contribution these workers make, and how hard they work on behalf of the Government of the day – whoever that Government may be. I know that many public servants spend their entire working lives within the service, accumulating a wealth of valuable experience and knowledge which Governments often rely on to guide their decision-making. And I believe that these workers, like all other Australians, have the right to know that when the time comes, their employer will be able to pay their superannuation entitlements, not turn around and say ‘Sorry, but we spent it all on broadband and some other stuff that seemed like a good idea at the time.’
This is why this Bill is so important, and why I am pleased to lend my support to it, particularly section 18A. It may seem as though this Bill just ties up the legislative loose ends surrounding the creation of the Higher Education Endowment Fund, but in reality, there is a much more important question at stake. That is: do we lock the Future Fund away from interference by governments so that it is able to meet the Commonwealth’s superannuation liabilities into the future, or do we leave it open to raids by any Government which needs a quick cash injection?
I know that I speak for the many thousands of Commonwealth public servants in my electorate when I say that the Future Fund should be treated as a locked box, not a piggy bank, and as an investment for the future, not a source of ready funds today. Commonwealth superannuants have just as much right to a financially secure future as all other Australian workers, and for that reason I would urge my colleagues on both sides of this chamber to support this Bill and save the Future Fund from the grubby hands of a future Labor Government or any others who would try to raid it.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION ENDOWMENT FUND BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2007-09-19,"—I seek leave to incorporate Senator McEwen’s speech on the Higher Education Endowment Fund Bill 2007.
Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION ENDOWMENT FUND BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2007-09-19,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

The Higher Education Endowment Fund Bill 2007 is a small step in the right direction towards providing Australia’s tertiary education institutions with the funding they need and that our nation urgently requires.
The Bill, and the Higher Education Endowment Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2007 follow the Government’s announcement in the 2007-08 Budget to create a continuous endowment fund which is intended to generate earnings to be used for research facilities and capital expenditure in Australia’s higher education institutions.
Labor supports this Bill with some reservations. Like so much of the legislation the Government brings to this chamber, it is too little too late and is a desperate attempt to remedy 11 years of neglect of a sector critical to the future economic and social well being of the nation.
We know that this legislation is here before the Senate only because Labor and Kevin Rudd have put education front and centre for the forthcoming election campaign and a desperate Prime Minister has decided he had better do something to make it look like he really cares about something other than caring about clinging on to power long enough to plan his retirement.
For 11 years the Howard Government has undermined and underfunded the higher education sector and it is only now, on the eve of an election that the Government has chosen to do something that will, hopefully, increase the sector’s funding. This funding mechanism, cumbersome though it is, is welcomed, but is not enough.
The National Tertiary Education Industry Union expressed a similar view stating in its submission to the Senate Enquiry into this Bill that it “acknowledges the Higher Education Endowment Fund does provide additional funding to universities, although we would stress that it in no way makes up for nearly a decade of serious disinvestment by the Commonwealth in Australia’s university system.”

 A vibrant, well funded tertiary sector is a priority for the NTEU—the major union in that sector—but Mr. Howard made it clear from the beginning of his term as Prime Minister that education would not be an area that he would prioritise.
In his very first term of office in 1996, Mr Howard presided over budget cuts to university operating grants of a cumulative 6% from 1997 to 2000. That meant a massive $850 million loss to the sector.
Universities have  attempted to claw back this money somehow, and charging exorbitant amounts for degrees and taking in full fee paying students has been the avenue some have been forced to take.
In 1999, Prime Minister Howard infamously said that ‘The Government will not be introducing an American-style higher education system. There will be no $100 000 university fees under this Government.’ Of course that was another untruth from this Government and the most recent edition of the Good Universities Guide shows that there are now 104 domestic full-fee university degrees that cost in excess of $100 000, three of which cost more that $200 000.
Labor Leader Kevin Rudd made comment the other day about how he had benefited from a free tertiary education thanks to the vision of a former Labor Leader, Gough Whitlam.  Many of us in this Chamber were also beneficiaries of that system and it is depressing to see that in such a short time we have now got a university system that—unless this Government is stopped in its tracks—is fast approaching the bad old days when only the wealthy could afford to contemplate a tertiary eduction.
Unlike the soon to be retiring Prime Minister and the Treasurer, Mr. Costello, who would like to be Prime Minister and who has been instrumental in wrecking our higher education system, Labor on the other hand does support universities and does support students and proudly puts education front and centre of our vision for the future.
We are committed to phasing out domestic full-fee degrees at public universities commencing 1 January 2009 to ensure access for all young Australian students is based on merit rather than financial means.
This Government’s appalling disregard for the nation’s higher education system doesn’t stop at lack of funding. Another attack on our universities was the Howard Government’s introduction of Voluntary Student Unionism—despite the opposition of the sector. That was a spiteful and miserable piece of anti-student legislation which has had a significant impact on universities across the country.
This bullying, extremist Government saw VSU as a way to silence students and—in its usual blinkered, visionless way—failed to see the implications such legislation would have on universities and their surrounding communities. Student unions provide subsidised child care, organise sporting teams, provide free advocacy to students and create vibrant, social campuses. A number of these services provided by student unions were also made available to the local community and this was particularly important in regional areas. Student unions also paid for the maintenance of many buildings on campuses. By introducing VSU the Howard Government put even more financial pressures on universities to provide services and infrastructure on top of an  $850 million budget cut.
The Government’s own analysis has shown that there is a significant backlog of deferred infrastructure maintenance that has built up since 1996 when this Government was first elected.  That deferred maintenance expenditure was estimated by the Department of Education, Science & Training to be at $1.5 billion for the university sector. The Department’s figure appears to be  conservative.  The Group of Eight Universities estimated that the total deferred maintenance liabilities was $1.53 billion in 2006 for the Group of Eight universities alone.
A number of submissions to the Senate Inquiry into this Bill expressed the view that the Government’s under funding of the university sector since it came to power is a significant contributor to the current situation. The funding cuts made by the Howard Government have not only led to the deferment of essential expenditure on the maintenance of buildings and facilities, but have changed the operation of universities. With greater financial pressures, the quality of teaching in the university sector has been difficult to maintain, a situation that negatively affects hundreds of thousands of students across Australia.
According to Universities Australia, the student-staff ratio has gone from 14.6 students per teacher in 1995, to 20.4. The Group of Eight’s submission to the Senate Committee also found that universities have had to reduce academic salaries relative to average wages, making it difficult for the sector to attract top quality staff.
Of course, this Government’s only real contribution to the staffing situation at universities is to tie up administration in red tape, not the least of which is to force universities to offer AWAs as a condition of funding. This is a  classic example of the breathtaking hypocrisy of a Government that spruiks about freedom of association and choice and flexibility but really it is just an  interventionist and overbearing bully that demands the higher ed sector implements the governments IR agenda or risks funding.
The effects of this Government’s under funding of the tertiary sector has had real implications for Australians. Apart from Ireland, Australia spends the least on education of the English-speaking OECD countries.
Another damning statistic is that of the English speaking OECD countries, Australia now ranks second lowest for persons in the age groups 25 – 35 with an upper secondary education. 
These are appalling statistics that show under this Government Australia has not kept pace with our compatriot OECD countries. Instead of facilitating growth, the Government has stopped growth in the education sector.
Australia’s education system now relies on more private financing than all other OECD countries with the exceptions of the United States, Japan and South Korea.
It is an absolute disgrace that during a period of rapid economic growth, largely due to the resources boom—and in a period of huge government surpluses—we fail to provide for our educational institutions. An estimated 52% of the cost of tertiary education today is dependent on private sources, a huge increase from the 1995 figure of 35% dependency on private sources.
So now, in a desperate attempt from a desperate government to address its woeful lack of investment in Australia’s future, we are being asked to support the establishment of the Higher Education Endowment Fund, a financial asset fund consisting of cash and investments.
The Treasurer and the Finance Minister will have the power to credit cash amounts to the Fund through a Special Account which is created by the Bill. These Ministers will also be required to issue an Investment Mandate to the Board regarding the investment of monies in the Fund.
A Higher Education Endowment Fund Advisory Board will also be established. The chief role of this board will be to prepare reports for the nominated Minister as well as keeping the Minister informed on any relevant issues. The nominated Minister is in turn responsible for providing copies of those reports and the annual report to the Education Minister.
The consequential Bill amends the Future Fund Act and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to support the implementation of the Higher Education Endowment Fund. The Bill consists of two primary amendments along with related changes and some minor amendments.
The first primary amendment is the extension of the Board’s functions under the Future Fund Act to include its functions under the HEEF legislation and the second amendment to the Future Fund Act is to ensure that investments will be consistent with the Future Fund’s objectives by including two limitations on its mandate.
Labor will support the Higher Education Endowment Bill 2007 and the Consequential Amendments as we recognise the importance of investing in our tertiary education facilities, particularly after the financial hardship they have faced over the last 11 years. We do, however, have a number of concerns which I would like to outline.
Firstly, the Bill gives the Education Minister of the day an enormous amount of power over the Endowment Fund. The Education Minister will decide who is on the Advisory board, appointing and dismissing members of the board at his or her own will. This allows for an incredibly biased, political board and not the independent board wanted by the sector. The National Tertiary Education Industry Union submitted that:

 ‘Given previous experience of the use of Ministerial power in relation to areas like the Australian Research Council grants process, the interests of transparency and good governance would be better met if the functions and responsibilities of the Board are set out in the Higher Education Endowment Fund Bill 2007. This must include the appointment process, which should be open and transparent.’

Many submissions received outlined another concern in regard to the Advisory Board and that is the credentials of those appointed to the board. It is important that the board is comprised of people who are very experienced in the tertiary education sector so that they will be able to make decisions that will be most beneficial to the sector.
From the submissions received it is clear that for the board to have the confidence of the sector there will need to be appropriate selection criteria. For example, The Australian Academy of Science expressed its hope that members of the Advisory Board will be appointed for their knowledge of the higher education sector, and on the basis that there is no conflict of interest.
The Australian Technology Network of Universities—in its submission—acknowledged that:

‘When assessing proposals, the Advisory Board will also consider the degree to which funding will support Government policy with respect to excellence, quality and specialisation.’ This consideration is particularly important as we face such an enormous skills shortage—another result of the lack of vision and future planning from this tired Government and its stale leadership.
Under this Bill, power is given to the Education Minister to give directions and authorise grants to eligible higher education institutions. With the allocation of grants determined only by the Education Minister, however, the grant process may not be independent and based solely on merit. The only requirement that needs to be met when allocating grants is that the board must have provided a statement for the relevant financial year. This does not stop the Minister from having complete control over the grants process as the Advisory Board is appointed by the Minister.
There is also the possibility of some institutions receiving large grants for the Government’s own political gain. While the Board will specify a maximum grants amount in accordance with the Maximum Grants Rules, these rules will be determined by the responsible Ministers. It has been advised that the deliberations regarding the Maximum Grant rules will be informed by external advice from an asset consultation, but this is not in the Bill and does not seem to have been committed to by the responsible Ministers.
The Group of Eight reflected these concerns in their submissions, stating:

‘The Bill vests control over the selection and allocations of grants from the Fund to the Minister of the day. With such large amounts of public funding involved, the policy priority should be the achievement of clear, transparent and non-political mechanisms for allocating grants. There are risks under this model that funding allocations will be based on political factors rather than on the merits of individual proposals or through any strategic consideration of the sector’s infrastructure needs.’

I note that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee Alert Digest no. 11/07 indicates that the Committee intends to ask the Minister whether or not the ministerial directions and authorisations in the Bill are appropriately exempted from disallowance provisions.  We look forward to the Minister’s response and note that, once again, the Government has put into the Chamber legislation that is insufficiently detailed and accompanied by an explanatory memorandum that is also lacking in detail.
Both the Australian Technology Network of Universities and Universities Australia noted that the legislation does not set out in any detail the rules by which funding is to be distributed under the HEEF.
This is concerning as without the detail, we cannot know if the system chosen will be fair or if it will disadvantage some institutions. Labor would like to know how the income expected to be generated through the fund will be distributed.
Many submissions noted concern with the requirement that a university is able to put up funds to match those provided by the fund. The Innovative Research Universities Australia stated in their submission that ‘matching funds should not be a requirement as some infrastructure cannot attract such funding.’ There is legitimate concern in the sector that this requirement would seriously damage a number of universities, particularly new, small and/or regional institutions.
There is also great concern regarding the possibility of a proportion of the grants being competitive. The March 2007 Productivity Commission Report on Public Support for Science and Innovation agreed that:

‘Competitive grants schemes effectively lock up a significant proportion of each university’s block funds and that any attempts to increase the proportion of competitive research funding relative to discretionary research block funding is not warranted and would threaten universities’ ability to undertake meaningful strategic research.’

That Report  also stated that ‘the high cost to universities in leveraging competitive grants is a threat to the quality of educational services that universities are able to deliver, especially in an environment where there have been significant real cuts in university operating grants for government supported students.’

It is unclear exactly how much funding the Higher Education Endowment Fund will provide as predictable returns will not be achievable over the first five years and very few of the Bill’s practicalities have been made available.
However The Federation of Australian Scientific Technological Societies estimates that the fund is likely to provide a funding stream of between $300 and $400 million per annum. This is a similar amount to the $300 million for each year from 2008-2011 estimated in the Treasurer’s Budget Paper.
Labor is particularly concerned by Section 49 which provides that in the event of a bad year and the Fund returns little or no income then the Fund will not release any money. Such a decision would mean a loss of an expected $300 million to the sector.  This has implications for eligible higher education providers that may be relying on being awarded approval for funds for infrastructure projects.
For Australia to be successful on an international level, it is crucial that Australia has high quality educational institutions. The Higher Education Endowment Fund will benefit research and capital projects, as well as improve the necessary infrastructure for teaching and research in the coming years. However the detail of the Bill will determine wether or not these benefits will extend to all tertiary education institutions.
I trust that the HEEF’s potential to be politicised will not be exploited and that we see the creation of a transparent funding process.
After 11 years of neglect, it’s about time the Government gave back to the universities of Australia.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION ENDOWMENT FUND BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2007-09-19,"—It is my pleasure to speak in favour of the Higher Education Endowment Fund Bill 2007 and the Higher Education Endowment Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2007 and to welcome them as yet another step in the Howard government’s advancement of Australia’s future prosperity. In particular, I acknowledge in the gallery today many young Australians who are obviously studying at present and who will be enjoying the benefits of this bill in their future years. Certainly, this is the type of initiative that is an investment in their future as much as it is an investment in the future of Australia.
The world is undergoing much global and economic change, and that is why higher education is so important to Australia’s future. I acknowledge that the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Education completed a report on this bill, and within that report it stated:
... internationally, major investments are being made in universities and research facilities. These countries are Australia’s economic competitors, both now and in the future, and if Australia is to be successful on an international scale, then it is imperative for Australia to be able to compete in the top end of the market.
This new Higher Education Endowment Fund will ensure that Australia is well placed to compete at that top end of the education market. It injects $6 billion into a perpetual fund to ensure that our higher education facilities can have the resources, infrastructure and facilities that they deserve into the future. It is part of the Liberal-National government’s broad commitment to getting it right across the education sector, across all the aspects of education and learning that Senator Marshall referred to earlier—not a narrow focus just on universities or on any one particular area, but a commitment to getting it right everywhere. It focuses on our schools, investing in our schools and ensuring that we have the right curriculum—a curriculum that addresses basic skills in literacy and numeracy, a curriculum that ensures that young Australians learn about our history—and get the right mix of curriculum.
Indeed, the Senate only recently completed a report into academic standards in schools, instigated by the Howard government. This will be used as a driving force, I am sure, in the future to ensure that those standards are raised. This is coupled with government investment in the school sector standing at a very high level, supporting both the government and non-government sector, particularly through programs such as the Investing in our Schools Program, which again is providing the practical facilities that schools so desperately need.
It is not just about the schools sector and the higher education sector. This government has provided strong benefits to vocational education and training. This government has proudly reinvigorated traineeships and apprenticeships as an important part of that mix, which has ensured that we have more Australians undertaking such apprenticeships than has ever been the case before. These are proud achievements in getting the right mix of education throughout lifelong learning for all Australians. This will ensure that young Australians, such as those in the gallery today, have a great schooling system and at the end of that have the opportunity to choose the pathways that will suit them best, be it an apprenticeship, a traineeship or going on to university.
We have worked with TAFEs and with the vocational education and training sector. I acknowledge that in this budget we have introduced not only this Higher Education Endowment Fund but also FEE-HELP for VET students. In fact, we are providing practical support as a first and new measure to assist those undertaking vocational education and training, just as we have provided such support to university students over a long period of time.
The university sector is the focus of this legislation. The university sector, contrary to what we hear from the opposition and the minor parties, has been enjoying a resurgence and is doing extremely well under this government. We need only look at the revenues that the university sector is generating. Details were announced today by the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Julie Bishop, who is doing such a good job in all of these areas of education. Minister Bishop announced that revenues for universities reached in 2006 a record $15.5 billion. That is an increase of $1.6 billion or 11 per cent over the year 2005. That represents significant growth in the revenue available to our universities to support students, and to support and develop the facilities they require.
That level of revenue has been achieved because this government has funded more public places than ever before, as well as supporting the option of up-front fee-paying places. It is that mixture of fee-paying places and government supported places that has provided universities with the surge in revenue that will allow them to achieve great things into the future.
Government funded places, as I said, have also been on the rise. The minister announced only last week 2,300 new Commonwealth supported places to help meet the demand for higher education into the future. These places are addressing student demand and skill needs for Australia. They include 560 new places for engineers, 390 new places for science professionals, 395 new places for nurses, 375 new teaching places, and 210 places for other health professionals. All up, they will contribute to around 4,600 new places that the government allocated last year, in 2006. So the Howard government is building growth upon growth in our university sector. Ultimately, it is expected that 50,000 new university places will be funded by the Australian government by 2011. This represents significant investment in university places for young Australians by this government.
We actually have historically low levels for the number of eligible students who cannot get a place. Some 92 per cent of eligible students received an offer this year, up from 90 per cent last year. So, contrary to what we hear at times from those on the other side of this chamber, it is the best result in more than two decades. If a young person qualified for a place in university, in the last year they had the best chance of getting that place in more than two decades. That is a great achievement by this government. I acknowledge that Senator Marshall in his comments recognised that enrolments in universities have more than doubled under this government. That is a proud achievement—that we have increased the number of places in universities and increased the funding in universities to match. That is why this government has something to be proud of with regard to its work in the university sector.
In my home state of South Australia, some 290 of these places will be injected for this year. They will fund 95 new science professionals, 90 engineers, 75 nurses, 10 teachers, 10 health professionals and 10 psychologists—additional places in key skills areas and additional opportunities for young South Australians. By 2013 the Australian government will have funded another 830 university places in South Australia. Coupled with this was an announcement which is of great benefit to South Australia: the government is supporting our first veterinary science school, at the University of Adelaide’s Roseworthy campus. For too long young South Australians who have aspired to study veterinary science have had to leave South Australia and study elsewhere. Now we will have a new veterinary science school proudly established at Roseworthy. I acknowledge the commitment of the minister to contributing $15 million in one-off funding to allow the University of Adelaide to establish this school. That is funding for places so that by 2013 up to 270 young people will be studying at the campus for either a Bachelor of Animal Science degree or a Master of Veterinary Science degree. This is a great achievement. In addition to acknowledging the minister, I acknowledge David Fawcett, the member for Wakefield, where the Roseworthy campus is based. He is a very hardworking local member who campaigned very hard to achieve the funding for this university campus from this government. It is a proud achievement for David Fawcett and for the government that we have managed to deliver this new opportunity for young South Australians.
This is a healthy tertiary education sector with a bright future that is being made even brighter by the funding provided as a result of the Higher Education Endowment Fund. As we have heard, the fund will take the opportunities for universities to invest in their facilities and infrastructure to a new level. It will create a special account under the Future Fund, managed by Future Fund trustees. It was initially announced in the budget this year at $5 billion but was subsequently increased to $6 billion. A long-term commitment was made by the Treasurer to take that amount further, to hopefully see at least $10 billion in this fund. I hope for even more over the years, for a perpetual fund that will provide ongoing financial support to our tertiary sector. As the Senate committee acknowledged:
The HEEF is expected to significantly increase the funds that are available to be invested in the higher education sector.
It went further:
This investment has been enthusiastically welcomed by the sector.
This is good news that is well appreciated by our universities. It is estimated that the initial investment will provide some $300 million to $400 million per annum for investments. These investments will be assessed by an independent advisory committee. So we will ensure that the money goes where it is needed most. That is in addition to the ongoing investment from this government in the higher education sector. The minister has made it perfectly clear that this fund will not be in place of anything—that it is an additional boost. It is in addition to the Capital Development Pool, which has had approximately $607 million invested over the past 11 years; it is in addition to the Research Infrastructure Block Grants, which have had approximately $1.5 billion invested over the same period; and it is in addition to the Major National Research Facilities Program, in which over $59 million has been invested. Over the next five years an estimated $540 million will be invested in the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy. This is not just about supporting new university places and the facilities at our universities; it is a great investment in the research and development and intellectual capabilities of Australia going into the future.
As my colleague Senator Barnett acknowledged, the fund will also be open to philanthropic donations. As a government, we hope the fund will provide a vehicle to encourage further consideration by the private sector to support these universities and to support the future potential for such excellence in Australian higher education. The Senate committee noted:
Grants from the HEEF are intended to promote the development of a world-class higher education sector with the provision of significant, targeted and strategic investments in the sector. The committee believes the HEEF has the capacity to deliver excellence in the higher education sector.
I welcome those findings of the cross-party committee. It is important that we do deliver these benefits, this additional funding and the financial gains it will provide to our universities.
The government are able to make this major social investment in Australia’s education sector because of 11 years of good economic management. This is part of the social dividend that we as a government are able to deliver that would not have been possible 11 years ago. Why would it not have been possible 11 years ago? Because 11 years ago we were paying more than $6 billion a year in interest on Labor’s $90 billion of debt. That is the reason. We were having to fork out this type of money on an annual basis as a nation just to meet debt payments. Now, 11 years later, this government has turned that around, has eliminated the debt and is making investments in the future—investments into the Future Fund that will clear up our future public sector superannuation liabilities; and investments into the Communications Fund, a $2 billion investment to ensure that into the future Australia’s rural and regional communities get the types of communications infrastructure they need.
Once again Senator Marshall, in his comments, committed the Labor Party not just to raiding the Communications Fund but to spending it all in one fell swoop and wiping it out. This is the type of attitude we have coming from the other side of the chamber. The risk the Higher Education Endowment Fund will face and the risk the Future Fund will face is that we will see a Labor government that not just starts to take little bits of it but starts to spend the whole lot on its way to placing Australia in debt again.
I welcome the establishment of the Higher Education Endowment Fund. It is a major investment into our university sector. It has been enthusiastically welcomed by our university sector. It is a demonstration, again, of this government’s commitment to fiscal responsibility as well as to investing into the future—to actually be putting money aside for perpetual investments into the future. A re-elected Howard government would no doubt be able to build on the approach of the last couple of years in the establishment of these funds to build them up to reduce the tax requirements for future generations and to ensure that we have the type of ongoing investment in Australia’s economic and social infrastructure that is required. I am confident that this will be of great benefit to many future students in Australia’s university sector, and I endorse the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION ENDOWMENT FUND BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2007-09-19,"—The Higher Education Endowment Fund Bill 2007 implements the government’s budget announcement about the establishment of a perpetual endowment fund for the use of higher education institutes in this country. The fund so set up will generate earnings which can then be applied for and used for capital projects. The Treasurer and the finance ministers will be given the powers to credit cash amounts to this fund, which will in turn be managed by a board of guardians. The responsible ministers then issue an investment mandate—a series of ministerial directions—to the board regarding the investment of the funds and benchmark returns expected on these investments. They will also have the powers of setting the rules for determining the maximum amount of payments from these funds. We note here that these directions will be tabled in parliament as legislative instruments. I understand, though, that these instruments will not be disallowable. The Minister for Education, Science and Training is responsible for appointments to the board and then responsible for authorising grants from the fund based on advice from the Higher Education Endowment Fund Advisory Board.
We note that, by including non-disallowable instruments concerning ministerial determinations and Higher Education Endowment Fund investments, the government is actually minimising the transparency and accountability of the processes surrounding this fund, its investment and allocations. I know that the bills concerning the establishment of this fund were sent to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Education, and concerns have been expressed about the operation of this fund and the way in which the funds emanating from this will be distributed. In fact, we have expressed concerns and uncertainty about exactly how it would work.
I noticed when the majority report was tabled that it played down the risk of the fund being used for pork-barrelling and, of course, I questioned whether the advisory board would have the expertise that is needed in order to allocate this fund. We know that the board is going to have a chairman and six members, including the Secretary of the Department of Education, Science and Training and the Chief Scientist. The minister has told us that members will be chosen for their knowledge of the higher education sector—that is probably a good thing, an essential thing—and other relevant expertise. ‘Other relevant expertise’ is yet to be defined.
We are not sure what that would mean. Perhaps under this government it would mean previous Liberal government members or even ministers. As we have seen with the Regional Partnerships program, this government is not averse to ensuring that funds it sets up are delivered and directed most prominently to its marginal seats, so we have grave reservations about how these funds will be allocated. The implications for the higher education providers that may be relying on being awarded approval for the endowment funds for infrastructure programs are, I think, fairly massive under this government. We know that decisions may well be made for political purposes. I noticed that in the minority report Senator Stott Despoja actually suggested that the funding recommendations from the board be made publicly available and the funding guidelines should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and veto. So there are concerns about not only exactly how this fund will operate but how the funds will be awarded and established at the end of the day, particularly under this government.
We are in the position of having publicly said that we would of course support much-needed funding for higher education, but we are critical of this government, which has neglected higher education for so many years. In fact, we have seen a real funding decline in this sector since this government came to power in 1996. The government commenced cuts to this sector of the education industry in its first budget in 1996, under Senator Vanstone, and has never reversed the trend. It has never turned around the funding implications and the funding cuts. It has never reversed the trend in cuts to the higher education sector in its 11 long years in government. It has forced universities to find other funding avenues and forced students to pay even higher fees.
The government’s own estimates are that there is a backlog of $1.5 billion in infrastructure needs in the higher education sector, so no wonder it has sought to set up a fund under the guise that this is something new and wonderful. Once again, this government is really playing catch-up for its 11 long years of neglect. Universities have put a much higher figure on what is needed in infrastructure. This government would say $1.5 billion; the Group of Eight say that it is closer to $1.53 billion just for them alone. That is $1.53 billion for just the Group of Eight, unlike this government’s guesstimate, which is $1.5 billion for our 38 universities, so there is quite a significant difference in where this government believes the infrastructure shortfall is at this point in time.
As a proportion of their total revenue, this government has cut Commonwealth grants to universities from 57 per cent in 1996 to only 41 per cent in 2004. It has forced universities to raise 24 per cent of their revenue from fees and charges since 2004. While just about every other developed country has been increasing higher education funding, the Howard government has gone the other way. The result of this perverse policy, bucking the trend of the rest of the developed world, has been that, since 1995, student to staff ratios have increased from 14.6 to 20.4 today. Bigger class sizes clearly have an adverse impact on teaching and learning, but this is a concept that this government has failed to grasp—not only in the higher education sector but particularly in primary schools and in early childhood education, where the government believes quality teaching is the be-all and end-all to outcomes in education, as opposed to actually looking at staff-student ratios, resources and infrastructure needs. Many lectures are now given to groups of well over 100 per class. Tutorials and seminars, too, have decreased in numbers offered and have increased in class size.
The Group of Eight sum it up in their submission to the Senate inquiry, in saying that the implications of the funding cuts are fivefold:
1. large increases in student to staff ratios, with implications for quality of teaching and learning;
2. reductions in academic salaries relative to average wages, with implications for the sector’s ability to attract top talent;
3. the deferment of essential expenditure on the maintenance of buildings and facilities, with long term consequences for the quality of essential infrastructure;
4. the pursuit of alternative sources of income, for example from full-fee domestic and international students; and
5. the pursuit of various practices designed to increase productivity and reduce costs.
These are all indicators of the implications of the funding cuts under this government.
Indeed, this government has been more concerned with forcing their industrial relations laws on the higher education sector than they have been with the quality of the education itself. Our higher education system now relies more on private financing than all other OECD countries except, of course, America, Japan and South Korea. It is clear that the present Prime Minister follows everything the American government would want us to do, and he would have us go the same way. We often talk about and hear about the Americanisation of our higher education system. The average amount of Commonwealth funding per student has declined in real terms over the life of this government by nearly $1,500. At the same time, HECS fees and other charges have had to rise to cover not only the real decline in government funding but the ever-rising costs faced by universities. Even with the rising charges and fees, universities have often had no choice but to defer important capital infrastructure projects.
Now they may have the chance to get some of this work funded, although there is no guarantee of that under the model proposed by this government. Submissions for assistance from this fund will be made on a competitive basis, by competitive tender on as yet unknown criteria. It is, therefore, possible under such conditions that the smaller, newer universities and institutions in the regions may be disadvantaged by this process. I might say that institutions that, perhaps, are in very safe Labor seats may well be disadvantaged as well. They may lack the economies of scale of projects on larger campuses or be forced to incur higher costs due to isolation.
Of course, the amount available will depend on the performance of the fund and the returns managed. Over the past few years, these returns might have been expected to be high, but in the present situation the financial market is quite volatile, largely—and very ironically—tied to the economic situation in the Prime Minister’s favourite country, once again, America. Returns have become far less predictable and may, indeed, be very low in the present circumstances. Under the maximum grant rules, the ministers responsible cannot allow payments to exceed accumulated nominal earnings, so the trust fund has to earn a return, and this may not be much in the early days. Mercer Investment Consulting, under Bruce Gregor, presented evidence before the Senate inquiry which said that a provision designed to preserve the government’s initial cash contribution would impose a very defensive investment strategy, possibly leading to no returns at all in the event of extreme market volatility in the early years.
This fund will not be operating until the end of this financial year and will certainly not be of immediate benefit. One would have to say that 18 months from now might see some funds available for payment towards replacing or repairing degraded infrastructure. The budget papers have the fund returning a notional $300 million a year, but, as indicated earlier, this is by no means guaranteed. However, even at this rate, if the Group of Eight are correct with their estimate of their needs being $1.53 billion between them, it would take six years of returns to meet the needs of just those eight universities. In their submission to the Senate committee, the Group of Eight said:
While $6 billion is a large amount of money it needs to be viewed in the context of recent funding trends for Australia’s public universities, the recurrent expenses and infrastructure challenges they now face, and international developments in public investment in higher education systems.
In other words, it is not as generous as this government would have us believe. The appointed advisory board will advise not only on grants made but also on investment proposals and strategies. As I said, this board will have a chair and six members, all appointed by the minister and able to be unappointed and dismissed by that minister.
The Senate inquiry into this legislation received several submissions expressing concern about the composition and appointment of this board. Again, these ministerial discretions are non-disallowable instruments, so the degree of transparency and accountability of the board can be questioned. The board could be open—and will be open, I suggest—to undue pressures or influence, as we have seen in the past, as I mentioned before, with the Regional Partnerships program. Again, I use the Group of Eight submission to reinforce this point. They say:
However, as introduced the Minister will determine who sits on the Fund’s Advisory Board (ss.40(2 &3)), how the Board is to carry out its function and the processes by which it will operate (ss.40(4)), will decide which grants are funded (s.45) and the terms of any funding (ss.50(3)).
The Group of Eight go on to say:
There are risks under this model that funding allocations will be based on political factors rather than on the merits of individual proposals, or through any strategic consideration of the sector’s infrastructure needs.
Philanthropic gifts can be paid into this fund; however, under this legislation they cannot be for any specific project. You would perhaps have to wonder why you would not just give your money to a single institution in its own right rather than go through the fund. The funds will go into the general ‘pool’, so a grateful former student of a particular university will be able to donate to the fund but will not have a say in where their donation is used—hardly any real incentive to donate. Despite all these doubts about the workability of the fund, it is a sure sign that, after 11 years of neglect, the Howard government has, in its own way, rediscovered higher education. ‘It must be an election year,’ I hear you say.
The recent ACOSS report A fair go for all Australians: international comparisons, 2007 found that Australia spends the least on education of the six English-speaking OECD countries except Ireland. We are lagging behind Canada, UK, New Zealand and the United States. The OECD report Education at a glance for 2006 shows that we are fourth lowest in the proportion of public expenditure on education—not a performance, I would have thought, that would give much optimism for the future of the skilling of this country.
The government of course makes all the excuses it possibly can and brings out the spin doctors and statistics geniuses to deny these reports. Even today we have Senator Bishop denying figures that have been released in an international report with regard to school education.
—Minister Bishop. You said ‘Senator Bishop’.
—Well, we wouldn’t give her that elevation. We have had Minister Bishop denying funding reports on an international report on primary education, saying that they are the wrong statistics at the wrong time, without looking at the fact that, during the period this government has been in office, higher education investment has declined no matter what sector you look at and no matter what period of time you concentrate on. Statistics are used by this government to disguise their neglect of the sector. They roll together figures for expenditure on both public education and private education to hide the fact that sometimes we are talking about money specifically being withdrawn from public education. Private education is necessary, of course, but private is private and public is public; they are two different things and they are funded quite differently by this government.
Australian public funding of tertiary education is at 48 per cent of their funds, down from nearly 65 per cent in 1995 and compared to the OECD average of 76.4 per cent. So, when the OECD average for public funding of tertiary education is over 75 per cent, here in Australia it languishes at 48 per cent. While spending on tertiary education has risen in real terms against the base figure for 1995, it has declined considerably in per-student terms due to the large rise in student numbers. It has declined by around $1,500 per student. ABS figures show that since 2001 spending has risen by six per cent but student numbers have gone up by 12 per cent.
I have already stated the effects of this: larger class sizes, less one on one with lecturers and tutors, more reliance on classes being delivered online through the internet, and, of course, increased fees payable by students one way or another. Student fees and charges have risen from 13 per cent of tertiary revenue in 1996 to 24 per cent of tertiary revenue in 2004 and they are rising annually. Aussie students now face mounting HECS debts after completing studies or higher full course fees to get their degrees. Our universities have been forced to rely more and more on HECS fee increases and full-fee-paying students, whether domestic or overseas—predominantly, I would have thought, overseas. It is not a desirable or long sustainable situation as more overseas countries such as China increase their own provision of tertiary education.
As said previously, this Higher Education Endowment Fund will be supported by Labor, although it could be seen as too little, too late. There are obvious faults with the way in which it is proposed to be managed, with government ministers having too many unfettered powers and with many of the regulations being determined as non-disallowable instruments. There is too little transparency and accountability. It is very welcome, provided, too, that it is not used to replace existing programs. Again, I refer to the submission from the Group of Eight, in which they said:
There are a variety of existing Commonwealth Schemes that directly or indirectly support investment in university capital and research infrastructure.
They said that, for reasons outlined in their submission:
… it is critical that the HEEF never be seen as a substitute for these important schemes which each serve specific purposes.
Labor believes that the income derived from this fund should be available as an addition to any existing program and that it should be available to those projects that genuinely advance our national interests and not just for any short-term political interests of the government of the day.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION ENDOWMENT FUND BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-09-19,"—We have seen overnight, with the latest OECD report, that Australia lags well behind comparable countries in public investment in education. In fact, for public investment in education Australia ranks 29th out of 34 countries in the OECD report. Those countries that choose to put more public money into education have better educational outcomes and do better economically. The GDP of those countries that choose to invest public money in education is higher than that of Australia.
We have the opportunity here in Australia to invest more public money in education so that we cannot only improve the quality of education but improve our society and our economy. The Greens call on the government to invest an additional $5.5 billion of public funds in education each year. If the government invested an additional $5.5 billion each year in education, that would put us among the top 10 comparable countries in the OECD—it would bring us up to about seventh—in terms of public investment in education.
The Higher Education Endowment Fund Bill 2007 relates to a $5 billion education announcement that occurred on budget night. It is not a decision to invest $5 billion each year but rather a one-off payment to go into a fund, the interest of which will be invested into capital infrastructure and research at Australia’s universities. Five billion dollars for education is a good thing, and the Greens support this bill because it puts public funds into education. But we have a variety of different ideas about how you might choose to invest $5 billion in higher education. One of the things the Greens have been advocating for many years now is that we return to a situation where students are able to get into university based on their ability and their merit rather than their capacity to pay. Five billion dollars could go a long way to removing the exorbitant HECS fees that students have to pay right now in order to get into university. The Greens would like to see the federal government investing money in higher education for the purpose of making higher education more accessible. Let us ensure that all the students who qualify academically are able to access a university rather than just those who are able to pay the fees associated with it. We would like to see our whole society benefit from a government investment in higher education that allows more people to access higher education. Our whole society would benefit from more people having the opportunity to access higher education. Funding that would remove HECS fees and full fees that prevent students from accessing higher education would be a worthwhile investment. The Greens would like to see the government put funding into higher education to do that.
We have other priorities and ideas about what might be the best way to invest $5 billion in higher education. We are concerned that these bills fall well short of what could be achieved with this kind of money available to the government. We are also concerned that the control over the distribution of the income generated by these funds leaves too much power in the hands of the education minister. On budget night, the Greens were the first to point out that the $5 billion headline could amount to less government investment going into university research and infrastructure than currently occurs. These concerns have been borne out by the ambiguous statements from the minister and the department about whether the income in this fund will be additional funds. The minister was reported in the Australian saying that these funds would ‘eventually supersede other capital funding sources such as the Capital Development Pool’. Yet in her second reading speech on this bill, the minister assured us that this is not intended to be a recurrent funding stream. That would be nice, if you could believe that.
The thrust of the way in which the government has been funding education—or not funding education—over the 11 years it has been in office has resulted in a shift away from government money to private funding. That is another thing we found in the OECD report that came out overnight—that shift to fund education in this country has moved onto the shoulders of students and their parents, as the government has pulled out funding. The government has reduced the amount of public investment in education and, instead, put the burden onto students and their parents. There has been an overall shift by this government in relation to education funding. I think we need to look at this bill in that context—that the government has reduced public funding and has put the funding burden onto individual parents and students.
Another confusing aspect of policy in this bill relates to philanthropy. The kind of philanthropy that the minister talks about that occurs in the US and the UK to encourage the university sector in those countries would not be effectively stimulated by this fund. The legislation fails to show how potential donors would be encouraged to contribute when the funds would be swallowed into the government fund. It does not allow the kind of support for specific projects that donors usually require. The reality is that most donors will continue to contribute directly to the institutions which they are interested in supporting and this fund will remain largely a public fund.
The way in which this fund is significantly different to other funds paid for from taxpayer surplus funds is not clear. What does it matter to the university or the taxpayer that the investments that have generated the funding have been labelled the Higher Education Endowment Fund rather than some other label where the surplus is invested? The key difference seems to be that this fund allows even greater power over the direction of research investment to rest with the minister.
The Greens share the concerns of others about the lack of transparency about the decision-making process that the minister would follow in approving projects paid for from this fund. The previous minister showed a willingness to ignore the advice of the Australian Research Council in rejecting research funding applications. Why does the government think that it is appropriate for a minister to reject the advice of expert panels without having to give reasons to the parliament? Why does the government think it is appropriate to make the determinations of the minister not subject to disallowance or approval by this parliament?
The government seems to have set up a fund which made great headlines on budget night but which fails to deliver on any significant educational or public interest grounds above what already happens. The Greens conclude that the government would be better off investing the $5 billion directly in the higher education sector now. Failing that, the government should put more government revenue—and that is all this fund is, just revenue with a different name—into recurrent funding of research. They should not add to the complexity of the research funding competition by introducing another competitive funding source. Instead, why can’t we see more funding going through the Australian Research Council block grant model?
Investing $5 billion in higher education is a good and necessary thing. The Greens call on the federal government to put an additional $5.5 billion into education each year so that we can go from being right at the bottom of comparable OECD countries in terms of public investment in education to being up in the top 10. The Greens have pointed to other ideas about how the government could spend its $5 billion by investing in higher education, including the abolition of HECS and making universities accessible to those who have the ability to get into university rather than simply being able to afford it. I foreshadow that I will move a second reading amendment on behalf of the Australian Greens.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION ENDOWMENT FUND BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2007-09-19,"—Senator Nettle sat down before I thought she was going to.
—Are you going to support our second reading amendment?
—No, I want to conclude the debate.
—Ha!
—That is not as funny as it might seem, Senator Webber, because it is a serious issue.
—You support my higher education amendments as a rule!
—Senator Carr knows very well that we have a history with education going back some years. We might have both shared an interest in it but I am not so sure we agreed on how that interest was to be reflected. The Higher Education Endowment Fund is an unprecedented investment in higher education in Australia. That is a common theme and something which is accepted. This is a $6 billion fund which provides future funding for capital and research facilities in the higher education sector. It is a true endowment fund, with a requirement in the legislation to maintain its real value over the medium to long term. Grants from the endowment fund will be directed towards promoting excellence, diversity, quality and specialisation in Australian universities—all laudable goals which I am sure are supported by all.
There will be an advisory board to ensure that grants are allocated in a way that delivers meaningful outcomes for the sector. This independent Higher Education Endowment Fund Advisory Board will be established to provide advice to the education minister, and its role will be to advise on the best way to implement and manage the endowment fund.
The provisions of the Higher Education Endowment Fund Bill 2007 and the Higher Education Endowment Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2007 allow for the movement of moneys into the endowment fund and for those moneys to be invested for the future. The responsibility for that investment rests with the Future Fund Board of Guardians. So there is a layer of probity, accountability and prudential requirement.
The sector will have a genuine opportunity to provide input into the development of guidelines, outlining how the funding program will operate. There is no requirement for this level of detail to be included in the legislation, but I say that so that it is on the record. I think the sector would welcome that opportunity to provide input.
Consistent with the government’s aim of encouraging diversity within the sector, all institutions listed under table A and table B of the Higher Education Support Act 2003 will be eligible to apply for funding. That is something which speaks for itself and is open to transparency and public inspection.
With the establishment of the endowment fund the government has created a new avenue for business and the general public to make philanthropic donations to the sector. That is something that universities in particular benefit from. In my home state of Western Australia, the University of Western Australia has, over a period of time, enjoyed that to great benefit. That is the reason it is perhaps one of the wealthiest universities in the country.
In the first instance, the bills provide that tax deductable gifts of money to the endowment fund will only be able to be accepted on an unconditional basis. At the time the endowment fund was announced, the government indicated that contributions could be earmarked for particular universities and that universities could choose to have their own philanthropic funds managed along with the endowment fund. These issues will be addressed following more detailed consultation with the higher education sector and the board of guardians. The government may then consider amendments to the legislation.
In order to support the establishment and operation of the Higher Education Endowment Fund, amendments to the Future Fund Act 2006 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 are required. Broadly, the amendments to the Future Fund Act extend the functions of the board of guardians to include its functions under the endowment fund act. The bill also makes it clear that there are two investment mandates that the responsible ministers can issue to the board: one for the Future Fund and one for the endowment fund. Correspondingly, the consequential bill clarifies that the board has two investment functions: one for the Future Fund and one for the endowment fund.
Both bills set out the limitation of the investment mandates. In line with good governance practice, the bills also specify that the responsible ministers cannot direct the board to use the assets of the Future Fund to invest or support particular financial assets. The Income Tax Assessment Act is also being amended to allow deductable gifts of money to be made to the endowment fund. I thank those senators who have contributed to this debate and, in particular, the standing committee for its work in relation to these bills. I commend these bills to the Senate.

At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate:
              (a)    condemns the government for failing to invest adequate public funds into higher education and consequently:
                    (i)    leaving Australia languishing 29th out of 34 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries by public investment in higher education,
                   (ii)    presiding over a decrease in real terms in public investment in higher education over the past decade,
                  (iii)    allowing teacher student ratios in universities to blow out to over 1:20,
                  (iv)    increasing the financial  burden on students who now pay almost the highest proportion of the cost of their education in the OECD,

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2007-09-19,"—I would like to speak today about an ongoing and serious issue for parents of children with a disability. The issue actually hinges on the very poignant question: what happens when we are too old or are no longer able to care for our children with a disability? This issue came to the fore again recently in Brisbane, in a radio interview given to the ABC by a very well-known rugby league coach. The interview started out being about his team’s ability and position on the ladder, but what caused a fuss about this interview was that this very controlled, very strong man became very emotional—with his voice actually breaking—when he was asked about the future for two of his children who have a disability. The question that was asked was: what about their long-term future? He answered that it was something that he lived with each day and it was not going to go away. He hoped that he and his wife had prepared for their future as best they could and that the family would be there to pick up the pieces when he and his wife were no longer around. His two children will no doubt have their physical needs met in the future. But as to their happiness, their sense of contentment with life, this planner and motivator extraordinaire could simply say that he would do his best and hope everything would be all right.
This same question and this same hope, rather than certainty, about the future confronts many thousands of families around Australia—families that have an adult child or a growing child with a disability. Many of these families have a far lesser ability to plan and to carry through their plans than the well-known Brisbane coach as they face this dilemma of getting older and continuing to look after their adult children with a disability. What happens to those we care for when we are no longer around or no longer able to care for them? The size of this problem within Australia is in fact relatively new. Firstly, advances in medical treatment mean that people with disabilities are, on average, living much longer lives—in many cases, with life spans close to the average Australian life span. In the 1960s, the life expectancy for a person with down syndrome was about 32 years. I now know a number of adults with down syndrome who are well into their sixties and living active, productive lives. I know young men with muscular dystrophy who are living well past the life expectancy for people with this disability. So there are more older people who have a disability than in previous generations, and we have the right to have every expectation that, in many cases, these people will outlive their parents. This is a relatively new phenomenon.
Secondly, the great majority of people with a disability now live in the community, either with or near their families. They do not spend their lives from birth to death in institutions, as happened in previous generations. But their ability to live functional lives within the community is often very dependent on the little things that their family do to assist them. I am speaking here not of paid services that are often provided by professional organisations but of the smaller things that keep life ticking along. Without that sort of planning and help from their families, there is a very real risk that, at their parents’ death, these adult children will lose not just their parents but also their home as they struggle to cope without a caring monitor of the quality of their lives. The medical and social advances that I have mentioned that have led to this increasing longevity and community inclusion for people with disabilities are to be very loudly applauded. But these advances have created, on a larger scale than we have ever seen before, a new and urgent need for long-term planning by parents and by siblings of people with a disability. Carers Australia has in fact described this need as a policy crisis.
I would like to flesh out a little for senators this dilemma being faced by thousands and thousands of Australian parents. In the majority of cases, these people with a disability will have their physical needs taken care of by others when their parents have gone. They will most likely be adequately fed, clothed and housed. But I ask any parent in this place to think about whether that would be their idea of enough for their child or for any vulnerable person they know. In fact, in contemporary Australia, our idea of an adequate or a good life includes a very high social component. In terms of a hierarchy of needs, an adequate or a good life includes living somewhere that is genuinely your home, not just a roof over your head controlled by others where you can sleep. A good and adequate life includes spending time with people you like and/or love—people who care about you because of you, not because they are paid to do so. It includes spending your time involved in activities that you actually enjoy, not just filling in the days going to functions and on outings that someone else thought might be a nice idea for you. Most crucially, a good or an adequate life within contemporary Australia involves having people who care about you and about the sort of life you are leading.
In many cases, when parents die, the siblings will take up this monitoring role for adults with a disability. But I hope that we as a society have already recognised that we ask far too much of many parent carers, ignoring their needs until they are at crisis point. To expect siblings—who probably have their own families, life issues and problems—to replace the parent completely in that role is, in my view, unrealistic and unreasonable. Most parents of people with a disability whom I know do not have an expectation that a sibling would completely replace them. They expect the siblings to be involved in the life of their brother or sister but they do not expect them to be the provider of all things in the way a parent might happily be.
I would briefly like to mention those who will not even get the basics of adequate minimum care that we are talking about—basic food, shelter and clothing. Many of the homeless people in our cities and those living in boarding houses and hostels are people with psychiatric and intellectual disabilities. They are very vulnerable people who have fallen through the cracks. None of us, least of all the state governments, can be proud of our lack of support for homeless people.
For the past few years, I have been involved with a Queensland organisation called Lifeways. I want to speak briefly about the purpose of Lifeways, as it relates to planning. The basic premise of the Lifeways organisation is that good housing, good support services and adequate financial resources are very important in the lives of adults with a disability but it is even more important for vulnerable people to be cared about—that is the critical need. What keeps vulnerable people safe is not a good house, a good car, a good bank account or a good service provider but having someone—and preferably lots of people—in their lives to ensure that they are not being exploited, abused or neglected.
The Lifeways solution to this problem would be to have paid facilitators to help families, including the person with a disability, to develop a long-term plan and a personal support network that would gradually replace the parents in caring about the individual at the centre of the plan. There is some good Canadian research on the establishment of networks. It would certainly involve siblings, if there are siblings around, but often people who are keen to be involved in the life of a person with a disability are not recognised by parents. Parents of children with a disability, particularly a psychiatric disability, often experience a lot of negativity from others and they are very reluctant to ask for help. So the idea of having an independent facilitator who would locate people to be part of a network, and maintain that network as it inevitably goes through the waves and troughs that any organisation established by people will do, is very important to this plan.
It is also very important for helping people in more remote areas where there simply may not be enough people to establish a support network of known volunteers within the social networks of the family. It would be thought that, in situations like that, you would have people from community organisations and church groups involved in assisting perhaps more than one person with a disability so that, in the long run, when parents are no longer there, there is a group of people who care about the person with a disability and care about continuing to ensure that there is a group who will monitor the quality of the services that are being offered to these people not just for their adequacy but for their suitability for the particular individual.
I think it is important to note that succession planning services should not be provided by current service providers. By that I mean that the organisation that is currently providing accommodation or employment or assisting with personal hygiene and health issues should not also be the organisation that is doing the planning for those things. It seems to me and Lifeways that there is an unacceptable conflict of interest if organisations that are providing accommodation and other services are also assisting families to plan for the provision of services and for monitoring the quality of those services.
Late last year the Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs responded to this planning crisis by producing two very useful booklets on succession planning for families. This followed quite wide consultation throughout Queensland. This parliament also passed legislation, initially developed by Senator Patterson when she was the Minister for Family and Community Services, to enable families to establish special disability trusts. I think special disability trusts deserve wider publicity and recognition than they are currently getting. There was a catch 22 for parents who were trying to provide for an adult child with a disability in that if they managed to save any significant amounts of money to help that person it affected their pension entitlements. Special disability trusts allow families to have funds of up to half a million dollars and a principal place of residence for the use of the adult with a disability before pension entitlements and other government benefits are affected. This gives people a very strong impetus to save to underpin that planning for the future.
It is also worth mentioning that in recent weeks Minister Brough has announced a $1.8 billion disability assistance package of supported accommodation and respite services. Information sessions on this will be held throughout Australia in the coming weeks.
What are the state governments doing? In most cases, it is very little. There is one good planning organisation in Queensland, called Pave the Way, but it is only able to assist a very small proportion of those families wanting help. Across the board, most state governments are failing their disability communities. Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania apparently cannot even manage to develop lists of the known unmet needs in the disability area in their states. They cannot meet even the most basic governance requirements in relation to the Commonwealth funding— (Time expired)

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-09-19,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Community Services (Senator Scullion) to questions without notice asked by Senators Webber and Campbell today relating to housing affordability.
In the main issue of housing affordability, Australians do not have a government that runs on sound economic principles, with rigorous policy development processes working for the benefit of Australian working families. We do have a government that has one guiding principle and one guiding principle only—that is, the marketing spin of its research agency, Crosby Textor. It is a government that will do anything, say anything and spend any amount to win office in the forthcoming election. It is a government desperately manufacturing lines and policies on the run in an attempt to create an agenda. We see that when it goes to its own backbench and says: ‘There is a whiteboard. What we want are some good ideas about housing affordability.’ It is too late. Time is too short. It is a short-termism that is typical of this government. It is not a way of engaging with your backbench. It demonstrates that the government does not have any policy and does not have any ability to lead the debate on housing affordability. Instead, it wants to simply jot down ideas on a whiteboard and then wipe them off after the next election.
We have a government that is more interested in spin. It does not respect the difficulty that working families are facing out in the community. It is not mindful of the struggles and challenges that working families have to meet every day. Let us look at the evidence. Over the last few weeks we have seen the attempts of the Prime Minister to promote himself as a strong man. The government mentioned today how he is out there in a strong way. But what he is doing is a furphy. He is aggressively attacking the states but as proxies for the opposition. We have seen the truth come out, though. It is about pork-barrelling and largesse reaching new levels from this government. It knows only one way, and that one way is to spend its way out of a problem. It has done that every time. You see that with phrases like ‘aspirational nationalism’. It tries to come up with phrases to jag the public’s interest. Stop the rot. Do not try to find phrases like ‘aspirational nationalism’ to get people’s attention. Come up with a good policy. Come up with a proper approach. Come up with something other than short-termism, something other than the most ugly and clumsy juxtaposition of ideas and language since the Prime Minister brought us ‘incentivisation’ back in 1987.
What we do know from Crosby Textor is that Howard will play a brand of federalism politics that is likely neither to work nor to endure as a template for government. Working families are juggling work commitments, increased consumer prices and increased uncertainty about their working conditions. They are worried about their children in the workplace as well. They are worried about how they are going to afford their houses. They are worried about how they are going to get to work, because this government has not built critical infrastructure. They are worried about how they are going to compete in the marketplace. They are worried about how they are going to ensure that all of those matters are addressed. This government has not invested in significant broadband services. In fact, all this government has done is find a label to stick across everything.
The Prime Minister said that people have never been better off, but it is reported in the press that people are struggling and losing their houses because this government does not care. The research shows that the number of households enduring mortgage stress will rise above 600,000 in the coming months. The Australian Mortgage Industry Report, from Fujitsu Australia and JPMorgan, reveals that 138,000 families may be forced to give up their homes because of mortgage stress. This is how out of touch this 11-year-old government has become. It is out of touch and does not care. As working families tighten their belts, this government embarks on a spending spree which is devoid of any purpose other than keeping Mr and Mrs Howard in Kirribilli House. Senator Minchin summed it up some time ago. In terms of the industrial relations debate, they do not want to tell us what they are going to do or provide any future direction— (Time expired)

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2007-09-19,"—I would also like to take note of answers in relation to housing affordability. I find it completely bemusing that it would cause concern to the opposition that, for 2½ solid hours yesterday, members of the coalition managed to come up with good, fresh, innovative ideas to help this country. We do not just have committees and reference groups to think about what to do; good ideas have been a hallmark of this government and will continue to be so. It is somewhat bizarre to think that having good ideas would be seen as a failure or a weakness of any sort.
Let us look at some of the facts behind the housing affordability situation. Yes, there are some families struggling and, yes, our government is working to assist those families. Let us also look at what the state governments are doing to assist those families. In all states there is a department of housing. What are they doing to help families with any problems? What have they done to develop more rental stock? What have they done to assist people who are in any sort of crisis—apart from selling off a few houses and not worrying about demand or supply? Let us look at what they have done to assist those families who may be about to experience mortgage stress. What have the states done with their growth taxes such as the GST, stamp duty, land tax and even, shamefully, their growing revenues from gambling? What do they do with those funds, which might assist families who have any concerns about their ability to afford houses?
Let us flip that around and look at it from the other perspective. What has the federal government done to assist working families? We are proud that we can say ‘working families’, because more families than ever before are currently in work. This is part of the reason why these people can afford mortgages to buy houses. More people than ever before are in a position to get themselves into the housing market.
Let us also look at what we have done in terms of reducing tax over the past 12 months. The new tax rates that came in in July this year give families the opportunity to invest that little bit more in their mortgage. In fact, if you look at the current mortgage situation, you will find that more than 25 per cent of people are more than a year ahead with their mortgage payments. Half the people in Australia who have mortgages are ahead with their repayments. That is the very sensible attitude that a lot of Australians have taken to give themselves a buffer in case of problems that might arise—not small increases in interest rates but the dramas and crises that can come up and affect any family as it goes through life.
We should also look at the Reserve Bank’s notes on the views of households about their personal finances. Most households report that their personal finances are stronger today than 12 months ago. They have continued to reap the benefits of a strong economy with high employment, lower tax rates and a lower take from the federal government. That is not so, unfortunately, in terms of the state governments. The states were dragged kicking and screaming to get rid of their taxes on bank deposits and other areas—things they were supposed to give up in exchange for getting the GST. What have they done with those growth taxes they have received from the federal government? They have done very little to help families. Senator Ludwig mentioned infrastructure. I thought roads, buses and gutters were the province of state governments. This is where we should be looking if we want to look at housing affordability— (Time expired)

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2007-09-19,"—I rise to take note of the answers given to us today by Senator Scullion in relation to housing affordability. This is an absolute policy-free zone when it comes to the Howard government. If it is not a policy-free zone then it is certainly a policy area where there are many different ideas and messages coming from the government members of parliament. One only has to look at the papers today to see that there are almost as many different policies on housing affordability as there are government MPs in this place.
According to newspaper reports today, policy No. 1 has come from Mrs Mirabella and Senator Ferguson, who are suggesting that first home buyers should receive the benefits of negative gearing on the home they live in. Policy No. 2 came from Mrs Danna Vale, suggesting that the Commonwealth should release land and build homes with the private sector. But wait, there is more policy. Policy No. 3 comes from Mr Pat Farmer, who has suggested that the government should match dollar for dollar, up to $50,000, the money first home owners save for their deposit. Last but not least, there is policy No. 4, which is from all the other MPs in this government, suggesting that the first home owners grant should be raised.
Coalition backbenchers are throwing policies around like they are going out of fashion. That is because they are desperate to have one clear, consistent policy from this government when it comes to housing affordability. But the Prime Minister and his cabinet ministers have been unable to lock in a concrete policy on how they want to tackle this issue. They are caught in a bind. There have been nine consecutive interest rate rises under this government and five interest rate rises since the last election. The pressure on this government to come up with a policy and plan for the future, an idea about how they will tackle this if they are re-elected, has caught them out again with a lack of policy on housing. We know that it is embarrassing for their backbenchers, who reiterate three or four different policies in any one day just to try to get this government to lay down a plan for the future and a plan for people who want to buy their own homes. Mr Peter Lindsay only last week blamed young people themselves for being priced out of the housing market.
After 11 long years in government and with a housing market that has frozen out most young people and average wage earners, it is astonishing that this government is in such disarray when it comes to having a plan or policy for housing affordability. At this point in time, statistics show us that homeownership amongst young people has dropped during this government’s term in office. Last week, the Real Estate Institute of Australia published figures showing that only 16.7 per cent of homes financed in June were purchased by first home buyers, compared with the historic average of 20 per cent. So the number of young people buying and purchasing their own homes is dropping. This government refuses to accept those statistics or to act on them.
According to Mortgage Choice’s latest survey, 28 per cent of Australians will be aged 41 years or older when they buy their first home. Even sadder, hundreds of thousands of Australians will be simply unable to ever afford to buy a home without any action by this federal government. In fact, back on 18 July the Australian stated that this is clearly all a bit beyond the Prime Minister. And clearly it is a bit beyond this Prime Minister and this government to come up with a plan to tackle housing affordability.
We know that data released this year also shows that purchasing a home in a capital city has become even tougher, with the Australian dream of homeownership slipping further out of the reach of families. This is a government that has no plan for housing affordability and no blueprint for what it will do in the future. It languishes in the past and pretends it has a track record on this when the statistics show us otherwise. After nine consecutive interest rate rises and five interest rate rises since the last election, this is a policy-free zone— (Time expired)

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2007-09-19,"—I also rise to take note of the answers given by Senator Scullion. Another day in the Senate and another day of empty Labor Party rhetoric. We on this side of the chamber take the pressures on working families very seriously. That is why we are focused on a strong economy, creating jobs, increasing real wages and keeping taxes low. The reality is that, in an environment where we have a growing population, the main thing that we can do to improve housing affordability is increase the supply of affordable land. If senators on the other side of the chamber were really so concerned about improving housing affordability across Australia, they would be phoning the Premier of New South Wales, the Premier of South Australia, the Premier of Victoria and the Premier of Western Australia. I call on my esteemed colleague Senator Ruth Webber to phone her very good friend the Premier of Western Australia, Alan Carpenter, and the Minister for Planning and Infrastructure, Alannah MacTiernan, and call on them to release more land and cut red tape, and call on the Treasurer of Western Australia, Eric Ripper, to reduce the extreme property taxes, stamp duties and land taxes—these are great disincentives for investors to get involved in the housing market—and to make affordable housing available to renters across Western Australia and Australia.
All we have heard today is empty rhetoric. We need a plan for a strong economy and a plan to create jobs and increase real wages, which is why the workplace relations reforms that the Howard government introduced in 1996 and subsequently are so important. I had the great privilege of talking about this last night. What is Labor proposing? Labor is proposing to abolish Australian workplace agreements. Labor is proposing to abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Not only is that going to push the cost of housing up; it is going to have a negative impact on real wages and employment and it is going to make it more difficult for people across Australia to afford their own homes. It is an absolute disgrace.
I have actually experienced, in my own home state of Western Australia, exactly what can happen when Labor comes into government and pursues those sorts of policies—indeed, particularly in the building and construction industry, which is so relevant when it comes to affordable housing. Straight after the Gallop Labor government was elected in 2001, in less than two weeks unions were going on a rampage across all of the major building sites across Western Australia. Of course, should Labor be successful—God help us!—at the next election, we are very likely to see exactly the same thing. The impact of that is less affordable housing, not more affordable housing.
Senator Ludwig spoke about marketing and how the government is focused on marketing itself. I do not think that there are any lessons we can take from the Labor Party on that. Today, I came across an article in the Age headed: ‘Bracks’ water ads broke budget’. I thought I would read that into Hansard, because it is quite outrageous. The article states:
Controversial advertisements starring former premier Steve Bracks spruiking the Government’s water plans cost taxpayers more than $1.7 million—70 per cent more than Mr Bracks admitted at the time.
Documents obtained by The Age under freedom of information reveal taxpayers funded television, radio, print and internet advertisements, shown in June, had a price tag of $1.7 million.
Those are, of course, those infamous ads showing the then Premier, Stephen Bracks, coming down in the helicopter and trying to sell himself.
The issue of housing affordability is a very serious issue. There are many families across Australia aspiring to buy their first home and, in the current environment, finding it tough. We are the first ones to acknowledge that. All of us as policymakers across Australia, whether we are at the state or the federal level, ought to very seriously reflect and consider what sorts of policies are able to make a positive difference to those families across Australia. Those families are not going to be helped by empty political rhetoric from the other side. If you, the Labor Party, are really seriously concerned, if you are really seriously interested in making a difference, pick up the phone, talk to your premiers, talk to your state ministers and get them to cut red tape, get them to reduce their property taxes and get them to get off their backsides and do something about it.
I feel very passionate about this because in Western Australia the levels of taxes and property taxes—the disincentives for people to buy their own home and for people to invest in properties that they might make available for affordable rental housing—are just so enormous. We are having very serious issues, particularly in our regional areas. (Time expired)

"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2007-09-19,"—All I can say, with all due respect to you, Senator Cormann, is that I must live in a different part of Perth to you, because if you were aware of what is going on in Perth you would not be interested in the blame game, which is all that those opposite do; you would actually understand what is happening in the northern suburbs. You would understand that in the electorate of Stirling 34 per cent of people are suffering from mortgage stress. When I am in that community, people come and see me regularly and complain about the $300 a week they have to pay to rent a house in Balga or Nollamara. You would not be interested in playing the blame game; you would be interested in sitting down and talking about real solutions, if you really do care about those people.
Obviously, your colleague Peter Lindsay from Queensland understands, although he likes to blame young people themselves. Other members of your party are open about the fact that there really is a housing affordability crisis. They talk about young families under mortgage stress being forced to sit on milk crates. What we need to do is work together and address the problem. All of those people in Stirling, those 34 per cent of people who are suffering from mortgage stress, remember your Prime Minister and your Treasurer—L1 and L2, as they are colloquially known around here now—promising to keep interest rates at record lows. Five interest rate increases later, they do not believe it when all of a sudden you have a brainstorming session and decide that you care. The way that you demonstrate that you care is to blame-shift—blame someone else. The Treasurer, after the last interest rate rise, said:
House prices are higher than they have been and they are higher than they have been because more people are in work and more people are able to afford to borrow to purchase more expensive housing.
When asked whether there is no crisis, the Treasurer replied:
Well, no.
You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say, ‘Yes, there is a crisis and we are going to blame everyone else,’ even though you are the party that has been in government for 11 long years; you are the party that has been responsible for the five successive interest rate rises since the last election. You have the Treasurer—L2, as he is colloquially known now—saying, ‘Well, actually there is no crisis.’ He does not seem to accept that there is a crisis. You can go for the third option, which is the option that Senator Ludwig was referring to, which is to simply come up with another marketing plan: get your mates from Crosby Textor out there and work out what the spin needs to be.
In the real world—the real world that is the northern suburbs of Perth, where 34 per cent of people are suffering mortgage stress—working families are facing the prospect of not being able to afford to buy their own home. They are facing the prospect of not being able to afford to pay $300 a week to live in Balga or Nollamara. That is the real world; that is what is happening today. After 11 long years, your government has done nothing to help people face those challenges. Those families are obliged to pay nearly one-third of their incomes on home loan repayments—the highest ever percentage of their income. That is the Howard-Costello-Vaile legacy—whoever wants to claim responsibility for this government’s legacy—to the northern suburbs of Perth. And what is the answer? Blame someone else. There was a scattergun, brainstorming exercise yesterday, where we had, all of a sudden, lots of different issues and lots of different options. The government just play the blame game, rather than accepting responsibility and helping those families who are in mortgage stress or helping the young families who are looking to buy their first home—and rather than actually showing that you accept some responsibility for five interest rate rises in a row.
When you add to that those families spending over one-third of their income trying to meet their mortgage repayments and the uncertainties they face in the labour market, thanks to Work Choices—that labour market system whose name the government dare not speak anymore—it is little wonder that families are feeling very nervous and very stressed about the future. This government’s typical solution is to take a scattergun approach, blame everyone else and then get Crosby Textor to test a few of the lines that were tried— (Time expired)

the suffering of the ‘comfort women’ in the 1930s and 1940s was an appalling episode in Japan’s history and that of the Asia Pacific region, and that there can be no disputing the facts of what occurred and the pain that it caused to those affected,
the position of successive Australian governments has been that the 1951 Peace Treaty, which Australia signed, firmly drew a line under the crimes committed by Japan before and during the Second World War, for which many Japanese were rightly tried, convicted and sentenced,
Japan has made great progress since 1945 in recognising and atoning for its past actions, and for many decades has been a major contributor to international peace, security and development, including through the United Nations,
the 1993 statement by then Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono on the comfort women issue (the ‘Kono statement’) fully and officially acknowledged the complicity of the Japanese Government and military in the 1930s and 1940s in a coercive system of sexual slavery in occupied territories, and
the Kono statement has been reaffirmed by subsequent Japanese governments and prime ministers, including by Prime Minister Abe;
commends the Japanese people and Government for the steps they have taken so far to acknowledge and atone for Japan’s actions in the 1930s and 1940s; and
encourages the Japanese people and Government to take further steps to recognise the full history of their nation, to foster awareness in Japan of its actions in the 1930s and 1940s, including in relation to comfort women, and to continue dialogue with those affected by Japan’s past actions in a spirit of reconciliation.

Leave granted.
The statements of reasons read as follows—

STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE IN THE 2007 SPRING SITTINGS


HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL


Purpose of the Bill

The bill corrects an unintentional requirement that in the course of deciding an application for registration the Private Health Insurance Administration Council (PHIAC) must refuse the application if the rules of the private health insurer, relating to both health insurance business and health related business, permit improper discrimination.  The improper discrimination provisions have always applied to health insurance business which is insurance products that cover hospital and general treatment.  Health related business covers overseas visitors’ health cover, dental and optical clinics.  It was not intended to subject health related business to the improper discrimination provisions. Unless an amendment is made it will have a particular impact upon the provision of insurance to overseas visitors and could mean that private health insurers are not prepared to offer overseas visitors’ health cover.
Two provisions in the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 (PHI Act), unintentionally require health insurers to community rate overseas visitors’ health cover. This was not the policy intention, and amendments need to be made to a provision regarding re-registration and an offence provision in the PHI Act to allow health insurers to risk rate these products.  Health insurers will then be able to compete on a level playing field with general insurers who offer overseas visitors’ health cover.
Amendments to the PHI legislation are also required to provide that APRA regulation and FSR requirements of overseas students’ health cover do not come into effect until 1 July 2008. This would align overseas students’ health cover with overseas visitors’ health cover (which is not subject to APRA regulation or FSR requirements until 1 July 2008), and would give the affected insurers enough time to change their business practices to comply with the new requirements.

An unintended consequence of the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Act 2007, which amended the National Health Act 1953, was to inadvertently restrict this substitution, which is an important element of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Restricting pharmacists from carrying out this role will have adverse effects on pharmacists, consumers and the pharmaceutical industry.
This amendment will restore the substitution of pharmaceutical items to its original legislative and policy intent.

Reasons for Urgency

Prior to the enactment of the PHI Act overseas students’ health cover did not have to meet the requirements of general insurance and was not subject to APRA standards or FSR regulation.  APRA has raised concerns that in effect the overseas students’ providers may be offering general insurance without a general insurance license, which attracts a criminal penalty of $35,000 a day.
The measures concerning the PBS needs to be implemented in time for the release of the October Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits to insure minimum disruption for pharmacists, consumers and the pharmaceutical industry.

HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (EXTENDING FEE-HELP FOR VET DIPLOMA, ADVANCED DIPLOMA, GRADUATE DIPLOMA AND GRADUATE CERTIFICATE COURSES) BILL 2007


Purpose of the Bill

The Bill sets up the arrangements and appropriation to extend FEE-HELP assistance to full-fee paying students at the VET diploma level qualifications and above at registered training organisations, including TAFEs and private providers.
As this Budget measure is an extension of FEE-HELP in the higher education sector, this amendment is based substantially on the existing FEE-HELP mechanisms already in the Higher Education Support Act.

Reasons for Urgency

The legislation needs to be enacted to allow training providers as much lead time as possible to permit the introduction of FEE-HELP from 2008 as indicated in the budget.
Delay in the passage of the Bill will cause considerable disruption to students planning for study during the 2008 academic year.
Students may consider deferring study until FEE-HELP is available resulting in an adverse financial impact on training providers.

INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT (Cape York MEASURES) BILL 2007


Purpose of the Bill

This proposal is part of a package being put forward by the Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership under an Indigenous Welfare Reform trial design phase, funded by the Australian Government. 
The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Indigenous Targeted Assistance Act 2000 Act to provide additional education support in the Cape York communities of Coen, Hope Vale, Aurukun, and Mossman Gorge by:
embedding the MULTILIT (Making Up for Lost Time in Literacy) teaching methodology and Tutorial Centres to enhance literacy teaching practice and literacy standards in Cape York schools; and
implementing Student Education Trusts (SETs) to enable parents/guardians to save to financially support their child’s education.

Reasons for Urgency

The amendments for increased funding for the 2008 year are required by 1 January 2008 to enable the Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership to implement MULTILIT and SETs in the four identified communities in Cape York prior to the commencement of the 2008 school year. 
It is critical that the increased funding is made available to the Cape York Institute with as much lead time as possible to permit the appropriate delivery of MULTILIT and SETs for these students from the beginning of 2008.
It is highly desirable that the additional funding for the initiatives be available from the beginning of the school year to ensure minimal disruption in implementation.  As increased funding is regarded an urgent priority in the Cape York region of Queensland to assist disadvantaged students, delays in implementation may cause adverse public reactions.

NATIONAL HEALTH SECURITY BILL


Purpose of the Bill

The bill provides the basis for a national framework for the management of Australia’s response to public health events of national and international concern.
The bill establishes a national register of laboratories holding hazardous biological materials and makes the legislative changes needed for Australia to comply with the core provisions of the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR (2005)).  These include the need to address privacy concerns related to the collection and sharing of health data between jurisdictions, the Commonwealth and the World Health Organization.

Reasons for Urgency

Australia’s response to national public health emergencies has been characterised by strong collaboration, cooperation and coordination between the states, territories and the Commonwealth.  However, the 21st century has introduced a new era of public health challenges for Australia and the global community.  The bill provides for certainty in consultation and cooperation between all Australian governments.
The bill gives certainty to implementation of IHR provisions for the exchange of health surveillance information, which entered into force on 15 June 2007.

SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES No. 2) BILL


Purpose of the Bill

The bill makes various amendments to social security law. It expands eligibility for automatic exemptions from participation requirements to principal carers who are relatives (other than parents) caring for a child under a parenting order under the Family Law Act 1975.
Section 12 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 does not operate as intended and the amendments to section 12 remove ambiguity and limit retrospectivity of transfers to other payments and access to closed payments.
The bill also reinforces the role of the Job Capacity Assessor (JCA) in assessing work capacity and applying impairment tables for people with disability or temporary incapacity.  Amendments ensure appropriate income support decisions and reviews of these decisions under social security law, which will clarify and uphold the role of JCA providers.
A minor technical amendment to section 1237AAD of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 is also included in the bill, with a view to streamlining administrative arrangements.

Reasons for Urgency

The bill is in part a response to the ruling of the Federal Court concerning the operation of section 12.  The early passage of the bill will provide certainty to those affected.

SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2007 BUDGET MEASURES FOR STUDENTS) BILL 2007


Purpose of the Bill

The Bill makes amendments to the Student Assistance Act 1973, the Social Security Act 1991 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to implementation measures announced in the 2007-08 Budget.  The Bill also makes amendments to streamline the administration of these Acts.
The measures are:
Extending Rent Assistance to Austudy students
Extending Youth Allowance and Austudy to approved professionally oriented coursework masters programmes
Amending the Tax Act to exclude payments under the ABSTUDY Crisis and Bereavement payments from the definition of income.

Reasons for Urgency

The legislation needs to be enacted to allow Budget measures to commence on 1 January 2008 so as to support students for the 2008 academic year.  Students who have planned their future study intentions on the basis of Budget announcements for 2008 should be able to rely on receiving these payments from that date.
Without enabling legislation, the Determination of Education Institutions and Courses to support the measures and technical changes to the Centrelink operating environment to implement these measures cannot proceed.

TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES No. 6) BILL 2007


Purpose of the Bill

The Bill amends various taxation Acts.

Reasons for Urgency

These measures need to be enacted as early as possible to provide certainty for business and taxpayers in relation to how the law applies.  Passage in this sitting is required as several of the measures are retrospective or are to commence in 2007.

TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (SMALL BUSINESS PROTECTION) BILL 2007


Purpose of the Bill

The bill amends section 87 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (the Act) to allow the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to take representative action in relation to sections 45D and 45E of the Act, affording business, particularly small businesses, enhanced protection from unlawful secondary boycotts.

Reasons for Urgency

Passage of the bill in the Spring sittings would allow the benefits to businesses contained in the bill to commence without delay.
Passage of the bill will allow the ACCC to seek compensation for illegal boycott activities on behalf of businesses that may otherwise not have the time or resources to enforce their legal right.  By doing so the bill improves the access of such businesses to remedies under the Act.
A delay in the passage of the bill may deny an effective remedy to businesses that suffer loss or damage as a result of an unlawful activity.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2007-09-19,"—I present the 10th report of 2007 of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I also lay on the table Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No. 12 of 2007, dated 19 September 2007.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
In tabling the committee’s Alert Digest No. 12 of 2007 and the 10th report of 2007, I would like to advise the Senate that the committee has not had the opportunity to consider the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2007, which was introduced in and passed by the Senate yesterday. While, pending the election, any comments that the committee may have on the bill will be included in a future Alert Digest, this will obviously be too late to inform the Senate debate on this bill, which is unfortunate.
I would, however, like to draw the Senate’s attention to a bill that has been reported on in Alert Digest No. 12 of 2007—the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Review of Prudential Decisions) Bill 2007. This bill includes numerous provisions that create offences of strict liability. Under the Criminal Code, if a law that creates an offence provides that the offence is one of strict liability, there are no fault elements for any of the physical elements of the offence. This means that, for example, the prosecution has to prove only that the person committed the act in question, not that they intended to do so.
The committee recognises that strict liability offences are appropriate in some circumstances. In particular, strict liability may be appropriate where it is necessary to ensure the integrity of a regulatory regime such as public health or financial or corporate regulation. The committee is of the view, however, that fault liability is one of the most fundamental protections of criminal law and that to exclude this protection is a serious matter. Where legislation seeks to apply strict liability to an offence, the explanatory memorandum to the bill should clearly explain, on a case by case basis, why strict liability is considered appropriate in the particular circumstances of that offence.
Such explanations should clearly demonstrate that the principles outlined in the Guide to the Framing of Commonwealth Offences, Civil Penalties and Enforcement Powers have been taken into account. The committee’s sixth report of 2002, Application of absolute and strict liability offences in Commonwealth legislation, also outlines a number of principles that the committee considers important to the application of strict liability. Under no circumstances should the imposition of strict liability be justified by reference to broad, uncertain criteria such as the ‘public good’.
In the case of the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Review of Prudential Decisions) Bill 2007, the explanatory memorandum seeks to justify the application of strict liability on the basis that these are:
… offences for non-compliance with basic regulatory requirements that should be complied with by all persons.
The committee’s view is that one could argue that all laws, by their very nature, should be ‘complied with by all persons’ and that this is not, therefore, a justification for applying strict liability to these particular offences.
It is also of concern to the committee that this is not the first time that we have seen this justification for the application of strict liability. The explanatory memorandum to the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Simplifying Regulations and Review) Bill 2007 also sought to justify strict liability offences on the same basis. The committee commented on that bill in its 8th report and is awaiting advice from the Treasurer.
The committee has written in similar terms to the Treasurer about the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Review of Prudential Decisions) Bill. Pending receipt of that advice, I draw these provisions to the attention of senators.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2007-09-19,"—I present the government’s response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on its inquiry into the provisions of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2007. I seek leave to have the document incorporated into Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
RESPONSES TO THE REPORT’S RECOMMENDATIONS

Recommendation 1 – Agreed in-principle


The Government appreciates the importance of providing information to members of the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS) and the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS) who are considering reducing their member contributions or leaving the PSS.


ARIA will continue to provide information and advice to members in accordance with the terms of its Australian Financial Service Licence. This licence permits ARIA to provide general advice, but not personal advice, to members.


However, the 
Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993
 does not permit the Government to instruct the trustee of a superannuation scheme in its decision making. For this reason, the Government is unable to agree to the exact wording of the recommendation.


Recommendation 2 – Agreed in-principle


The Government acknowledges the need to effectively promote the pension restoration changes. As the Report notes, this process has already begun. Arrangements have been made with the Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and other relevant entities (such as the Superannuated Commonwealth Officers Association) to include appropriate information about pension restoration in their newsletters.


As with recommendation 1, however, the 
Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993
 does not permit the Government to instruct the trustee of a superannuation scheme in its decision making. Therefore, the Government is unable to agree to the exact wording of the recommendation.


Recommendations 3 and 4 – Not agreed


The Government acknowledges the desirability of individuals not being financially disadvantaged by the commencement provisions of these changes and notes that the Committee’s proposals are designed to achieve this outcome. However, the Government is concerned that the retrospective effect of these recommendations may have detrimental impacts on individuals. For example, the additional income an individual receives in relation to a prior year as a result of the proposed backdating may be sufficient to reduce or remove eligibility for other benefits, such as the social welfare pension and the health care card.


Should individuals be found to have been overpaid such benefits due to an increase in their income, it may result in a debt being owed to the Commonwealth.


Therefore, while the Government agrees to the Committee’s intention in making these recommendations, it is of the view that the same outcome can be achieved effectively through mechanisms, such as act of grace payments, under the 
Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997
.


Recommendation 5 – Agreed


The Government agrees to the recommendation that the Senate pass the Bill.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-09-19,"—On behalf of Senator Stott Despoja, I move Democrat amendment (1) on sheet 5353:
(1)    Clause 40, page 30 (lines 7 to 9), omit subclause 40(2), substitute:
         (2)    The Advisory Board consists of not less than 7 members representing a range of professional backgrounds who collectively possess knowledge and expertise in the following fields:
              (a)    tertiary sector management;
              (b)    the research sector;
              (c)    teaching and learning;
              (d)    the evaluation of capital infrastructure;
              (e)    knowledge transfer to industry;
                  such persons to be appointed from time to time to the Advisory Board by the Education Minister in writing.
The Higher Education Endowment Fund Bill as it currently stands gives the Minister for Education, Science and Training enormous freedom to appoint members of the Higher Education Endowment Fund Advisory Board as she sees fit, but there is no mention of the size of the board in this legislation nor of the expertise that would be sought. Although the minister has separately announced that it will consist of a chair and six members with the Secretary of the Department of Education, Science and Training and the Chief Scientist serving in ex-officio roles, this clause as read is very open-ended.
The amendment that the Democrats have put forward today clarifies the size of the advisory board and stipulates that the board should collectively possess knowledge and expertise in certain fields. Our amendment focuses on the part of the Higher Education Endowment Fund Bill 2007 that deals with the Higher Education Endowment Fund Advisory Board, its relationship with the minister for education and the awarding of grants to universities. This amendment is designed to improve the level of transparency and accountability in the government’s delivery of this significant initiative. This amendment deals with clause 40, which sets out membership of the advisory board. Currently the clause is open-ended, as I have said, giving the minister total discretion as to the number of members, when they are appointed, when their appointments are terminated, what their experience is and so on.
We have taken advice from the sector. They say that the advisory board must have a strong mix of experience from research, academia and industry. The National Tertiary Education Union, the Group of Eight universities, the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies and the Australian Academy of the Humanities all raised the extent of ministerial discretion in appointing the board as a matter of concern. So our amendment seeks to specify the kind of knowledge and experience that should be on the board in order to position it to be best suited to the job at hand. We specify collectively so that one individual could potentially cover off more than one of those categories of experience. This still gives the minister significant discretion in appointing members but also gives the higher education sector some certainty that the appropriate skill set will be on the board. It is also consistent with other legislation—for example that dealing with national health and medical research advisory committees—which specifies particular knowledge or experience.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION ENDOWMENT FUND BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2007-09-19,"—I will take this opportunity, because at this time of the year time is short, to indicate that the Labor Party is disappointed with the answers the government has given. While we have indicated support for the principle of this legislation, it is quite apparent that the level of ministerial discretion is wide-open. The capacity under this legislation for the minister to vary decisions on advice received from the so-called ‘council of guardians’—some sort of Orwellian group of people that the minister will appoint—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—No, Orwellian would be more appropriate. We have a situation here where the level of detail in this legislation is grossly inadequate and it is quite apparent, as the previous minister at the table indicated, that the government itself sees the need for amendment to this legislation. In this debate, the government has already foreshadowed that, if it is re-elected, it will be proposing further amendments to this legislation. With that in mind, I indicate to the chamber that the Labor Party too feels that this legislation in its present form is inadequate, is vague and is unclear in a number of important aspects. Also, as the chamber would be aware, the Labor Party has a different approach to the development of a national innovation system and its administrative arrangements. Given that a very large proportion of this funding will end up going towards research funding, it is quite clear that there will be need for revision of the way in which these mechanisms are administered. In that context we say to the Democrats, on all three amendments, that because this bill has been so badly drafted, and notwithstanding that we support the sentiments that have been expressed by Senator Allison, we will be opposing them.
We take the view that this legislation has a number of deep flaws, and tinkering with it at this point would not be appropriate and would not be able to remedy the problems that have been identified. The processes of allocation of research support are not transparent and, under these Democrat amendments, that situation will not necessarily be improved. There are acute problems remaining with the core issues indicated at this point with regard to the criteria for making recommendations for funding to institutions. They are not adequately specified in this legislation and we have yet to see the guidelines. We are told only that there will be further consultation, which in this government’s sorry record with regard to research policy could mean with anybody, and it gives me no satisfaction and no confidence that this government will proceed properly. Rather than provide a bandaid solution at this point in the cycle, we will not be supporting the amendments of the Democrats.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION ENDOWMENT FUND BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1

In the light of that actuarial advice tendered to the Senate committee, is it the department’s view that funding will be available in the time lines previously indicated?

I undertook, in the appropriate manner, inquiries of the nature that I conveyed to Senator Carr yesterday and I am not in a position to advise him of any further information.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-09-19,"—I move Democrat amendment (2) on sheet 5353:
(2)    Clause 41, page 30 (lines 22 to 30), omit the clause, substitute:
41  Functions of the Advisory Board
         (1)    The Advisory Board has the functions of:
              (a)    assessing and ranking applications submitted under the Higher Education Endowment Fund for a grant of financial assistance, according to guidelines issued by the Education Minister;
              (b)    making grant recommendations to the Education Minister; and
              (c)    other matters referred to it by the Education Minister that relate to:
                    (i)    making grants of financial assistance to eligible higher education institutions in relation to capital expenditure; or
                   (ii)    making grants of financial assistance to eligible higher education institutions in relation to research facilities.
         (2)    A guideline made under subsection (1)(a) must specify the considerations by which grants of financial assistance will be made to higher education institutions, including but not limited to criteria providing for merit and eligibility.
         (3)    A guideline made under subsection (1)(a) is a legislative instrument to which section 42 (disallowance) of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 applies.
         (4)    The Minister must cause a copy of a grant recommendation made in accordance with paragraph (1)(b) to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of the Minister’s receipt of the recommendation.
This amendment again seeks to address Democrat concerns and those of several sector stakeholders regarding the lack of specificity in this bill on the functions of the board and how grants under the fund will actually be awarded. It amends clause 41 to clarify that the primary function of the advisory board is to assess and rank applications for grant assistance under the Higher Education Endowment Fund and to make recommendations to the education minister on which applications should be awarded funding.
This amendment retains the power of the education minister to seek other advice from the board where it in some way relates to grants for capital works or research facilities. We have also introduced reference to program guidelines in this section and stipulated that these guidelines must make clear the considerations by which grants of financial assistance will be awarded, including amongst other things the eligibility and merit criteria. These factors will have a critical impact on whether or not the fund is a successful stimulus to the higher education sector.
As the bill stands, the parliament is being asked to approve legislation for the commitment of a very significant amount of money to an initiative that could have a big impact of the higher education sector, and yet we have little detail to allow either us or the sector to anticipate what that impact might be. Once the bill is passed, we will have no control over the fine detail, and I am not alone in being concerned about the extent of discretion afforded the government in this regard.
Again, many sector stakeholders suggested to the Senate inquiry that the guidelines be a disallowable instrument, so this amendment stipulates that as well. Finally, this amendment also refers to the interaction between the advisory board and the minister on applications for grant assistance under the fund. Currently the bill does not actually specify that the advisory board is to recommend applications for grant assistance to the minister, but this was implicit in Minister Bishop’s second reading speech, where she said that she will be supported by the board in allocating:
... grants in a manner which best enhances the sector ...
The Department of Education, Science and Training further confirmed this in their submission. There is, however, no legislative requirement for the minister to heed these recommendations. This was highlighted as a concern by a number of sector stakeholders during the Senate inquiry because it leaves the door open to politicisation of the grants process. The Democrats share those concerns and with this amendment we seek to ensure that any grant recommendations by the advisory board are tabled in the parliament. That still gives the minister the discretion to accept or reject the recommendations of the board, but it will improve the level of transparency afforded to those decisions.
The government may protest that they approach these things professionally, but it is a fact that perception counts for a lot when awarding taxpayers’ money, so any improvement to transparency ought to be welcome. If the government wish to reject this amendment, I would ask what exactly they have to hide by doing so.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION ENDOWMENT FUND BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2007-09-19,"—With all due respect, Senator Allison, what a silly question—what does the government have to hide?—just because it does not agree with your amendment. Grow up!

(Senator Barnett)—Order! Senator Allison, do you wish to make a point of order?
—Yes. It does not seem to me to be very parliamentary for the minister to be telling senators in this place to grow up. Chair, I ask you to ask the minister to refrain from that kind of jibe.
—I withdraw. It does not seem very parliamentary either to accuse the government of having something to hide simply because it does not agree with an amendment. Let me explain the government’s position to the senator. As stated in 41(1) and 41(2) of the bill, the function of the advisory board will be to advise the education minister about matters related to the making of grants of financial assistance to eligible higher education institutions in relation to capital expenditure and/or research facilities. The government has made it clear that the higher education sector will have a genuine opportunity to engage in the development of this new funding program. This will ensure that the advisory board can make recommendations to the education minister on the basis of sound advice and sector participation.
Further, the government does not accept the need for amendments to the provisions of the bill relating to the issues of program guidelines. It is unnecessary for this level of detail to be prescribed in legislation. This is not an unusual situation. The government has many successful, robust grants programs that do not have their guidelines in legislation. It is an entirely appropriate mechanism, along with the requirements of the Financial Management and Accountability Act, to safeguard against the inappropriate allocation of grants.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-09-19,"—I move Australian Democrats amendment (3) on sheet 5353:
(3)    Page 30 (after line 30), after clause 41, insert:
41A  Keeping the Parliament informed of grant recommendations
             The Minister must cause a copy of a recommendation from the Advisory Board that relates to:
              (a)    a grant of financial assistance to an eligible higher education institution in relation to capital expenditure; or
              (b)    a grant of financial assistance to an eligible higher education institution in relation to research facilities;
             to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of the Minster’s receipt of the recommendation.
This amendment works with the bill as it is currently read to simply call for the minister for education to table the advisory board’s recommendations relating to which applications should receive grants. I am moving this separately because I think it is possibly the most effective single step we can take to improve the level of transparency inherent in the implementation of the fund. In this case the amendment works with clause 41 as printed, adding a new clause 41A to stipulate that any recommendations from the advisory board relating to grants to higher education institutions be tabled in the parliament within 15 days. While it is possible that this amendment could be seen as including all advisory board recommendations to the minister, I would like to stress that I am specifically interested in the advisory board recommendations as to which applications should receive grant funding and not recommendations relating to broader policy or program implementation issues.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION ENDOWMENT FUND BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2007-09-19,"—The subclauses 45(1) and 45(2) make it clear that it is the education minister who authorises grants of financial assistance to eligible higher education institutions. I note that this power was not disputed by any of the parties who made submissions or gave evidence to the recent Senate committee hearing. It is proper that the right to authorise grants rests with the responsible minister, who is accountable to the department for her decisions. This is not an unusual situation. The government has many successful, robust grants programs that do not table recommendations of ministerial advisory bodies in parliament. I further note that the government has made it clear that the higher education sector will have a genuine opportunity to engage in the development of this new funding program.

HIGHER EDUCATION ENDOWMENT FUND (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2007

Bill—by leave—taken as a whole.
Bill agreed to.
Bills reported without amendment; report adopted.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION ENDOWMENT FUND BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-09-19,"—I rise to speak on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (Terrorist Material) Bill 2007. I note that Labor are supportive of this bill; we will support it and vote for it. However, during the committee stage we will move amendments consistent with the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. These were recommendations from a decision of a committee where the majority of Liberal and Labor members supported those recommendations. The aim of the legislation is to provide greater clarity on whether or not terrorist material must be refused classification by the Classification Board of the Office of Film and Literature Classification. The bill will insert a new section 9A into the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act, which provides that material which advocates terrorist acts must be banned.
The proposed new section also provides the criteria that will be used to determine whether or not material advocates the doing of a terrorist act, specifically whether:
it directly or indirectly counsels or urges the doing of a terrorist act; or
it directly or indirectly provides instruction on the doing of a terrorist act; or
it directly praises the doing of a terrorist act in circumstances where there is a risk that such praise might have the effect of leading a person—(regardless of his or her age or any mental impairment (within the meaning of section 7.3 of the Criminal Code) that the person might suffer)—to engage in a terrorist act.
The report of the Senate committee has recommended changes be made to proposed subsection (2)(c) to remove the phrase:
... (regardless of his or her age or any mental impairment (within the meaning of section 7.3 of the Criminal Code) that the person might suffer) ...
This is an amendment that Labor foreshadows it will move in the committee stage. I will return to that in due course. The recommendation was that proposed new section 9A(3) provide a clarification to this, so that the new section would not apply if the depiction or description:
... could reasonably be considered to be done merely as part of public discussion or debate or as entertainment or satire.
So material which is produced genuinely for public debate or for entertainment and satire will not fall under the aegis of proposed section 9A.
Turning to the background of the bill, the bill originated from considerations earlier this year that films advocating terrorist acts of martyrdom and jihad and calling Jews ‘pigs’ were freely available in Australia, having been rated PG by the Office of Film and Literature Classification—OFLC—after referral of the material by the Australian Federal Police. In response to this, the Attorney-General, Mr Philip Ruddock, firstly called on the states and territories to amend the classification laws and subsequently released a discussion paper, ‘Material that advocates terrorist acts’, which has culminated in this bill.
Labor’s response was to call on Mr Ruddock to immediately refer the film to the Classification Review Board on the grounds that the material promoted and incited crimes or violence. However, I note that the Sydney Morning Herald revealed the existence of these movies some two years ago. At the time, the Attorney-General promised that he would act but then did nothing for a year, until he wrote to the states to request action on the National Classification Code. Surprisingly enough, the Attorney-General has now decided that it is time to act, in this instance very shortly before an election. Rather than bring forward this legislation when the situation became public knowledge two years ago and rather than act to protect Australians from this material at the time, he has instead chosen to debate this legislation in possibly the final sitting week before the election.
There is no point in playing the blame game. There is no point in blaming the states for this delay, for not agreeing to the proposals that he took to SCAG earlier this year. The Attorney-General knew about the problem for a year before he wrote to the states. It is a little rich to sit on an issue for a year then throw your hands in the air, foist it on the states and expect them suddenly to agree. Once again the government really demonstrates that it is in a bit of a slow panic over this issue. The government knew about the matter and could have dealt with it in a reasonable way in the course of the 12 months. It could have raised it with the states, raised it through the proper channels and then been able to resolve it, at least with time on its side. The government has known of the existence of the material for the past two years and still, with the introduction of this legislation, has done nothing to attempt to remove it. We have only got to this point now.
I want to take a moment to say a little bit about the Classification Review Board. The chief problem facing Australia’s classification regime these days is simply the fact that the government has spent the last 11 years, instead of making sure that the Classification Review Board has community representation and instead of ensuring that it works effectively within the legislative regime, making it a place where Liberal Party mates are more than well represented. We have now come to a stage where four out of the seven members of the review board have either direct or very close links to the Liberal Party. In other words, we have what is commonly called a non-representative body, in my view, where a large part of the community is not represented.
On the board is a narrow political ideology representing their views. It is really no wonder that the decisions are so out of touch with the community when the Liberal Party is the holder of the majority in the Classification Review Board. How can, really, the Australian community have any confidence in the classification watchdog when more than half of its members are representatives of such a narrow constituency? The government has, like it has with other areas of Public Service institutions, got its hands on it. It has transformed the Classification Review Board into another source of jobs for mates. That is how we got into this mess. Now the Attorney-General has had to find a legislative fix, given his inaction and the way he has treated the Classification Review Board as a place for mates.
I note that many in the community are opposed to the bill. I hope to allay some of their concerns, if not all. It is Labor’s opinion that the bill will not improperly or unfairly impact on the legitimate right of the community to debate these issues. There are moves underway at the Standing Committee of Attorneys General that will allow much greater freedom for academics to access material that has been refused classification. As I understand it, many in the community have legitimate concerns regarding the legislation. However, there are four key points that I would like to take the opportunity this evening to respond to.
The first is that the legitimate concern of many in the community opposed to the bill must be weighed against the competing interests, which include the right of the community to protect itself from material which openly advocates violent attacks upon it. The unfortunate and unacceptable situation at the moment is that we have material which openly advocates for young children to become terrorists, which racially vilifies Jewish people and which is given a PG rating. As Australia’s alternative government, Labor takes the threat of terrorism seriously. We will not allow a situation to evolve where material such as Hamas’s infamous Mickey Mouse look-alike and ‘jihad bee’ characters indoctrinates young Islamic children into acts of violence. I point out that this bill belatedly arose out of a situation in which a DVD urged young children to become terrorists and martyrs, and yet it was given the same rating as The NeverEnding Story or Star Wars.
There is a serious and legitimate concern about freely allowing material which openly purports to turn children into holy warriors or terrorists to circulate. While there is a general presumption in the classification code that adults should be able to see and read what they wish, there have always been limits on this. The right to free speech does not extend to yelling ‘Fire!’ in a crowded theatre, nor does it extend to indoctrinating children in acts of terrorism. On balance, Labor believes that this legislation does strike an appropriate balance between the competing desires of public safety and the right of adults to see and read what they wish.
The second point I would like to take up is that there naturally are legitimate uses of the material itself. Academic, security and intelligence purposes come to mind. I note that some have called for an exemption for academics from the provisions of the new bill; however, this cannot be achieved for technical reasons. While it is the Commonwealth which classifies this material, it is usually state or territory law which provides penalties for its distribution. In other words, the penalty provision or regime is within the states, so this is not something which can be achieved easily under the federal jurisdiction.
However, I would note that there are currently proposals before the Standing Committee of Attorneys General which are looking at ways to allow academics and others with a legitimate interest to legally access material that has been rated RC. I will take the opportunity in the committee stage to examine how far that has now been progressed. It was a matter that was raised in the Senate committee hearings, and obviously some time has passed since then, so I am sure that the department, through the minister, can provide some assistance. In federal Labor’s view, this is an appropriate way to progress the issue. Labor supports the SCAG process. The proposals before the SCAG go a long way to eliminating many of the concerns—the legitimate concerns, may I add—that have been raised by persons who have a legitimate interest in the material.
The third point I would like to explore is that, when you look at it, this legislation in fact only clarifies the existing position. The National Classification Code, as it stands, provides that material that counsels, praises, urges or instructs in matters of crime or violence must already be refused classification. As advocating terrorism and terrorist acts are already offences under the Commonwealth Criminal Code, the effect of the legislation is largely to clarify the situation of material that promotes and incites terrorism. The effect of the scheme would actually be to streamline the process for police investigation of this material. If the police believed that material advocated a terrorist act—again, already an offence under the Criminal Code—then they would be able to refer it to the OFLC for their classification.
Finally, I turn to the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The Senate committee recommended a change to the legislation to make it easier for the material to be classified. I touched on this earlier this evening. As I stated earlier, the problem arises in subclause (c), which provides that material must be banned if it:
... directly praises the doing of a terrorist act in circumstances where there is a risk that such praise might have the effect of leading a person (regardless of his or her age or any mental impairment (within the meaning of section 7.3 of the Criminal Code) that the person might suffer) to engage in a terrorist act.
The Senate committee made this recommendation after receiving submissions, including from the Classification Review Board itself, that this clause would be difficult to enforce. The Classification Review Board said:
It is difficult to envisage circumstances where the Review Board might objectively assess how a teenager, for example, or a person with some mental impairment might react to praise of a terrorist act.
The committee, having examined the submissions, ultimately recommended the removal of this clause from the bill. Labor will support that position and similarly foreshadows an amendment. The position ultimately arrived at, on the submission by the Classification Review Board itself, objectively sought to ensure that the Classification Review Board could do its job effectively and could ensure that material that fell into directly praising the doing of a terrorist act could be removed by making a Refused Classification decision. That which did not meet that standard would not. In other words, the Classification Review Board was indicating that it would be able to then make those decisions itself.
Unfortunately, in this instance, having allowed the situation to continue for over two years—plus, I might add, the full year in which he sat on his hands and did nothing—the current Attorney-General, Mr Ruddock, once again went to the blame game, blaming the states not agreeing to the proposal that he took to SCAG this year to resolve the matter. That notwithstanding, he went out and beat it up beforehand, expected them to meet an agreement and held the bill over their heads to say, ‘If you don’t agree, I’m going to pass the legislation in any event.’ You really wonder about the negotiating skills of the Attorney-General in this respect. He was always going to get what he wanted—that is, the legislation—because of the way he commenced the negotiation. It was not, in my view, in good faith. He undertook a situation where he then ensured that we would be here debating this legislation rather than trying to reach general agreement with the states.
But I have already said that this matter was revealed more than two years ago. So, given he had known about it for that length of time and had left it right to the end to use in a manner which he chose, you can only conclude that he had one aim in mind. That was not to reach agreement with the states themselves but to then find someone to foist the responsibility for the delay in bringing forward proper measures onto the states themselves—in other words, to say, ‘Because you haven’t agreed, it’s your fault; therefore, I have to legislate, and it will take time.’
However, the legislation, in any event, is before us. It is appropriate and adapted to the twin tasks of providing proper guidelines for the classification of terrorist material and of ensuring that the principle that adults should, prima facie, be able to read and view what they want is upheld. It does achieve that. Labor will support the legislation, but I think it does not reflect well on the Attorney-General and the process that he has adopted in bringing this legislation forward. It could have been a much easier and neater process to engage the states, change the guidelines and give the opportunity for the OFLC, the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board to do their work.",SENATE,"<title>CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) AMENDMENT (TERRORIST MATERIAL) BILL 2007</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1

As the Democrats’ Attorney-General Spokesperson, I rise to speak on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (Terrorist Material) Bill 2007
This Bill is objectionable to the Australian Democrats for many reasons.
We consider that the Bill represents a confrontational approach by the Government to law making and comments by the Attorney-General to the effect that this legislative change is necessary because of a lack of cooperation from State Governments are commensurate with a power grab and must be resisted.
The Attorney General noted in his second reading speech that it would be preferable to deal with the subject matter of this Bill via the National Classification Code. The Code has operated as a cooperative classification scheme between the states, territories and the Commonwealth for almost 11 years. It is a scheme that, by and large, has served the community well and operated effectively.
Indeed, the Attorney General devoted more time in his second reading speech to criticising his State counterparts for failing to support amendment to the Code, rather than providing the necessary and concrete basis to Parliament which justifies the need for this legislation.
There is a good reason why the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General did not reach consensus on this Bill—the mechanism is clumsy, the means not justified, and the implications for fundamental rights are too high.

Power grab/constitutionality

In its submission to the Senate inquiry, the Law Council warned that Parliament should not jeopardise the cooperative national scheme by using the Classification Act to circumvent the nationally agreed standards in the Classification Code. In short they say that ‘the success in Australia’s federal system is contingent on jurisdictions not withdrawing their support or simply “going it alone” whenever their preferred view does not prevail’.
The Victorian Attorney General, Mr Rob Hulls, has stated that the matter hasn’t even been properly discussed with the states and that the Attorney General:
‘is trying to bully the states and territories into accepting laws he hasn’t even demonstrated we need.’
Some stakeholders challenged the laws on constitutional grounds. In particular the Sydney Centre for International and Global Law stated that the:
‘proposed power to refuse classification for “praising” terrorism may excessively restrict freedom of religious expression, since it disproportionately affects all believers to control the expressions of a few.’
The Commonwealth is expressly prohibited, of course, from making any laws which prohibit the free exercise of religion by virtue of s.116 of the Constitution.
Moreover, the Centre noted that:
‘constitutional protection limits only Commonwealth laws and does not prevent the States from curtailing religious speech, which is significant given that State criminal laws primarily enforce classification decisions.’
This emphasises the inherent flaw in the Mr Ruddock’s attempt to sideline the states on this issue. The Democrats are concerned by these arguments and consider that it raises the question as to whether the Commonwealth should be legislating in this area on constitutional grounds.  

Bill of Rights

At the risk of sounding like a broken record, the Democrats also consider that the Bill’s dramatic implications for human rights and civil liberties are even more concerning, given Australia does not have a Bill of Rights or Human Rights Act.
As the only common law country without such protection, the basic human rights of Australians are subject to greater risk than the rights of citizens of these other nations.
While a number of the provisions contained in this Bill emulate the United Kingdom’s laws, it does not contain the UK’s accompanying protections for human rights and civil liberties. 
The Human Rights Act and the European Convention on Human Rights provide citizens of the United Kingdom with an avenue of appeal and an opportunity for judicial review when their Government infringes on these rights. I ask the Government: why do Australian citizens not deserve commensurate protection?
Clearly, the absence of a Bill of Rights or Human Rights Act exposes Australians to unjust infringements on their rights and freedoms. A Bill of Rights is about protecting people and ensuring that our Government remains accountable for its actions.
As Sydney Centre for International and Global Law noted:
‘...in the absence of any entrenched statutory or constitutional protection of human rights in Australia, it would not be appropriate to modify classification law in this far-reaching manner. The proposed amendments have the potential to unjustifiably and arbitrarily infringe freedom of expression, without showing any proximate connection to a substantial likelihood of imminent unlawful terrorist violence actually occurring.’
The Democrats’ Parliamentary Charter of Rights and Freedoms Bill is on the Senate Notice Paper and the Democrats will continue to advocate for an Australian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Empirical justification

Turning now to the lack of justification for this Bill by the Government, its content has been described as unjustified and unrepresentative of community views. 
Several agencies have requested empirical evidence to show a causative link between accessing ‘radical materials’ and the risk of terrorism occurring. However, none of the extrinsic material that accompanies the Bill provides a convincing argument as to why existing classification laws should be extended in this manner, nor how the vulnerable in the community are to be protected. No such evidence was presented to the Senate inquiry either.
In contrast, many credible submissions to the Senate inquiry argued that the classification scheme as presently configured is capable of being applied so as to ban material which advocates terrorism.
HREOC recommended that the proposal be reconsidered on the basis that it was not convinced ‘of the necessity for tighter censorship laws in order to combat incitement and/or glorification of terrorism.’
The current provisions of the Classification Code provide that material must be refused classification if, amongst other things, it promotes, incites or instructs in matters of crime or violence.
These existing grounds are claimed by the Attorney General to be inadequate, notwithstanding an acknowledgement that a terrorist act is both a matter of crime and violence. As the Law Council noted:
 ‘…as such material which promotes or incites the commission of such an at or provides instruction on its commission must already be refused classification’
Put simply, the law as it stands is sufficient. The Government is making laws for the sake of making laws and, in all likelihood, as part of its hitherto successful campaign of maintaining a ‘climate of fear’ to justify is actions.

Definition of a terrorist act

The Democrats consider that the Bill uses a problematic definition of terrorism.
 In the words of the NSWCCL:
‘the Code has too broad a definition of what may constitute terrorist activities. While this broad definition may be suitable for dealing with actual terrorist actions, it is not suitable as a guideline for censorship.’
The definition of terrorism for the purpose of the Bill is taken from the Commonwealth Criminal Code—a definition which itself has been widely condemned by none less that the Government appointed Security Legislation review Committee, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence & Security, the Senate legal & Constitutional Affairs Committee and the UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of Fundamental Freedoms while Countering Terrorism.
All of these entities recommended that, in the very least, section 102.1(1A) of the Code, the equivalent of subsection 9A(2), should be amended to require a substantial risk that praise of a terrorist act might lead someone to engage in terrorism, rather than a mere ‘risk’.
But will the Government heed this advice? Of course not, it pushes on with a defective definition, and throws some extra complexity in for good measure!
Subsection 9A(2) attempts to define how someone ‘advocates’ the doing of a terrorist act. The use of advocacy is problematic because it includes the notion of ‘praise’, a far vaguer notion than ‘promotes’ or ‘incites’ as is presently the case in the Code. Quite simply, the definition is too broad.
Further, the Bill purports to require decision makers to stand in the shoes of a young or mentally impaired person, in considering whether there is a risk that praise may lead to terrorist activity. Apart from the obvious logistical difficulties that this scenario may raise, as was made clear by the Classification Review Board itself (how can you put yourself in the shoes of a mentally impaired person!) this requirement unnecessarily introduces a ‘lowest common denominator’ factor.
As stated by the Law Council:
‘..the ability of people to participate in a public debate…should not be unduly circumscribed by  prohibitions based on speculation about how irrational actors may respond to certain material’
If this Bill is to become law we will be moving amendments to delete reference to the phrases identified above and replace them with terms which narrow the scope of materials which can be censored and introduce more objective tests. 

Exemption for genuine educational purposes and policy makers

Finally, the Democrats are alarmed at the Bill’s failure to address whether academics or policy makers may access banned material for academic or policy research.
Various incidents were referred to in submissions to the senate inquiry which highlighted the need to grant academics access to banned materials for study.
Such incidents have included removal of books from university library shelves where the books were introduced by a historian and to help his students understand Jihad, and the questioning of a university student studying the prevention of terrorism by the AFP
Limiting access to books on terrorism will hinder the ability to understand and criticise the ideas expressed in them. This is a problem not only for academics and scholars, but also for the community at large, which depends upon quality research to better understand the social and security challenges facing the nation.
The Democrats oppose the restriction of materials for genuine academic or policy research and we will be moving amendments to create an exemption to allow access to banned materials for this purpose.",SENATE,"<title>CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) AMENDMENT (TERRORIST MATERIAL) BILL 2007</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-09-19,"—Freedom of expression and freedom of speech are two of our most important freedoms, and they must be defended vigorously. The Howard government has presided over many attacks on human rights in Australia, often under the guise of combating terrorism. This is a government that does not tolerate different ideas, and it has jettisoned its liberal principles in the pursuit of conservative power.
Since September 11, over 50 different pieces of legislation have marked the erosion of civil rights and fundamental freedoms in Australia. This marks another step down this road to tyranny. The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (Terrorist Material) Bill 2007 will change the definitions of Australia’s classification laws to ban any publications, films or computer games that advocate terrorist acts. The definition of ‘advocating terrorist acts’ is extremely broad and is built on the flaws of existing terrorism laws with wide definitions. The definition of ‘terrorism acts’ encompasses a wide range of political activities that no reasonable person would construe as terrorism. Nelson Mandela’s ANC, the East Timorese resistance, Tibetan activists or citizens blocking the construction of a coalmine could all fall within the definition of terrorism in this legislation. Even the UN special rapporteur takes the view that Australia’s definition of a ‘terrorist act’ goes beyond the UN Security Council’s characterisation of terrorism and believes that it should be more limited.
The definition of ‘advocacy’ is equally broad, including those who directly praise the doing of such acts. Immediately, it is easy to see how those who praise in print or film the action of the West Papuan independence movement, for example, or the Iraqi insurgents could be caught by these definitions. Regardless of what political perspective one has about such things, should the professing of such views be banned?
It is concern about the depth and the breadth of this definition that meant that the Attorney-General’s attempt to change the censorship laws in this way was rebuffed by the state governments. Now the Howard government is trying to ram them through in the dying days of its government. The Law Council of Australia, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and a range of community and legal organisations have also opposed this bill, but the government is, nevertheless, persisting. The Law Council said in its submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill:
- no need for the proposed amendments has been demonstrated;
- the intended implications of the amendments are unclear and have not been plainly and consistently stated; and
- the amendments seek to rely on definitions used in the Criminal Code which have already been the subject of substantial criticism because they are overly broad and vague.
It goes on to highlight the important limits in international law on government attempts to squash freedom of speech.
Article 19(3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires that any restrictions governments impose on freedom of expression must be necessary:
(a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;
(b) For the protection of national security or of public order ... or of public health or morals.
The Law Council says in its submission:
With the current level of information provided in the Second Reading Speech and EM about the operation of the existing classification regime and the intended effect of the proposed amendments, the Law Council believes that members of parliament could not possibly satisfy themselves that the proposed amendments are necessary in the manner required by international law.
It goes on to say that this parliament has not been given sufficient information to answer the following critical questions:
- are the current provisions directed at materials that promote, incite or instruct on matters of crime or violence insufficient to prohibit the distribution of materials which are likely to increase the risk of a terrorist act?
- If so, in what way are the current provisions insufficient? What type of material do they allow to be published which the Government claims it is necessary to ban?
- Is it in fact necessary to ban this additional material for the protection of national security and/or the respect of other rights? Would the banning of such material actually serve to decrease the risk of a terrorist act and how?
- Are the proposed amendments appropriately targeted at banning this type of material—that is, are the parameters of the type of material targeted clearly defined and are those parameters as narrowly drawn as possible? Or are the proposed amendments so broad or so discretionary that they unduly burden public debate in a manner which is fundamentally incompatible with freedom of expression?
The Law Council is also concerned at the manner in which the government is undermining the cooperative approach to classification laws between the Commonwealth and state governments.
The practical scope of these proposed laws is extremely unclear. The fact that the government has attempted to claim exemptions for entertainment and academic work shows that it knows the definition is highly subjective, broad and open to abuse. Even with these entertainment and academic exemptions, it is hard to know where in practice the censor and courts would draw the line. For example, the computer game Command and Conquer allows a player to be an Islamic terrorist. Would it be captured by these laws? There are many other computer games with similar themes played by millions of Australians. Even the Classification Review Board, which manage the censorship laws, are concerned about the bill and the lack of an objective test. In particular, the inclusion of indirectly or directly praising a terrorist act in the definition of advocacy lowers the bar on what may be refused classification.
The reality is that there is no need for this bill, and it could make things worse. It could worsen the problem that the government purports to be trying to solve. The few publications that really do promote Islamic or other forms of terrorism in Australia will be driven underground and will circulate in secret. They may even be given greater notoriety through the classification process. The Greens believe the best antidote to dangerous ideas is the light of day and public debate, not suppression. As Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once wrote:
… the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out.
Terrorism must be fought politically. We must show that freedom and democracy are worth their claims.
The crucial point that seems to have been lost in this debate is that the classification laws already ban the incitement of violence and that any expression that is seriously proposing attacks on Australian citizens would already be covered. Sydney journalist David Marr said it best in a Sydney Morning Herald article written not long after the July 2005 London bombings. He wrote:
Banning the expression of these grubby ideas is going to lead us into absurd and embarrassing tangles. While we’re stripping bookshops of repugnant texts that urge the destruction of Israel, perpetual jihad against the US, and tell how to turn yourself into a human bomb, what should we do with—
parts of the Bible that—
... call for homosexuals to be put to death? And what should we do with the new edition of Mein Kampf that sells steadily in Australia?
Staying clear of this mess has traditionally depended on one key issue: the danger of violence. Incitement to violence is an ancient crime, against the law in every corner of Australia. Anyone who incites others to acts of violence is guilty of a criminal offence. That’s also the law in Britain. Even in the US, constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech ends at the point where speech might lead to “imminent lawless action”.
This is the power we’ve always had to combat fanatics trying to whip secular and religious terrorists into action. At the core of the crime—for centuries—has been the provision that the threatened violence must be direct, intended and close to hand. That’s how freedom of speech is protected.
This bill goes well beyond this sensible approach to limiting freedom of expression which has withstood the test of time. It is a great shame that the government has failed to see reason on this matter and that the opposition, who for many years have allowed themselves to be spooked by the government’s mantra on national security, are following the government on this issue and this bill. There are many in this place who like to claim that they support liberal values, yet too often the same people give their support to attacks on the values they claim as their own.
Noam Chomsky said, in his famous study of the media and Western democracies, Manufacturing Consent:
Goebbels was in favor of free speech for views he liked. So was Stalin. If you’re in favor of free speech, then you’re in favor of freedom of speech precisely for views you despise. Otherwise, you’re not in favor of free speech.
For democracy to claim freedom as its mantle, it must be able to tolerate dissenting views in its midst, no matter how hateful or unpopular. If we have confidence in the people, democracy will allow them to reject such ideas. The Greens are confident that the Australian public will not succumb to the ideas of hate and sectarian conflict. We are confident that, given freedom of expression, people will use such a right wisely and for good. This bill is a product of fear. Senators should embrace hope and freedom and show confidence in the Australian public and our democracy rather than embrace the fear that is a part of this bill.",SENATE,"<title>CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) AMENDMENT (TERRORIST MATERIAL) BILL 2007</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2007-09-19,"—I stand tonight to support this government’s legislation and to respond to some of the comments made from the opposition benches. I note that Senator Nettle has referred to the imposition on free speech resulting from this legislation, and in one way she is right. But in another way she is wrong. She is wrong because it is important to secure the safety and security of the Australian people—that is, Australian families and Australian children. This legislation is designed to strike a balance. The government believes, and I believe, that freedom of expression and freedom of speech are maintained in this legislation in an appropriate balance. I will speak to that a little later.
The report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (Terrorist Material) Bill 2007 is a public document and was tabled in July 2007. As chair of that committee, I want to thank the secretariat, Jackie Morris and her team, for their work in preparing the report and for their assistance. I would also like to thank Senator Crossin and the other members of the committee, including the participating member Senator Nettle. I thank her for her involvement and participation. I also wish to place on record my thanks to the witnesses who appeared at our hearing in Sydney on 17 July and to all those who presented evidence to the committee. We appreciate it.
In speaking in support of the bill, I refer to the Attorney-General’s second reading speech in which he summarises the concerns as follows:
This bill will improve the ability of our laws to prevent the circulation of material which advocates the doing of terrorist acts.
…            …            …
Currently there is too much uncertainty around whether the existing classification laws adequately capture such material.
The Attorney-General says that the classification scheme is a cooperative national scheme and that he would prefer to see these provisions in the national code and guidelines. Importantly, the Attorney-General first sought state and territory agreement to changes to the classification laws in July 2006—over 12 months ago. In his second reading speech, he states:
To date, they have been reluctant to respond positively to my proposals. I am not prepared to wait indefinitely to address this problem.
Senator Ludwig spoke to the bill and indicated support for the bill, subject to some amendments. I broadly support the comments made by Senator Ludwig in support of the bill. But there are some aspects of his contribution which I wish to oppose and these relate to the involvement of the state and territory censorship ministers. The Attorney-General has expressed and requested a cooperative approach to this matter, starting over 12 months ago in July 2006. But the Attorney-General is rightly aggrieved and upset with their lack of action on material which advocates terrorism. Surely this has to be a top priority for all Australians no matter what level of government.
Our censorship laws through the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (Terrorist Material) Bill 2007 improves the ability of our laws to prevent the circulation of material which advocates the doing of terrorist acts. But it should be remembered that the classification review system that we have in this country has traditionally been a cooperative one. The Attorney-General, Philip Ruddock, has demonstrated leadership on this matter to ensure proper balance. In a news release issued by the Attorney-General on 27 July 2007 he expressed:
... strong disappointment that agreement could not be reached with State and Territory Censorship Ministers to toughen laws that deal with materials advocating acts of terror.
The release went on:
Mr Ruddock said the failure of the states to recognise the need to do everything possible to stop the recruitment of the impressionable and vulnerable into terrorist activity, left him with no choice but to act independently.
“Prevention is the new terrorism battleground and I am not prepared to wait indefinitely for Labor states to ensure this kind of material is removed from circulation ...
“As I have said before, should an attack happen in Australia I want to be able to look in the eyes of those affected and know I did everything I could to stop terrorism and the recruitment of the impressionable and vulnerable into terrorist activity.”
Those on this side of the chamber fully support the Attorney-General in his efforts to act independently because he could not obtain the agreement and the cooperation of the relevant state and territory censorship ministers. For whatever reason—and I believe it is probably political—they did not come to the table with a cooperative and positive approach. I believe it is to their shame that they did not address this matter. It is in the public interest to protect the impressionable, the vulnerable and those who may be swayed in some way by material that is before them. This legislation, in my view, does the right thing to ensure that material promoting acts of terror will be removed from public availability.
There has been widespread community concern about the availability of books and videos which advocate terrorist acts. The government considers that such material should not be available. It is not completely clear whether this kind of material would be picked up under current classification laws. There is some doubt about that and I think all of us in this chamber accept that. So we need to act. We cannot wait any longer. The proposal is intended to get this inflammatory material advocating terrorism out of circulation to protect the vulnerable and the impressionable in our society. It is not, as Senator Nettle indicated in her contribution, about curtailing freedom of expression. We are not about that; we support freedom of expression. It is an important foundation ingredient of freedom in Australia. Freedom of expression is one of the underlying principles of Australian society. Merely holding and asserting strongly opposing views should not attract censorship. Our laws must strike an appropriate balance between freedom of expression and the need to protect the community and provide safety and security. That balance is needed. I believe the legislation before us has an appropriate balance.
The committee considered the proposed legislation in some detail—and, again, I thank all those senators involved in putting their views forward. Page 5 of the committee report states:
Proposed subsection 9A(3) provides an exemption for some material that might otherwise be considered to advocate the doing of a terrorist act as follows:
A publication, film or computer game does not advocate the doing of a terrorist act if it depicts or describes a terrorist act, but the depiction or description could reasonably be considered to be done merely as part of public discussion or debate or as entertainment or satire.
We had submissions from, for example, the Australian Library and Information Association as well as from a range of other groups—the Writers Guild and those types of groups—and this is important for them. The Attorney-General’s Department, in its response to some of the questions asked at the committee hearing, noted:
The original proposal outlined in the discussion paper has been modified to address concerns expressed about its scope, and in particular a new provision, 9A(3), was introduced to make it clear that material that does no more than contribute to public discussion or debate or is no more than entertainment or satire is not material to which this provision is intended to apply. The explanatory memorandum clearly states that the provision is only intended to capture material which goes further than that and actually advocates the doing of a terrorist act.
I failed to mention this earlier, but the government has listened. A public discussion paper was put out for public consultation. Responses were received and the government and the Attorney-General’s Department have acted on that and inserted this exemption under section 9A(3).
I am sure Senator Ludwig, and perhaps others on the other side, may refer to the reference in subclause (c) of 9A(2), which says:
... it directly praises the doing of a terrorist act in circumstances where there is a risk that such praise might have the effect of leading a person (regardless of his or her age or any mental impairment (within the meaning of section 7.3 of the Criminal Code) that the person might suffer) to engage in a terrorist act.
There will be some discussion about this. I am sure Senator Ludwig and others will be addressing it with an amendment, but it was the view of the committee that there could be some confusion by the inclusion of the words ‘regardless of his or her age or any mental impairment’, and I acknowledge that as the chairman of the committee who has signed off on the report. But the Attorney-General’s Department has provided assurances with respect to the clarity of the legislation. There are more lawyers there than sitting on these benches, and greater minds than me have accepted the fact that that is not required and may, in fact, diminish the effectiveness of the legislation. All in all, the committee believes that the legislation should be passed, and I think it is well worth while.
In making some concluding comments, I want to refer to the concerns that even New South Wales Premier Morris Iemma had about Sheik Mohammed, the leader of the Global Islamic Youth Centre in Liverpool, in Sydney’s west, when he was inciting terrorism. As reported by the Daily Telegraph and AAP on 18 January this year:
Mr Iemma said he had called on the Attorney-General (Philip Ruddock) to do whatever was necessary to have Sheik Feiz Mohammed’s DVD withdrawn from sale.
‘This DVD goes a lot further than vilification,’ Mr Iemma said in Sydney.
‘The sort of incitement that’s taking place, or that the DVD encourages, is incitement to acts of violence and acts of terror.
‘I will take the advice of the Attorney-General but there are specific laws in the Commonwealth jurisdiction on the sale of this material and that’s why we’ll be seeking the cooperation of the federal Attorney-General to take whatever steps are necessary.’
That is exactly what the Hon. Philip Ruddock is doing; he is taking the steps that are necessary to ensure the removal of this type of material. The article continues:
The sheik delivers his hateful rants on a collection of DVDs sold in Australia and overseas.
‘This is just more disgusting commentary from a sheik who has no understanding of the values that we live by in this country,’ Mr Iemma said.
‘I’ve called on the Commonwealth Attorney-General to take whatever necessary steps are available to try and have this DVD withdrawn (from sale).
So there we have it. We have a Labor New South Wales Premier asking the federal Attorney-General to take whatever steps are necessary, and the steps necessary are the legislation that is before us.
Other concerns were expressed to our committee and they are set out in our report. We heard from Mr Jeremy Jones, Director of International and Community Affairs at the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council. You can understand their concerns. They invited the committee to go further by having tougher legislation to thwart that type of material being put into the public domain, and I can understand it when those types of comments are made by whoever and get into the public arena.
I think the balance is right. There has been public discussion. There has been a draft discussion paper. Feedback has been obtained from the public. We have had a Senate committee report. Sadly, the state and territory censorship ministers have been dilatory and have not cooperated, so it is important. I thank the Attorney-General, the Hon. Philip Ruddock, for his leadership.
In closing, this issue is not dissimilar to the philosophy and initiative of this government to protect children and families online with the more recent $180-plus million initiative by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Helen Coonan. It is a fantastic initiative to protect Australian families online with internet filtering initiatives across the board. It is consistent with this government’s policy of protecting, supporting and encouraging families in every way possible. On that front, I thank Senator Coonan, her office and her department for their leadership in that arena, because it is a great initiative that is consistent with this government’s philosophy of protecting, supporting and doing its best to protect the welfare of Australian families.",SENATE,"<title>CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) AMENDMENT (TERRORIST MATERIAL) BILL 2007</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2007-09-19,"—I rise today to contribute to the debate on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (Terrorist Material) Bill 2007. Labor has indicated its support for this bill, which was the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which Senator Barnett referred to and which he chaired and I was a member of. The committee received a number of submissions during its inquiry that raised a number of concerns about this bill, some of which I will mention in the time available to me today. Under this bill, publications, films or computer games that advocate the doing of a terrorist act are to be refused classification. When introducing the bill into the House of Representatives in June, the Attorney-General claimed:
... there is too much uncertainty around whether the existing classification laws adequately capture such material.
The Commonwealth Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 provides the basis for a cooperative national scheme to regulate classification of these materials in Australia. The act establishes the National Classification Code, which is managed and implemented on a cooperative basis by state and territory representatives. The code establishes the categories of classification to be applied to publications and may only be amended with the agreement of participating members.
When the Attorney-General first proposed amending Australia’s classification laws to include a provision banning pro-terrorist related publications he did consult with the participating members—namely, the state and territory ministers responsible for censorship and classification matters. But, as Senator Barnett pointed out, the state and territory ministers were divided on this issue and as a consequence did not agree to amend the code. So what we have before us today is a bill that represents the attempt by the Commonwealth to amend the code unilaterally to implement its desired changes in the absence of agreement between the states, which still has not been secured.
As I said, a number of matters were raised by witnesses to the committee’s hearings on the bill. There were concerns about specific provisions of the bill, in particular the inclusion of definitions from the Criminal Code, the adoption of a low threshold test for determining the impact of terrorist material and the limited exemptions in the bill. There were broader concerns raised at the committee hearings about the growing number of anti-terrorism laws in Australia and whether we are striking the appropriate balance between guarding against terrorism and protecting our civil liberties from encroachment.
The Classification Code currently requires that material be refused classification if it promotes, incites or instructs in matters of crime or violence. A publication which is refused classification is effectively banned. As I said, the Attorney-General has claimed that there is uncertainty surrounding the classification of material that may insidiously encourage people to commit terrorist acts. Section 9 of the principal Classification Act provides that:
... publications, films and computer games are to be classified in accordance with the Code and the classification guidelines.
The relevant amendment inserts the words ‘Subject to section 9A’ before section 9. The proposed section 9A provides that a publication, film or computer game that advocates the doing of a terrorist act must be refused classification. The definition of ‘advocates’ says that:
(a) it directly or indirectly counsels or urges the doing of a terrorist act; or
(b) it directly or indirectly provides instruction on the doing of a terrorist act; or
(c) it directly praises doing a terrorist act in circumstances where—
and these are the important words—
there is a risk that such praise might have the effect of leading a person (regardless of his or her age or any mental impairment) ... to engage in a terrorist act.
In the time I have available I am going to go through some of the concerns that were raised by witnesses at the hearings of the committee, and I begin with the definition of ‘terrorist act’. One of the principal concerns raised at the committee hearings was the inclusion of the existing definition of ‘terrorist act’ from section 100.1(1) of the Criminal Code. The legislative definition of a terrorist act in the Criminal Code includes behaviour that is otherwise considered criminal. The Criminal Code defines a terrorist act as an action which may include causing physical harm, death, damage to property, endangering life or creating a serious risk to the health or safety of the public.
In its evidence to the committee, the Law Council of Australia drew our attention to the criticism that Australia has attracted for adopting this definition. The UN special rapporteur has noted that Australia’s definition is ‘beyond the Security Council’s characterisation’. The Law Council warned against adopting this definition in other legislation, particularly the bill before us, and argued that it is necessary to distinguish terrorist conduct from ordinary criminal conduct and to differentiate between the threat of doing a terrorist act and the actual taking of steps towards it.
The committee noted in its report that the definition of ‘terrorist act’ was the subject of considerable public debate and examination in the parliament and by the committee itself when considering the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 [No 2]. The committee also noted that the definition of ‘terrorist act’ in the Criminal Code is already relevant to classification decisions and that the Classification Board had cited this definition in two previous decisions when it refused classification to the publications Join the Caravan and Defence of the Muslim Lands. On balance, the committee was not persuaded that a narrower definition was necessary for the purposes of this bill.
I move now to the definition of ‘advocates’. As I said, a number of witnesses expressed their concern about the breadth of the term ‘advocating’ and I read out the definition that is contained in the act. The Law Council, for example, said that the threshold test that this effectively put into place:
... appears to require decision-makers to consider the lowest societal common denominator in considering how material will be processed, comprehended and acted upon—an almost impossible test to apply.
The Classification Review Board, in its evidence, said that the definition is such that there is no scope for any discretion to be applied and, in fact, if there is any praise of a terrorist act then the publication must necessarily be refused by the board.
The Convenor of the Classification Review Board said in her evidence that it may well be prudent to amend this bill to require that there be a substantial or a significant risk that praise will lead to a terrorist act being committed. She said that this would give those responsible for classifying material greater discretion as to whether a publication should be refused classification. A number of witnesses argued that to assess risk at the threshold of the consideration of how a minor—that is, someone under the age of 18—or a person with a mental impairment would react to material would have the potential to seriously limit the material that can be made available to the general public.
The Gilbert and Tobin Centre of Public Law described the test as unjustifiable and argued that the test ‘would permit all sorts of material to be banned that no reasonable person would see as offensive or dangerous’. In its report, the Senate committee acknowledged that there was the following risk:
... that such a test could prevent access to material which should be available to adults, particularly those engaged in academic research of terrorism or public debate about this important matter.
The committee did recognise the difficulties that a classification decision maker would have in applying this test and acknowledged that the bill may well have an effect beyond its stated aim. We were mindful of the difficulties that writers, artists and publishers would face in determining whether their work would be caught by the provision. The committee was of the view that classification decision makers should take into account how a young person may react to such material. As a compromise, the committee recommended that the bill be amended to delete the phrase ‘regardless of his or her age or any mental impairment’. I understand that there will be an amendment moved before this chamber to that effect.
Further concern was also raised at the committee inquiry about the breadth and ambiguity of the inclusion of the words ‘indirectly’ and ‘directly’ to describe what constitutes the urging or doing of a terrorist act. For example, the Australian Muslim Civil Rights Advocacy Network argued that the words were ‘unreasonably vague and could potentially cover a wide range of activities’. The Australian Press Council argued that the definition could prevent the free expression of views on political issues. But, when the committee examined it, we determined that the deletion of the word ‘indirectly’ would have the effect of undermining the aim of the bill.
In relation to exemptions from the act, proposed section 9A(3) provides that exempted from the bill are those publications that:
... could reasonably be considered to be done merely as part of public discussion ... or as entertainment or satire.
We did hear evidence from a number of witnesses that the exemption does not go far enough to protect reasonable freedom of expression. For example, the Gilbert and Tobin Centre of Public Law said that it was not broad enough to cover speech such as academic research. The committee, however, concluded that the clause is broad enough to provide adequate protection for freedom of speech.
A broader concern that was raised before the committee was, as I mentioned at the outset, a concern that we now have 40 pieces of anti-terrorism legislation that have been enacted by this parliament in the six years since 2001, producing what now resembles a simmering cauldron of terror laws. Recently I was a panel member at an Amnesty International forum held in Adelaide titled ‘Securing our Freedom’. On that occasion, I said that we must guard against a reactive approach to law making in this area and take care not to sacrifice the freedoms and the rule of law that sustain our democracy in our efforts to protect our national security.
So, as we today add a further ingredient to the simmering cauldron of antiterror laws, we must acknowledge that legislation of this nature has the potential to encroach on the individual freedoms that are the foundation of our democracy. My concern is how we are going to deal with this combination of laws—this simmering cauldron—if and when we ever decide that they are too oppressive and need to be wound back. No doubt this bill, like the 40-plus anti-terror laws this parliament has enacted in the past six years, will require a sturdy Mongolian soup stick to remove it from the simmering cauldron of terror laws.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2007-09-19,"—Over recent weeks we have been made aware through various special events that this year is the 200th anniversary of the first export of a commercial bale of wool from Australia. Tonight I rise to pay tribute to this industry to which we as a nation owe so much. That historic event 200 years ago has had an immense economic effect on our nation. It has led to the establishment of one of our major wealth-producing industries and has encouraged a rural way of life which has helped to mould the Australian character as we know it today.
Some might question why it took 19 years from first European settlement for such an obvious commercial event to occur. We must remember that, in the early days of settlement in New South Wales, times were tough. The colony had little to spare, and food and security were paramount. The challenge of exporting wool to the other side of the world was not the main goal at first, but enterprising people could see the opportunities even in those very early days. In fact, the first wool samples were sent to England in 1804; eight samples of the first wool ever grown in Australia were forwarded for the approval of King George III. They were very well received, with amazement being expressed at the quality and softness of the samples.
Those samples were the result of work by the Reverend Samuel Marsden, a clergyman, who, along with John Macarthur, a soldier, had acquired the first dozen or so Spanish merinos brought from South Africa back in 1797. So it was that in November 1807 the Reverend Samuel Marsden, the owner of the third-largest flock at the time, arrived in England with a cask of Australian wool. In the same year, Macarthur sent more than 400 pounds of his wool to England aboard HMS Buffalo. The wool sold for 45p a pound.
In the following year, 1808, Marsden’s wool was woven into a piece of cloth, from which a black suit was tailored. Marsden proudly wore that suit when he was introduced to King George III. The demand for wool rose quickly, helped by the needs of the Napoleonic Wars and the continental trading blockades occasioned by that conflict.
By 1830, the Australian sheep population was close to two million and was multiplying with speed. It was helped by the inflow of merinos, which greatly improved the quality of the wool in many flocks. Over the 200 years that the wool industry has been so important to our economic wellbeing, the ethos of wool and merinos has ingrained itself into our way of life in so many ways. Through literature, art, language, humour and music, many aspects of the wool industry and its way of life have become part of the cultural and commercial character of Australia. Just look at our most popular song—a tale of adventure over a sheep—and the wonderful woolshed paintings of Tom Roberts and his contemporaries. From the transport infrastructure built to serve the industry, right down to Australia’s love of dogs, which have softened our hearts with their clever ability to work with sheep, so much of our Australian character is closely connected to our heritage as a major wool-producing nation. The wool industry has greatly contributed to our national character and the strength of the notion of mateship. Even city dwellers feel a strong emotional link when they see people working with sheep on the land.
Minister Truss recently said in the other place that wool is still one of our major export commodities, particularly amongst our primary sector, and is making a very substantial contribution to our nation’s export growth. He said:
In commemorating 200 years of Australian exporting, it is interesting to observe that it took 190 years for Australia’s exports to reach $100 billion in a year. It has only taken the 11 years of this coalition government for us to double that number to $210 billion—
a great effort.
While parts of Australia have been suffering from prolonged drought, we have still been able to keep the wool industry in a very viable state. While the number of sheep tends to vary during drought conditions, our enterprising rural Australians show their resilience by always bouncing back as soon as conditions allow.
Our wool industry has flourished over so many years because of the excellent quality of our product, its natural characteristics and the way in which innovation and technology have helped us produce the finest and softest wool, which is demanded by top fashion designers around the world. In our minds we connect the wool industry with outback shearers and the historic and romantic image that has built up over two centuries, but it must not be forgotten that the world’s leading designers and fashion houses have also helped to build our wool’s reputation throughout the world.
Given that my last job before entering the Senate was as the manager of a wool textile mill in Launceston in Northern Tasmania, and also acknowledging that I currently own sheep on a farm, I have a particularly personal relationship with this subject. Like so many Australians, even though I am nominally an urban dweller, I can relate closely to the image of our rural industry, which is such a significant part of our national wellbeing.
As we work our way into the new century, it is heartening to see that our wool industry is still very much a major contributor to our rural economy. To those who work in the industry, whether it be as graziers, shearers, mill workers, fashion designers or retailers, congratulations on your contribution to an industry which is so vital to Australia’s growth. On this 200th anniversary of the first export of commercial wool, we are grateful to those who have done so much to provide the prosperity which we attribute to our ability to ride on the sheep’s back for so long.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Wool Industry</title>,Adjournment,28,1
