"SPEAKER, Mr",N/A,2000-12-04,"—I present the report of the Australian Delegation to the 104th Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference held in Jakarta from 15 to 21 October 2000, and the bilateral visit to Vietnam from 22 to 27 October 2000. I want to make a few brief comments and then allow others in the delegation to provide more detail.
The Australian delegation played a major role at the IPU conference and was instrumental in formulating two of the resolutions adopted by the conference. The IPU is going through a critical period. If it is to remain relevant as a legitimate forum for international parliamentary debates, in my view and that of many others it must undertake a series of reforms to ensure that it operates within its budget and that the conference format makes for more effective use of time and limited resources. The Australian IPU group will do what it can to ensure that this occurs and that the IPU continues to be a respected and effective international institution.
The bilateral visit to Vietnam was particularly successful. The official program included meetings with the prime minister, the foreign minister, the planning minister and the chairman of the national assembly, as well as the chairmen from several other provincial councils and committees. The delegation also met with a number of Australian business people operating in Vietnam. These meetings enabled the delegation to discuss a range of issues, including the strength of the bilateral relationship; the progress of economic reform in Vietnam, in particular opening up the economy and increasing the level of foreign investment; the aftermath of the floods in the central and southern regions; the role played by Australian aid in various developmental projects, including the successfully completed My Thuan bridge; and the role played by both countries in the Asia-Pacific region.
The discussions were frank and informative and left the delegation with a very clear impression that Vietnam is making steady, if measured, progress towards the reform of its economy and access to its markets. Of particular interest to the delegation was the opportunity to see at first-hand the impact of Australian investment and the benefits to the social economy of Australian aid expenditure. Overall, it was a very informative and rewarding visit. The relationship between both countries is strong, and the delegation came away with a very positive impression about future relations between Vietnam and Australia. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 104th Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference, Jakarta and Bilateral Visit to Vietnam</title>",Delegation Reports,1,1,speech
"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,2000-12-04,"—I, too, in following those remarks, would like to comment very briefly on the IPU conference. I take on board, as do the other delegates, the changes that are occurring and will occur, not only to the structure of the IPU but also to its charter. One of the things I would like to mention in the House is that we have already commenced that process through the meeting of women parliamentarians. When we meet at the next IPU conference we will be adopting a different format. One interesting part that is very dear to my heart is that, following the executive council meeting—and it is noted on page 21 of the report—the council took note of a report by Mrs Murti from Indonesia, who chaired the proceedings of the women's meeting, when she called on all national parliaments to ratify the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women. I again appeal to the government to take that on board, bearing in mind that many national parliaments around the world have now taken that step.  
Without covering the IPU in detail, I would like particularly to turn to Vietnam. Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your leadership there. It was a very trying time: we seemed to be perpetually and continually on the move. I found it very interesting to see what has happened with Australia's aid in Vietnam. We do realise and acknowledge that, over a period of four years, until 2002, some $236 million in aid has been pledged to Vietnam. On top of that, there is $11 million per year from Australian funding for regional programs, NGOs and emergency assistance. I can assure the parliament, as I and the other delegates have seen at first-hand, that they are certainly spending the money very wisely and well. I was particularly impressed in Hanoi where we visited a university where a special project is being undertaken by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. Scientists are researching various diseases with bananas, cucumbers, papaya, et cetera, and are working hand in hand with the university people there. I think it is an excellent project. 
The other project I was particularly impressed with—and I know you mentioned the bridge project, Mr Speaker, at My Thuan—was when we went into the rural areas to see the work being done by some of our Australian aid workers. On that early morning flight we visited Tra My, one of the four mountainous districts in Quang Nam province. We were able to witness at first-hand what the RIDEF project is doing there to alleviate rural poverty through investment in small scale, social and economic infrastructure in relatively poor and underequipped rural areas and provinces. I think the parliament can be very proud of how our money is being spent and of how well it is being spent. We are making a difference there. I think all of Vietnam is now acknowledging Australia as very much a major player in assistance to them. In particular, I think through the IPU conference, with our delegates being on the ground there, we were able to assist and help the Indonesian and Australian relationship. I thank all the staff who were there with us.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 104th Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference, Jakarta and Bilateral Visit to Vietnam</title>",Delegation Reports,1,1,speech
"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2000-12-04,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I present the committee's report entitled Cracking down on copycats: enforcement of copyright in Australia, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—This report of the House of Representatives Standing committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is the result of a prolonged study of the enforcement of copyright in Australia. Terms of reference for the inquiry were received from the Attorney-General in March 1999 and the committee commenced its work. In September 1999, when the Copyright Amendment (Digital Agenda) Bill 1999 was introduced into the House, the Attorney-General referred that bill to the committee for inquiry and report. The two inquiries complemented each other in part, because they both reflect a focus that is timely—that is, on copyright enforcement in a manner that is appropriate to the information age.
The current inquiry followed a growing number of claims by some Australian industries that copyright owners and other members of the community are being deprived of income that is rightly theirs, because of infringement of copyright. Perhaps because copyright is an intangible form of property, its infringement or theft is not regarded with the same seriousness in the community as we regard thefts of other kind of property. It is also fair to say that copyright law is not well understood. This may also contribute to the broad lack of concern about infringement. Current attitudes to copyright law need to change. Many of the new jobs underpinning our economy involve the creation, manipulation, storage and use of information. It follows that adequate protection of intellectual property, including copyright, is essential for individual owners and also for our future prosperity. 
In undertaking its inquiry the committee first surveyed the nature and extent of copyright infringement in Australia. It has concluded that, despite a perception in some industries that copyright infringement is rife, in fact it is low by international standards. I note in passing that evidence on whether and to what extent organised crime groups are involved in copyright infringement was conflicting. Most government bodies were not aware of such involvement, while some industry bodies told the committee they knew of some organised criminal groups that were involved. Whatever the frequency or source of infringement, the fact remains that it is a costly and significant burden to the economy. The committee heard evidence from copyright owners and industry groups that infringement is likely to increase in the future, especially in the electronic domain.
Facilitating proof of copyright ownership in both civil and criminal proceedings is the focus of one of the committee's key recommendations. The evidence received by the committee showed that proof of ownership has been a major stumbling block in actions for infringement. In response, the committee has advocated the use of an affidavit that outlines the chain of title, thus giving rise to a rebuttable presumption of ownership. The committee preferred this simplification over the reintroduction of a system of registration for copyright.
The committee has sought to strengthen criminal sanctions for infringement by advocating sentencing guidelines for copyright offences in the form of guideline judgments and by amendments to tighten the offence provisions in the Copyright Act. One recommendation aimed at deterring repeat offenders is for the provision of increased penalties for people who are convicted of subsequent offences. The committee also recommended new offences to target end-user piracy and bootlegging at public venues.
The committee was concerned to increase access by copyright owners to civil enforcement action as well as to enhance the effectiveness of such action. The main recommendation in this regard is for the establishment of a small claims jurisdiction within the Federal Magistrates Court to hear claims of infringement. The committee has also recommended a limited power of seizure to assist in the pre-trial process as well as calling for consideration of a system of statutory damages as an alternative to the requirement to prove actual damage. The committee considered it appropriate to lift the veil when enforcing copyright judgments against corporate infringers so that owners may recover damages from the directors of companies that are found to be engaged in piracy or bootlegging. Last, the committee examined the role played by government agencies and recommended some changes in this regard. 
In conclusion, I hope that through this report, Cracking down on copycats, we can contribute to more effective enforcement of copyright throughout Australia and better education of all those involved. I thank all those individuals involved in the report, those who made submissions and the members of the committee for working in a constructive way to arrive at these recommendations. I thank the secretariat staff—in particular Andrew Grimm; the secretary, Catherine Cornish; and the administrative officer, Frances Wilson—for the work undertaken in support of the committee during this inquiry. I commend the report to the House.

"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,2000-12-04,"— Thank you, Mr Speaker. This report of the House Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled Cracking down on copycats is a very important report. Firstly, I want to echo the words of the chair of that committee in congratulating those involved in the secretariat and on the committee. This was a very cooperative committee. The chair and deputy chair worked very well together to ensure that the procedures of the committee were streamlined. They worked very effectively. We had a wide opportunity to debate this internally. I think this is a vital report. 
Over a long period of time, this parliament's attention has been focused on the substantive copyright law—making certain that we have legislation in place that correctly identifies legal rights and enables the remuneration of those who are rights holders. But giving people rights in law is only part of the responsibility of this legislature; the other part is making certain that those rights can be effectively enforced. There has been great weakness in terms of the capacity to translate a theoretical right into a practical right. This committee's starting point was that there needs to be some significant public education in relation to the importance of these copyright issues to make certain that the community understands the rights and responsibilities in relation to holders of copyright and how those rights can be enforced. 
A number of recommendations go to the ease of proving matters—removing the procedural and technical difficulties that have hitherto made it difficult for copyright holders to establish their entitlements. There are some self-help measures included in this which particularly go to those who run stalls or flog goods outside concerts or the like which would enable copyright holders to seize those goods, but it would also give anyone who contests that right an opportunity at a later stage to have their case heard.
There are some practical measures in establishing a small claims tribunal, and this government has introduced a magistracy to the Federal Court. Hitherto, its focus has been in relation to streamlining the effectiveness of the Family Court. But, if we are going to establish a magistracy, there is no reason we cannot include within its jurisdiction a small claims jurisdiction of the kinds which operate in the various states and territories—and we suggested as models along the lines of the Tasmanian or ACT models—which would allow for small copyright matters to be heard in that very informal way.

"Wilkie, Kim, MP",ALP,2000-12-04,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	congratulates Iran regarding the completion of acknowledged democratic elections and the work of the new Majlis;
(2)	nevertheless regrets that Iran's reputation continues to be marred by questions of human rights and denial of religious freedom, most particularly the persecution of Baha'is and the renewal of the death sentences of Mr Hedayat Kashefi Najafabadi and Mr Sirus Zabihi-Moghaddam, and the inception of another against Mr Manuchehr Khulusi;
(3)	furthermore notes the persistent gaoling of numerous Baha'is for their religious beliefs and widespread discrimination in property, education, employment, civil and political rights;
(4)	acknowledges grave concern for the fate of 13 members of the Jewish community presently in custody in Iranian prisons and facing charges of espionage; and
(5)	urges Australia's continued vigilance and activity regarding human rights issues in Iran.
This parliament has debated the situation of the Baha'is and religious freedom in Iran on a number of occasions, most recently in motions put before the parliament by the member for Reid and also by the member for North Sydney. The motions have been debated at length by some distinguished members of this House, including the member for Aston, the member for Hindmarsh and the member for Franklin. I welcome their involvement in those discussions. The general situation of the Baha'is in Iran is quite appalling. To give some credence to that, I would like to advise the House of a number of areas where they are unable to practise their faith and the resulting distress that it causes the community.
It is a matter of deep regret that Iran's conduct in this area continues to justify the concern of this parliament and, indeed, of the international community as a whole. The Baha'i community in Iran numbers around 300,000. It is the largest non-Muslim religious minority in that country, yet it continues to face systematic persecution by the Iranian authorities. Currently 10 Baha'is are imprisoned and one is under house arrest in Iran because of their religious beliefs. A number of these are under the death sentence. Baha'is have been systematically excluded from employment and higher education in Iran. An entire generation of Baha'i youth has been prevented from entering Iran's tertiary institutions. The Iranian government has sought to prevent Baha'is from undertaking their own education of Baha'i youth by arresting and intimidating teachers who voluntarily undertook to provide education the government has sought to deny them. These efforts have been unsuccessful and the Baha'is continue to run a correspondence based Baha'i Institute for Higher Education.
The most holy places of the Baha'i faith, Baha'i community properties and Baha'i cemeteries have been desecrated, destroyed or confiscated. No attempt has been made to restore or compensate the Baha'i community, as called for by the international community. Baha'is continue to be denied the right to bury their deceased relatives with dignity, being forced to use unmarked graves in areas of waste land. The `spiritual assemblies' of the Baha'is, elected lay councils of nine men and women which fulfil some of the roles of clergy in other religions, are sacred to the Baha'is and membership of these has been banned by the Iranian government. This is a significant restriction on the freedom of Baha'is to practice their religion in accordance with the tenets of their faith. It is also a denial of the freedom of assembly and association that every individual possesses. The freedom of association of Baha'is is regularly impeded by government interference in devotional and educational meetings of the community. Mr Maurice Copithorne, the UN Special Representative on the Human Rights Situation in Iran, in his latest report, notes continuing acts of intimidation carried out in order to prevent Baha'is from participating in religious or educational activities and an apparent increase in the number of short-term arrests and suspended sentences to be applied only if the accused participate again in Baha'i gatherings. 
Baha'is encounter difficulties in obtaining passports, impeding their freedom of movement. One improvement that should be noted is that, although Iran does not recognise the right of Baha'is to marry in accordance with their own religious traditions, by removing questions on religion at the time of registration of marriage, Iran has now put in place measures to allow administrative acknowledgment of the marital status of a Baha'i couple. This removes a longstanding civil discrimination affecting the legality of family life of Baha'is and their inheritance rights and is to be welcomed. The treatment of the Baha'is in Iran is undoubtedly a key issue in terms of both religious freedom and human rights for that country.
In Australia, 12,000 Baha'is live in full religious freedom. They, like other Australians, are not subject to intrusive inquiry into their beliefs, nor to penalties because of their faith. They are a diverse religious community of a wide variety of backgrounds who seek to give expression to their religious convictions by worship and by service to society. Their beliefs include principles such as oneness of God, the oneness of humanity, the equality of men and women and the independent investigation of religious truth. They are known for their commitment to the promotion of peace. In 1986, the Australian Baha'i community received a peace award from the UN Secretary-General for its work in the promotion of peace during the International Year of Peace. In my electorate the members of the Baha'i community share my deep concern for their fellow believers in Iran. Many Australian Baha'is have relatives in Iran, including some among those imprisoned in Iran for their beliefs. They live in constant anxiety as to the fate of their relatives.
Recently there were parliamentary elections in Iran. The motion that is currently before the House also addresses those elections. The elections demonstrated the strong commitment of the Iranian people to parliamentary democracy and their aspiration for civil and political freedoms. Iran is to be congratulated for that achievement. It is to be hoped that Iran's parliament will be given the freedom to carry out its responsibilities as the representative of the people of Iran.
In relation to the death sentences and penalties that have been imposed by the courts, this motion also refers to the cases of Mr Hedayat Kashefi Najafabadi, Mr Sirus Zabihi-Moghaddam and Mr Manuchehr Khulusi, who have been sentenced to death because of their involvement in organising religious classes for Baha'i youth. I have been informed by representatives of the Australian Baha'i community that, in the cases of Mr Najafabadi and Mr Moghaddam, these sentences were recently set aside as unsound by the Iranian Supreme Court and that their cases were referred back to a lower court. This is the third time that even the Iranian Supreme Court has felt the injustice of these cases and quashed lower court decisions imposing death sentences on these men.
It is time that these men were released. They were first sentenced to death in February 1998, along with another Baha'i, Mr Ruhullah Rawhani, who was in fact executed by the regime for his beliefs. In March 1998, the Supreme Court rejected the verdicts, finding no evidence against them and that their religious beliefs did not provide justification for a death sentence. The case was referred back to a lower court. In September 1998, a lower Islamic Revolutionary Court again sentenced them to death, despite the findings of the Supreme Court. The men were tried again—this time with a lawyer of their choice, which had been denied to them previously. In January 1999, the Supreme Court again overturned the verdict for the second time because of what were referred to as `technical deficiencies'. In November 1999, the men were again sentenced to death by the same lower court, leading to the latest Supreme Court decision quashing the sentence. Only one action should be taken in this case and that is the immediate release of these men. 
Mr Manuchehr Khulusi was also sentenced to death in Mashhad but later released. No action appears to have been taken to revoke the death sentence which continues to hang over his head. There are other Baha'i prisoners facing similar fates. I would like to read an extract from the Iranian court decision in regard to Mr Dhabihullah Mahrami, recognised by Amnesty International as a prisoner of conscience, to make clear what his case is about and why he is imprisoned for life in Iran. It states:
Concerning the charges against Mr Dhabihullah Mahrami ... ie denouncing the blessed religion of Islam and accepting the beliefs of the wayward Baha'i sect (national apostasy), in light of his clear confessions to the fact that he accepted the wayward Baha'i sect at the age of maturity, later accepted Islam for a period of seven years, and then returned to the aforementioned sect and because of the fact that, despite the most tremendous efforts of this court to guide him and encourage him to repent for having committed the most grievous sin, he remains firm in his baseless beliefs, he has, on three consecutive meetings, while being of sound body and mind and in absolute control, announced his allegiance to the principles of Baha'ism ... and he is not willing to repent for having committed this sin ... the accused is sentenced to death because of being an apostate. Furthermore ... in light of the fact that he does not have any Muslim heirs, a verdict is issued for the confiscation of all his properties and assets.
There have also been the trials of Jewish prisoners who have received similar fates for very similar reasons. Obviously none of these imprisonments are justified, and action needs to be taken to ensure that these people are released as quickly as possible. I urge Australia's continued vigilance and activity regarding human rights issues in Iran. The Australian government must continue to take every opportunity in both multilateral forums and its bilateral relationships to promote the universality and indivisibility of all human rights, specifically the right to freedom of religion and belief. I thank the Baha'is community for their assistance in preparing today's presentation.

"Thomson, Andrew, MP",LP,2000-12-04,"—I think this is a very interesting motion because it deals with issues that are pertinent to Australia's national interest. The position of Iran in the politics of the Middle East is significant and changes to the standards of human rights covenants within that country will have an effect on countries around Iran. Some of the things that we ought to take note of include some improvement in human rights standards in Iran, as acknowledged in the first part of the motion. Later clauses deal with some of the more unfortunate things that are still going on. Of particular interest to me is the treatment of 13 members of the Jewish community who were charged with various offences, 10 of whom are currently in prison, facing charges of espionage and so forth.
What underlies some of the changes in Iran are some changes in its demographic trends. In 1996, Iran held a census and found that 40 per cent of the population was aged under 14 years. So now, with a few years passing, these citizens, who are approaching their twenties, perhaps represent Iran's best hope for the creation of a modern democracy in the country. It is important to emphasise, too, that, although the reforms are only in their embryonic stage and they still have much to achieve, there has been some noteworthy groundwork set down by President Khatami, who is described as a moderate and who was elected to office in 1997 with a groundswell of support from the voting public. He has made some progress in trying to remake what was an intensely theocratic state and to turn it into a much less restrictive one. This is why, with the support of a young population he is achieving some success. 
There has been some degree of cultural liberalisation. The government in Iran now recognises marriages between members of the Baha'i community, and it is proposed that university places will soon be open to members of this minority group. Although that is a positive step forward, it is astonishing how intensely discriminated against this community has been in Iran. You cannot erase that over the course of just a few months. I do not know quite why the government of Iran has such an intense hatred of this minority group. They seem a very peaceful folk to me, but it has been the case. Although there has been some liberalisation in the treatment of these people, it behoves us, the Australian government—as the motion and its mover, the member for Swan, say—to continue to scrutinise very carefully what is going on there and to speak up when the need arises.
President Khatami has also indicated his commitment to human rights in a more general sense and to creating a more open dialogue between nations. This is a very welcome movement in Iran because, compared with some of its neighbours—for instance, Afghanistan, where the ultraorthodox Islamic militia, the Taliban, hold government—Iran's human rights record is marginally more favourable. Next door in Iraq there are significant problems with Saddam Hussein still holding office, but, in the long term, Iran could have a democratising effect on some of its neighbours. Australia would welcome the opportunity to improve relations with countries in the Middle East generally, were this process to take place.
However, in spite of some of these reforms, there is obviously still within Iran an ongoing tension between reformists and very hardline elements—those who are stalwart defenders of the revolution that still maintains a stranglehold on some of Iran's institutions. It remains very much under the control of its clerics, who maintain control over the armed forces, the broadcasting authorities, the judiciary and so forth. So there is a conflict between these two groups: the clerics on one side and the parliament, or Majlis, on the other. This conflict is having an impact on the efforts of the president and the new parliament to effect democratisation that the majority of Iranians appear to support.
We have to encourage reform, but, at the same time, we must not be blind to the existing and continuing abuses. The most immediate human rights concern is the fate of what is called the `Shiraz 10'. These are Iranian Jews charged with espionage, and they are conspicuous victims of this bitter struggle between the reformist and the hardliners within Iran. Australia has acknowledged its concern for the safety of these people, who were arrested and imprisoned in the city of Shiraz, and we continue to argue for their release. The Iranian government's actions in targeting, arresting, incarcerating and, thereafter, trying and sentencing these Jews represent a significant blow to their internal reform processes, and to do something about it would serve Iran's reputation very well.
More alarming I suppose is the fact that the trials of these innocent people reveal an absence of democratic rights and due process for minority religious groups in Iran. Since their incarceration, Australia has made 27 separate representations to the Iranian government expressing concern about the fate of these people. In July this year 10 of the 13 people charged in Shiraz were found guilty and given sentences of between four and 13 years. These people included community leaders, religious teachers and a rabbi, and initial concern for the welfare of those convicted extends both to their immediate physical safety and to that of their families. Subsequent appeals have resulted in sentence reductions of two to six years for some people—indeed, for six out of the 10. While I suppose this is something of a demonstration of good faith, it is more appropriate that those convictions be overturned.
In a larger sense, this issue throws light on Iran's treatment of Jewish people in prison. It highlights the general issue of human rights standards and the problem of how we go about encouraging countries to meet those standards. Originally, the most basic principle of the law of nations—or international law, as it is called these days—was that one nation would not interfere in the internal affairs of another. This enabled sovereign nations to navigate their way through trying to resolve world problems that cropped up from time to time without too much conflict. We dealt with each other nation to nation and did not interfere constantly in what was happening in a neighbour's territory.  
However, particularly postwar, some of the conventions and agreements that established universal standards of human rights have sought to vary this basic notion—by declaring that such-and-such a manner of treating somebody shall be a violation of a basic human right, for example. That gives rise to the presumption that it is all right to interfere to some degree, or threaten to interfere, in the internal affairs of another country. The trouble is that, by setting these standards and then cloaking them in the costume of law without providing for an enforcement mechanism, we create endless frustration. On one side, we have these standards that must be met; and, on the other side, we have no real way of making sure that they are met—as we would be able to do in a domestic situation.
In the end, peer nations—such as is happening at the moment in this parliament—put pressure on another government to deal with its people, albeit religious minorities, in a more gentle and civil way. That is the only practical way of improving human rights, and it can be a good approach if we persist. However, we do not need so-called leadership from Euro politicians, appointed with grand titles, from the UN system telling us what we should or should not protest about. These are the sorts of things that sovereign nations and the elected members of parliaments in those nations can decide very well for themselves. That is exactly what we are doing in the case of those people who are suffering oppression within Iran.

"Hoare, Kelly, MP",ALP,2000-12-04,"—In seconding this motion, I congratulate my colleague the member for Swan on keeping the plight of the Baha'is in Iran in the public arena. I will give members a short history of the Baha'i faith. The Baha'i faith was founded in Iran in the mid-1880s and Baha'is have been persecuted there ever since. By religious standards, the faith is relatively new. The Baha'i understand that this type of persecution stems from the fact that their faith is new and that the traditionalist, or older faiths, misunderstand or fear a new religion. 
However, this understanding does not provide acceptance of the fact that, during the 19th century, 20,000 people died as a result of violence perpetrated on Baha'i followers by the Islamic religious authorities. That persecution and violence continued into the 20th century, with regular violence being experienced by the Baha'is in Iran. Different regimes over the years have even formalised policies of oppression against the Baha'is as concessions to the clergy and to garner support from the nation's Islamic leadership. During these years Baha'i literature was banned, Baha'i marriages were not recognised, Baha'is in the public service were demoted or sacked and Baha'i schools were even closed.
Another massive round of violence—murders, rapes and robberies—occurred following the decision of the Pahlavi regime in 1955 to allow Islamic clerics to broadcast on national radio denouncing the Baha'i faith, thus inciting further violence. The irony of the suffering of the Baha'i followers in Iran is that a major tenet of their faith is that loyalty to government is an essential spiritual and social principle. Even today, as Baha'i followers continue to face persecution in Iran, the faith pronounces loyalty to governments.
This motion also urges Australia's continued vigilance and activity regarding human rights issues in Iran. In this regard, particular importance is placed on the biannual resolution of the human rights situation in Iran at the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. This resolution expresses international concern about a range of serious human rights violations occurring in Iran and provides recommendations to Iran to remedy these violations. The resolution has been of critical importance in discouraging even greater violations of the rights of the Baha'is by extremist elements in Iran. However, rather than addressing the United Nations recommendations for protecting the rights of Iranian citizens, the Iranian government has devoted its energies to defeating the resolution. 
Successive Australian governments have consistently supported the resolution and Australia has been a co-sponsor of the resolutions since their inception in 1980. Given the wide range of human rights abuses in Iran detailed in numerous United Nations reports, there is no justification for any change in Australia's policy. Therefore, I am happy to congratulate the government on its decision to co-sponsor this year's resolution that is now before the United Nations General Assembly. I call on the government to continue this bipartisan tradition of defending the human rights and religious freedom of the Baha'is and other religious minorities in Iran—particularly in light of the report on this important topic that was presented just last week by this parliament's human rights subcommittee. It recommended that:
... the Australian Government continue to take every opportunity, in both multilateral forums and in its bilateral relationships, to promote the universality and indivisability of all human rights, specifically the right to freedom of religion and belief. 
Co-sponsorship of the UN resolution on the human rights situation in Iran presents such an opportunity. Moreover, in light of this recommendation, I call on the Australian government to give priority to working with like-minded nations to ensure greater international support for the resolution of the human rights situation in Iran. Two decades is enough time for Iran to remedy this human rights issue, which justifiably continues to concern this parliament and the international community. I acknowledge my good friend Tom Jones, Secretary of the Newcastle Baha'is, for his continued support and friendship and for his ongoing local advocacy of world peace and international harmony.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Human Rights: Iran</title>,Private Members' Business,3,1,speech
"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2000-12-04,"—In responding to this motion from the member for Swan, I would like to first talk about the political situation in Iran, the encouraging things that we can say about Iran, and then focus on the treatment of the Baha'i community and the Jewish community in Iran. At the February 2000 elections for the Iranian parliament, President Khatami received the support of the Iranian people. The encouraging things about this occurrence are that President Khatami has a reformist program and he has emphasised the promotion of the rule of law, upholding the Iranian constitution.
Iran's human rights record does compare favourably to those of some of its neighbours. As for improvements that we have seen, there has been greater government transparency; there has been increased women's access to education and to politics; and legislation covering reform of the marriage laws has been introduced into the parliament. A judicial reform has been canvassed but has not gone any further than that. Despite those things, which are on the good side of the ledger, we should be concerned about how minority groups, especially Jews and Baha'is, are being treated in Iran. I am pleased that the Australian government has sought assurances that minorities are protected by the constitution.
The Baha'i community of South Australia has its headquarters in my electorate. I was pleased recently to attend an evening its members organised, which celebrated the year 2000 as the International Year of Peace. I am also pleased that the foreign affairs minister, Alexander Downer, raised human rights issues, including the discrimination against the Baha'i community in Iran, during his July 2000 visit to Teheran. Australia has also co-sponsored the resolutions relating to human rights in Iran, both at the United Nations General Assembly just recently and also at the Commission of Human Rights. Australia has made representations on individual cases and for the Baha'i community as a whole in Canberra and Teheran. So we are continuing to make representations about this important minority, whose members have been persecuted in Iran. 
In regard to the Jewish community, Australia has made 27 separate representations to the Iranian government in concern over the arrest and trial of 13 Iranian Jews and nine Muslims. I think, since this motion was put in, three members of the Jewish community have been acquitted, so it is now actually 10 members of the Jewish community. Thirteen of these representations to Iran have been made at a ministerial level. Australia has expressed concerns at the trial outcome for these 13 Iranian Jews and also at deficiencies in the trial process—and it will continue to make those representations.
In summary, some improvements are being made in Iran. We need to continue through motions like this, which are helpful, to co-sponsor the human rights motions in the United Nations General Assembly and also the Commission of Human Rights. We should also be prepared to take up individual cases, as we have done and which have been taken up at a ministerial level.

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2000-12-04,"—I draw to the attention of this parliament a serious issue relating to a constituent of Greenway, Mr Keith Harrison. He served in the Australian Navy on the HMAS Hawkesbury during the atomic tests at Monte Bello. Keith is now suffering from leukemia but is unable to get any preferential medical treatment or a service pension, as he is not considered a `veteran' under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The HMAS Hawkesbury was the only naval ship to remain in the atomic testing area for the duration of the testing period, except for a short trip back to Fremantle. When the Hawkesbury did dock in Fremantle during the testing period, there was considerable public concern about radiation contamination.
Although Keith served a total of six years in the Navy, he is one of only three crewmen of the Hawkesbury who did not serve in an operational area during `specified dates'. Therefore, he is classified as an `ex-serviceman' and not a `veteran'. It is my view that a strong moral case exists for Keith to be considered a victim of the atomic tests at Monte Bello. I will be asking the various government departments to acknowledge this fact and grant Keith the necessary means to obtain medical treatment for any illness contracted during his service in the Australian Navy.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,"<title>Greenway Electorate: Harrison, Mr K.</title>",Statements by Members,4,1,speech

That this House:
(1)	expresses its dismay at the ongoing violence and incitement to violence in the Middle East and calls on both sides to immediately stop all violent acts and for the restoration of calm to the region;
(2)	takes note of the far-reaching and courageous proposals made by Israel's Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, at Camp David and its disappointment that this historic opportunity was not successfully seized by all parties to the peace process;
(3)	calls on all partners to resume negotiations without the threat of violence and without the premature announcement of unilateral declarations;
(4)	expresses its grief for the innocent lives lost on both sides and condemns the unacceptable inclusion of children in violent activities on the front line and expresses the hope that violence will be stopped in accordance with the Sharm el-Sheik agreement;
(5)	hopes that the conflict will be resolved in the framework of agreement and compromise;
(6)	calls on the leadership of the Israeli and Palestinian people to restore trust and confidence in order to pave the way for the resumption of peace negotiations;
(7)	calls on all countries surrounding the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian territories to ensure their sovereign territory not be used to promote aggression into an already turbulent area; and
(8)	believes that peaceful coexistence is the only option for both Israelis and Palestinians now and into the future. 
The ongoing conflict and incitement of violence and retaliation we are witnessing in Gaza and the West Bank and Israel is a devastating setback in the long road to peace in the Middle East. It is devastating on two levels. The first is the senseless violence and loss of life which has resulted from the vicious circle of incitement and retaliation and the failure of the Palestinian leadership to take all steps to pacify their supporters. The second is the enormous damage done to prospects of achieving a lasting peace. I sincerely hope that every member of this House can agree that the first priority is for the violence and bloodshed to stop and for negotiations to resume. It is the only way to salvage any prospect of a lasting peace in the Middle East.
Present developments in Israel and the West Bank and Gaza over recent weeks resemble a tragic paradox. At the Camp David summit, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak offered the most generous, far reaching and indeed unprecedented concessions to Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian National Authority. The proposal has, however, elicited the most violent and militant reaction from Palestinians since the beginning of the peace process. It is fundamentally disappointing that such a historic and progressive opportunity was not successfully seized upon by all parties involved. Since that time, the `peace partnership' that has been evident in recent years has broken down to the extent that the incitement and retaliation of teenage stone-throwers and armed militia now represent the progress of the Middle East peace process. The result has been the loss of innocent lives on the front line, the death of children and the ever diverging possibility of future agreement. Such tragic consequences following the rejection of the Barak offer are all the more distressing considering that the generous terms set out in the proposal came exceedingly close to meeting stated Palestinian demands. Indeed, on the strength of this a resolution seemed imminent.
The significance of Ehud Barak's steps should not be underestimated. The position presently taken by Israel has proved to be the most accommodating to date, to the extent that no such concessions would have seemed conceivable to previous Israeli prime ministers. The proposal included offering the establishment of a Palestinian state in all of Gaza and almost all of the West Bank, Palestinian sovereignty in the great majority of Arab areas in East Jerusalem and an arrangement of joint control over the remaining land. A further offer included vacant land within Israel's 1948 borders as compensation for the continued Israeli control of heavily Jewish portions of the West Bank.
That the proposal has resulted in both violence and the breakdown of agreement and compromise helps no-one. Despite declining the Israeli proposal, it seems the Palestinian leadership provided no substitute proposal nor even an indication of what would presently be acceptable to the Palestinians. Quite apart from the tragically needless waste of life and resources on both sides, the recent combined efforts of both parties have cast a grave shadow over the peace process, damaging the prospects of a lasting peace. It is essential that the leadership of the Israeli and Palestinian people take swift action to restore trust and confidence in the peace process. Once re-established, such trust will pave the way for the resumption of peace negotiations in a framework of agreement and compromise. Encouragingly, and despite provocation, Israel has been forthcoming in offering a series of confidence building measures if the campaign of sniping, bombing and violence is called off. These measures include the reopening of crossings, a pulling back of forces and the reopening of the Gaza airport. It is by the extension of such goodwill that a framework for peaceful coexistence can develop. It is clear that such coexistence is the only acceptable outcome of any Palestinian-Israeli agreement, now and in the future.
Importantly, Israel's likely election in the coming months does not change the fundamental need for an end to violence. Indeed, it highlights the urgency for renewed negotiations and a development of confidence in the Israeli state. It is apparent that the Israeli electoral culture and Ehud Barak's internal political difficulties have not inhibited his enthusiasm and commitment in pursuing the peace process. It is also clear from prominent Jewish sources inside and outside Israel that he would most likely have received the backing of both parliament and the electorate had Yasser Arafat agreed to the Israeli concessions at Camp David last July. Both Palestinians and Israelis, in their quest for rights and sovereignty, have a fundamental interest in making peace and immediately avoiding intense and widespread conflict. This is particularly so considering that in this particular period, unlike any other in the modern history of the Middle East, the influence of external world powers upon the outcome is at its lowest. For the first time since Napoleon Bonaparte's conquest of Palestine, Palestinians and Israelis have the opportunity to settle their own affairs and build upon the confidence and security which such an outcome would bring. The only way to overcome the devastating setback to the peace process, to put an end to incitement, violence, the senseless loss of life and the killing of children is for both aggressors to re-enter the Middle East peace process. This must be done with a spirit of cooperation and conciliation, in recognition that peaceful coexistence is the only option available for both Israelis and Palestinians.  
Can I also thank members of both sides of the House for the bipartisan way in which they have approached the serious questions facing the Middle East peace process in the last few months. On a number of occasions the Jewish community here in Australia have brought speakers, academics and others to Parliament House to meet with members of both the coalition and the opposition, and the Australia-Israel Parliamentary Friendship Group, chaired by me and with the member for Melbourne Ports as secretary, have worked tirelessly to try to include as many coalition and opposition members as possible in our meetings to spread the opportunity for information to each of the members of the parliament. 
One of the most obvious aspects of the current situation is that the media have not reported the goings-on in the Middle East in such a way as to provide us with the facts surrounding much of the situation facing the Middle East. There are countless examples. I think of one particularly: the photograph published in, I think, the Melbourne Herald Sun of a so-called Palestinian boy, bloodied and beaten, being stood over by an Israeli soldier. As it turned out, in fact the photograph was of a Jewish boy in Jerusalem who had been beaten up by a mob of angry Palestinians, and the Israeli soldier had come to the boy's rescue. But it highlights the role the media plays in the information that is sent out to the public. In that case the photograph, I think, was on page 1 or page 3 of the Herald Sun, but the retraction was, as usual, a small piece somewhere back in the newspaper.
I also draw attention to the Australian'scoverage of the Middle East process. The way they have reported it on occasions almost suggests that actions taken by the Israeli state were designed to inflame passions amongst Palestinians. I think it has been obvious from the efforts being made by Ehud Barak and his government that the last thing they would want to do is inflame passions amongst the Palestinian leadership, and that is why they made the concessions that they did at the Camp David summit which resulted in a failure on the part of both to agree, and they then attended the Sharm el-Sheik discussions to try to bring an end to the violence. One thing is for certain: I think all members of the House wish to see a speedy conclusion to the problems facing the Middle East and the settling down and the stability that will lead to a peaceful, happy coexistence between both Israelis and Palestinians in that part of the world.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Middle East: Israeli-Palestinian Conflict</title>,Private Members' Business,10,1,speech
"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2000-12-04,"—I second the motion. How far we seem from those days when Mr Rabin, the late Prime Minister of Israel, shook hands with his long-time adversary, Mr Yasser Arafat, the President of the Palestinian National Authority in the rose garden at the White House, Washington. The last few weeks are tragic for all those around the world who follow events in that part of the world where our civilisations began. The current situation is that we have, apparently, the two sides as intractably apart as ever before. At the end of the Cold War we saw an apparent solution to the problems in South Africa and Ireland, and lots of people around the world were very pleased to observe that the Middle East seemed to be part of this process where Cold War tensions no longer heightened the conflicts in those parts of the world where conflict was very high. 
The recent historical background to the last few weeks is, I think, worth examining. The current Israeli government is a Labour government led by Mr Ehud Barak. Mr Barak in his election program proposed and promised a number of radical measures for achieving peace. One of them was the unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon that was completed about halfway through this year. That withdrawal was designed to solve the problem of the people in south Lebanon and northern Israel being involved in constant conflict. That was achieved—not with the greatest of grace, but it did happen. One of Mr Barak's chess pieces was moved in the direction of peace. 
The second offer came with negotiations that American President Clinton had with the then and now the late President of Syria, Hafez al-Assad. Those negotiations arose following the election of the Barak government and were designed to see a withdrawal of the Israelis from the entire Golan Heights. I might say that many Australian parliamentarians who visited that area over the decades since it was the scene of conflict in the 1973 war and the 1967 war remarked on the generosity—some people would say the wisdom—of Mr Barak in making that offer. It was an offer which anyone who has stood in the very small spaces we are talking about and looked down into the valley of Galilee below understands is a big risk for peace. That was the second chess peace that was offered but was unfortunately not pursued by Mr Assad. 
The next and most important part of this saga was referred to by the member for Sturt. That was the offer in those long days of negotiation between Mr Arafat and Prime Minister Barak at the American President's retreat at Camp David. The extent of that offer, to people who follow in detail the Middle East, was very surprising. As the member for Sturt said, it involved an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel, 95 per cent of the territories, all of Arab East Jerusalem, shared sovereignty over the holy sites in Jerusalem, and an exchange of territory for the remaining five, six or seven per cent between Israel proper and those heavily populated areas of the West Bank that were contiguous with Israel but were heavily populated by Israeli Jews.
I note, by the way, that the Israeli Arabs, who are proposed to be part of this exchange of territory, are not very happy with this idea. Despite their support for the Palestinian Arabs and their concerns about the violence in the territories and the deaths in the recent conflict, they are not enamoured of the idea of being part of any population or land transfer.
Mr Arafat, for reasons that are best understood by him, did not accept this most comprehensive offer ever made. If this House, as a responsible House, is seeking to add to the responsible discussion of this troubled part of the world in seeking political solutions, it ought to focus on the kinds of political solutions that it might help bring about. The American President, who presided over these discussions, Mr Clinton, was very disappointed. The Chairman of the Palestinian Authority, Mr Arafat, proceeded on an international visit where, to his surprise, the leaders of both France and Russia—traditionally supporters of the Palestinians—informed him that the Palestinians should accept the deal and that they would not support a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state, the alternative for which Mr Arafat was hoping to get their support.
Very interestingly for me, the Labor Party national conference took place around this time, and those participating in the Labor Party conference—who have previously held different points of view on the Middle East—took a unanimous view and did not support unilateral declarations. We supported negotiation through peaceful discussions between the parties. Since those attempts at getting international support for a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state, there has been an awful mess—the death of many innocent people on both sides in past months. Like any human, when I saw the picture of the boy who was shot at the Netzarim crossroads, my emotions were stirred. The shooting was a tragedy. That children are being involved in this kind of conflict is something all of us regret. I later saw an aerial photograph of crossfire taking place between a Palestinian police station and an Israeli strong point. This fact is neither here nor there: the tragedy of the boy is not relieved by the circumstances in which he died. 
As responsible friends of both peoples in the area—and Australia has a very honourable record in helping to achieve a just and peaceful solution to the conflict over there—we ought to be focusing on the political solutions to this conflict. Any examination of the peace plan as advanced by Camp David ought to lead this House to supporting it, as the motion moved by the member for Sturt outlines. It is regrettable that, in the last few days, the Palestinian Legislative Council has voted for a continuation of the intifada, or the uprising or violence in the territories. A slightly encouraging aspect is that it has also voted for the continuation of negotiations. I do not think both can occur at the same time. I hope Mr Barak's gamble on calling early elections will be supported by the Israeli population. He has offered about as much as I think any Israeli leader has ever offered in the past or will offer. I hope that the measures that he has taken to resume negotiations with the Palestinians bear fruit and that the Israeli population, in an election, support those peace moves. It is in the hands of the people who live in the area, through peaceful negotiations.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Middle East: Israeli-Palestinian Conflict</title>,Private Members' Business,10,1,speech
"Georgiou, Petro, MP",LP,2000-12-04,"—I wish to support the motion moved by the honourable member for Sturt. In the last few months, we have witnessed an outbreak of violence in the Middle East. This violence has led to the death and injury of many innocent Palestinian and Israeli men, women and children. The loss and suffering of both sides in this conflict is deeply felt by this parliament. The tragedy is compounded by the fact that the Middle East peace process seems to have all but collapsed. The diplomatic triumph that brought with it great hope and potential reward today lies all but abandoned.
Since his election victory last year, Israel's Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, has dedicated his administration to securing peace for Israel. In the last year, the government of Israel has withdrawn Israeli forces from Lebanon and has offered Syria a peace proposal that included all of the Golan Heights. To the Palestinians, the Israeli government offered a peace settlement at Camp David that was both generous and brave. A fortnight ago, our Prime Minister, during his address to the annual dinner of the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council expressed the Australian government's view on that peace proposal when he said:
I do not believe that any Prime Minister of Israel could have offered more than did Ehud Barak at Camp David. It was an offer that should have been accepted and it is tragic in the extreme that it has not been accepted.
Since the Palestinian Authority's refusal of Israel's offer, we have watched as talk of peace by Yasser Arafat and other Palestinian leaders has been replaced by the rhetoric of violence and conflict. When the peace process commenced in 1993, the Chairman of the PLO renounced violence. At that time, he stated:
... the PLO renounces the use of terrorism and other acts of violence, and will assume responsibility over all PLO elements and personnel in order to assure their compliance.
In recent months, despite repeated requests and calls from the international community and Israel, the Palestinian leadership has done little to call for an end to violence. It is also disturbing that Yasser Arafat chose to release from jail many known terrorists from various extremist organisations. As a consequence, we are now witnessing the return of terrorist bombings of buses and public places in Israel and an escalation of civilian deaths.
The Palestinian people have a legitimate aspiration to realise their own state. We recognise and support that aspiration. But the most effective vehicle to deliver that outcome is the peace process. Since the signing of the Declaration of Principles, the peace process has brought the Palestinian people closer to nationhood and delivered more tangible benefits than at any time in the last half century. Today, more than 97 per cent of the Palestinian population live under Palestinian rule. The Palestinian Authority controls more than 40 per cent of the West Bank and Gaza. Since the Oslo agreement, the Palestinian people have also been the recipients of huge capital inflows and aid contributions from the international community. 
Australia is a strong friend and a staunch ally of the state of Israel and the people of Israel. There are few nations in the world which have overcome so much, fought so hard and sacrificed so many of their sons and daughters in the search for peace. Five million people in a sliver of land that would fit into Victoria 10 times continue to live with the daily reality that they face hostile neighbours still intent on their destruction. Yet, in a nation where every square mile carries with it serious strategic consequences, Israel continues to propose peace initiatives and concessions that increase her strategic vulnerability. I think we can all appreciate the frustration felt by many in Israel that, after having taken great risks in the search for peace, they are today faced with the same insecurity and violence that beset their nation before the peace process commenced. As Israel goes to the polls in a new election, it is my hope that, despite the current climate, her people continue to search for a renewed path to peace. I commend the motion to the House.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Middle East: Israeli-Palestinian Conflict</title>,Private Members' Business,10,1,speech
"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2000-12-04,"—In speaking in support of the member for Sturt's motion, I join my colleague the member for Melbourne Ports and other members in supporting peaceful negotiation rather than force or violence as a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Australian Labor Party has a long and honourable record of supporting both Arab and Jewish rights in that part of the world. Australia was involved in the original decision to partition Palestine into an Arab-Palestinian state and the Jewish state of Israel. That fair partitioning is the underlying basis for this motion. Dr Evatt, as chairman of the UN General Assembly, saw the partition of Palestine, which was and is the wise and right manner in which this matter should be and might be resolved. Like King Solomon, we have to support the parties who are willing to make a political compromise, not the party that wants to have everything.
At our ALP national conference, we called on all parties to not make unilateral declarations that would pre-empt negotiation. Peace can come only as a result of negotiation between the parties, not from us. Mr Arafat was told the same by the governments of Russia and France, which have been traditional supporters of the Palestinian cause. It is obvious that this is an emotional topic, with children being captured on television dying in crossfire. We also see mobs desecrating religious sites and lynching individuals. In Australia, we should be contributing to a political solution, not to emotional appeals on one side or the other.
In my contribution, I do not really want to talk about who is right and who is wrong, because in these matters that is a fine line to distinguish. I do want to pick up on a point about the media and about the citing of individual cases. The media has portrayed at times very graphic sights and has, I believe, with those images taken one side or the other and sometimes both. I do not believe that these grim pictures and people witnessing these events actually help the cause; rather, they destroy the negotiations and the potential for peace. In the very recent past, we have seen people like President Clinton with Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat having discussions, having negotiations and genuinely working towards what might be a peaceful solution in the Middle East.
The battle between the Israelis and the Palestinians has been going on for many years, and it is one that obviously does not have an easy solution and cannot be easily resolved by combined negotiations, but I think negotiations are the only way that it can be resolved. At some point, both sides must sit down and both sides must give and take. There was just recently some of that giving and some of that taking, and I think Ehud Barak has made some generous concessions in working towards what might be a solution. At the end of the day, the negotiations will have to come to the point where they actually find what will be the area of Palestine or a Palestinian state. As the member for Kooyong rightly pointed out, the Palestians do deserve their own state, they do deserve to have their own territory and they do deserve to be the masters of their own destiny. At some stage, the two must come together to find where that point is. 
I will quickly refer to point 3 of the motion moved by the member for Sturt. It `calls on all partners to resume negotiations without the threat of violence and without the premature announcement of unilateral declarations'. For these negotiations to continue, they must continue in peace. Violence must end. Violence is not benefiting one side or the other; it is only ensuring more graphic pictures in the media. I would also like to highlight point 5 of the motion, which says the House `hopes that the conflict will be resolved in the framework of agreement and compromise'. I would also like to highlight point 7, which `calls on all countries surrounding the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian territories to ensure their sovereign territory not be used to promote aggression'. Other countries should not contribute to the violence and the current problems in the Middle East.
There is one good thing we are doing through this parliament, and that is the Australia-Israel Friendship Group. It is a good group chaired by the member for Sturt and deputy chaired by the member for Melbourne Ports. I am a member of that friendship group and am glad to be. I fully support the good work being done here in support of the peace negotiations and in support of both sides finding a resolution. All we can do in this place is lend our support and offer any advice and assistance that we can to both parties and hope that, in the very near future, a solution is found and peace is brought to the Middle East.
 (Mr Nehl)—Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2000-12-04,"—We have heard recently about many rural and regional communities complaining that services have been taken from their local communities, and that it has had a consequent effect on the standard of living of those people in those communities. This is true not only of regional and rural communities, however. In my electorate, which is a metropolitan electorate, the withdrawal of banking services from a number of suburbs has had a very detrimental effect on the people whom I represent. There has been round after round of branch closures in my electorate. Of course, with those branch closures come staff losses. But with those branch closures also comes rising inconvenience for the people who have relied on those banks until now. The exorbitant fees and charges that many of the banks have been charging, particularly people with low account balances, have had a very detrimental effect on my constituents.
The Australian Banking Industry Ombudsman received 22 per cent more complaints in 1999-2000 than in the previous year. This is just a small indication of the frustration that many ordinary Australians are feeling on this issue. The Prime Minister is said to be a supporter of battlers; he calls himself a supporter of battlers in Australia. Yet his inaction on the issue of banks and the fees and charges that they are levelling on my constituents, and the fact that he has taken no clear line on the number of bank closures, would suggest that he is a bit more interested in the large donations that the big banks make to the coalition parties. 
—And the Labor Party.
—They make much bigger donations to the coalition parties—vastly bigger.
—Prove that.
—It is very easy to prove it, in fact, if you have been putting your returns in properly. Between 1993 and 1999, Australia's big four banks—Westpac, the National Australia Bank, ANZ and the Commonwealth—have closed a quarter of their branches nationally. Over the same period, the combined net profits of the big four nearly tripled. In the first six months of this year alone some 355 bank branches closed across the country—that is a rate of about two branch closures almost every day of the year. The Finance Sector Union is very upset about the branch closures.  
In my electorate of Sydney, the Commonwealth Bank has recently closed branches in Waterloo, Alexandria and Erskineville. Last month I was informed that the bank would be closing yet another branch in my electorate, at Railway Square. That is due to close just three weeks before Christmas. On Friday I received another notice from the Commonwealth Bank that it is about to close another branch in my electorate. This one is on one of Sydney's busiest streets: Oxford Street. It is very difficult to argue that they are closing because they do not have customers. In fact, I know that they are overwhelmed with customers. The Commonwealth Bank has closed over 75 branches in the first half of this year alone, or 680 branches since 1993—more than any other bank. Westpac, however, has also been closing branches in my electorate. Recently, they have closed branches at Waterloo, Camperdown and in the southern part of the central business district. 
Moving on to fees and charges, in 1999 fees and commissions charged by the banks increased by $1.32 billion. The recent Reserve Bank and ACCC report entitled Debit and credit card schemes in Australia: a study of interchange fees and access demonstrates clearly that the banks are profiteering on fees and charges. Interchange fees—imposed when a consumer withdraws money from their bank at another bank's automatic teller machine—are around double the average cost of providing these services. Similarly, issuing credit cards creates revenue well above the average cost of providing these services. One week after the release of the report, the banks announced plans to raise fees and charges by as much as 50 per cent, and to introduce new charges where there were none before. These increases saw the Commonwealth Bank increase fees for over-the-counter transactions from $2 to $3 and giroPost transactions from $2 to $3. The National Australia Bank announced an increase in the fee for over-the-counter transactions from $2 to $3 as well, at the same time announcing that it would close 100 branches in metropolitan areas. Likewise, Westpac increased its over-the-counter fees from $2 to $2.50.
These charges make a significant impact on the lives of pensioners and people on low incomes, for whom every dollar must count—especially after the introduction of the GST, which has hit these vulnerable people particularly hard. The majority of the 6,199 cases put to the banking ombudsman related to complaints by consumers that their bank had charged fees and charges contrary to the terms and conditions of that account. The problem with this, of course, is that consumers must be eternally vigilant to make sure that their banks are not, in fact, charging fees contrary to the terms of their account. But it puts a vast onus on pretty vulnerable consumers to take on large financial institutions.
In respect of jobs, since 1993 the number of employees at the big four banks fell by over 21,000 people, and the rate of profit made by the banks per employee has increased. However, workers and the Finance Sector Union have had to fight a protracted campaign for even the most basic wage rise. In 1998, it was reported that the head of Australia's biggest bank—Mr Don Argus of the National Australia Bank—was calculated to have been paid some 103 times the wage of a first-year teller. The closure of bank branches not only affects the staff of the bank itself, it has a dramatic impact on the community surrounding the bank and particularly on the shopping centres that surround banks in suburban shopping strips. There can be up to a 40 per cent downturn in retail trade in those suburban shopping centres when a branch closes.
There is a particularly stark illustration of this in my own electorate, in Waterloo. As I said, it has lost two banks recently and a post office. Suburbs like Waterloo are almost becoming ghost suburbs, as people have to leave the area to do all of their shopping and all of their banking and postal transactions. Elderly people and people with mobility difficulties in particular are disadvantaged by fewer branches, higher fees and charges and a reduction in face-to-face services. Closing a bank branch means that pensioners have to spend part of their precious pension money on actually getting to a bank in a neighbouring suburb. 
One of the problems in my electorate is that there is quite a high number of bag snatchers in the inner city. Pensioners are forced to travel from Waterloo to Redfern, for example, to access their pension payments. If they want to do that only once a week or once a fortnight, they must carry quite large amounts of money—perhaps their entire pension. Unfortunately, the bag snatchers in the area know when it is pension day and many older people are attacked for their pension money because they have to carry it quite long distances as bank branches closer to home have closed.
It is easy to identify problems, but I think it is incumbent upon us to start discussing solutions. The banks have spent an enormous amount of money on advertising and I remind honourable members of the cash for comment scandal. These are not solutions to the problem of the poor standing of banks in the community. If banks are to improve their relationship with consumers and the community, they must start providing a better service—particularly for those on low incomes with low account balances. Banks have an obligation to society as well as to their shareholders, and people on low incomes cannot be excluded from financial services simply because their business may not create as much profit for the banks as do wealthy people and wealthy corporations.
With the top four banks enjoying more than 80 per cent of the banking market and making a combined total of $9 billion between them, the `leave it to the market' answer is clearly unworkable. The government must direct the ACCC to continue to monitor bank fees and charges. We also have to bring the banks to the negotiating table with consumer groups and pensioner groups to create a social charter for banks. A social charter is important in ensuring that every Australian can access simple banking services. The social charter must be binding, otherwise it will be just a toothless tiger. It should include a requirement to provide a fee-free account for pensioners and social security recipients. We must also address the problem of banks that have closed branches thus making it impossible for their customers to access local branches or even ATMs.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Banking: Branch Closures</title>,Grievance Debate,11,1,speech
"Ronaldson, Michael, MP",LP,2000-12-04,"—I say at the outset of my speech on the Roads to Recovery Bill 2000 that I will limit my time today because, unfortunately, as a result of the opposition's actions last Thursday, a considerable amount of debating time for this important bill was lost. So given the time constraints and the need to get this bill into the Senate for their consideration and to get the money out on to local roads, I will keep my comments very short. I received a letter on 29 November, which stated:
Dear Michael,
LOCAL ROADS FUNDING BOOST
Hepburn Shire Council thanks you and the Federal Government for the very positive funding boost for local roads. 
As you are aware we and other Councils have not had the resources to adequately maintain the extensive local road network. Your sympathy and support on this issue over recent years is very much appreciated. 
We will ensure that this funding is used effectively and strategically. Council already has detailed lists with priority assessment. We expect that much of the funding will be channelled into resealing of local roads and gravel re-sheets of unsealed roads. This would provide more extensive benefits than concentrating the funding in a small number of projects. 
The problems with infrastructure require long-term solutions. Our community has recognised that ongoing rate increases will be needed together with improved Federal and State funding. We request that this four year funding program be progressively assessed for effectiveness and benefits with a view to becoming ongoing.
Thank you once again Michael, for your support.
The letter is signed by Victor Szwed, Chief Executive Officer, and Max O'Shea, the Mayor of Hepburn Shire Council. An article in the Ballarat Courier last week quoted City of Ballarat Mayor, John Barnes, following the federal government's announcement of the Roads to Recovery Program. Councillor Barnes was quoted as saying:
“I think it's very generous”, he said.
“We're very happy about it.”
The Mayor of Hepburn Shire Council, Max O'Shea, was again quoted as saying that the funding was a `wonderful boost for local roads'. The Moorabool Shire will be receiving some $3.279 million over the four-year period. The article stated:
Chief executive officer Chris Gillard said the funding would contribute to closing the council infrastructure funding gap. 
“It will mean some projects will be able to be brought forward,”
In the Ballarat Courier again—it is a marvellous newspaper that covers a broad range of interests to my community—the `Farmers' Weekly' section stated:
Victorian Farmers Federation president Peter Walsh said the increase represented about a 75 per cent increase in the annual funding for local roads.  
“The deterioration in local roads is a major constraint on growth in rural Australia,” Mr Walsh said. 
The Commonwealth has called upon the states to also increase funding for local roads. The VFF endorses this call for the Victorian Government to increase its allocation to rural local roads. 
“The Labor Party made an undertaking prior to the last election to `commit resources to rural local roads' but so far this commitment has not been met.
The state government did make that comment prior to the last election, but since then any requests for an increase in local road funding has fallen on deaf ears. It is my understanding that the Victorian transport minister, Peter Batchelor—and this is from a press release by Minister Anderson—is quoted as saying `local roads are the responsibility of local governments'. 
The simple fact is that we—and I am sure honourable members on the other side do likewise and if they do not they are not doing their job properly—speak to our local government representatives to ascertain from them what the real issues are. I hit the circuit about 12 months ago to speak to all my mayors, shire CEOs and shire presidents, again, to ascertain what their needs were, and the single biggest issue was local roads. It was local roads—tens the field after that. It was the only issue confronting my local government representatives—it was not the only issue, but it was the key issue that they wanted addressed. This is a very significant contribution to infrastructure in rural and regional Australia. This is a very significant contribution to local road infrastructure in my electorate of Ballarat and the general region. In the wider region, some $25 million has gone into local roads.
There will be some, I suspect, who, through ignorance—and I do not say that in a negative sense—would not understand the importance of local roads to not only rural and regional economies but also national economies. There are 1.7 million Australians who depend on the export industry for their jobs—that is one in four people in rural and regional Australia. These jobs are primarily generated from produce that begins its journey on local roads. I was speaking to a constituent on Saturday night who advised me that a road near him carries a school bus and he got one of the children to hop out of the bus the other day and step into a pothole on this road and he could not see anything six inches below this child's knee. This is a local road that is taking school children to school. This is a local road—and I am sure the honourable member for Corangamite, who is sitting beside me, will be acutely of aware of this—that is not only transporting children but also transporting families and transporting agricultural produce. This is the lifeblood of rural communities—the lifeblood—and they have been starved of funds. 
In 1991, all three tiers of government got their heads together and said that federal government would fund national highways, state governments would fund state roads and local government would fund local roads. The simple fact is that that agreement has not worked. That agreement has seen an extraordinary deterioration in local road infrastructure throughout rural and regional Australia. It is a significant matter for all Australians because all Australians have both an economic and a social investment in local roads. They may well be 2,500 kilometres away from where people live, but we all have an investment in local roads. They are pivotal to this country's economy. They are the lifeblood socially and economically of rural and regional communities, and the state of deterioration is absolutely appalling. In fact, I would go so far as to say that it is a matter of national shame that our local road network has got to this stage. Local government, as hard as it tried, simply could not spend the money that was required. That is why the federal government, in consultation with local government, has given a $1.2 billion boost over four years to local roads.
Members of parliament get phone calls about many things: some not so complimentary, some complimentary. My phones have been ringing off the hook in relation to this with people desperately urging me to get their local roads fixed. I have told those people that we are directing the money straight into local government, so that local government can determine their priorities. If you look at people like those in the Shire of Hepburn, they have already done that work. They know where the money is to be spent. They know it is desperately needed and they know it will be money very well spent. 
I think this is one of the greatest achievements of this government because it addresses everything across the board. It is a national program with national benefits. I say to those people who are waiting for their local roads to be fixed: this is a partnership. It is a $1.2 billion partnership from the federal government; local government is making its contribution; and I call upon the states to match this funding, because they have as much investment in local roads as local government does and as the federal government does. I urge them, I plead with them, to please match this funding so that we can make a significant difference to what I think is a national issue. Given the time constraints and the number of my colleagues who wish to speak on this bill, I draw my comments to a close.",REPS,<title>ROADS TO RECOVERY BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2000-12-04,"—I will attempt to follow the honourable member for Ballarat's lead in keeping my comments short to ensure that all members of this House have an opportunity to speak on what is a very important bill, but I will have some difficulty in following his rhetoric because my views differ somewhat from those of the member for Ballarat with respect to the Roads to Recovery Bill 2000. This bill is about a broken promise. The Prime Minister gave an ironclad guarantee prior to the last election that the GST would not cause petrol prices to rise, and it was a promise that he reaffirmed after the election. This bill is the second of the government's political responses to the fallout it is encountering as a result of that broken election promise.
It is a serious broken election promise and one that affects all people from all walks of life. As many members would be aware, over the last few weeks I have been participating in the federal opposition's fuel inquiry. It is an inquiry that is designed to establish the extent of the Prime Minister's GST induced fuel tax windfall and how best that can be returned to the Australian people. It has been a very interesting exercise because, wherever we go, particularly in regional Australia, we are overwhelmed with people who are keen to share their petrol experiences with us. Not only individuals, families and small business operators but also, indeed, a number of community groups ranging from Meals on Wheels through to community transport are keen to share their story with us, keen to let us know how John Howard's broken election promise is affecting them.
We have had local government bodies before us, as well. The member for Ballarat spent a fair bit of time sharing with us how happy local government is about the Roads to Recovery Program. Many of those local government representatives are with us in the building tonight and we welcome them. We are hearing a different story at the petrol inquiry. We are hearing numerous stories about the manner in which higher fuel prices are affecting the operations of local government. For example, council bodies that have fixed contracts for work they do for state roads bodies are not compensated in terms of those contracts for increases in fuel prices.
So there is a mixed message out there. In particular, owner-driver truckies have approached our inquiry in great numbers, explaining how they are being squeezed at both ends and how they are being asked to pass on fictional embedded wholesale sales tax savings and, at the same time, bear the brunt of higher fuel prices. This is an issue hurting people badly in the regions in particular. It is going to get worse.
—I rise on a point of order, Deputy Madam Speaker. The member for Hunter has been going for four minutes now and has made no reference to the bill at all, let alone its context. I ask that you bring him back to the subject matter of the bill.
—As I listened to the Chief Government Whip, I am listening to the member for Hunter. There is no point of order. 
—Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I will make sure that I get my 20 minutes now. I thank the member for Ballarat. As I was pointing out, this is the government's political response to its failure to keep its election promise on fuel prices. I was about to say before I was rudely interrupted by the Chief Government Whip that the situation for the government is about to get worse. I heard the AAA—the Australian Automobile Association—talking this morning about the prospect, due to maybe an easing in the price of world oil, of petrol prices coming down a bit.
I beg to differ for one particular reason. No-one has considered this yet, but we all know that each year during the Christmas period the major oil companies take the opportunity to exploit the sudden increase in demand for petrol. They exploit the desire of families to travel on holiday. Every year it is the same: surprise, surprise, the price of petrol goes up by between 5c and 10c in late December. There is no solid reason or real explanation for this other than the fact that the major oil companies seize the opportunity to take excessive profits throughout the Christmas period when they know that demand is high and that the purchase of fuel is essential if Australian families want to holiday by car.
Let us consider what will happen this year. When the major oil companies force up petrol prices by five per cent in their attempt to take excessive profits by exploiting the Christmas holiday period, what will happen to the GST? It will also increase. This year there will be a compound effect. We have experienced higher petrol prices throughout the Christmas period for decades, but, because the GST is an ad valorem tax, the situation will be compounded this year. Ten per cent on 95c is less than 10 per cent on one dollar. The government need not kid itself that the political pressure is about to ease; I believe it is about to get even tougher. 
What was the government's first reaction to its failed election promise? Its first response was the so-called Fuel Sales Grants Scheme designed to ensure that motorists in rural and regional Australia received a rebate of between 1c and 2c. It was a desperate attempt by the government to deliver on its pre-election GST petrol promise, but that initiative has failed. Throughout the short history of this scheme, a number of anomalies have indicated that it is flawed. The first triggered an ACCC inquiry—the results of which are still pending—into suggestions that the fuel grants scheme is not being passed on to those for whom it is intended—the motorists of rural and regional Australia.
In the mid-year budget review, we learnt that the cost of the fuel grants scheme had blown out considerably. It appears that, rather than costing the government $500 million over four years, it will now cost more like $1 billion. The question is: why has the fuel grants scheme blown out so extensively? The government's response is that Treasury simply underestimated the number of retail outlets that were likely to be eligible for the scheme. That is absolute rubbish. A simple five-minute telephone call to the Motor Traders Association would have given Treasury the information that it required to assess the number of service stations adequately and to do a by-volume assessment of the cost of the scheme. I suggest that there is a little more to this than meets the eye and that some in the regions who are not eligible for it are claiming that grant. I question also how much of the money is going to bodies not originally considered by the government—such as mining companies operating in regional areas that might have a number of related entities that retail fuel to each other. Of course the fuel grants scheme covers not only petrol but also diesel.
I intend today to put some questions on the Notice Paper for the Treasurer. They include: how many large corporations other than the major oil companies have received money under the fuel grants scheme in the first three months? I hope I get a better answer than I did to my question of 30 August when I asked the Treasurer what proportion of the fuel grants scheme had gone to the major oil companies—BP, Shell, Caltex and Mobil—in its first three months of operation. Despite the major oil companies' claim that they cannot pocket the grants scheme money because it has to go to the retailers, the fact is that they are the retailers and they have an enormous share by volume of retail petrol. If those companies run service stations, they are retailers; if they deal with a service station proprietor on a commission agency basis and the ownership of the fuel does not change hands, they are retailers. If people purchase their fuel with a Shell card or a BP card, the ownership of that fuel reverts to the major oil companies. Under all those circumstances, the fuel grants scheme money goes straight to the major oil companies. 
How much do you suspect the major oil companies have received under the fuel grants scheme? It has been suggested to me that they have each received about $5 million, three months in advance. Yet when I asked the Treasurer to confirm that figure, what answer did I get? The answer reads:
This information is not available due to the privacy restrictions of Section 47 of the Product Grants and Benefits Administration Act 2000.
That is a non-answer. What is section 47 designed to do? It is designed to protect commercial-in-confidence information that agents of the Commonwealth gather when auditing the fuel grants scheme. To audit the scheme properly, they must have an in-depth knowledge of the operations of the retailer involved, and of course they should not return to Canberra and share that commercially sensitive information. But section 47 is not designed to deny the Australian taxpayer information about what taxpayer-funded grants are going to private corporations in this country. That is not what that section is about. That is the most outrageous answer to a question on notice that I have ever seen, and we must ask: what has the Treasurer got to hide? Why does the Treasurer not want the general public to know how much of their money is being forked out to large, private corporations in this country under the fuel grants scheme? What has he got to hide? 
That was the government's first response to the political crisis that flowed from John Howard's broken election promise. This bill, the Roads to Recovery Bill 2000, is its second response. I must say that I agree with the member for Ballarat on this point: all government bodies around this country will welcome the money allocated to them under this particular program. I was on the Cessnock Council for eight years. I know, as well as anyone in this place, the challenge faced by local government in terms of meeting the demands placed upon them by local roads programs; they are always behind, always struggling with that situation. In my own electorate, some of my councils did relatively quite well: Cessnock, $2.6 million; Singleton, $1.8 million; Muswellbrook, $1.4 million—and the list goes on.
But the question has to be asked: should all Australian motorists continue to bear the brunt of high petrol prices and petrol taxes so that the few who live in that relatively small number of streets can benefit? To put it another way: having identified or acknowledged a shortfall in local roads funding, shouldn't the government just have funded it anyway, without resorting to this conditional approach? That harks back to the old sale of Telstra: Natural Heritage Trust money, but only if you agree with the sale of Telstra. That is unacceptable, totally unacceptable. The government needs, first, now to acknowledge its broken promise and to move to reduce the petrol tax burden on the Australian motorists.
I have one quick point before I close. We are talking tonight about $1.2 billion under the Roads to Recovery Program. But what about the other $400 million? The government claims that the $1.2 billion we are talking about tonight will be shared equitably amongst councils. There is some question about that, but we will just accept that for a moment. What about the balance, the $400 million that the government says will be spent on the national highway and roads of national significance? How will those priorities be determined? If the government is fair dinkum about this, it will set a proper list of priorities and address the problems that have been caused by years of funding cutbacks to the national highway system. It will fund projects like the Kurri Kurri Corridor, a very important road project in the Hunter that would link the F3 freeway to the New England Highway north of Branxton; it will fund the Muswellbrook bypass; and it will fund the intersection where Weakley's Drive meets the New England Highway. It will fund other important projects that promote economic growth, such as local roads projects in Hunter wine country, in the Pokolbin area. It will fund projects that will create economic growth in high-growth tourism areas. If the government is fair dinkum about that balance of $400 million, it will set proper priorities and fund projects like the ones I have just mentioned.

"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,2000-12-04,"—I thank the member for Hunter for his dissertation on fuel prices—nothing to do with roads. I remind the member for Hunter that fuel prices have risen because of the OPEC oil prices rising 300 per cent. Maybe he would rather overlook that.
Let me just strongly commend to the House the Roads to Recovery Program. Through this program, money will be allocated to local councils throughout the whole of Australia—not just country, but city and country. It is a program for the allocation of $1.2 billion over four years, with an extra $300 million per annum going to local councils throughout Australia, as I have said. Through the financial assistance grants—and there has been some argument about the methodology in allocating this money—this current financial year, the government has injected into local councils throughout Australia an amount of $406 million; and next year, it will inject another $300 million.
The important things to note are the criteria for this allocation of money: length of road and population. That makes a balance between those councils with bigger numbers of people and those councils that have longer roads in rural Australia. I think the formula is very fair, it will affect all electorates and it basically works out very well. The grant will be tied to local councils for road funding. That will ensure that the money the federal government has put forward will be spent on roads. It will also ensure that local councils can make their own priorities. Madam Deputy Speaker, you would be aware of that; local councils can make the decision at the local level and not blame the federal government for some of the roads that might need repair but which do not fit their priorities.
I would encourage the states to fund the maintenance and construction of state roads for which they have a responsibility. Under this program, the states cannot move away from their current commitments under the guise of the federal government having provided more money. As we all would be aware—disregarding the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Hunter—the GST will provide a growth tax to state governments. Nobody would deny that. So, in four or five years time, state governments will find sufficient revenue to support their road funding programs in a better way than they can now. I would also encourage local councils to maintain their rate base to support their own funding programs and, again, not move away from the road programs that they had planned because of the federal government's injection.
It is worth putting on the record that this Roads to Recovery Program has been made possible by the sound economic management of the Howard government. We have a low inflationary situation, we have a budget surplus, and the government has seen fit to return some of these funds to infrastructure at all levels.
Just very briefly, I will refer to a House of Representatives standing committee that inquired into road funding and that produced a report entitled Planning, not patching. That committee tabled its report in October 1997. I was a very active member of that committee. We inspected roads throughout Australia, and we identified the ongoing problems of federal funding, state funding, local funding and the never ending problem of allocating funds to those three sectors. We looked at the private sector contribution and the possibilities of BOOT funding: build, own, operate and transfer. This, again, represents a very interesting set of possibilities, which have been implemented in New South Wales with the M15, the M14, the M2 and the Sydney Harbour Tunnel; and in Victoria with the CityLink project of $1.2 billion. With these developments, the private sector provides the capital, the motorists pay a toll and, after a period of time—in the case of CityLink I think it is 35 years—they return to public ownership. Also on that committee we had a good look at the relationship between the federal government, state governments and local governments in terms of planning, ensuring that the projects were properly evaluated, that their design and construction were first class and that the taxpayers and ratepayers got value for their money. 
I notice the member for Corio has entered the chamber, and I will be referring to him in a minute because he is a very good supporter of road funding in rural Australia and he does support this package, I am very confident. Road funding in Australia amounts to about $6 billion—and I emphasise that—from all sources, so roads receive a lot of money compared to railways, which receive virtually nothing in terms of maintenance and capital spending. The revenue sources for that amount of spending are somewhere in the range of $12 billion to $13 billion from excise and road related registration fees and local rates. We see the interesting scenario where hypothecation does not really exist in the Australian road funding situation, but I put on the record that a lot of money is spent.
If we look at the federal government's responsibility for road funding, over the years the federal government has taken on the responsibility of the federal highway system. I give a clear definition of that: capital city to capital city roads. The federal government is prepared to pay, organise, construct and maintain those important national arterial highways. The second sort of responsibility is for roads of national importance. The member for Corio would understand that, because the Geelong-Melbourne road is a road of national importance. The federal government contributed $120 million of the $240 million project. Thirdly, there is the Black Spot Program, which has been very effective in identifying the parts of all roads that are a dangerous part of the road link and that should be repaired. I note in passing that the federal contribution to the Geelong road is not very well signposted and that the $120 million federal government contribution is not fully recognised. I will be drawing that to the attention of the minister so that motorists on that road will understand that the federal government is contributing half the funds and that the road is not just a Victorian government project.
Madam Deputy Speaker, I draw to your attention and the attention of the House the councils who received money from this program. At the local level, the various councils in my electorate are very pleased with the funding that will help them enhance their program. The Borough of Queenscliffe, whilst it is a very small borough, is very efficiently run and very frugal in the way in which it spends money. It has a very good road structure. Fundamentally, there is no moisture under the road, because of the sandy nature of the soil, and the road structure will go on and on, unlike other roads in my electorate. Over four years, the Borough of Queenscliffe will receive $280,000; that will be very helpful to that small municipality. 
The Surf Coast Shire, on the other hand, have a major difficulty. They have drawn to my attention that the FAGs are based on a census taken in August; they have a smaller population in August but in the summer period their population doubles so there is tremendous pressure on their road infrastructure, both for their main highways and for their smaller roads. I have been very aware of that problem, and very happy to represent their point of view as from time to time they have sought a change in the formula that leads the Surf Coast Shire to suffer. They will be receiving $2.4 million over four years, and they will be very happy about that.
The City of Greater Geelong is represented by the member for Corio—and ably represented, generally, when he is there. He is not there very much these days because he is representing the farmers throughout Australia. The City of Greater Geelong is going to receive $8.4 million from the Howard government, which I am sure the member for Corio will acknowledge at the local level. He will ensure that that money is spent in the rural part of the city of Greater Geelong, not in the urban area where he lives. That is where they need the extra money. The city of Geelong enjoys a good rate base, solid industry and an ability to generate considerable funds of its own. 
The Golden Plains Shire are going to receive $3 million over the four-year period. We have a farming community where there is heavy traffic with fertiliser, timber, grain and wool, where again the important formula of the distance of road and lesser number of people will come into play to allow the municipality, which again has done a good job over the years, to maintain its road infrastructure. It will be very pleased with this allocation from the federal government. 
The Colac Otway Shire will receive $3.1 million over the four years. It is in a high rainfall zone. Weeaproinah has 70 inches of rain a year. That shire has great difficulty in maintaining its road infrastructure because of the poor foundation and the extra wetness that comes through the winter months. It needs that money to maintain its current infrastructure, let alone build new roads. It has problems with timber vehicles and milk tankers. Some of the roads are gravel and the high rainfall does not help to maintain them. It has considerable disadvantages because of its geographical location.
The Corangamite Shire is a neighbour of the Corangamite electorate. My good friend Mr Hawker is the member there. Again, it has problems with milk tankers, high rainfall and the roads collapsing because of the foundation. It will appreciate, I know, the $3 million that the federal government has allocated to it. 
I finish by putting on the record the concerns of the Great Ocean Road funding. We have 800,000 tourists per annum. They are of an international character and it is a bit unfair for the local municipality to have to take all the funding and maintenance of that road.
I hope that the state government will continue to match the funding, that there will be no cost shifting by state governments or local governments and that local councils will not apportion blame to the federal government having made this very good allocation to improve the roads. Money will be left on local roads and the local councils will continue to look after local roads for local people and for those local motorists who move throughout the electorate of Corangamite. I commend the legislation, I commend the allocation, and I hope after the next four-year period the roads of Corangamite will be in a much better state because of this allocation from the federal Howard government.",REPS,<title>ROADS TO RECOVERY BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2000-12-04,"—Members of this House with an understanding of rural and regional Australia know the importance of local roads to rural dwellers. From an agriculture point of view, the maintenance of local roads is important not only to the economic efficiency of Australia's agricultural sector but also in preserving its social fabric. Most agricultural produce is transported in the first instance by road, either to another transport connection or to the marketplace directly. The run-down in the nation's road transport infrastructure over the past five years under the Howard government has impacted adversely on the efficiency of Australia's agricultural sector. I have travelled extensively throughout Australia in my capacity as shadow minister for agriculture, and there has been one constant message that has come through from farmers, local councillors and rural communities: the need to maintain roads and bridges in country areas. That is why over recent years rural communities have reacted with dismay at this government's failure to adequately resource the maintenance of Australia's road infrastructure. That is why they have reacted angrily while the government has lined the pockets of Sydney and Melbourne advertising agencies to the tune of half a billion dollars to advertise a GST that people in those communities did not want, while they watched their roads deteriorate. Now the member for Corangamite and the member for Ballarat and other members on the other side want to be applauded for their past negligence. They think that this Roads to Recovery Program will wash away their past sins of silence on this matter. The fact is that the funding of this program is based on a broken promise, a gross deception that was perpetrated by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer on the GST's impact on the price of fuel. Now the government wants to fiddle the figures in the Geelong region with a slick bit of double counting on the funding allocation. 
Firstly, to the Prime Minister's broken promise: members will recall the Prime Minister's promise that the GST would not increase the price of petrol. This is a Prime Minister who cannot lie straight in bed. He promised to keep Telstra in public hands, and then he sold 49 per cent of it. He promised never, ever to introduce the GST, and then he broke that promise and introduced it. He promised the pensioners of this country $1,000 compensation for the GST, and he ratted on that promise. He promised that the GST would not increase the price of petrol, and he has been caught out in violation of that promise, like a kid in a lolly shop, by the automobile associations of this country and the National Farmers Federation. 
What came with the violation of the fuel promise was a massive billion dollar windfall, and it is that windfall which is now funding this particular package so applauded by members opposite including the member for Corangamite. Of course rural people welcome any expenditure on their roads. But do not treat them arrogantly. Do not treat them like fools by dressing this package up as evidence that this government have any real concern about the needs of people in rural areas. Budget after budget this government ripped the heart out of rural Australia, and now they want to be applauded for putting something back. The National Farmers Federation got it in the neck from the Howard government ministers for having the temerity to point out that the package was funded by a broken promise and for demanding that the government honour its original word.
The member for Corangamite is happy to support not only this deception in this parliament today; he also supports the government's rorting of the figures in the Geelong area. In the government's own document the allocation for the seat of Corio, which encompasses the City of Greater Geelong, is $8.4 million over four years. But you would not believe it! When you come to look at the figures for Corangamite, included in the $20.89 million for the electorate of Corangamite is a figure of $8.4 million over four years. So the allocation to my electorate in Corio is being double counted in Corangamite to save the skin of the member for Corangamite at the next election. It has happened not only in Victoria in the seat of Corangamite. It has happened all over Australia, especially in Queensland. The government knows it holds Corangamite by a slender margin of 4.5 per cent. The demographics are changing; the issues on people's minds are of substance. The fortunes of this tired, arrogant, out-of-touch government are on the wane and the Prime Minister is trying to save one of his stalwarts, the member for Corangamite, one of the loyal supporters who missed out on a frontbench position and was rewarded for his loyalty with the deputy whip position. Let us not forget that the member for Corangamite's loyalty to the Prime Minister was rewarded in this way. The people of Corangamite know that the GST, fuel prices, Telstra and industrial relations all have the potential to retire the member for Corangamite at the next election.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.
—I am concluding my comments on the government's Roads to Recovery Program. I was speaking about the dickying of the figures that seems to have occurred by the member for Corangamite with reference to the funding allocation in the Geelong region. I know the coalition is full of rorters. We have seen several ministers prematurely retired from service on the front bench because they were rorting their travel allowance and, of course, more recently we have had the case of a senior member in the coalition rorting his phone card—or having others rort it for him, having lent it to his son. I must admit that I know the honourable member for Corangamite is a good friend of the minister for small business and employment relations or whatever it is that he is a minister for these days, but I did not think he would stoop so low as to attempt to double-count the road funding figures in the Geelong region. I call on the honourable member for Corangamite to publicly state in the Geelong region that the funding allocation for the seat of Corangamite is not the $20 million that has been portrayed in government literature but is something more in the region of perhaps $12 million or $13 million. When he does that, I suggest he will have some real credibility—even though he is only restoring some of the funding that has been ripped out of Corangamite by the coalition over the last five years and the funding is being financed by a deception on fuel. 
The opposition have been critical of many aspects of this particular legislation. We have been critical of the way in which the funds have been raised, and the deception therein. We have also been critical of the fact that this particular legislation program has been dumped on the electorate for basically electoral gain. There is no real planning in this. There is no national transport plan behind this expenditure, merely some more pork-barrelling by the National Party and the Liberal Party, especially in rural and regional seats. It is interesting to note that 17 government seats will receive $25 million or more. I do not begrudge those regional areas funding from this program—after all, they had the insides ripped out of the funding for their roads over the last five years—but I do take exception to the fact that the honourable member for Corangamite comes in here claiming $20 million of expenditure in Corangamite when, in fact, he is double-counting the particular figures that are in my electorate.
I conclude with these remarks: the honourable member for Corangamite was saying that the coalition was not getting recognition for the $100 million or so that it is putting in to the Geelong road. I have to remind the honourable member for Corangamite—and the people of Geelong know this—that it was only after Labor at the federal level and the state level had committed to funding the road that the Liberal Party came out of the woodwork and wanted a piece of the action. I am not one to look a gift-horse in the mouth. We will take the funding, and we will get the extra lane on the road. But, as a matter for the public record, it was Labor that flushed the coalition out on this: after we had made the funding commitment and committed to that road, it was then, as usual, Labor with the vision and, of course, the coalition falling in behind.
I find it interesting that the member for Corangamite lectures local and state governments on maintaining their funding programs. I thought he would have had a little more cognisance of the Prime Minister's comments in question time when the Prime Minister said that local governments, if they spend the money that they get on roads, could then divert their expenditure in other directions. The Prime Minister was giving them the clue to basically maintain their road funding and spend this money in other areas. I ought to mention, in conclusion, that the coalition cannot even tell this parliament the formula, the basis, on which these funds have been allocated. That is an absolute disgrace and it really points to the fact that this is a fly-by-night government, a desperate government, a government that has ripped the insides out of rural and regional Australia and now wants to curry a bit of favour with its Roads to Recovery Program.",REPS,<title>ROADS TO RECOVERY BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Lawler, Tony, MP",NP,2000-12-04,"—This government's recently announced $1.2 billion funding package for local country roads represents one of this administration's finest accomplishments for regional areas. Despite what the previous speaker says, it is all very well to have vision; but, if you cannot pay for it, forget about it. It is apparent that those opposite are unfamiliar with the challenges that are faced by country people, and that may be because they hold very few seats in country areas. They do not appreciate the challenges that country people, such as those in my electorate of western New South Wales, face and they have failed to appreciate what this stark turnaround in funding will mean to communities in my region. The people in my region, especially the local governments, are not foolish enough to be conned by any outlandish announcement that a government may make. There is no better barometer to be measured against than the jubilation of local government officials in my electorate of Parkes, which has been so long starved of sufficient funding to maintain the huge and crumbling local roads network. One ALP mayor in my electorate, whom I will spare the embarrassment of naming, was among those singing the economic and social praises of this radical reform of funding for minor country roads. In fact, the local newspaper did not run his comments—as he told me—only because he was praising the government. 
To assist those with scant awareness of what is consistently the number one issue in rural areas, alongside health care, it must be remembered that the roads that we are talking about are not necessarily bitumen. They are most often gravel or dirt, stretching for many thousands of kilometres, with hazards that city motorists—represented by those opposite—could only dream of, and they are often unpassable after rain. At their worst, local roads inhibit commerce and reduce the quality of life. It is as simple as that. Yet long-suffering country motorists are not seeking the same luxury of door-to-door paving enjoyed by their city cousins. They simply want roads that are passable a day or so after rains instead of a week after rains. They want a road on which they can travel at nearly 100 kilometres an hour between towns without literally risking life and limb.
Tourism is often touted as an alternative revenue source for some embattled outback communities, but it takes a lot of country hospitality to attract a family from blemish-free coastal highways onto dusty deathtraps or quagmires five or six hours away. In the same vein, attendance at a third of country schools is affected by wet weather isolation. So people on properties or in far-flung areas send their children away to school, only to have them stuck in nearby towns when they try to return for school holidays, due to a downpour that cuts them off the last few kilometres from home.
A CWA study nominates roads as the top priority of almost 70 per cent of country women, while getting stranded on a darkened country road, ferrying a sick child to medical help, is listed among their greatest fears. But those days will hopefully become a thing of the past when this funding acts as a circuit-breaker in the cycle of frantically patching up roads while others fall to pieces to the extent that local councils indicate that, at the rate they were being funded before, the job of resheeting roads would take 200 years. It just goes to show the absolute ignorance of those opposite, such as the previous speaker, who suggested that local councils might use this money to fund their roads, because it is tied, and spend what was previously their roads funding in other areas. There would not be a single council in the electorate of Parkes who does not spend more than the allocated amount on their rural roads. They are most welcoming of this package.
Let me inform those misguided critics of the benefits this funding reappraisal will bring to people in my electorate. Consider the economic benefits from improved transport routes for rural producers to get their goods to market faster and in better condition. In addition, this funding will not only make life better in terms of access to towns and the services, luxuries and friends they contain but also go a long way to improving the education prospects of our children, for the reasons outlined above. Of course, these improvements to the region's economy, its social network, its educational standards and comfort levels for travellers will also enhance the prospects of communities attracting professionals, such as doctors or nurses. Those opposite may be surprised to learn that there is one nursing home in the town of Tullamore in my electorate whose number one reason for being unable to attract nursing staff to their aged care facility is simply the road between Tullamore and Dubbo. The nursing staff simply will not risk their lives and their cars—and, therefore, their hard-earned money—travelling along the roads to work in Tullamore.
The wider view of the road network's value has been a cornerstone of many National Party members' efforts to secure this funding. Credit should go—I feel a little bit of a Johnny-come-lately standing here—to the member for Riverina, along with the member for New England, Stuart St Clair, the member for Kennedy, Bob Katter, and the member for Hinkler, Paul Neville, for their extensive and successful efforts in bringing road funding to the position in the government's sight in which it is in today. Along with groups like the CWA, local government can take credit for highlighting the importance of this issue to their federal representatives. In my area, that applies to Ray Longfellow from the Central Darling Shire, Rex Wilson and Ashley Weilinga from the Warren Shire, Ray Donald and Paul Wearne from the Bogan Shire, Peter Yench and Russ Pigg from the Cobar Shire, Peter Felsch and Angelo Pippos from the Brewarrina Shire and Wally Mitchell, Wayne O'Malley and Alan McCormack from the Bourke Shire. These and many others are the ones that have raised this issue time after time with me. 
The pressure that has, quite rightly, been brought to bear on the government by many members of the public and by the local shires has resulted in this forward thinking plan. Individual members of the public who have added weight to calls for more funding include Louise Fisher from Nyngan, whose child missed 10 days of school due to impassable roads, and also Andrew and Jenny Paul from Cobar, and especially Gary Langley and James Harris from the Tullamore-Narromine district. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the time to take the effort to approach your local governments. This is the time when the local governments have the money to spend to upgrade the roads that you have brought to my attention.
Appropriately, it was last year's Roads Forum in Moree—instigated by the Local Government Association—that set the stage for the roads issue to emerge from National Party leader John Anderson's Regional Summit as a major priority. After turning all its guns onto the issue of dwindling country health services at the last budget, this government has now launched an all-out attack on the country's shabby local road network. The ability of federal funding to reach its local government target more effectively than when it first sifted through the agendas of state governments leads me to believe that such a direct approach should be implemented more often. This comment has been gathering momentum in my electorate as I speak to more and more people, especially those in local government.
I would admit that many people in regional centres such as Dubbo are not familiar with the importance of rural roads. But you do not have to go far out of Dubbo to run into people every one of whom knows how important this funding is. The message that is coming back through to me and that I convey to those in the chamber tonight and to those listening is: thank goodness that this government is controlling the purse strings. Yes, there has been some pain. Yes, there has been some restriction on government spending. How else would a government—any government—cope with an inherited $90 billion deficit? The word coming through very strongly is: thank goodness that there is a government that has been able to steer us through the Asian economic crisis and that has some money to spend on rural roads. It is going to be in a position to provide some much needed relief funding for those affected by the floods and heavy rains in the area of western New South Wales.
Driven by public comment and National Party input, the government have shown both the will and the ability to attempt to turn the tide, first on country health and now on country roads, and that constitutes a good day for regional Australia. I have been inundated with calls and letters from people in my electorate praising the government and thanking them for the work that they have done to deliver this road funding. I might just finish this evening with a brief quote from the Bourke Shire Council. It reads:
This excellent news was received with much appreciation and a good deal of relief. This will allow council to catch up on maintenance work we have not been in a position to do. Council has been contemplating reducing our planned fleet by one grader ... and associated staff in order to remain within our budget.
It is interesting that the opposition are having trouble even finding speakers to speak on this bill, such is the importance they give to country roads. The final paragraph says:
This funding will allow us to maintain this unit and more importantly the jobs associated with its use. Council is most grateful for your support and that of your government.",REPS,<title>ROADS TO RECOVERY BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,2000-12-04,"—I must admit I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak. I thought at one stage that the government might not even allow me to speak. There are a number of points I want to raise in speaking on the Roads to Recovery Bill 2000. The point I think we have to concentrate on is really the failure of the government to develop a national infrastructure strategy and a national transport plan. Of course, we are talking about construction of the Western Sydney Orbital road in my electorate. The Western Sydney Orbital covers a number of electorates in Western Sydney. Since this government came to office, they have continually delayed the major announcement of the Transport and Regional Services portfolio until they have found themselves losing support in the bush because of their broken promises on the GST and on petrol. 
The government has only now announced this $1.2 billion of taxpayers' money to be spent in rural, regional and metropolitan areas of Australia. I do not begrudge the $850 million going to the rural areas, nor the $350 million going to metropolitan areas throughout Australia. What I did find offensive is, as I brought to the attention of the Speaker last Tuesday when I read it in Sydney's Daily Telegraph, a comment about how fortunate the electorate of Prospect was because the electorate of Prospect was going to receive over a four-year term the sum of $13-odd million. I could have got up in my electorate and said, `I'm a very hardworking member'—of course, my electorate believe that anyway—and taken the credit for that $13.2 million. But, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you and every other member of this House would be aware, we then got a breakdown from the minister's office on what was happening with the distribution of these funds. When you go to the breakdown of this $13.2 million over four years coming to the seat of Prospect, you find the one sum of $13.2 million is coming to seven federal electorates in Western Sydney. I went right through the listing to see whether I was perhaps exaggerating when I first read it. Of course I was not. I found that Blacktown City Council receives $4.877 million over four years, which is wonderful for that city. It is one of the largest cities in Western Sydney and one of the largest cities in Australia with the population that it has to cater for. But I share that money. The member for Greenway has it included in his electorate as well. I went further and found that it is the same money that the member for Lindsay, the Minister for Sport and Tourism, has for her electorate. The Penrith City Council has $3,637,225 for the Roads to Recovery Program. Again, I share it. I have that amount for my electorate of Prospect.
I then went further and decided I would have a look at the seat of Chifley, another close neighbour of mine. Not only did he share with me the Blacktown City Council's and the member for Greenway's sum of $4.877 million but also he shares with me and the member for Lindsay Penrith City Council's $3.637 million. I thought I would go one further and have a look at what is happening in Parramatta. I find that I am sharing with the member for Parramatta and he is sharing with me, as we share with other members around, the same amount of money. We are sharing the Holroyd City Council's sum of $1.473 million. We share Blacktown, Fairfield, Holroyd and Penrith. Then of course there is Reid. Reid has Fairfield, Holroyd, Parramatta and Strathfield.
What I am trying to say is, if we are going to talk about money being distributed, however it is spent, let us have a little bit of honesty in the reporting of it. This is one of the anomalies we have seen in the road program. Local government will welcome any money they possibly can get to assist and help them with their road infrastructure, but we have to have a little bit more honesty when we are talking about every electorate—148 electorates around Australia—and how well off they are going to be, when I find that one amount of money is being shared in seven federal electorates just in my area. I think that is deceitful and, more importantly, it is not telling the electorate at large exactly where the money is being spent. That is the thing I have a problem with. I would like to see a little bit more honesty and a little bit more concern about what is going to happen with road programs in the future.
As we know, $1.2 million has already been allocated, and we have $400 million yet to be spent. I have heard the Prime Minister time and time again talk about where he is going to spend the money in Western Sydney to improve the area, particularly looking at the orbital road. It is a major road. It is a major road announcement we have all been waiting for for a long time in that area. In fact, the only road that now connects the major freeways is the Cumberland Highway. If you travel on it for an hour and a half in the morning and an hour to two hours at night, it is nothing but a parking station. We are talking about growth, we are talking about expansion and we are talking about bringing more and more industry to the west to create more and more jobs. You cannot do that unless you have access to transport. You cannot do that unless you build the infrastructure, and the infrastructure has to be the roads to connect that region. We have the highways—the M4, the M5 and the M2—but there is no interconnection except the Cumberland Highway. If you are not going to build the connections between those areas, you are not going to provide the transport and therefore cater for the area's needs. I think we should be concentrating a little bit more on how we allocate money. 
I was very concerned when the Prime Minister, on radio 4BC on 21 November, only days I might add before this package was announced, stated—and I would like to repeat these words in the House:
I am not giving any secrets away to say that there was already enough in the budget to cover the Western Sydney orbital.
If there was enough money in the budget that has already passed this House to cover the Western Sydney Orbital, one of the questions that I ask, that every council that is waiting for the Western Sydney Orbital would ask and I feel sure that every federal member that feeds into that area is asking is: when is it going to be built and when is the decision going to be made? We have not heard any of that, and that is why I think the Prime Minister needs to be reminded occasionally of exactly what motorists think of him and, more importantly, where he thinks he is going to have to take the money from. If it is already in the budget, why are we not getting some decisions made as to having that Sydney Orbital built? 
The budget, I repeat, was handed down in May. I think the Prime Minister might have a little trouble remembering the date. I would like to remind him that it is now December. I can go through other records and find time and time again of instances when the building of the orbital was announced, yet we have no orbital and still have $400 million in this roads program unallocated. I just wonder whether we are ever going to get a decision from the Prime Minister and from this government as to where we are going to go with the Western Sydney Orbital. We have had a deputation down here from WSROC—the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils—attended by a number of members on both sides in the Western Sydney region. It was certainly a non-political representation. We are all of the one voice. One of the most urgent needs in the infrastructure of roads in the whole area of Western Sydney catering for something like 1.4 million population is the building of that particular road. Without that road we are not going to see further advancement take place at the pace that we would all like it. I have no problem at all with what they are doing in the regional areas but, as I say, when we are looking at metropolitan areas we also have to look at the population and where it is located geographically and, more importantly, we have to look at how those dollars are being distributed. 
I believe that if we are going to stop flood mitigation programs—and we have seen the flooding that has occurred in New South Wales, and we still experience flooding in our metropolitan areas when the creek systems that govern and go through our areas overflow and damage our roads—and if we are going to give local government the money to build the roads, I think we should first correct some of the problems that are being caused by flooding and then maybe we will be able to maintain some decent roads.
I believe the government itself over time has been very quick to deny suggestions that the funding will favour coalition seats or even target the marginal seats in the coalition areas of rural and regional Australia, but one only has to take some time to read those figures again. I know the member for Canberra will not mind me mentioning it, but when I drive around Canberra it seems extraordinary that $20 million has been allocated over a four-year period for the road system here. The seven federal electorates in Western Sydney are going to share over four years $13.2 million, yet here in Canberra something like $20 million has been allocated for the same period. One would have to query the funding decisions that have been made for this area. One would also have to consider how the money is going to be spent and where it is going to be spent. I realise that it is the decision of the councils and I appeal to my councils to make sure the money is spent wisely and well. But, more importantly, I say to the Prime Minister, to the Deputy Prime Minister and to the government that you have to look at the allocation of resources. Infrastructure is an important thing and local governments are crying out for it. More particularly, we must have the means of transporting people and we must get industry moving. Then we will be able to create more jobs. The Western Sydney councils are constantly growing in size. The Western Sydney area of New South Wales is expanding at a rate far exceeding any other local government area around Australia. A number of our councils are here now at a local government conference, and our councils are saying that their need is so great and their populations so large—and, more importantly, the rating structure is not as they would like it—that they need the help of government at all levels. I would appeal to the government to make a decision on the orbital, make a decision on Badgerys Creek and, for goodness sake, start making decisions and spending money where the need is.

"Kelly, Jackie, MP",LP,2000-12-04,"—I seek your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker.
 (Mr Hawker)—Please proceed.
—During question time today a number of assertions were made by opposition members. I undertook to make inquiries and advise the House. I am now in a position to do so. With respect to the election conducted for the Penrith City Council in 1999, I can advise the House that, on 23 September that year, Senator Steve Hutchins, the state President of the ALP in New South Wales, wrote to my colleague the Special Minister of State, Senator Chris Ellison, requesting an investigation into various allegations. I am advised that Senator Ellison referred Senator Hutchins's correspondence to the Australian Electoral Commission. The Australian Electoral Commission referred the complaint to the Australian Federal Police on 15 October 1999. On 3 July 2000, the Australian Federal Police gave the results of their investigation to the Australian Electoral Commission. On the basis of the Australian Federal Police investigation, there was no further action by the Australian Electoral Commission. My colleague the Special Minister of State has today issued a statement outlining the above details.
—Was that ever reported?
—Sit down and shut up.
—And I table a copy of that statement. For the record—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: you have given the minister indulgence. It is not helping the matter if the minister at the table, Mr Tuckey, who is supposed to be in charge of government business here, starts telling the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to shut up. Is that the way we are going to conduct this little exercise or are we going to have the minister just hold his tongue for a while?
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on the point of order: my response was to an interjection that was totally unnecessary in the first instance and—
—Absolutely necessary, and you know it.
—`Absolutely necessary.' You have heard it, Mr Deputy Speaker. All you need to do at this stage of the game is see that there are no interjections from either side.
—Order! The point is upheld and I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition understands that the minister has the call. Therefore, I call the minister. 
—For the record, I draw the attention of the House to a previous statement by my colleague the Special Minister of State relating to allegations regarding the Lindsay by-election in 1996. That statement demonstrated that, following a complaint by the ALP, the matter was referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions on 23 January 1997. On 31 January 1997, the Director of Public Prosecutions provided advice to the Australian Electoral Commission. The Australian Electoral Commission decided not to proceed with the matter any further. I table a copy of the statement from my colleague to this effect. 
With respect to allegations relating to a former staff member, I have now had the opportunity to speak to him, and I advise the House as follows. He worked for me from December 1996 until earlier this year when he left to work in the private sector. The circumstances are that when he first came to work for me he lived at West Lindfield. This is a considerable distance from my electorate office in Penrith, and it was clearly impracticable for him to commute on a daily basis. Accordingly, because I had a residence which I was already sharing with a former RAAF colleague and had spare accommodation, he began living there and enrolled in Lindsay. He told me after question time today that he remained on the roll in Lindsay until October 1998. Until my conversation with him this afternoon, we had never discussed details of his electoral enrolment.
 Following a media report on this evening's news, I should also advise the House that I have absolutely no knowledge of alleged printing of how-to-vote cards of a candidate who ran under the name the Grim-Reaper at the time of the Lindsay by-election. Earlier this evening, that candidate provided my office with a copy of the how-to-vote cards he alleges were produced for him. In his own handwriting he annotated names of candidates he alleges preferenced me as part of some anonymous deal.
Vicki Aird's campaign manager was a member of the Labor Party. She did not preference me before Ross Free. Rodney Franich was the candidate for the Shooters Party, and it is a matter of public record that he also preferenced Ross Free before me. Brian Grigg, the candidate for Call to Australia, did preference me. Such a preference is not exactly unusual, given the values of the Call to Australia Party. Kay Vella is, in my experience, a person of the utmost personal integrity who has had a consistent public stance of opposition to a second airport at Badgerys Creek. Given the former Labor government's attitude on this issue, her preference decision is also not surprising. I table a copy of the how-to-vote card provided by the candidate who called himself the Grim-Reaper.
—Mr  Deputy Speaker, I seek indulgence.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. There is no indulgence entitled to a member of the opposition when a minister adds to an answer, which is what the minister has just done.
—The point of order is upheld. There is no indulgence in regard to that reason.
— I move:
That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Deputy Leader of the Opposition from responding to the Minister for Sport and Tourism. 
I move this motion fundamentally on this basis: firstly, why was the AFP report never reported back and, secondly, why did this question of abuse—

"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,2000-12-04,"—I rise to talk tonight on the Roads to Recovery Bill 2000. I would like to welcome $16.75 million to shires in the electorate of Blair. That money, a Howard government initiative, comes from the Roads to Recovery Program—something I think that all members on both sides of the House would welcome. It turns my mind to thinking about what great things can be done with that kind of money, when we talk about local roads.
In my electorate we have the shires of Kilcoy, Kingaroy, Nanango, Esk, Gatton, Laidley and Rosalie, as well as the City of Ipswich. We have all kinds of needs across that area for this money. Certainly, when it comes the Kingaroy Shire, I am sure the councillors will be looking at developing the tourism industry, particularly wine tourism which is really on the go. In particular, we have many difficult dirt country roads that serve those cellar door locations, and I think it would be a great opportunity to be able to use some of this money to assist the developing wine tourism industry in the Kingaroy Shire.
Turning to the Nanango Shire, we have many small roads across that area—an entire network of roads—that deal with small communities and small holdings, and once again we have many underdeveloped dirt roads that require the expenditure that we can now undertake with money contributed through the Roads to Recovery Program. Another point that I would like to raise in relation to the Nanango shire is that, for many months now, heavy trucks have been regularly sent from Ipswich up to the Tarong power station in the Nanango area to provide it with the sort of coal they need to be able to keep the power station running. They use what they call `environmental coal', which comes from the Ipswich district, to keep the emissions from the power station down. All that transportation of coal by road is a real burden on local residents and a real burden on the roads themselves because those roads are being pounded by the coal trucks. There is an opportunity here for the shires, should they so desire, to contribute some of their money towards what is in fact a state road, the D'Aguilar Highway, and to provide that road with some extra support to meet the demands placed on it by all these coal trucks roaring up and down to supply the Tarong power station.
I should also mention the Esk Shire Council. In Esk, we have recently seen evidence of good cooperation between the state and Commonwealth governments. That area was very badly affected by the floods we had at the beginning of not this year but last year, when a great number of bridges along the Brisbane River were wiped out, absolutely destroyed by heavy flooding. Good cooperation between the state and federal governments resulted in those bridges being rebuilt to a very high standard. In fact, I was speaking today with the Mayor of Esk Shire, and she told me that they have been able to replace the timber bridges with concrete structures that will be of long-term advantage to the whole Brisbane valley, and that is of course very welcome news there. The Esk Shire now is in a position to be able to use some of the money from the Roads to Recovery Program to develop some of the networks that link with those new bridges and to provide support to local farming communities and also to the tourism industry which is developing around the Wivenhoe and Somerset dams.
I should also mention in passing the Kilcoy Shire, which has a great deal of difficulty with many dirt and unmade roads that are at times quite rough. This money will assist the shire with the upkeep of those roads. For example, the back road from Linville to Nanango is quite rough but it is very important to people in the Mount Stanley area who use it regularly. Funds are being channelled in that direction through the Roads to Recovery Program, and that is just one example of how the money can be used very effectively. Roads in quite remote areas such as Stockyard Creek in the Gatton Shire are under a lot of pressure and that shire will certainly welcome the moneys being provided through the Roads to Recovery Program.  
We have seen roads in Laidley Shire with completely substandard drainage that turn into rivers when it rains. We need sufficient money to overcome those sorts of problems, and we will be able to do that only through schemes such as the Roads to Recovery Program. Another example is the Rosalie shire and the Blackbutt to Crows Nest road and the road through Anduramba. Some dirt roads in that area are washed out every time it rains. We will now be able to do something about culverts and provide a good, graded surface to support the people in that area.
The Ipswich City Council area is quite significant because it is part of the growing Brisbane greater metropolitan area. All kinds of feeder roads in that area bring traffic both to the Ipswich motorway and to the new road out through Springfield, which provides an alternative route for people commuting from Ipswich to Brisbane. While there has been some recent work on the road through Springfield—which, as I said, provides a very good traffic route from Ipswich to Brisbane—we now need improved feeders to take people to that road. Each one of the shires that I have mentioned has an established and prioritised list of road works. We are providing $16.75 million to shires in the electorate of Blair, which will allow them to go that much further down their priority list when allocating that extra money. 
The program is welcomed by every single shire in my electorate. I have spoken to each mayor and every one is absolutely thrilled with their allocations from the Commonwealth. I cannot understand some of the strange comments by members opposite. Before the recent fracas, I was listening to the member for Prospect complaining about the fact that the Blacktown council area had been mentioned in relation to a number of different electorates. The fact is that there is only one Blacktown council—I am not from Sydney, but I know that. If members cannot figure out for themselves which Blacktown council the government is referring to, they should go home—they should not be here. 
I have looked at the boundary surrounding the electorate of Blair and noted the areas that will receive money under this program. Some $40.4 million is being allocated to the electorate of Oxley, which will share in the allocation for the city of Brisbane. Some $28.6 million will be made available to the electorate of Ryan, which is basically the Brisbane City Council allowance. Ryan lies totally within the Brisbane City Council area, so I do not know what the government could say apart from, `Refer to the Brisbane City Council allocation'. Dickson will receive $32.8 million, and the member for Dickson cannot complain because she will be getting a share of the quite significant Brisbane City Council moneys. The electorate of Longman will receive $7.5 million. Wide Bay will receive $19.1 million; Maranoa, $51.3 million; and Forde, $22.5 million. All those electorates bordering the electorate of Blair are doing extremely well under this program.
I state here and now my support for this wonderful program, which is long overdue. The Roads to Recovery Program is aptly named—it suits the purpose to which the government has put it—and I call on opposition members to support it 100 per cent.",REPS,<title>ROADS TO RECOVERY BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2000-12-04,"—I am very pleased that the member who has just resumed his seat is very happy with all the road funding going to his shires, and I am sure that all his shires are happy—although not as happy as he thinks they are. While local government will always be pleased to receive more money—if it is offered, of course—one wonders what this government is really doing. Is this a cover-up for its concern at the extent of community feeling about the cost of petrol?
There was a very interesting debate about road funding on the radio the other day. It took place with the announcement being made about the buckets of money that were to be rolled out—which were perceived as being a sop for not freezing the excise on the GST. The figure announced came out as `$1.6 billion extra in road funding'. Presumably that meant that all of the extra money that had gone to the federal budget would be spent on roads and that perhaps it was a compromise come to by this government for people having to pay the GST on fuel. But then the next line said that it would be over four years. So here lies the rub. There will be an amount of $400 million a year, and the government is getting an extra $1.5 or $1.6 billion. That means that this government is keeping three-quarters of that money. That does not sound reasonable to me. It was thought to be a con job by a number of the commentators then—and I am sure they still believe that now. It will average out to be only $40 million a year. This is a classic pork-barrelling exercise, as those commentators have said. 
What that really means is that the government is putting money into the electorates that give it the best chance of winning at the next election. Mr Deputy Speaker, you only have to guess at whose electorates will get the biggest boost—and surprise, surprise, there is the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, who is also the Leader of the National Party—a trouble spot, I understand, these days. His electorate will get one of the top allocations: a whopping $42.3 million.
It does appear that some of our parliamentary colleagues on the government side do rather better than those on the Labor side—and it is not true to say that these are the electorates that are the most needy in the regional areas. Perhaps some of the most needy areas with regard to road maintenance are those on the fringes of the bigger urban areas, where roads have been neglected for years and there has been a failure to recognise certain roads as national roads.
The report on regional Australia Time running out highlighted the plight of regional Australian roads; it made a number of significant recommendations dealing with regional infrastructure, roads being one part of that infrastructure. There does not seem to be any proper provision for assisting with the specific repairs of bridges and culverts; new truck weights have not been considered in much of the planning; and there needs to be a national policy to deal with the general usage of roads, as well as the linkages of roads with other transport systems.
The motor car is the ordinary person's freedom, enabling them to live in places where it was not possible before. This has allowed industry to move out and labour to be more footloose; and people's independence from mass transport has been a part of Australia's culture. But technology changes and then that independence becomes skewed to those who have money. Whereas a few cents on petrol is nothing for those who earn $75,000 a year—and many of those who work in management in local government earn more than the average person—the cost of petrol is of enormous importance to those on low incomes, such as young families, and those on fixed incomes, such as retired people, single women, et cetera. These people may only use a vehicle for recreational time or for vital trips where there is no public transport. They are the people who are hurting with the price of petrol as it is.
Although at first glance the figures for the Lyons electorate in Tasmania seem reasonable, when you see who gets what and why, there are a number of questions to ask. Apart from anything else, it is just not enough. One of my mayors on the west coast of Tasmania, Mayor Darryl Gerrity, was scathing in his assessment of the funding. Councillor Gerrity said that it was disappointing but completely predictable, knowing that the State Grants Commission was involved. Gerrity said that it was stated at the weekend that it would be needs based, but needs were never considered; it was worked out by someone in Canberra with a calculator. I really have to agree with him: I do not think need came into it at all.
The government's letter advising of these grants stated that we have even got to have a network or series of signs basically saying how good this is. There are signs all over the place from previous federal government road programs. Apart from being an environmental nightmare and a traffic hazard, they are useless bits of information. When one is driving along the road looking for a nonexistent direction sign, who cares who paid for the road?
Anyhow, the government has made its decision. This funding is obviously a sweetener aimed at trying to suppress the anger of motorists because of the broken promise on the price of petrol and the GST. But, on that score, I believe it has failed dismally. Individuals—and they are the ones who vote, not the councils—are still having to pay too high a price for their petrol. They will not be able to afford to use the roads. It is a good pork-barrelling exercise and it does not cut with the electorates. They see it as a con—and that is what it is. Yes, there is a case for increased local road funding—but not just local road funding. What about railways and ports? What about road safety and the issues surrounding road accidents? Where the program is weakest is that there is still no national infrastructure and transport plan. That is the problem with pork-barrelling: you do not want to have an overall plan because that takes away your right to fiddle around the edges and to manipulate the political system—and that is what the Prime Minister is all about. 
Yes, we need local road funding, but the government should face up to its responsibilities for a national transport plan. More importantly, the Prime Minister should understand that the Australian electorate is not stupid. People are not to be bought off. The amendment put by the shadow minister for this area, Martin Ferguson, shows the bill for the sham that it is. It fails to help those people who most need the fuel prices to be kept at an affordable rate. The goods and services tax has hit low income people in thousands of ways. This is one of the worst. We will have no national strategy for infrastructure development to deal with the thousands of changes that have occurred in both funding and technology. We desperately need such a strategy, particularly the development of a national transport plan that includes all means of transport. Australia is lagging so far behind other nations it is laughable. Our infrastructure status is holding back development in this country. 
Government's role is to provide the means by which the private sector can develop our economy—the interface between government and private money. This role is clearly not on the agenda of this government; the government are failing to assist business and industry build that infrastructure. The government ought to be exposed for the frauds that they are. It is all a matter of personal gain—keeping personal power—not the greater good of the country. I can only support wholeheartedly the substance of the amendment despite the fact that any money being given to rural and regional areas has to be a plus even if it is only a drop in the ocean of need.",REPS,<title>ROADS TO RECOVERY BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Barresi, Phillip, MP",LP,2000-12-04,"—It is a great pleasure to be able to speak on the Roads to Recovery Bill 2000, an initiative by the coalition of $1.6 billion. That is the coalition's response to the need for urgent expenditure on Australia's local roads. The government understands the importance of local roads to the economy and to social amenity.
In listening to the member for Lyons, I could not help but feel sorry for him, because he is actually caught between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, he has to put out the lines that his leadership team have asked him to put out on this bill, and that is to complain that it is not enough, that it is pork-barrelling. On the other hand, he has to welcome the measure because he knows that the contribution of his own state government, the government of the state he represents, is actually—what is it, member for Lyons? Zilch! It is absolutely zero. Here he is. He has to support this bill, because, unless he supports it, the local governments in Tasmania will be the losers. On the other hand, he cannot support it too much because his leadership team will say, `You have to toe the line and somehow confect a rage.' In his speech, the member for Lyons struggled to be very sincere about his opposition to the bill. It was one of those speeches that you know the person just does not mean. Of course he does not. Every member in this chamber, if they go around and do polling in their electorates, if they go out and do doorknocking, knows that one of the consistent messages that comes out, whether they are in country Tasmania or suburban Melbourne—wherever they may be—concerns the state of the roads. Often the complaint is very much one that can be dealt with only by the local council, whether it be a speed hump, a controlled intersection, a black spot—which we can now deal with through the Black Spot Program—or a pedestrian crossing here and there. It is a consistent message, particularly from the elderly and those who rely on their cars to travel to work or to the local shopping centre, to pick up their kids from school, to drop their kids off at school or to use their cars for the various activities which are required in living in suburban and regional Australia. 
I know that in Deakin this is a most welcome bill. I know it is going to be a most welcome bill in the electorate of Bruce—neighbouring the electorate of Deakin—which is the electorate represented by the parliamentary secretary to the shadow minister for health, who is at the table. I also know it will be welcome down in Tasmania. People there recognise that the state of our roads requires urgent attention. In Deakin we have been winners out of this package. It is very gratifying to see the Commonwealth's contribution to the two councils that make up the electorate of Deakin. 
Through this announcement, over the next four years the Roads to Recovery Bill will provide $1.2 billion in additional funding to local councils for local roads. This funding, it must be recognised, is over and above the current Commonwealth local road funding. It is an investment in Australia's roads has been made possible by the coalition's sound economic management. The member for Lyons talks about pork-barrelling and perhaps appeasing our conscience about the petrol tax. There will be a lot of motorists out there who will say, `If we have to put up with higher than normal petrol prices due to the fluctuations in the world market and the fluctuations in the Australian dollar, at least let me feel I am making a contribution to my roads.' We are making a contribution through $1.6 billion, $1.2 billion of that going into local councils and the other $400 million being additional funding for major arterial roads, roads of national importance and national highways. 
It has been brought about, as I mentioned, by the coalition's sound economic management. We are now in a stronger budgetary position that allows the government to return a dividend to the whole community through the substantial investment package. Of the $1.2 billion, $250 million has been allocated to Victoria. Once again we can look at the state government's contribution. It is a little more than the contribution the Tasmanian state government is making to local councils. The contribution of the Bracks government, the government that is heralded as the people's government, is $14 million to local council roads.
I say to the local councils, `Why are you letting the Bracks government off the hook? Why are you allowing them to pull the wool over your eyes over road funding that should be allocated to you?' It is not as if the state government of Victoria does not have the finances. The money is there. We have been told about how cash rich they are. It would be great if they could make an increased contribution to our local roads, because I certainly have a list of roads a mile long that they could start working on. 
The two councils in Deakin, the Maroondah City Council and the Whitehorse City Council, have been big winners out of this obviouslynot in the same proportions as those in regional Australia but, even though I am a suburban member of parliament and I have the interests of the suburbs at heart and as some of us on this side often say, suburban toil is well and truly alive in Melbourne, I do recognise that regional Australia has a much larger need. Their roads really have been in disrepair. Essentially they were built in the 1950s if not the 1940s and they have been going downhill rapidly since those days. 
Maroondah City Council will receive just over $1.9 million over the next four years. It is an increase in their funding of $483,659 in the next financial year at least. That is a welcome boost to those people in Ringwood who will be smothered or choked by the traffic that will be coming out of the Eastern Freeway once it is finished being built in 2005. The City of Whitehorse will be receiving just over $2.5 million over the next four years, and in the next financial year $648,496. The additional allocation of funds will enable these two councils to bring forward numerous projects that are currently on their capital budgets. It will make a real difference to their existing plans to construct, maintain and improve roads. One of the councils recently told me that their five-year out plans will be halved by the Roads to Recovery Program. That is great news for the local residents. It is great news to know that a road that is projected not to be even looked at for the next five years can be brought forward and perhaps be attended to within the next two or three years. They will be able to see, for example, extra funding going into their local roads, in terms of reconstruction, kerbing, undertaking major repairs, resurfacing, building roundabouts, measures to slow traffic down and pedestrian crossings. I urge all Deakin residents, if you have a road that you believe has not been attended to for whatever reason, to make sure you go out there and put it to the council for their consideration. At the end of the day it still has to pass the criteria and still has to go through the council's own priority listing, but put it to the council because they certainly cannot turn around and say, `We just don't have the funds.' Sure, they might say, `We'd like more money,' but I would say there wouldn't be a council in Australia that would ever say that what they had received was enough. There will always be a need to have even more. So go out there. Nominate projects for urgent attention. For my part, as the member for Deakin, I will be reviewing these road plans and asking the council from time to time to give me feedback on the progress of the projects. 
In the last minute or so that I have available, in order to facilitate continuing debate on this topic, can I simply say one other thing. The $400 million that has been allocated as extra contribution to the development of arterial links in outer metropolitan areas is welcome out in the east. We have had a proposed road that has been discussed and debated and raised in parliament by me and my colleagues the member for Dunkley and the member for Aston on numerous occasions as well as in the party room. We have met with three roads ministers since 1996. I am referring to the Scoresby Transport Corridor. We have been strong advocates of this project and we look forward to Peter Batchelor, the state Minister for Transport in Victoria, making sure that he crosses the t's and dots the i's, completes the design project and starts actually allocating money in the state budget. If the state government is really serious about the project and not simply pulling the wool over the eyes of the people in the east by saying, `We approve the concept,' then the efforts of the federal members in the eastern suburbs will be enhanced. We will continue to go in to bat not only for the eight councils affected by the Scoresby Transport Corridor but more importantly for the people in the area who have been calling for a link between Ringwood and Frankston for many years. It is a project which does need funding, which does need support, and I look forward to that part of the allocation in the Roads to Recovery Program considering the Scoresby Transport Corridor as a priority road for development in Victoria.",REPS,<title>ROADS TO RECOVERY BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Livermore, Kirsten, MP",ALP,2000-12-04,"—I am supporting this bill this evening, but not as the Minister for Transport and Regional Services might like me to. I am supporting it in the same vein as one of my local council representatives. His response to the funding when we had a conversation about it last week was, `It's better than a poke in the eye with a burnt stick.' That is a pretty fair assessment of this Roads to Recovery package and what it contains for regional and rural Australia. It is the reason that the Labor Party is supporting the bill but also taking the opportunity through our second reading amendment to highlight the issues and opportunities that the bill and the government's new roads package leave unaddressed—things like the high price of petrol and diesel in regional and rural Australia and the failure of the government to compensate motorists for the effect of the GST on fuel prices; the failure to develop a national strategy for infrastructure, particularly in the area of transport; and the overall neglect and lack of interest that this government has shown towards regional development and infrastructure over its five years in office. 
Of course, local councils are pleased to receive more funding to help with the enormous job of keeping their road infrastructure up to scratch. It is the assistance they have been calling out for for five years, ever since this government's first king hit to rural and regional Australia when the bush paid for Peter Costello's surplus in the 1996 budget. He is now telling us that the surplus is up to $4.3 billion—and we are still paying in the bush through higher fuel taxes and a continued withdrawal of services. When you look at the $22 million of road funding announced for Capricornia in that light, you can understand that the general reaction of councils has been `Thanks, but ...'. The `but' refers to the years when councils have struggled along in an environment of neglect and indifference from the federal government. The federal government's belated concern for local councils is welcome, but it is hard not to be sceptical about its motives and timing. The `but' also refers to the opportunities missed in this funding package. Infrastructure is an essential factor in regional development and the future prosperity and quality of life of a place like Central Queensland. That is why we need a long-term strategic approach to planning and developing infrastructure. It is an approach that has to involve local councils identifying their needs and opportunities so that transport links and other infrastructure are designed for maximum economic and social benefits and not for maximum votes.
I was at a community forum in the town of Moranbah last Monday when the details of the road package were released to the various councils in my electorate. Many of the rural councils of the region were represented at the forum. Part of the forum was for the councils and other members of the communities to sit down and identify the strengths and weaknesses of our region, as well as the support needed to make the most of our opportunities in the future. Naturally, road priorities came up in the context of that discussion. The main priority is the roads that link up—or, more accurately at the moment, fail to link up—the mining communities.
The shires of Nebo, Bowen and Belyando all stressed the importance of the roads linking the mines and communities from Collinsville in the north through to Glenden and Nebo and down to Moranbah in the south. I have spoken previously in the House about the Cerito-Newlands road, and that is a big part of this link. A road linking those communities and mines would make it much easier for miners to access employment from a number of coalmines, as well as allow easier access to services for them and their families. It would help to encourage people to stay living in the mining communities and keep those towns viable. Those linking roads identified in the northern end of the Bowen Basin would also be a boost for tourism in the area. Currently, there are too many roads to nowhere—roads that finish at a particular mining town and do not link up—whereas it is a quite spectacular area with a beautiful environment which would be an attractive alternative route for tourists visiting the area, who are currently restricted to only the coastal road. If there were a reliable road through that area, I am sure that it would attract a lot of attention from tourists.
As I understand it, the emphasis on local roads in this government package would not fund the creation or upgrading of those roads that would create the strategic links for those small related communities—links that could bring those communities closer together in a practical way and allow each of them to benefit as individual communities from the growth and development occurring in other parts of their immediate region. For example, one council told me that the money would allow them to fix some existing local roads and address problem areas, such as sections of road that get boggy and cause problems for cattle trucks in the wet season. So that is why I say, `Thanks, but ...' Yes, it is good that councils in my area will be given assistance to repair local roads. But, after listening to the same councils and knowing that they have sat down and strategically analysed their infrastructure needs in terms of capitalising on their future opportunities, it is still very disappointing that the federal government has not taken regional development seriously enough to do the same thing. 
Another road in my electorate that I would like to mention specifically is the Aramac-Torrens Creek Road in the west of my electorate. The road is a 270-kilometre link from Aramac to Torrens Creek and, as such, creates a link between the Landsborough Highway and the Flinders Highway between Townsville and Mount Isa. At present less than 100 kilometres of the road is sealed. The Aramac Shire Council, together with other councils along the route of the road, is anxious for the road to be sealed to give residents of Aramac and the wider Central West a quick and reliable route to Townsville, as well as opening up the other economic benefits that such a link would bring. The council is concerned that the Roads to Recovery package may not allow for the funding to be applied to the Aramac-Torrens Creek Road because it is not a local road. I know that representatives of the council are in Canberra this week and will be seeking clarification of that point so that the council can continue the upgrading work on the Aramac-Torrens Creek Road. I hope that the minister can reassure the council that the scheme is flexible enough to accommodate the priorities determined by the council and the people of Aramac.
My response to this bill might be different if we were in a situation where the government had developed a strong and strategic policy for infrastructure and development in regional Australia, including Central Queensland, and if this particular package were just a bit of a top-up filling in some gaps. But, when this is the pinnacle of the government's achievements or aspirations for regional and rural Australia, I have to say that it is too little, too late. My response to this bill is similar to the reactions that I have picked up anecdotally around my electorate: `Thanks for the funding, but ...' Thanks, but where has your commitment to regional and rural Australia been for the last five years? Thanks, but how about taking infrastructure policy and planning seriously and involving local governments in a long-term process with strategic objectives and outcomes? Thanks, but there are strategic infrastructure needs that are outstanding in Central Queensland. And, finally, thanks but we still have not forgotten about your government's broken promise on the GST and fuel, so you are still not off the hook for high fuel prices in my part of Queensland.",REPS,<title>ROADS TO RECOVERY BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Gash, Joanna, MP",LP,2000-12-04,"—I am very happy to rise and speak on the Roads to Recovery Bill 2000 which will allow local councils all over Australia to do much needed extra work on their own roads, not just this year but for the next four years. There are three local governments in my own electorate of Gilmore: the Kiama Municipal Council, the Wingecarribee Shire Council and the Shoalhaven City Council. Each of them has plenty of work on roads in their local area, given the funding, as we all know that roads in most of the council areas have reached their use-by dates. That is probably true of all Australia. The three councils have very different road funding needs from one another. The Kiama Municipal Council has a high rate base and a smaller geographical area than the other two. Its urban roads are generally in good condition, and this is because the council has been able to efficiently manage its resealing program over the last 15 years.
However, there are some rural and regional roads that would certainly benefit from this extra funding. Obviously no council has had time to develop a plan for spending the extra funding as yet. The roads I am talking about now are the kinds of roads that would most likely be in contention for receiving the benefit of the extra funding from this government. I know that Kiama's first thought would probably be for road safety. These roads could include the Jamberoo Mountain Road, which already has a safety audit done on it and needs guardrails and other work. The Saddleback Mountain Lookout Road also needs guard rails. The sort of roads with resealing needs might include the Sand Track—or, as it is known, the Crooked River Road—from Berry Beach Road to the Seven Mile camping area.
Then, of course, there are rural roads that have not yet been sealed. Roads in this category could include Mitchells Lane at Rose Valley or Wallaby Hill Road and Burra Creek Road at Jamberoo. Of course, there are also traffic facilities that could do with some extra funding, and these too would have a road safety element in their construction. They could include the proposed roundabout for the intersection of Allowrie and Churchill roads in Jamberoo, especially as the plan for this has already been basically approved by the RTA. Safety aspects at Kiama Primary School and Minnamurra Primary School could also be addressed. Kiama Municipal Council has an extra $174,453 per year to spend specifically on local roads, totalling almost an extra $700,000 over the four years of this program. This is in addition to the $1 million provided in the federal government's financial assistance grants over the same period. 
Wingecarribee Shire has a much lower rate base than Kiama and covers a significantly larger area. Consequently, it has not been possible for this council to even consider getting all of its roads up to the standard it would like. With careful management, Wingecarribee Shire Council has made the best of a very difficult job. I was a councillor on the Wingecarribee Shire Council for five years and participated in many of those decisions, and I know just how hard the engineers and planners have tried to extract maximum value out of every dollar. Wingecarribee Shire Council will receive $680,549 extra per year for the next four years, totalling over $2.7 million extra in local road funding all-up. This is on top of the FAGs over the same period of almost $3.8 million.
The kinds of roads in the Wingecarribee shire that might be in contention for the extra funding are Belmore Falls Road in Robertson and Tugalong Road in Canyonleigh, which have a length and usage that could make them a priority. Belmore Falls Road in Robertson is a major tourism trail and is also used by many locals. Residents have been calling for its upgrade for over 10 years. Mr Archer last Sunday pointed out to me and to state member Peta Seaton the condition of this road, which has almost disintegrated along its edges. Tugalong Road in Canyonleigh is well known for its numerous rollovers, where drivers have lost control at speed on its gravel surface. There are large housing developments right along this road and the traffic is increasing dramatically. Village roads that might also have a high ranking would be Wildes Meadow Road and Nowra Road between Moss Vale and Robertson. Roads in commercial areas that may attract the extra funding could include Erith Street in Bundanoon and Station and Boolwey streets in Bowral.
Shoalhaven City Council is the largest of the local government areas in Gilmore. Over 60 per cent of its land is owned by State Forests, National Parks and Wildlife Service and other like authorities, with a consequent difficult rate base. This means that the council does not get rates for much of the land in its boundaries, which makes it difficult to fund major items like roads. However, the Shoalhaven City Council, just like the others, has made a considerable effort to ensure a sound plan of road management continues each year, despite funding difficulties. One of the exacerbating problems is that many of the 49 towns and villages that make up the Shoalhaven are on the coast at the end of long stretches of road off the Princes Highway. Shoalhaven City Council will receive an extra $1.2 million per year for local road funding. This is an extra $4.8 million over the four years, on top of the FAGs over the same period of over $6.6 million. Council is very excited and pleased with the government's announcement on the additional road funding.
It is a major infusion of funds to local government, gives council an opportunity to respond to a number of very critical issues in terms of its bridge and road network and will allow these projects to be brought forward for funding and for council to provide a far better service to the city. Council has a number of existing timber bridges that have reached the end of their lives, which require the spending of $900,000 per annum over the next five years. One such project is the Badgee Bridge at Sussex Inlet, and the provision of this funding by the federal government will allow the council to consider bringing this project forward. Shoalhaven council is also looking at upgrading a number of roads that have deteriorated. These could include the road from the Princes Highway to Huskisson, Sussex Inlet Road, Coolangatta Road between Shoalhaven Heads and Berry and St Vincent Street in Ulladulla. 
All the councils in Gilmore are very happy to have this funding. Make no mistake, it matters not what political flavour they are. We are all working together to get the best value out of the Roads to Recovery funding. This federal government's initiative is the best thing since sliced bread in our area. Roads and their conditions are constant topics amongst the locals and a constant headache for local government. I welcome the Roads to Recovery Bill and commend the minister and his department for providing just what this country needs. Next for Gilmore, of course, we shall be continuing to call on the state government to fund Main Road 92 and we shall be continuing our push for the North Kiama Bypass to be declared a road of national importance.
The Labor state member, Mr Wayne Smith, today put out a press release. Does he say, `Thank you for the funding'? No. He whinges and gripes. He wants the federal government to do this; he wants the federal government to do that. Nothing is enough. But does he call on his own state Labor government and say, `Come on, Mr Scully, let's build Main Road 92'? No, not him. He calls on us to give more funding, when we have already put a whole lot of funding into areas that are not even the federal government's responsibility. So I say to Mr Wayne Smith: get back in your box. Try and do some of your own work instead of calling on us to do it all for you.",REPS,<title>ROADS TO RECOVERY BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Hoare, Kelly, MP",ALP,2000-12-04,"—My colleagues speaking before me have welcomed the extra $1.2 billion for local roads coming from the federal government, but we must question why Australia needs a Roads to Recovery Program. We need a Roads to Recovery Program because, over the last five years, this government has decimated the infrastructure, services and living standards of all Australians in regional Australia. Australia has seen five years of neglect in infrastructure and regional development. We have seen the government's refusal to act on the withdrawal of regional services—that is, government services—and the closure of banks. We have seen the government's broken promise on petrol prices, we have seen cuts to local government and community jobs programs and we have seen massive cuts to social policy and attempts to run down our public schools and hospitals. Over the past five years, this government has completely neglected infrastructure and regional development. Over 12 months ago, the Institution of Engineers produced a report card on Australia's infrastructure which slammed this government's record in relation to infrastructure and slammed the government for failing to provide leadership in this area.
If we go to the allocation of the Roads to Recovery funding, nine out of the 10 electorates which received the most funding from this program are held by Liberal-National Party members. The division which tops this list is none other than the federal division of Gwydir—the division which is represented in this parliament by the Leader of the National Party and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, who announced this policy. I thought that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry was going to introduce this bill when I read in last Thursday's Notice Paper that Mr Truss was introducing `a bill for an act relating to the pig industry'. We have heard a lot about the stench of pigs and the stench of pork about this program, and many others in this debate have spoken of pork-barrelling and the like.
One of the reasons for this, as I have just mentioned, is that nine out of the 10 electorates receiving the most funding are held by Liberal Party or National Party members. We have the announcement of this policy 12 months out from an election and 12 months after that damning report card from the Institution of Engineers about the decimation of regional services in Australia. The government is keeping its options open to make further major announcements regarding roads closer to the federal election. The letter I received from the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and Leader of the National Party says there is:
... an additional $400 million in total over four years from 2001-02 for developing key arterial link roads in outer metropolitan areas. The Government will provide details of this programme next year once it has assessed and prioritised potential projects. 
To me, that reeks of pork-barrelling, and more roads announcements are going to be made by the government much closer to the election to enhance their doomed electoral prospects. As I said, I welcome this road funding, but I emphasise, as many speakers before me have done, the double counting that has been used by the government in relation to the allocation of the funds. Many examples have been provided. I will mention just one that has been provided by the shadow minister for transport and regional services. It says:
The documents reveal that Brisbane Council gets $28.6 million over four years, but that money has been double counted in each of the Federal seats of Bowman, Brisbane, Dickson, Fadden, Griffith, Lilley, Moreton, Oxley, Petrie, Rankin and Ryan.
This is a huge example of double-counting, and it happens to a huge extent not only in the capital cities but also in my own region, the Newcastle-Hunter area. Last Tuesday, after the announcement was made, the front page of the Newcastle Herald had the headline `$44m roads boost'. This was announced by the Hunter based Liberal senator, John Tierney, and it was reported by the Newcastle Herald. I attempted to clarify that position and to say that the good senator as well as the Newcastle Herald double counted those figures and neglected to add up the exact amount that each of those councils was allocated. It took the figures that came from the minister and added those together to come to a figure of $44 million. But, if you actually add together the figures that were allocated to each of the councils in those five federal electorates, they come to $25,789,780. That is almost $19 million less than that proposed by Senator Tierney and reported by the Newcastle Herald. As I said, I tried to clarify the matter with the Newcastle Herald in a letter to the editor on that Tuesday. That has not been published. I clarified it with the political reporter from the Newcastle Herald on Friday. He said, `This will make a good story, Kelly,' but that has not been published. I just wonder where the Newcastle Herald actually lies in its reporting of government policies. Does it want the truth or does it want the double counting propaganda which is coming from this government?
What this country needs, particularly in regional Australia, is the establishment of a national infrastructure advisory council, a council which was announced by the member for Batman. It is an announcement which has been applauded by those with a commitment to Australia's infrastructure and those who will be represented on the advisory council. They are representatives from industry, finance, engineering, planning, academia, local government and regional Australia.
During this debate, there has been a lot of discussion of the formula used to allocate this $1.2 billion to local governments. The government claim to be using a formula developed by Labor in 1991 in relation to state grants. However, they are yet to actually disclose to the opposition and to the public the particular formula that they have used. It is interesting to note that during this period my predecessor, Bob Brown, was the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support. We can have a look at what Labor had in place as part of a national infrastructure strategy at that time. That period saw an expansion of the national roads system from 16,000 kilometres to 18,000 kilometres. That period also saw the construction of the highways linking Adelaide and Sydney, and Melbourne and Brisbane.
The national highway system was an initiative of the Whitlam government, and it meant that all of the major highways linking capital cities were taken completely out of state government budgets when the federal government accepted responsibility for supplying every cent that was spent on construction and maintenance, initially on the 16,000 kilometres of road and eventually on the 18,000 kilometres of road. The results of those policies were dramatic improvements in our roads. We saw dual divided highways, overpasses, cloverleaves and all of the contemporary characteristics of roads which make them both more efficient and safer now. 
As a result of all these improvements in the national highway and road infrastructure, literally thousands of lives were saved. We do not know exactly whose lives those are, but we do know with absolute certainty that they are there. We know that the lives that have been saved are those of our parents, our children, our aunts and our uncles, our friends and our grandparents. While we welcome this extra funding for roads—because it is going to save further lives; it is going to save the lives of our families and our friends—we call on the government to come clean with the formula that has been used to allocate it and to prove to the electorate that they are not pork-barrelling and are not using this to win the next federal election. Then we would be happy to support it.

"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,2000-12-04,"—I have a serious matter to raise in the House tonight and it relates to an important infrastructure project in my electorate which has been ignored by the Howard government, and I am talking about the Pakenham Bypass. The Pakenham Bypass has been identified by all of the municipalities that make up the Gippsland local government network as the key infrastructure priority for the entire Gippsland region.
The Beaconsfield-Pakenham section of the Princes Highway, which is what we are talking about, is the worst accident area in the state. Accidents over the past five years have now grown to more than 100 and are increasing exponentially. The Princes Highway near Army Road in Pakenham has been identified by the RACV as the state's worst accident black spot—48 crashes and seven deaths in five years. This section of the highway is twice as deadly as any comparable road and its accident rate is five times the national average. In the Shire of Cardinia alone, hundreds of families travel to and from schools along the highway in and near Pakenham five days every week, and there is considerable parental concern at the extreme accident risk.
Despite this and the obvious need for this project, we have seen almost no action at all being taken by the Howard government in relation to this project. As I mentioned before, the Gippsland local government network, as the representatives of some 280,000 people, have identified this as the number one infrastructure priority right across the Gippsland region. So this is not something which is not considered seriously by the people in Gippsland or by the people in Pakenham; it is something which is thought of as being our number one priority. Despite this fact, we have seen hardly any attention at all given to this project by the Howard government. And despite the number of people who are increasingly having accidents and even dying on this bit of road, we have seen hardly any attention given to this project by the Howard administration. 
The state government has committed to construct the $200 million Pakenham Bypass on a dollar for dollar basis by 2005. So we have the money from the state government; it is the federal government that is the problem. The current federal government has seen fit to declare the Princes Highway East as a road of national importance but has committed only $30 million as its contribution to funding construction of the bypass, with the completion date estimated to be 2005. Although the documentation we have seen from the Howard government says that there will be a $5 million allocation in 2001-02 and $25 million in 2002-03, nothing has been committed beyond that time. This is obviously something which the Howard government needs to start to take a bit of initiative on and interest in, and I call on it to seriously consider funding this project in the budget to be brought down next year.
I point out that, whilst many people in the Howard government have said, `Oh, look, we are providing money for roads because we are putting money into the so-called Roads to Recovery project,' this is nowhere near enough. I note that the Cardinia Shire at the western end of my electorate has received only a very small amount of money from the federal government under the Roads to Recovery Program. It has received in the order of only $3.7 million over the entire length of the program. The Cardinia Shire is not happy with this at all, and it said in an article in the Pakenham Gazette:
The $3.7 million earmarked for Cardinia Shire over four years as part of the Federal Government's Roads to Recovery Program is not enough, according to chief executive Don Welsh.
	...	...	...
Mr Welsh said the shire had over 1000 kilometres of overloaded local roads and the money would make only a slight impression.
It is amazing that the members opposite think that, by putting a little bit of this money into local roads, that will make up for all of their deficiencies. It has not pleased Cardinia Shire. It has done nothing to address the key infrastructure priority for the Gippsland region—the building of the Pakenham Bypass. I say to the Howard government: let's get serious about roads; let's get serious about key infrastructure priorities for regions like Gippsland and build the Pakenham Bypass.

"Reith, Peter, MP",LP,2000-12-04,"—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
	(1) to (5) The Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business has an extensive and complex online presence which provides a variety of services to the public.  All of these services could be classed as transactions of a sort but some are rather different to the classical definition.  For example, these transactions vary from the availability of information/advices, electronic publications and static information, through to the functionality that exists on the Australian JobSearch site allowing users to search for a vacant position online, and the services the department provides for registering and searching for an ABN on behalf of the Australian Taxation Office.
The number of these transactions is difficult to quantify and forecasts don't exist.  Indeed the type of online transactions are difficult to quantify and not comparable.  While statistics exist for the usage of a particular website, these are based on the number of pages viewed by an individual visiting the site.  
I refer you to my department's recently completed Online Action Plan: http://www.dewrsb.gov.au/department/keyCorporateDocuments/onlineActionPlan/default.asp. The Online Action Plan outlines our achievements and future directions in online service delivery.  It contains details of all the services currently offered via our websites and extranets, and how these will be enhanced.  The Action Plan has identified that over 90% of the department's information is now available online.

These services have been well-received by the public.  Our achievements include over 500,000 Australian Business Number (ABN) registrations received via the Business Entry Point website - over 15 per cent of the total registrations - and over 100 million page views on the Australian JobSearch website during 1999-2000.  Page views for all departmental websites total in excess of 135 million for the same period.   
Alternatives to online service delivery are provided where required.  For example, the Australian JobSearch site lists vacant positions, but these are also available through Job Network member offices.  Similarly, registration for an ABN is available via the Internet, but it is also available directly from the Australian Taxation Office or from accountants via their electronic lodgement systems.  
The total cost of administering the services provided in this environment has not at this stage been fully assessed, however there have been significant savings achieved by the Commonwealth in bringing services online.  For example, with the introduction of the Australian JobSearch system (both web and touchscreen units) there has been greater public access to jobs, with over 50,000 jobs online and over 500,000 actual searches performed per day.  The overall costs involved have also decreased even though the number of physical sites has increased from 500 (under the Commonwealth Employment Service) to over 2100 (Job Network).  These savings would not have been possible without the use of online delivery. 
Given the nature of their services, some of the department's portfolio agencies have been able to provide more specific answers.  These are set out below.
