Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (13:30):  One of the finest traditions that we have in this place is that we welcome kids from schools right around the country. I welcome those who have joined us today in the chamber. I was pleased to see that some of the young Australians got to witness the speech that the Leader of the Opposition gave earlier about higher education which set out some important principles. I was pleased to welcome last week kids from Woodridge North State School, Calamvale Community College and John Paul College from my own community. Many of these kids ask why our democracy matters, and I say, 'It's because it impacts on your lives, and that's why we need to include you, not just in the ceremony of the place but in the substance of our ideas and policies.'


When you go home, your parents might ask you what you saw while you were in Canberra. I think you should tell them that when you came to Canberra you saw one side of politics that wants to fan and feed your ambitions and opportunities and another side of the House that wants to extinguish them—not for all of you, but for some of you. That side wants to make you choose between higher education or a university degree and buying a home or raising a family or starting a small business—not for all of you, but for some of you. This side has a different view. When the time comes to decide whether you want to go to university, we want you to understand that this side wants that decision to be determined by what is in your mind and not what is in your parents' wallets.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (14:00):  My question is to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister promised Australians on at least 14 separate occasions not to make any adverse changes to superannuation. Prime Minister, is not delaying the increase to the superannuation guarantee for more than 8½ million Australians an adverse change for the retirement accounts of all Australians?

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Prime Minister) (14:00):  More confected indignation from an opposition which has made itself irrelevant by refusing to accept the mandate this government won at last year's election.



Opposition members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  There will be silence on my left! The question has been asked. The Prime Minister is entitled to be heard and I will have a general warning.




Mr ABBOTT:
  There are no adverse changes as a result of this because, by delaying the increase in the superannuation guarantee levy, we are keeping more money in workers' pockets. That is exactly what we are doing—keeping more money in workers' pockets. A certain authority, to whom I will come in a moment, said:




… analysis suggests that, over time, superannuation guarantee increases have come out of wages rather than profits—



Who was that, I wonder?




Mr Hockey:
  Bill, it's you.




Mr ABBOTT:
  It was old 'Electricity Bill'. That is who it was. 



Mr Hockey interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The Treasurer will desist.




Mr ABBOTT:
  I have to say not only is this government keeping its commitments but also it is doing the right thing by the workers of Australia.



The SPEAKER:  Before I call the honourable member for Corangamite, I said there is a general warning and, if you are in competition to see who is the first to leave, the choice is up to all of you.




Mr Burke:
  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Given the noise that was coming from that side, is there a reason you are only looking over here when you make a comment like that, because that was unbelievable from that side?



The SPEAKER:  I said it is a general warning. It applies to everybody.

Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (14:12):  My question is to the Prime Minister, and I refer to his previous answer, in which he claimed a mandate for delaying the superannuation guarantee rise by six years. Prime Minister, isn't it the case that your superannuation policy at the last election admitted only a two-year delay in increasing the superannuation guarantee? Prime Minister, isn't it the case that, far from having a mandate, your government has broken a commitment to almost nine million Australians?

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Prime Minister) (14:12):  It is passing strange that members opposite should complain, given that they have frustrated every promise that this government made. They have sought to frustrate this government keeping every promise that it made. There is not a single major policy promise that we made at the election that the opposition has not opposed. So this opposition can hardly complain when every promise that we made pre election has been monumentally frustrated at every turn, and they have made themselves completely and utterly irrelevant by refusing to accept the mandate that the government won.


We took a superannuation guarantee levy pause to the election. That pause has now been implemented. And I remind the Leader of the Opposition of his statement, that the superannuation guarantee levy comes out of wages. So by pausing the operation of the levy, we have helped the workers of this country. And we have got rid of the mining tax. We have seen the back of the mining tax—



Mr Watts interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Gellibrand!




Mr ABBOTT:
  possibly the most foolish tax in the history of our country—a tax that destroyed jobs, a tax that damaged investment, a tax which cost money and a tax which did not raise any revenue. Well, it is gone, thanks to this government—no thanks to the opposition.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (14:41):  My question is to the Prime Minister. Why did the Prime Minister team up with Clive Palmer to kill the schoolkids bonus, the low-income superannuation tax breaks and the income support bonus, and to delay superannuation for almost nine million Australians? Is the Prime Minister proud of the dirty deal he has done with Clive Palmer that will injure millions of Australian families?

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Prime Minister) (14:42):  All the measures that we have, in the words of the Leader of the Opposition, 'teamed up with Clive Palmer to implement' are promises that we took to the election. They are all commitments that we took to the election.


Let's consider what this opposition is doing. First of all they are complaining that we do not keep commitments and now they are complaining that we do keep commitments! They cannot have it both ways. What we are seeing is the futile roaring of an opposition which has dealt itself out of making a serious contribution to the government of this country. It is an opposition which has made itself a relevant by refusing to accept the mandate that this government won at the election.


This government is determined to implement its policies. We are determined to implement our policies for the betterment of our nation and we are determined to work with other political parties who recognise the mandate that we won to do the right thing by the people of this country. We will deliver. We will work with the parliament, the people elected, to deliver on our commitments to the Australian people.

The SPEAKER:  I call the honourable member from Ryan.




Mr Shorten:
  Speaker—



The SPEAKER:  Does the Leader of the Opposition have a point of order?




Mr Shorten:
  No. I seek leave to move the following motion:


That this House condemns the Prime Minister for:


(1) Violating the trust of the Australian people;—



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition! I had given the call to the member for Ryan and I have given acknowledgement—



Opposition members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  There will be silence! I gave the call to the Leader of the Opposition after giving the call to the member for Ryan, asking him if he had a point of order. He said no and that he wished to move a motion. So we will take the member for Ryan first and then he can move his motion.




Mr Burke:
  Speaker, I rise on a point of order. You asked the Leader of the Opposition whether he had a point of order. He said he did not and continued to ask leave. You did not withdraw the call at that point. He continued to have the call while he sought leave. You have to allow him to conclude asking for leave before the call goes to someone else. You cannot deny the call midway through someone seeking leave.




Mr Shorten:
  Madam Speaker, if I may be of assistance to the House. Whilst I agree with the Manager of Opposition Business, we can wait another four minutes; it does not change the violation of trust by this Prime Minister.

The member for Lingiari then left the chamber.




The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition can now move his substantive motion.




Mr SHORTEN:
  Thank you and I thank the Prime Minister for granting leave. I move:


That the House condemns the Prime Minister for:


(1) violating the trust of the Australian people;


(2) raiding the hard-earned retirement incomes of working Australians to pay for his broken promises;


(3) abandoning a promise he has made at least 14 times not to make any adverse changes to superannuation;


(4) freezing the increase to the Superannuation Guarantee which will cut the retirement incomes of all working Australians;


(5) abolishing the Low Income Superannuation Contribution which will make it harder for low income earners to save for retirement;


(6) mortgaging the future retirements of working people because of his Government's dishonesty; and


(7) repeatedly breaking his promise not to do deals with minor parties and independents.


We have seen today, and Australians waking up today have learnt, the devastating news that there has been a disgraceful, destructive and dishonest attack to freeze their superannuation. Australians have woken up to find out that there has been a dirty, devious backroom deal to deny millions a decent retirement income. This deal has been done and the arch culprit is the most out of touch Prime Minister since the top hat-wearing Stanley Bruce. This Prime Minister says in answer to the first question in question time, 'There have been no adverse changes'—remembered his weasel words, 'There will be no negative adverse changes to people's superannuation accounts.' He did not say it once, he did not say it twice, he lied on 14 occasions about this matter. A new land-speed record for a duplicitous government. And that dilemma is—




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The government has given leave for a debate. It has not given leave for the use of unparliamentary terms and the Leader of the Opposition knows that. He should withdraw it and then he will be allowed to proceed.



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition will withdraw the unparliamentary term.




Mr SHORTEN:
  I withdraw, Madam Speaker. We have seen on 14 occasions the nation's greatest fairytale teller, telling fairytales which will harm Australians. What is it about the meaning of the word 'adverse' that this Prime Minister does not understand? Why is it that he speaks weasel language, not the English language? And why doesn't he understand why we believe this is a despicable attack? Of course, there are members of the government who sneer at this debate. Why wouldn't they? They are on much better superannuation than the almost nine million Australians whom they are holding back. And they should not shake their heads. If you do not know how real people earn their income, you are not fit to be here.


We know it is a con job. The government said that they would defer the increase to 10 per cent for two years. That is all they said. But since then we have seen a rushed, botched job where they have now said, 'We will delay it for six years.' 


The government either deliberately seek to harm the less well-off in this community or, at the very least, are clueless about how people other than themselves live. They have said, 'This is a good thing for the Australian worker.' We heard this Prime Minister say, 'There's no adverse harm,' with his trademark smirk and shrug of his shoulders. 'What does it matter?' What we know about this Prime Minister is that he would rather put the interests of fewer than 10 mining companies ahead of almost nine million Australians. Those are your priorities, Mr Prime Minister. You have never seen the big end of town that you would not help and you have never met anyone less well-off whom you would help through policies and superannuation. The Liberal Party has got form on superannuation. Some of the historians of the Liberal Party can shake their heads—



Mr Robb interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  The minister for trade! In 1992 they voted against mandating compulsory superannuation. When John Howard ran for power in 1996, he said, 'You can trust us to lift super to 15 per cent,' matching Keating's promise. Then, after 1996, these disgraceful recidivists, these people who have no clue about superannuation except their own accounts, reversed that and said, 'We're not increasing it.' So for many years superannuation was stuck at nine per cent. Then Labor, again, in the last term of office, moved superannuation in incremental amounts to 12 per cent. The coalition voted against it then. But when they got near the election these recidivists, these fairytale tellers of political lies then said—



The SPEAKER:  The member will—it is all right. Okay.




Mr SHORTEN:
  Thank you, I am glad you agree, Madam Speaker. These recidivists, these fairytale tellers of political lies said, 'You can't really trust us on super, but we'll delay it for just two years.' We knew that they were making it up. But they did say that; they put it in black and white. 



A government member interjecting—  




Mr SHORTEN:
  And don't call me 'genius'—you wouldn't be fit to even tie the bootlaces of the people who need this superannuation. Then we go further. Now they have got the chance to lift superannuation to 12 per cent, what do they do? They freeze it again. They do not know what they do. As a classic—



Mr Morrison interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  Oh, Morrison, be quiet. They have no idea what they do. Have we heard any information at all from the economic neo-Luddites of the antisuperannuation brigade? Have they said how much it will cost an individual's account? They have no idea what it means to a 25-year-old now, earning $55,000. They have no idea what their change means. I will tell you. It means $9,516 less in their account. What about a 35-year-old who is on $75,000? Because of these changes, they lose nearly $13,000 in savings.



Mr Pyne interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  Oh, Christopher Pyne, don't talk to me about wages. You have never seen a wage you wouldn't cut; you've never seen a student you wouldn't harm in terms—



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition will refrain from talking across the table using terms other than their name.




Mr SHORTEN:
  The truth hurts, Madam Speaker. They have no idea what is going on with the trajectory of this economy. The pool of national savings has been harmed by hundreds of billions of dollars as a result of this decision. They are going to delay—



Mr Fletcher interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  Oh, Fletcher, be quiet. They have delayed hundreds of billions of dollars in accumulation for superannuation. We asked this government a question today: what is the impact—



Mr Simpkins interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Cowan will remove himself under 94(a).




The member for 
Cowan then left the chamber.





Mr SHORTEN:
  We asked the government today: what is the impact on national savings? They have no idea. We asked the government today: what does it mean for increased Commonwealth expenditure on the age pension? We asked the Prime Minister, in a triumph of hope over experience that he would answer it, but he did not fail us. He did not answer the question. There is no modelling here. I challenge the Prime Minister right here, right now: show us your modelling which indicates the impact on the pension, on people's accounts and on the national savings profile of this nation. They have no idea what they do.


The government are happy to hold back increased superannuation for nearly nine million Australians. They are happy to do that. But what they are also happy to do is extend the tax break for people who earn over $100,000 in interest on their superannuation savings. They are happy to look after a very small number of people but do over nearly nine million people. I repeat that: when it comes to people who have millions of dollars in their superannuation and they earn over $100,000 in interest each year, the government says, 'No worries; you get that for free.' But they will make everyone else work to age 70. 


As I said, we now see what is a remarkable act of faith by the Treasurer, not necessarily borne out in today's caucus meeting, I might add. I do note that the Prime Minister, according to Fairfax, had to slap down the Treasurer after a stoush over GST anger. Hang in there, Christian Porter, you will get a promotion eventually!


We now see the government are going to give Joe Hockey, the man who inspires such confidence in the night musings of the backbenchers, especially their marginal seat members, control of when we get superannuation increases. This Prime Minister says, 'You'll eventually get to 12 per cent in 2025.' Thank goodness! 


Always with 'tricky Tony' watch the fine print, because I have no doubt that that will change. In fact, from what they have said, it can take as long as 2034. 


Why is this government so against improving the pool of national savings? I love this mob opposite for their sheer effrontery. They have got more front than Myers, this mob opposite. If they were at a superannuation conference they would say, 'Oh, it's great the pool of national savings—$1.6 trillion. You'll love it, Joe. You'll love superannuation.' You would beat your chest, you would chomp around and you would blow hard about superannuation. But the problem is that when you have a chance to do something about lifting superannuation you chicken out every time. I have never seen an increase in super that these people opposite have not voted against. What they do is damage the retirement incomes of ordinary Australians. 


This government has form in damaging superannuation. They have gone after the low-income superannuation contribution. The low-income superannuation contribution was enacted by former Treasurer Wayne Swan. He stands up for the low paid in our community. What he said in his legislation and what we say now is: why on earth should 3½ million people—and the government should listen to this; they might learn something—




Mr Hockey:
  From you? 




Mr SHORTEN:
  Joe Hockey, I would just be quiet and not remind anyone you are here, mate. What do they do with the 3½ million people getting the low-income superannuation contribution? Currently, under Labor's proposal, which we enacted, if you earn less than $37,000, you pay no tax on your superannuation contribution. This is not a bad idea. Once upon a time they used to pay 15 per cent, but the difference is that, if you earn this money in the pocket, if you just take it as pay—as Christopher Pyne suddenly discovered about low-paid workers, other than the ones who serve him a cappuccino at the cafe—



The SPEAKER:  The member will refer to people by their correct titles.




Mr SHORTEN:
  The member for Sturt. Okay, you got me. The member for Sturt says he worries about the wages of people, even though he has no form guide for ever voting for it. What we see is that people who earn less than $37,000 under Labor's proposal pay no tax on their superannuation contributions. This is actually sensible, because when we go back to what the Liberals and the Palmer United Party have done, people will be paying more tax on their superannuation than they would at their effective marginal tax rate. Only a Liberal! They are so out of touch with how poorer Australians earn their living that only they could dream up having a higher tax on compulsory savings than they would on the money that people take home. These are the sorts of people we are dealing with. But it does not just stop there. Not only have they broken a promise—and believe me, Mr Abbott, you have broken this promise and we will hold you to it; they have cut the tax refund which low-paid Australians get. What they are actually doing is that they want people to work longer and receive less in terms of their aged pension when they retire. This is a government who has never seen a lower paid Australian whom they did not want to slug. I love their false indignation on behalf of ordinary Australians. If they really cared about ordinary Australians they would not be delaying or freezing their superannuation increases. If they really cared about lower paid Australians, ordinary Australians battling to make ends meet, they would not be cutting the indexation rate of the age pension. If they really cared about lower paid or ordinary Australians, they would not be taking away the tax refund. Tony Abbott, though, has form on superannuation. 



The SPEAKER:  The member will refer to people by their correct title. 




Mr SHORTEN:
  The author of Battlelines has form on superannuation. He once famously said—and I saw some of his new and neophyte members a bit surprised at the question; remember, we asked the Prime Minister 'Is compulsory superannuation the greatest con job?'—well may you nod, Tony, because we know what you said. He said, 'Compulsory superannuation was the greatest con job ever foisted on Australians.' So, to be fair to Mr Abbott—



A government member:  The Prime Minister.




Mr SHORTEN:
  Yes, the Prime Minister, well spotted. To be fair to him, he did flag in 1995 that he thought compulsory superannuation was a con job. Of course, he has had more twists and turns—he is a weathervane—on superannuation. Late yesterday and now today, in order to look after a few mining companies and in order to work with your great friend Clive Palmer, life member of the LNP and buddy on Senate deals, they made a deal that nearly nine million Australians will miss out. That is why we condemn this Prime Minister. You are not fit to handle the policies of superannuation in this country. If you are seriously putting up that we would let Joe Hockey be in charge—




Mr Morrison:
  Treasurer.




Mr SHORTEN:
  Thanks, Scotty—the Minister for Immigration. If you think that we are going to allow that Treasurer to be in charge of the national savings account of Australia then, as they famously said in The Castle, 'Tell 'em you're dreaming.' We are on to you and the Australian people are on to you, and we will hold you to account for this latest broken promise and lie. 



The SPEAKER:  Is the motion seconded? 




Mr Bowen:
  Yes.



The SPEAKER:  Before I call the member for McMahon, I see that the Leader of the Opposition had a great deal of difficulty remembering to address people by their correct titles.

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2014-09-02,"



Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Prime Minister) (15:05):  I do appreciate the opportunity to address the issue before the chair today. The simple truth is that today the government delivered on a fundamental election commitment. We promised to abolish the mining tax, and we promised to abolish the spending associated with the mining tax—spending that was not sustained by the tax that raised no revenue—and today that is precisely what this government has done. I thank crossbench members of the Senate. I thank the member for Fairfax for the assistance that he has given to the government to deliver on this fundamental election commitment. If members opposite led by the Leader of the Opposition were not in denial about the result of last year's election, the deal that they now complain of would never have been necessary. 


The Leader of the Opposition is angry. He is obviously angry. He is understandably angry, because what we have seen today is a government that is succeeding and an opposition that is failing and, indeed, an opposition leader who is drowning. That is all we have seen today. The Leader of the Opposition must have expected his suspension would be gaged, because plainly he did not have a speech to deliver in support of the suspension motion that he moved. 


I want to make it absolutely crystal clear that this is a government that is delivering on its commitments. We said we would abolish the carbon tax, and the carbon tax is gone; we said we would stop the boats, and the boats are stopping; we said we would build the roads of the 21st century, and those roads are powering ahead; and we said we would bring the budget back under control, and I cannot say it is easy to address the debt and deficit disaster that members opposite left us but that loathsome legacy is being addressed by this government.


What are we seeing from members opposite? We are seeing the whole gamut from members opposite. They are complaining that we do not keep commitments and then they are complaining that we do keep commitments. The one constant is that they are complaining. This is not an opposition leader who is running an alternative government—this is an opposition leader who is running the national complaints bureau! That is all he can do. Until such time as the Leader of the Opposition remembers that the job of opposition is to be a constructive alternative, Labor will be in the doldrums.



The Labor Party in government could not be trusted with border security. It has learned nothing in opposition. In government it could not be trusted with public finances. It has learned nothing in opposition. This is a Labor Party that damaged our country in government and now is attempting to damage our country from opposition. This government is doing what it can and should to faithfully deliver on its election commitments. We said that we would abolish the mining tax because the mining tax was damaging investments, damaging jobs, failing to raise the revenue that was claimed for it, and involving the spending of unsustainable billions of dollars. Today, the mining tax is gone. We said that we would abolish the low-income superannuation contribution, and it will go. We said that we would abolish the income support bonus, and it will go. We said that we would abolish the schoolkids bonus, and it is going. All this is not because we do not want to see a good deal for the people of Australia but because these things are not a good deal for the people of Australia if they are funded by unsustainable borrowing, if they are unsupported by the kind of economy that we need and if we are to have a generous social service system.


Is the deal that was done with crossbench senators today perfect? No it is not, but it is a better deal than to leave this unsustainable mining tax and the spending associated with it in place forever. This is a government that is prepared to work with the parliament—a parliament that the people of Australia elected—to do the right thing by the people of Australia.


Throughout question time today, members opposite acted as though the superannuation guarantee levy was the perfect answer to every person's retirement dreams. For the benefit of members opposite, let me remind them that there is no nirvana in superannuation guarantee levies, as the Henry tax review reported:


… employees bear the cost of these contributions through lower wage growth.


The Leader of the Opposition himself, in one of his rare lucid moments, admitted this on the Neil Mitchell program in 2010. The Henry report goes on to say—



Mr Shorten interjecting—




Mr ABBOTT:
  I am sorry? Are you okay?



Ms Plibersek interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Sydney!




Mr ABBOTT:
  The Henry tax review went on to say this about the superannuation system beloved of members opposite:


This means the increase in the employee's retirement income is achieved by reducing their standard of living before retirement.



Ms Plibersek interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Sydney will desist.




Mr ABBOTT:
  Let us be absolutely clear: yes, this is worth doing, but it is certainly not the nirvana promised by the Leader of the Opposition. That is why it will be abolished by 2025. This is a government that is getting on with the job of governing. We said that we would not form a minority government with Independents. We were not going to make the mistake that members opposite did when they sold their soul to the Greens after the 2010 election.



Mr Dreyfus interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Isaacs will desist or leave the chamber—the choice is his.




Mr ABBOTT:
  But we never said that we would not do deals with the parliament. The whole point of being in government is to get legislation through the parliament. If members opposite are determined to frustrate legislation getting through the parliament, we will work with members of this parliament who are prepared to respect the mandate of this government. What we have done today is secretly supported by many members of the Labor Party, because most members of the Labor Party, in their hearts, understand that the mining tax has been deadly for jobs, deadly for investment and deadly for fiscal responsibility. Let me quote the member for Perth, her head buried in papers.



Ms MacTiernan interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Perth will desist.




Mr ABBOTT:
  Just bury your head again, if you wouldn't mind! What was said by the member for Perth was that 'We do actually have to start listening to the Western Australian representatives about what will work and what won't work in Western Australia.' There was a pretty strong view coming from virtually all the Western Australian representatives about what should have happened with the mining tax. 



Mr Shorten interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition will desist.



Mr Shorten interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  I said the Leader of the Opposition will desist.




Mr ABBOTT:
  The member for Perth wanted the mining tax gone—



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr ABBOTT:
  I am sure somewhere in all that bellowing are sotto voce congratulations for doing what she and other members of her party in Western Australia wanted. This government is fixing all of the messes that it inherited from members opposite. They gave us the carbon tax; this government has got rid of it. They gave us the mining tax; this government has got rid of it. They gave us a whole lot of Green vetoes over important projects; the Green veto has gone, thanks to the Minister the Environment. They gave us 10 years of negotiations and no free trade agreements; we have delivered the free trade agreements.

Mr Burke:
  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I refer to the precedent you set on 26 February this year, when you ruled out an amendment which had been moved by the opposition to a motion that had been moved by the member for Denison. In that ruling you stated:


I am looking at the terms of the motion as it was moved and I am looking at the amendment and there is a requirement that the amendment be relevant to the substance of the motion. There is no relevance of the amendment to the substance of the motion and I rule the amendment out of order.


Given the relation on 26 February between the amendment and the motion on that day, it would be a very long stretch for the Prime Minister's amendment to be anywhere near being ruled in order.



Mr Ewen Jones interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Herbert is warned. I recall making that determination. However, there is ample precedent in this place where a censure motion is moved and where it is turned around by the opposing group. Indeed, if I recall, I have even had it happen to me.




Mr Burke:
  Madam Speaker, a point of order.



The SPEAKER:  A further point of order? I have not ruled yet.




Mr Burke:
  No, but before you do—it might be helpful. If you do not want me to, I will sit down.



The SPEAKER:  I think we will proceed.




Mr Burke:
  Is the amendment in order or not?



The SPEAKER:  The amendment is in order.




Mr Burke:
  Madam Speaker, I raise a point of order. The words that I said immediately before you made that ruling in February were these:


Thank you, Madam Speaker. There have been many occasions where amendments have been moved and accepted and much precedent for amendments which look at the issues contained within the resolution in a different way.


You then ruled that point of order, almost identical to the words you just uttered, as out of order. I ask you to establish the new precedent that you established on that day.




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Speaker, the point of the amendment is to rebut the issues surrounding the mining tax as put by the Leader of the Opposition. The original motion is about the mining tax. The amendment is about the mining tax. The Manager of Opposition Business might want to detract from the debate because of how poorly it has been going for the opposition, but the reality remains that the amendment is clearly in order and that these are just delaying tactics for goodness knows what purpose.




Mr Burke:
  Madam Speaker, if that is the argument from the government, there is no mention of the mining tax in the motion at all. If that is how it is relevant the arguments from the Leader of the House cannot be held.



The SPEAKER:  I think that in the case of where there is what amounts to a censure motion and the government has moved to reverse that, effectively, there is ample precedent within the Practice to do it. It is in order. The original question is that the motion be agreed to. To that the honourable the Prime Minister has moved an amendment. If it suits the House, I will put the motion in the terms: that the amendment be agreed to.

"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2014-09-02,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (15:20):  Today says it all about this government and today says it all about this Prime Minister in particular. He is a Prime Minister addicted to breaching election commitments. Even worse, he is a Prime Minister who insults the Australian people by denying it and who insults the intelligence of the Australian people by refusing to admit a blatant truth. We saw it just a few moments ago in question time when the Prime Minister claimed a mandate for his freezing of the increase in the superannuation guarantee. I am holding a copy of his superannuation policy from the election. Remember when he used to hold press conferences and hold pamphlets under his head, point to them and say, 'This is our plan for Australia.'? They had a plan. It reads 'The Plan'. It gets better: point 1 is 'Certainty and Stability' for superannuation. It says 'the gradual increase will be delayed by two years'. So says the Liberal Party's policy at the last election. Today two years became six, and the Prime Minister does not even have the grace to admit this breach of an election commitment.


A year ago, tomorrow, the Prime Minister said:


I expect that people will be very harsh on a new government that doesn't keep its commitments.


It can count on that because the Australian people are harsh on a government that does not keep its commitments; and this government has broken more than any other. Today we have seen a deal done in the other House. We saw the Treasurer up doing the deal in the Senate—very proud of his handiwork; very pleased with himself. Then there is the commitment from the now Prime Minister: 


There will not be deals done with independents and minor parties under any political movement that I lead.


That says it all!


More than anything else, Madam Speaker, what today tells us about this government is this government's warped values and twisted priorities. This is a government which says, 'Work longer.' This is a government which says, 'We can't afford fair indexation of the age pension.' But this is a government which says, 'We are not going to help you save for your future retirement; we are going to make it harder.' Today the government has achieved the trifecta: they have made Australians work longer, they have made the pension less fair and they have put more people on the age pension by their short-sighted policies. 


There is only one thing that is consistent about this government and it this: it is the people who can least afford it who pay the price for their broken promises. It is Australia's low- and middle-income earners who pay the price for their breach of commitment. During question time we saw the Prime Minister show that he did not know how many more people will be reliant on the age pension because of his policies. He had no idea how many more people will be on the age pension. He has no idea by how much Australia's pool of savings has been reduced today. He has no idea what the long-term impact on the federal budget will be. Let's help him out. During question time, financial services counsellors helped the Prime Minister out: they said that by 2025 there will be $128 billion less in our national pool of savings, thanks to this Prime Minister and thanks to this Treasurer. The Treasurer who puffs himself up to full height, beats his chest and lectures Australians that they should work longer than anybody else in the world, that they should have a less-fair pension, that they should have a pension which is not indexed fairly and properly—a Treasurer who dares to say that it is strongly arguable that pensioners could be better off under his budget. By his actions he will have made Australia's working population $128 billion worse off by 2025. That is the only thing consistent about this government.


They say to high-income earners: 'Oh, look, those terrible tax changes the Labor Party put in—which were modest—we're going to reverse those. We're going to look after you, but for low-income earners—people earning less than $37,000 and some of them might even drive a car—we are going to give them zero tax concessions for their future. They commit no crime other than to work hard, but we are going to give them nothing.' I say this: the vast majority of those low-income earners—people in Australia's factories, cleaners, people in manual labour—are women, who deserve a chance to save for their future through superannuation and to receive some modest tax breaks for doing it. But this government just does not get it. They do not understand the impact of their own policies; they certainly do not understand the impact of their values and their twisted priorities; and they certainly do not understand the impact of their budget on Australians.


But there is just one more reason that today says it all about this government. Yesterday we all saw the farce of the government introducing a bill into the House with no speech—the bill with no speech. The government forgot to explain to the House what they were voting on. There was a clause in that bill yesterday which said that the Treasurer should have the ability to change the superannuation guarantee rate himself—and need not come back to the parliament. We pointed that out to the House, when we eventually got the bill, but I can report to the House that it lasted less than 24 hours, because even the government acknowledged the error of their ways—and now they have not done that. So this is calm, methodical government by this government of grown ups, who have had three positions on superannuation in the last 24 hours—the last one just negotiated in the Senate. I wonder how long the cabinet meeting went to discuss that one! We were told, of course, by the Prime Minister: 


The main commitment I want to make tonight is to restore cabinet government. 


That was on 22 June 2010.


As a general rule all significant government decisions should be considered by cabinet before they are announced, rather than subsequently presented as done deals.


We hear a lot about methodical, calm government, don't we? We hear a lot about it, but we do not see a lot of it.


They have adopted three positions in 24 hours on a matter of some importance to the Australian people—their retirement incomes. It is a matter that actually counts to Australians who are saving for their retirement and who care about their future. They want to know that this government has a plan. They do have a plan, apparently—in fact, they have three, and we have seen them all over the last 24 hours. But today's is the worst, because they have frozen the increase in the superannuation guarantee for six years. As the Leader of the Opposition said, 'They have got form. This is what Liberals do, because Liberals don't believe in working people having the ability to save for their future.' Liberals do not believe in working people receiving some modest assistance to do so. Liberals won the 1996 election promising to increase the superannuation guarantee. They won the 2013 election promising to increase the superannuation guarantee, and what we have found is another point of consistency—breaching their promises on superannuation. Why? Because they just don't get it.


It tells us something even more about this government, this Prime Minister and this Treasurer. It tells us about their prejudice—their prejudice against working people. If this was an ideology, Madam Speaker, I would have a little bit of respect for it. If this were an extreme right-wing ideology, I would have as much respect for it as disagreement, but I have no respect for prejudice. I have no respect for the prejudice which this Treasurer implements in his budget and his policies. I have no respect for the prejudice which this Prime Minister implements in his blatant disregard for Australian people and his election commitments to them. We have no respect for your prejudice, and the Australian people have no respect for your prejudice, because your prejudice hurts working people. People around Australia go about their daily business hoping that somebody in Canberra is looking out for them—somebody in Canberra saying, 'I wonder how we can help people save for their retirement,' or somebody in Canberra saying, 'Let's care about the long-term future of Australia.' They hope somebody in Canberra is saying, 'Let's give the working people of Australia a hand.' Right around Australia, millions of Australians are saying, 'Is somebody in Canberra looking out for us?' Well, not over there. It is not that Prime Minister and not that Treasurer. We have a Prime Minister and a Treasurer who have such contempt and prejudice for working Australians that they scoff, they smile, they snarl, they sneer—



Opposition members:  They smirk!




Mr BOWEN:
  And they smirk. Even more importantly than that, they are hurting people with their policies. I have to confess, I am not sure whether the Treasurer just does not understand the impacts of his policies or he embraces his policies because of this government's prejudice. I suspect that it is a bit of both, because he does not understand the impact of his budget on the Australian people and he does not understand the impact of his retrograde superannuation policy either.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2014-09-02,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney—The Treasurer) (15:30):  The first thing I say in response to the shadow Treasurer is that we do not take all credit for winning the last election. I think the Labor Party helped us along the way. I want to personally thank the honourable member for McMahon for his contribution to us winning the last election. It was very generous of him and of all his colleagues. That help was primarily based on the fact that, after six years in government, the Labor Party just did not know what it believed in. The Leader of the Opposition is a great example of that. He does not know what he believes in. He is a man with loyalty to no-one but himself. He is a man who has been loyal to no-one in his life. He was not loyal to Kevin Rudd and then he was not loyal to Julia Gillard. Then, in the end, he was not even loyal to the Labor Party but he became the leader of the Labor Party—and he is not even loyal to the policies that they took to the last election. 


They come in here and give us sanctimonious lectures about improving the budget when the Labor Party itself is opposing $5 billion of policies it took to the last election to pay for its own promises—spare us the hypocrisy! They come in here and lecture us about superannuation and yet the Labor Party increased taxes on superannuation by $9 billion in the last six years. There were $9 billion of increases in superannuation taxes. They could not do that with a mining tax they designed, yet they managed to find $9 billion of new taxes on superannuation after Kevin Rudd promised the Australian people in 2007, in writing, that they would not change superannuation 'not one jot, not one tittle'. That is what Labor said in 2007 and that is what they promised the Australian people, and then they broke that promise.


We went to the 2010 election and the 2013 election saying that we were going to get rid of the mining tax and the associated expenditure. Labor does not want to hear this. They do not want to hear this because they are embarrassed by their own policy failures. They are embarrassed by their own political failures as well, because they can hardly complain about us when they will not let us keep every single initiative that we took to the last election. When we come to a deal with reasonable senators in the Senate to get our election commitments through, they complain that we are breaking election commitments. The hide of them! The Labor Party does not know what is right and what is wrong, because they do not believe in anything. Bill Shorten has no core values. He is a man who blows in the wind. He is an insipidly weak man.




Mr Mitchell:
  Speaker, I rise on a point of order. You have been very consistent today in pulling up the Leader of the Opposition for not addressing people properly. Three times you gave that ruling earlier this year when the words used by the Prime Minister were not someone's correct title. Now, again, the Treasurer is using the incorrect title for members. He should be brought into line like the rest of us.



The SPEAKER:  I will do precisely that. Thank you, member for McEwen. The correct title for me is Madam Speaker. I would ask the Treasurer to also use the correct titles.




Mr HOCKEY:
  The Leader of the Opposition is an insipidly weak man. He has no principles. He blows in the wind, as his loyalty blows between many people. That is reflected in the fact that he is moaning about us keeping our election commitments and each day he comes in to complain that we may be breaking election commitments. This is a Leader of the Opposition who has successfully dealt Labor out of any activity in relation to policymaking during this term of government. They thought they could paint us into a corner in relation to the debt limit. We did a deal with the Greens to remove the debt limit that Labor created but Labor could never keep. They thought they painted us into a corner on the repeal of the carbon tax and then we managed to do a deal with a number of senators to pass the repeal of the carbon tax. They thought they painted us into a corner in relation to FOFA and then we did a deal to get that through. Then they thought they painted us into a corner on the mining tax, and we managed to do a deal with reasonable senators as well.


I said last week that the Labor Party is travelling at high speed down into a cul-de-sac. I am proven absolutely right today. They are driving at high speed down into a cul-de-sac—a policy cul-de-sac but also a political cul-de-sac. Why so? That is because their only friends in this parliament are the Greens.



Ms Ryan interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Lalor is not in her seat and is not entitled to speak.




Mr HOCKEY:
  They are the only friends of the Labor Party in this parliament, as was the case in the last parliament and the parliament before. Their only friends are the Greens. They are soul mates and political mates with the Greens. They have not learned anything from the last election. They have learnt absolutely nothing.



Ms Ryan interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  If the member for Lalor interjects one more time, she will leave.




Mr HOCKEY:
  As a result, we are getting on with our agenda. If nothing had been done about the budget, we would have been facing $123 billion of deficits over the four years. We would be facing $667 billion of debt over a 10-year period. That is $25,000 of debt for every man, woman and child in Australia. I will tell you what is unfair: Labor's legacy of $25,000 of debt for every man, woman and child is unfair. I will tell you what is unfair: $1 billion a month in interest, just on the debt that Labor left behind. Seventy per cent of it goes overseas to repay the money to people that we borrowed from. I will tell you what is unfair—that that we leave Australians with a lesser quality of life in the future than that which we have had. When you borrow money today, you are borrowing from the future. The money must be repaid, in principal and interest, into the future. What have we done? We have started by identifying the mess that was left behind. They left behind record deficits and record debt. They left behind 93 announced but unlegislated taxation changes and we are fixing that. They left behind unfulfilled agreements on trade with Korea and Japan, and there was China as well. We have delivered two of the three, with one yet to come—a great credit to the minister for trade. 


We said we would end the age of entitlement, starting with corporate Australia, and we have done that. We know it is not painless. We know that. But we have delivered, and it took enormous courage. We stood up to people because it is the right thing to do. Whether it is an industry or whether it is a business, we cannot take money from the battlers of Australia paying tax and give it to corporate Australia. We cannot do that. We said we would clean up the mess in taxation that Labor left. We got rid of the carbon tax for pensioners and middle Australia—$550 per household per year. It is a burden lifted off manufacturing, and a burden lifted off exports. We said we would get rid of it, and we got rid of it. We said we would get rid of the mining tax and associated expenditure. Every day during the last election Labor kept saying, 'show us your costings.' We did show them the costings, and we provided in detail every single bit of the abolition of the mining tax package. We gave every single detail in full, and Labor did not like it. We had the guts to go to the election and give the people the facts, and the electorate voted for us, just as they voted for us to get on with the job of fixing the economy. 


There were $800 billion of approvals for projects held up under Labor, and we have gone on and done the job with those. We are also getting rid of red tape—$800 million a year in red-tape burden on business. We have got rid of that as well. We are getting on with the job of strengthening the Australian economy. We are building the infrastructure of the 21st century. We are laying down plans and delivering on $125 billion of new infrastructure for Australia. We are creating tens of thousands of new jobs, because ultimately it comes down to jobs. Under the former minister for workplace relations, Job Creation Australia was tracking at 5,000 new jobs a month. Under us that figure is 15,000 new jobs a month. Under us, even Labor economists like Stephen Koukoulas recognise that business expectations are at decade highs, that business confidence is at highs and that consumer confidence is back to highs. The bottom line is that we are building a stronger economy. We are building a stronger budget. We are determined to build a stronger Australia. I say to the Labor Party: you are irrelevant; you have put yourselves in that place—don't blame anyone other than yourselves for your own political and policy incompetence.




Mr Burke:
  Speaker, I rise on a point of order under standing order 67, relating to the question we are about to vote on. The copy of the amendment that has been circulated has a point (2), which refers to delivering a simpler, fairer tax system. That point (2) has been crossed out on the amendment copy that we have been given. When we vote on the amendment, I want to know whether or not the Prime Minister has actually moved point (2), or whether they are not claiming that the government has delivered a simpler, fairer tax system in their amendment. If it is of assistance, my recollection is that the Prime Minister did not refer to a point (2) when he moved the amendment. He went from point (1) to point (3), but given that we have a copy with a point (2) crossed out, I wondered under standing order 67 whether you could affirm what the detail of the amendment is that we are voting on. Who crossed it out would be another question.



The SPEAKER:  I think that the best evidence on what we are voting on is the amendment which has been circulated—as it stands, with (2) crossed out. All that means is that it was not debated, and it was not dealt with. The question is that the amendment be agreed to.



The SPEAKER:  The question now is that the motion, as amended, be agreed to.

Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (15:53):  There is plenty of hurt being inflicted by this government's adverse changes to superannuation. There is plenty of hurt being inflicted by its changes to the age pension. There is plenty of hurt being inflicted on the Australian people because of the government's changes to family tax benefits. But, more than anything else, what we have is a government which is determined to breach its election commitments and hurt the Australian people in a way that is adverse not just to individuals and families but to the long-term economic future of this nation.


The government do not realise the importance of the policies they are dealing with. They see superannuation as their personal plaything—in which they do not believe. The Prime Minister, when he was sitting up on the opposition backbench, called superannuation a con job foisted on the Australian people by our government. We know that he does not understand superannuation because, years later, in his book, he called for retrograde steps to be made. And now, given the chance as Prime Minister of Australia, he is making retrograde steps to Australia's superannuation system.


Let me be very clear: superannuation is a proud achievement of Labor governments. We built it and we will defend it. We will defend it against Liberal and National MPs who vote consistently to downgrade it—they did so in the 1990s, they do so today and, no doubt, they will do so in this House tomorrow. They do not believe in superannuation building the future for working Australians. They do not believe it and they fight it. Well, we will fight them every step of the way. We are proud of the fact that our superannuation assets are now the fourth largest in the world. We are the 12th largest economy and we have the fourth largest pension pool in the world—achieved by Australians saving for their future, achieved by Australia's financial services industry, achieved by a framework set up by successive Labor governments. The Hawke and Keating governments invented universal superannuation, the Rudd and Gillard governments strengthened universal superannuation, and the Abbott government is trying to drag superannuation down—breaching their election commitments to the Australian people.


Well, the Australian people are awake to the conflict of disloyalties which goes to the heart of this government. We have a government that beats its chest and lectures Australians about working harder and longer, a government that says Australian should work until they are 70. Can the government name one country in the world with a pension age of 70? No. Can it name one country that is projected to have a pension age of 70 by 2035? No. Can it name one country that is projected to have a pension age of 70 by 2050? Not one! This government thinks Australian should work longer than people in any other country in the world. This government says we should have an indexation of the pension arrangements which is as onerous and as mean as any tried by any government in the world—barring not even Margaret Thatcher's government.


We are the 12th largest economy in the world and the government says that, as a nation, we cannot afford to give pensioners fair indexation. The government says to Australians that it is not going to help them save for their future if they dare to be low- or middle-income earners or one of Australia's female workers across the country—the 2.1 million female Australians who are today missing out on a modest superannuation concession at the hands of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the members who sit behind them. There are 2.1 million Australians who happen to be women working in schools, hospitals and factories—the workplaces of Australia—who today are losers at the hands of this Prime Minister and this Treasurer.


The government say to these people: 'You deserve zero tax concession on your superannuation. You deserve nothing from your government for daring to save for the future. We're going to make you work until you're 70. We don't care if you're a nurse who works the night shift. We don't care if you're a bricklayer who works your body to such a point that you can go no further. We don't care if you're a policeman or a policewoman keeping our streets safe. We don't care who you are or where you are, you'll get nothing from us.' That is what the Prime Minister and the Treasurer say, and that is what every single member opposite says. Whether they be from the Liberal Party or the National Party, whether they represent city or rural Australia, they all say to Australia's low-income earners: 'We're not on your side. We're on the side of higher income earners, who deserve ever more generous tax concessions. If you dare to be a low-income earner, you'll get nothing from us.' They have abolished the low-income superannuation contribution in their deal with the Palmer United Party in the other house and, no doubt, tomorrow they will do so in this house. We say, 'Shame on them!'


We will stand up for Australia's low-income workers. We will stand up for those workers who say: 'We deserve some assistance to save for our future. We don't mind working hard. We don't mind doing what it takes to put food on the table and to provide for our families. But is somebody looking out for us?'


Is somebody going to say there should be some modest tax concessions for low-income earners? Yes, there is somebody, but we are all on this side of the House. There is not one on that side of the House. The National Party, which once promised so much to rural Australia, says to all those low-income earners right throughout rural and regional and Australia, 'We're not on your side. We will not stand up for you.' 


The Labor Party will stand up for the workers of rural and regional Australia. The Labor Party will say that those workers right up and down the coast and through Australia's great inland deserve some assistance to save for the future. They deserve some assistance to be part of that great Labor achievement of superannuation, that Labor achievement which has helped so many thousands of Australians have a dignified and comfortable retirement. That is what we believe in. We believe that regardless of your income, background, gender or where you live you deserve dignity in retirement. We believe that if you have worked hard all your working life you deserve to be able to retire before you turn 70 and you deserve to have some dignity and comfort in your retirement. We are not talking about luxury or great riches. We are talking about dignity. We are talking about giving Australians the chance to live free of being reliant on the age pension. 


The Prime Minister did not even know the impact of his own policies. He could not tell the House or the Australian people how many people will now be reliant on the full age pension because of changes he has pushed through the parliament today. He does not know, and how could he know? This is policy on the run. We have had three positions from the government over the course of the past 24 hours. I wonder if the minister who will respond on behalf of the government will share with the House any Treasury modelling they may have done about the impact on low-income earners, or on the budget over the long term, or on the national savings pool. I severely doubt it. They are good people down at the Treasury. They work very hard. But they cannot provide modelling in 30 minutes when they have a dysfunctional government that does not know what it is doing. This is a dysfunctional government which treats the parliament and the people with contempt because of their arrogance. Their arrogance tells them that from Canberra they can dictate that low-income earners deserve nothing when it comes to superannuation, that low-income earners should get a tax concession which amounts to no more or no less than zero, and that low-income earners should get no assistance. 


This arrogant government says to Australia's hardworking low-income earners that they do not care about them. We care about them. That is why we voted the way we did. That is why we voted the way we did in the other place. That is why we will vote the way that we will in this House, in defence of Australia's low-income earners. We will stand up for them against this arrogant government. We will stand up for fairness. We will stand up against their moves to make the age pension less fair. We will stand up against their moves to make Australians work longer than anybody else in the world—not only in the developed world but anybody else in the world. 


This government says Australians should work longer than workers in any other country in the world. Did they say that before the last election? I do not recall them saying that before the last election. Did they go out with their pamphlets and say, 'Here is my policy. I reckon you should work longer than anybody else in the world'? That would be a winner, wouldn't it? No, they did not. No, they did not, because they knew the Australian people would vote differently if they were honest with the Australian people about their plans and about their prejudice. That is what we see from this government: plans to implement their prejudice, their prejudice against working people. We will fight it all away.

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (16:03):  Once again, we hear the Australian Labor Party come into the chamber and rail. We hear words like 'justice', 'equity' and 'fairness'. We hear the shadow Treasurer railing about how the government is being arrogant. I think his choice quote was how, as a government, we were treating the parliament and the people with contempt. These are pretty serious charges. How arrogant and contemptuous of us as a government to deliver a promise! How arrogant and contemptuous of us as a government to go to the Australian people before the last election and say, 'If we get elected, because the Labor Party has put the budget in such a stew, we are going to abolish the mining tax and we are going to abolish all the spending associated with the mining tax.' And then, what did we do? We followed through on our commitment. Guilty! Seriously, this is the shadow Treasurer, the man who presided over a spectacular calamity when it came to Australia's finances, now standing up and hectoring and standing up with moral indignation about how inequitable it is, how unfair it is and how Australia will be in a worse situation all because the government is doing what we said we would do. 


Look at this joke of a shadow Treasurer and this joke of an opposition. This is the reason the Australian people reject them and reject their approach. They made that point crystal clear in September last year. They made that point crystal clear. Despite the fact that the Australian Labor Party likes to pretend or likes to think that the Australian people are stupid, they are not. They are smart and they recognise when a government has reached its use-by date as the Australian Labor Party did. But the fundamental problem is that Labor has not heeded the lesson. Labor has not listened to the verdict of the Australian people. Instead of actually recognising the shortcomings on their part, they stand up and huff and puff and try to make out that the fault lies with the government. The fact is that we are a government that has honoured yet another commitment. We are government that are implementing the meaningful, mature, methodical approach to governance that the Australian people had a yearning for and that they called out for last September. It is this government and not all the hot wind from the opposition that is going to make a long-term difference to the Australian people. It is this government's decisions—although not universally popular—




Ms Macklin:
  That's for sure!




Mr CIOBO:
  and we know that—that we know are in the national interest. I will take a decision in the national interest over short-term populism every day of the week, Member for Jagajaga, every day of the week. That is what we were elected to do. We were elected to make the hard decisions. We were elected to make decisions that mean this country is on a long-term sustainable pathway. We reject entirely Labor's short-term, knee-jerk approach to politics, because we know, as the Australian people know, that Labor's approach is nothing but a recipe to land us in the same hot water that short-term thinking in Europe landed most European countries in. We know that hard decisions need to be made and that you do not always do what is popular but what is right, because that is what governments are meant to do.


So, when I hear the Australian Labor Party start screeching on about how people say one thing and do another, I scratch my head and think, 'Well, that's slightly hypocritical'. We already know that we said something before the election. We said we would abolish the mining tax and we said that we would abolish the spending associated with the mining tax, and that is what we have done. So, there has been 100 per cent consistency with what we said we would do. Let us contrast that with Labor's record. Let us contrast it with what Labor's approach has been. There is quite a track record there. Who could forget, in 2012, the member for Lilley, the then Australian Treasurer, standing up at this very dispatch box, saying:


The four years of surpluses I announce tonight are a powerful endorsement of the strength of our economy, resilience of our people, and success of our policies.


In an uncertain and fast‑changing world, we walk tall—as a nation confidently living within its means.


This Budget delivers a surplus this coming year, on time, as promised, and surpluses each year after that, strengthening over time.


That was the member for Lilley, on 8 May 2012. So, I say to the Australian Labor Party: seriously, take you hand off it; enough is enough. It is about time the Australian Labor Party stopped having a lend, because we know that this is a government that delivers on its commitments. It contrasts with the Australian Labor Party, who had an approach of saying exactly the same as they do today—saying whatever they think they need to say because they think there is a vote in it. That is not the coalition's approach. So I am happy to be compared, and the government is happy to be compared, every single day on delivering on our commitments versus Labor not delivering on their commitments.



But there is more, with respect to the superannuation guarantee charge. We see the Australian Labor Party, once again, railing about the fact that we have deferred the increase in the superannuation guarantee. I feel a little bit sorry for the member for Fraser, because how many times have we seen government ministers—and I would not say 'unfairly'—making hay of the fact that the Shadow Assistant Treasurer has written in a very strident way about his strong support for a Medicare copayment? We know that does not sit comfortably with them because it is contrary to Labor Party policy. You can imagine that on the Labor Party's side probably a lot of them would be concerned about what it is that the Shadow Assistant Treasurer has actually said. But I think Labor has a problem, because what do they do when the actual Leader of the Opposition, the leader of the Labor Party, makes a comment that 'analysis suggests that, over time, superannuation guarantee increases have come out of wages rather than profits'? I think the member for Fraser should be feeling quite good about himself. It has not stopped the Leader of the Opposition from rising to his position. Now the member for Fraser is in good company, because both he and the Leader of the Opposition have a point of policy that is different to Labor's actual policy. We know that the Leader of the Opposition said that superannuation guarantee increases have come out of wages rather than profits. Well, good news, Leader of the Opposition: because of the deal that the coalition has delivered today, because of our deal to repeal the mining tax that was making this country less competitive, because of our deal to make sure that as a nation we are back on a sustainable fiscal pathway by cutting, unfortunately, expenditure that ideally we would not have to—but let us make no mistake about the fact that we are doing it because of the state of the books left to us by the Australian Labor Party—we are leaving more money in people's pockets, just as the Leader of the Opposition said was the case in relation to the superannuation guarantee and just as we know is a fact.




I repeat to the Australian Labor Party: if they are serious about increases in the superannuation guarantee, they need to make sure that those increases and those policy positions are sustainable and funded, because the easy thing, the indulgent thing and in fact the reckless thing to do is to come into this chamber and to huff and puff but not to have any money to pay for it. I go back to one fundamental tenet. It is a point I have raised in this chamber before, and it is a point that I will raise every single day in relation to this notion of fairness and equity. We hear the charge levelled against all of us on this side of the House about how grossly unfair we are and how as a government we are so inequitable. And I just make the point again that every day of every week I will stand up for a government that lives within its means, that does not mortgage future generations of Australians, that does not say to Australian kids today, 'Tough luck that you'll have to spend 20 or 30 years paying off today's spending.'





I am happy to look any future generation of Australian children and say to them, 'We stood the test of time; we stood up against the shallow charge of those opposite, who claimed all things to all people to make themselves popular for five minutes, because we took decisions in the national interest to make sure that we safeguarded the future of our children, the future of our nation.' That is what true fairness is. That is what true equity is. True equity is not about stealing or mortgaging future generations; true equity is about living within your means, spending only what you can afford, and, if you introduce a new tax, not introducing a tax that raises one per cent of the forecast revenue but making sensible crucial decisions and as a government taking the mature approach that delivers outcomes.

Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga) (16:13):  On a day that yet again sees this government break another promise—another filthy deal done by this government with the Palmer United Party to remind 2.3 million Australian pensioners what this government is doing to them—2.3 million pensioners understand that this government has betrayed them. One year ago exactly, this Prime Minister went to the National Press Club and said, yet again—he had said it many times—'there will be no changes to pensions'. Which one of you goes out into your electorate and owns up to your pensioners that your Prime Minister lied to them? Did you tell them, over there in Townsville? He is happy to go out there and tell his pensioners that the Prime Minister lied to them before the last election because that is exactly what he did.




Dr Hendy:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Jagajaga is using unparliamentary terms with respect to the Prime Minister and I ask that she withdraw.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I was in conversation with someone on my right. I did not hear them, but it would assist the chamber if the member for Jagajaga would withdraw those comments.




Ms MACKLIN:
  I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. I know that in the seat of Eden-Monaro there are 2.3 million pensioners who live—




Mr Whiteley:
  2.3 million in Eden-Monaro?




Ms MACKLIN:
  the 2.3 million pensioners in Australia, some of whom I met in Queanbeyan today. The member for Eden-Monaro should get out and talk to some of the pensioners he has betrayed and the Prime Minister has betrayed. I say to the pensioners in Eden-Monaro that the member for Eden-Monaro is sitting in here having a good old laugh today because he has betrayed them and the Prime Minister has betrayed each and every one of the pensioners in Eden-Monaro—and in Bass, in Herbert. You keep laughing when you face up to those pensioners in Townsville and tell the truth at the next election. Those pensioners are going to see a cut to their pension because of the way each and every one of you has voted in this House of Representatives. Each and every one of you will be held to account by all of us at the next election for the way in which you are cutting the pension. If you do not want to believe me,  just believe your own Treasurer, who, last week admitted that by 2024 the amount the government will spend on the age pension will be $7 billion less than otherwise projected. What does that mean to Australian pensioners? We tried to ask the Prime Minister this question the other day but of course he refused to answer. 


The Australian Council of Social Service has worked out exactly what it will mean to Australian pensioners. Over the next 10 years it will mean $80 a week less and the member for Eden-Monaro should have a chat with his pensioners in Queanbeyan because they know—and you can shake your head and act like you do not know—that you have betrayed them and they know that Tony Abbott has betrayed them. It will be exactly the same for the three stooges in Tasmania.




Mr Nikolic:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Regularly in this House members opposite are reminded to refer to people by their correct titles. That was an unparliamentary and offensive term and she should withdraw it.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I would ask the member for Jagajaga to withdraw and also to refer through the chair not at the chair. It is a common mistake of many on both sides of the House.




Ms MACKLIN:

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications) (16:18):  The opposition really must think that both the government and the people of Australia have ridiculously short memories when they have the temerity to put forward a motion which purports to criticise the government for 'adverse changes to superannuation'. Do they think that the Australian people have forgotten that previous Prime Minister Rudd had this to say in 2007:


Absolutely not, there will be no change to superannuation laws—not one jot, not one tittle.


A quote which should live in memory, along with the tremendous quote the House was reminded of just a few moments ago by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, 'The four years of surpluses I announce tonight,' 


when he brought down a budget which delivered no such thing. The onlyexplanation I can think of is that both the former Treasurer and the former Prime Minister are enthusiastic residents of Second Life, which is a virtual world in which you create a representation of yourself called an avatar. It also has its own virtual currency. Perhaps the former Treasurer found a particular version of Second Life in which the virtual currency which is used has the amazing property to always deliver a surplus, no matter how extraordinarily economically inept you are.


Over the last six years of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government we had the most extraordinary record of economic ineptitude and that is true as much of superannuation as it is in every other aspect of economic policy. The shadow Treasurer, speaking earlier, sought to cloak himself in the legacy of the Hawke and Keating years, but the legacy of this dismal side opposite is the legacy of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years, years which began with that strangely convoluted promise I have just cited, 'no change to the superannuation laws—not one jot, not one tittle', the 'Ruddbot' obviously at that point having a bit of a programming difficulty and lapsing into its own peculiar form of language. 


But did the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government deliver on those promises? In fact, what we saw was a chaotic and relentless series of changes to the rules governing superannuation. And who was deeply involved in all of that? Of course, the current Leader of the Opposition who was then the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation. He was deeply involved, as was the now shadow Treasurer. From the 2008 budget onwards we saw a relentless series of tax increases, some $9 billion of increases on the tax applying to superannuation. We saw a consistent and repeated record, change after change, some 11 separate rounds of superannuation tax hikes. We saw the concessional contribution limit drop from $100,000 to $50,000 and then to $25,000; it was frozen at $25,000.


We saw the continuing uncertainty that operated across all of the policy settings in superannuation. Who can forget in 2013 the chaotic and desperate process that the then government went through as they cast around for some new measures under which they could extract additional tax out of superannuation? At one point, there was going to be a tax on the balance held in a superannuation fund above a level of $800,000. There were going to be additional contributions taxes—indeed, that was where they ultimately settled.


But the rules kept changing, and it was in response to that relentless series of changes that Australians increasingly lost confidence in the superannuation rules, because, if they continued to change, then what rational person was going to say, 'This is a wise place to be putting my retirement savings'? That is a very clear distinction between the policy approach on this side of the House and the policy approach that we saw from the other side of the House in relation to superannuation for six or seven years. We saw continued, repeated changes to the rules. When the then Labor government came to power in 2007, there was a super co-contribution of $1,500; when they left, it had gone down to $500. There was change after change after change.


We have been clear and honest and consistent with the Australian people in what we took to the election in 2013 and the measures which we are moving to implement now. We made it clear that we intended to pause the increase in the superannuation guarantee charge because it did not make sense to make a commitment to do something which could not be afforded. That is the clear position on this side of House. We want a sustainable superannuation system. We are strong believers in superannuation, and we are strong believers in an affordable system.

Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley) (16:24):  The retirees and pensioners of Australia will not forget this rotten Liberal government for what it is doing to their life savings and the national savings pool of this government, and Labor will make sure that they do not forget. But we will not be on our own, because it is the pensioners' organisations and the retirees' organisations, that represent millions of retirees, millions of Australians, that are out there making sure that their members do not forget either—and, believe me, their voices are loud, and they are people who vote with their conscience when it comes to decisions on their retirement savings and their pensions. And, oh boy, they won't forget this!


So we are not alone in thinking that this is a rotten Liberal government that has done the wrong thing by pensioners, has broken every single promise it made, and is doing the wrong thing by retirees. In fact, the Financial Services Council's media release today had this headline:


Super guarantee delay will mean $128 billion less in savings for working Australians


That is an awful lot of money. That is by 2025, due to the delay of the 12 per cent superannuation guarantee that Labor would have achieved—and this government could have achieved, if it had had vision; if it had had foresight and, dare I say it, if it had actually cared for retirees and pensioners.


None of the evidence would suggest that these people here—the government of the Liberal Party and the National Party—care because, if they did, they would actually understand that this is a positive move for the economy and a positive move for pensioners and retirees. This actually saves you money. It saves you money in the short term, the medium term and the long term.


What does John Brogden, CEO of the FSC, have to say about this? He says:


We are concerned it could exacerbate the nation’s low savings rate and that costs will be passed on to future generations.


So the CEO of the FSC says that the Liberal Party will be passing on the costs to future generations. Disgraceful—that is what I have to say! He also acknowledges in there that:


Australians are living longer and need to plan for their retirement with certainty.


Well, Labor agrees. It appears that the Liberal Party does not agree.


It also appears that the Liberal Party has not figured out that, this year alone, the government will save $6 billion in age pension costs because of the superannuation guarantee—because of our retirement savings pool. This would be a cost-benefit—a benefit to the country and to the economy and to the budget, if the Liberal Party would allow it; if it had vision; if it could see beyond its own ideology and beyond its nose. But it is too busy.


This is a Liberal Party too busy doing the exact opposite of everything it said it would do just before the election. Breaking every single promise would be about as close as it gets to consistency and certainty. That I am certain of—when they talk about certainty, what they mean is: 'We will break every single promise,' and the list is being ticked off very, very quickly.


This is a deal that they said would never be done: 'No deals; no uncertainty; no new taxes' and the list went on and on and on. But they are happy to deal with the Palmer United Party to see the low-income superannuation contribution for Australia's lowest-paid workers scrapped—full stop; gone. They are happy to do a dirty deal on that, as long as it suits their political agenda.


But who pays the price? Who is it that wears the cost? Two-and-a-half million of Australia's lowest-paid workers, the majority of whom are women and need the bigger support.


So the next time any of us hears the Liberal Party talking about how concerned they are about the ageing population, and saying: 'We've got to try and help women to get a little bit more money in the kitty for their retirement savings,' we will say: 'How disingenuous is that! You've got an opportunity. It is actually done for you. All the work is done. You've just got to let it sit and allow it to continue. Don't scrap it, don't delay it, don't make the bad decisions, and it's a done deal.' Yet they are doing the exact opposite.


If they came in here and could actually articulate just one good reason—just one, apart from doing a deal and saying, 'The business of government is dirty,' and, 'We don't have any choice,' and, 'We've got to save ourselves from the budget crisis,' and, 'We've got to call these things in'—

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (16:29):  This is yet another supposedly 'critical matter of public importance' by those opposite, complaining of some hypothetical 'hurt' to Australians. I remember speaking on a debate just last week with very similar wording. It is great to see that those opposite have so little to complain about, they cannot even change their MPI statements.


Those opposite must be total hypochondriacs; they complain of hurt here, and hurt there. They talk about hurt to education, when funding to education has gone up under the coalition. They talk about hurt to seniors, when the pension continues to go up under the coalition. They talk about hurt to health, when the funding for health continues to increase under the coalition. They talk about hurt for senior Australians, when the coalition has already moved to reduce the cost of living for older Australians, and to provide incentives to business to employ them. The intestinal fortitude of those opposite to come into this place and make out that the coalition has somehow done wrong by aged pensioners and senior Australians is unfathomable. 


Since those opposite obviously have minds with as many holes in them as their economic policy, I will take this opportunity to remind the opposition of their own record when it comes to older Australians. They were the party that introduced the carbon tax, which raised the cost of living despite promises to the contrary. They were the ones who attacked private health insurance, hurting older Australians and self-funded retirees who were already doing the right thing and contributing where they could to the cost of their retirement and health. And they were the ones who increased the pension age to 67.


I believe that Australians are getting sick and tired of Labor tooting their truth-tilting trumpets, and it is time to set the record straight on the coalition's aged-care changes. We are all aware that one of the biggest problems that Australia faces into the future is our ageing population. And the coalition is taking action. The coalition is addressing the limitations of our current system to ensure that we get the best outcomes possible for older Australians, now and into the future. 


The coalition is ensuring that the sustainability of aged care is not put at risk, ensuring that we will be able to provide quality care for older Australians now and into the future. The changes are designed to make the aged-care system: more sustainable, more efficient, more flexible and easier to access and navigate. Contrary to the malicious trumpeting of those opposite, there will always be a safety net. We are asking people who can afford to contribute to the cost of their aged care to do so.


I would like to make it clear that these changes were already taking effect, and the coalition inherited them from the previous Labor government. But our incoming government did not start with a clean slate. If it had been a coalition government at the helm at the time, these changes may have been slightly different. These aged-care changes have their origin in a Productivity Commission report from 2011. 


It is a great shame that we cannot afford a luxurious suite of aged-care policies. Our aged-care generation deserves them. But, with Labor having plunged Australia into the fastest deterioration of debt in our modern history, if no action was taken on Labor's reckless spending commitments, within a decade our interest repayments would have been $3 billion a month. That is three thousand million dollars every month wasted. With this money we could afford to give every aged pensioner their own 24/7 personal nurse. This is money we could put to dementia research, free pharmaceuticals, free treatment for arthritis, cancer research—you name it—this money could made a real difference. 


But we do not have the money for these initiatives; we do not have the money, as a result of poor and reckless financial management by those opposite. Instead all of us are forced to tighten our belts and to rein in spending, to pay off their irresponsible fiscal incompetence. It is shameful.


It is laughable that those opposite are claiming that the coalition is hurting Australians. It was Labor who tried to stand in the way of the government honouring its election commitment to self-funded retirees, to index the income threshold for the Commonwealth seniors health card to inflation from 20 September this year. Labor voted against legislation to provide wider access to this card that provides essential and affordable medical services to nearly 300,000 senior Australians.


Those opposite remain in their fictitious fairyland filled with foolish fantasies. They have no clue when it comes to doing the right thing by older Australians.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:34):  The member for Oxley dealt with the grubby changes to superannuation that are going to impact millions of Australians in terms of their financial security. The member for Jagajaga talked about pensions. I want to refer the member for Ryan—she did say that there was almost no adverse impacts on pensions and senior Australians—to page 192 of Budget Paper No. 2, which shows $1.3 billion in cuts for pension concessions; for utilities, for transport, for registration et cetera. Page 203 of this document—if you had bothered to look at it, Member for Ryan—shows $449 million in cuts to pensions; veterans pensions, disability pensions, carers payments, age pensions. That is what it shows. And, if those members have a look at their own document, they will see there are cuts to pensions for older Australians. 


But what age pensioners need is support, greater choice and financial security. They need more support and care at home. They need greater access to residential aged care. We did Living Longer, Living Better. I will deal with the third aspect of this MPI: support to older Australians and the cuts the coalition is undertaking. What did they do within days of getting into government? They cut the workforce supplement, which was there to help aged-care providers with assistance for nurses and carers in aged-care facilities—$1.1 billion. They cut the funding in the workforce supplement. They followed it up in the budget with $653 million in cuts; getting rid of the aged-care payroll tax exemption supplement. The aged-care sector had no idea this was coming. It was a one-two punch to the head for the aged-care sector. It meant that a sector with low profit margins could not provide the assistance. I met today with Leading Age Services Australia, LASA, to talk about this and the impact on older Australians because of the cuts that this government has perpetrated on senior Australians.


Then, just before Dementia Awareness Month, this government cuts the dementia and severe behaviour supplement; 330,000 Australians need that help in residential aged-care facilities. Now the children of people in those aged-care facilities have to go there to provide the support and assistance that aged-care providers and residential aged-care homes should be providing. And all those opposite bemoan this. They go back to their listening posts and mobile offices and say: 'We have cut the dementia and severe behaviours supplement'. 


There was no notice given to the industry. It was not in the MYEFO and it was not in the budget—but after the budget. The sector did not know about it. This sector is under so much pressure from the cuts of those opposite. They did not tell the sector about this before the election—and they did not tell them that they were going to get rid of the payroll tax exemption supplement either. What the government have done is make it harder for older Australians in residential aged-care facilities. Where are they going to get the doctors, nurses, carers and accountants? Where are they going to provide assistance? 


We know that older Australians need support. This is a country with an ageing demographic. At Federation four per cent of Australians were over 65 years of age; now it is 14 per cent and it is going to be 25 per cent in the next couple of decades. There will be a million Australians in this country with dementia, and those opposite do not care at all—because they are cutting the funding for this sort of assistance in the homes. That is what they have done—with no consultation with the sector.


Those consequential cuts will have an impact on the kind of care those people in dementia units get. They have kept the cognition supplement—the extra 10 per cent—for the homecare packages for people with dementia who are in their home. But they cut the funding, the extra $16.15 a day—that is all it is—for those people in dementia units. I say to those opposite: go back to your listening post, your mobile offices and your aged-care homes—go to Blue Care—and tell them that you are cutting the funding. Those opposite will pay a big price for their cuts to support for aged care. They will pay a big price for their cuts to support the pension and the cuts to support superannuation. In places like Townsville, Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Gladstone, Bundaberg and Rockhampton, they will rue the day they did this.

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (16:39):  Sometime this morning—and I am not sure exactly what time it was—the member for McMahon wrote to Madam Speaker notifying her of a matter of public importance. Sometime between him writing and despatching that letter and about four o'clock this afternoon those opposite appear to have lost interest in this matter of public importance. When the member for Blair, their fourth speaker, rose to his feet, there were only two Labor members in this House—the member for Blair himself and the member for Greenway.


I think this seriously brings into question the genuineness of this matter of public importance that has been raised by those in opposition. I believe that they should consider their position in relation to raising future matters of public importance, if the way that they are going to deal with this is by having limited members in the chamber to put the positions.


This indicates loudly and clearly that this is not a real matter of public importance for those opposite. What this is is an opportunity for them to endeavour to raise cheap political points. This matter of public importance has not been raised out of any genuineness at all to debate this matter or out of any real concern about the issues that they have raised. This is all about those opposite trying to portray the government as nasty and out to get people. It is a confected narrative. This is all about their disgraceful, sneering class warfare tactics—which are about the only thing that Labor has left. They certainly do not have any solutions. The Leader of the Opposition proved that very clearly when he stood up in his budget reply speech and offered not one single alternative to address the challenges that our government, our nation and our economy must face. And there are serious challenges that our nation must face—not the least of which is the economic mess that Labor left behind.


It is astounding, and we should never ever forget, that in less than six years Labor saddled us with five successive budget deficits totalling $191 billion and racked up a further $123 billion in deficits into the future. The nation went from a position where we had money in the bank to one where we now pay over $12 billion each year on interest payments alone, just on the debt Labor racked up in those six short years. That is the reality and that is what we have to fix. If we do not act now, in 10 years time we will be paying an incredible $32 billion a year just in interest payments. That is more than we currently spend on aged care, schools and child care combined. Under Labor's 'let's not change a thing', head-in-the-sand, fingers-in-the-ears approach, we would continue racking up debt and wasting obscene amounts of money every single year in interest payments. Our government did not create this mess, but we are accepting the responsibility for fixing it.


When you look at how Labor got us into the mess, you get a shining example with the minerals resource rent tax—or the mining tax as it is known. The superannuation changes Labor refer to in this debate are a result of repealing promises they made that were to be funded from the profits of the mining tax. The only problem was that the profits did not flow. The tax was an absolute shocker. The original mining tax was expected to raise $49.4 billion over five years, and on that basis Labor made all sorts of promises, including changes to superannuation. It was then altered and forecast to raise $29.5 billion over the five years. However, it was then expected to raise just $668.5 million over the forward estimates to 2017-18.


The previous government had an appalling record and it has been left to this government to try to fix the mess. It is really about time that those opposite recognised that the situation that this government finds itself in is entirely their fault and that they need to start working actively to fix their mistakes.

 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (16:44):  What is absolutely beyond debate is that there are now adverse changes to superannuation. It is also beyond debate that there are changes to the aged pension. And it is also beyond debate, for the purposes of the member for McPherson, that there are cuts to support for elderly Australians. I will let everyone in on a secret here: superannuation impacts on all of our communities, not just those in Labor electorates. It impacts on every family, on all workers and on all our communities—as I said—not just those that happen to reside in a Labor electorate. If you look around, you will find them in your own backyard but I do not expect you to go and look there because mainly they are going to be workers—people who actually go out and work for an income—and superannuation is very important to them.


I am old enough to remember how superannuation was brought about in this country. Superannuation is a vital scheme, one that provides a benefit for those who are going to retire. It gives people the opportunity to retire with dignity. Back before the mid-eighties, the only people who had superannuation were the public servants and those who occupied white collar management positions in the private sector in this country. It did not apply to workers and it certainly did not apply to blue collar workers. I did leave parliamentarians out because they had this rolled gold untouchable superannuation scheme—some of them still do.


The trade union movement pursued superannuation throughout the mid-eighties until we had award based superannuation. It took a Labor government until about 1992 to actually legislate to provide compulsory superannuation for all Australian workers. There is one group of people that sit around these benches that opposed that. Do you know who it was? It was all those opposite. They failed to support it. They failed to support it while they were occupying those benches and while sitting on their own parliamentary superannuation scheme—the untouchable scheme that had a benefit that was far better than anybody else in this country. They said 'no' and voted against superannuation for Australian workers.


People do come to this debate with a little bit of history. What is wrong with people being able to retire with dignity? What is wrong with encouraging people to save for their future? As I said, the Libs do come to this with a little bit of history.


Russell was around long enough to actually see this unfold. Back when this legislation was going through, there was one member on that side of the House who decided to speak on behalf of the Liberal Party and who occupied the position of shadow industrial relations spokesperson. Let me quote the Prime Minister's words in 1995: Compulsory superannuation is one of the biggest con jobs ever foisted by government on the Australian people.


That is what the Liberal Party thought of compulsory superannuation. They did not mind sitting on their superannuation here in this place and, fortunately, they still supported our public servants receiving their superannuation. But for anybody else out there, they thought they should just rely on the pension. They did not even get the idea of encouraging people to provide for their future or what reducing the public's reliance on pensions would mean for community saving.


We should have heard the alarm bells go. I am sure the member for McPherson, when this promise was unveiled, probably thought it was true that no unexpected changes would be made to people's superannuation. They went to an election on that basis. And now they want to come in here and make these changes, to give the Treasurer this unfettered power to delay the further advancement of superannuation, which will not only delay the growth of current superannuation contributions to 12 per cent but it will also reduce the pool of people's savings. I would have thought that would have intergenerational impacts on future budgets as well.


If those opposite are going to reduce the amount of savings that people are going to bring to bear in their superannuation, where are they going to top that up from? They are not going to do it out of the pensions because they have already cut those. Those opposite have already moved to reduce the indexation rates of pensions and are going to make sure that these pensioners pay. How will they make them pay? They have this great idea, Tony Abbott says: they are going to make sure that people retire when they are 70. We are going to have the highest retirement age in the world. (Time expired)

Dr HENDY
 (Eden-Monaro) (16:49):  A question for the Leader of the Opposition: where is the money coming from, Mr Shorten? I begin by reminding the House of the enormous damaging budgetary legacy that the ALP left this government to clean up. We have been talking a lot about it since May this year when the budget was released but it does not seem to have sunk into the heads of the people opposite. Australia cannot go on borrowing a billion dollars every single month just to pay the interest on Labor borrowings. This is wasted money that could otherwise be building roads, schools or hospitals or paying for tax cuts for long-suffering taxpayers. Under Labor, Australia ran six straight years of record budget deficits. Labor left the coalition a further $123 billion in projected deficits and gross debt is forecast to hit $667 billion—that is, $25,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia or $25,000 for every person in my electorate of Eden-Monaro.


This year's budget papers show that even with the government's efforts to repair the budget there will be four more deficits over the next four years. That would make 10 deficits in a row and would be unprecedented in our post war history. We did not create Labor's mess but said we will fix it and that is exactly what we are doing. In fact, the amazing hypocrisy is that one of the architects of that debt and deficit disaster, the member for McMahon, the former Treasurer, has sought to debate this issue today although he is not here. That shows what he really thinks about the issue. In fact, there are only three members of the ALP in the chamber at the moment and one is just about to leave. So as the member for McPherson said, that just gives you an indication of how seriously they really regard this issue.


Despite what our opponents state, the government is honouring its election commitments to aged pensioners and self funded retirees to make no changes to the age pension in this term of government and to index the income thresholds to the consumer price index for the Commonwealth seniors health card for self funded retirees. In fact, aged pensioners will benefit because the government is scrapping the carbon tax. That will reduce price pressures. Aged pensioners will also continue to receive the compensation payment after the carbon tax is scrapped. So that is an extra boost.


What the opposition wants to ignore in their pursuit of scare campaigns is that Australia faces a major demographic shift as the baby boomer generation enters retirement. We will have more retirees than ever before and they will be living longer. That is an unavoidable fact and a proven government has only one course of action: that is, to deal with the issues head-on. The demographic challenge will have major implications for the aged pension system. If we wish to have a sustainable aged pension system that looks after those who need it most now and into the future, we must reform it.


When I go around my electorate of Eden-Monaro, seniors in my seat understand that there is a monumental task that needs to be addressed. Australia needs a well-targeted, means-tested income support system which provides financial assistance to those most in need while encouraging self-provision whenever possible. One part of our policy is to deal with the aged pension age. The previous government enacted legislation to increase the aged pension to 67 years by July 2023. They do not like us reminding the Australian people about the fact that they did that. New legislation from this government will continue the process they set up to increase the aged pension age until it reaches— (Time expired)

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2014-09-02,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (16:53):  I am so disappointed that that earlier contribution was cut so short!


When I was so rudely interrupted by an event earlier today, I was talking about regional universities and the impact of the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014, particularly about regional universities, students, their families and communities in the Northern Territory.


We do know that universities which will be most disadvantaged by these cuts are those most reliant on public funding—the smaller regional universities in particular.


Minister Pyne says :


Regional students and their communities will be among the big winners from the Abbott Government’s higher education reforms …


Well, blah, blah, blah—we all know that is wrong. Let me just give the contrary view, as expressed by the former vice-chancellor of Melbourne University, Prof Kwong Lee Dow, who said:


Whatever finally emerges from the political machinations with the Senate, students will be paying significantly more, and rural and regional students will be disproportionately affected.


Which is precisely what I have been saying.


The minister argues that regional universities will benefit in attracting students by keeping fees low. He has the Bunnings model of higher education for regional students, based on keeping costs and prices low and keeping volume of throughput high. I have news for him: this is based on what I think is a very poor and mistaken assumption that regional universities will be in a position to reduce their fees and absorb the funding cuts. Regional students and universities will be reduced in this process—the process being imposed upon them by this government—to second-rate institutions!


Regional universities enrol well above the sector average when it comes to the proportion of domestic students who are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, who come from low-SES backgrounds and who are from regional and rural areas. For example, Charles Darwin University has the highest Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander enrolment in the country at 7.3 per cent. Monash University has 0.4 per cent. Charles Darwin University has a low-SES student cohort of 19.6 per cent. The University of Sydney—that great sandstone university which really wants these processes—has only 7.8 per cent. And Charles Darwin University has students from a regional and remote background at 63 per cent and Macquarie University has 5.9 per cent. Those are just three examples of the way in which Charles Darwin University, in this case, is looking after the interests of those people who we want to target to make sure they get a better educational outcome.


The minister says that new scholarships will produce record levels of scholarships for disadvantaged students and will be of particular benefit to regional students and regional universities. However, as we know, this scheme is basically funded by an internal 20 per cent tax on increased course fees. An increase in fees for any university where more than 20 per cent of its student cohort comes from a disadvantaged low-SES background will be more than the average value of the Commonwealth scholarship. Therefore, if the university wanted to award every low-SES student a scholarship this would be less than the increase in fees used to fund them and the university would be losing.


By contrast, universities with the lowest levels of disadvantaged student enrolments will be in position to offer more generous scholarships—that is, Sydney, Melbourne and the like—and to attract the best students from the bush. I know this to be the case: this is what regional universities fear. That is, regional unis might be unable to compete to keep the best students from their own communities. This poses a significant threat to viability and long-term educational opportunities for those communities, and particularly puts the social and economic health of regional communities at risk.


Professor Andrew Van, the vice-chancellor of Charles Sturt University said:


The second concern I have is with the impacts on workforce supply. In the existing system we have been able to boost the supply of skilled professionals in regional areas. I worry that this may be undermined by these changes as regional students are put off studying.


Universities like CDU are a key social, cultural and economic part of their local and regional communities. Considerable public investment has been put into establishing these universities where people live and work in regional Australia. It would be highly regressive to the prosperity of our nation—and it is clear that this will be the case—if our regional universities are closed down or reduced to cut-price, or find that they cannot offer the breadth of courses that they currently offer to compete with other universities—the sandstone universities and private companies—which have no long-term investment in the community.


A 20 per cent cut to Commonwealth grants funding—as I said earlier today, in CDU's case—will mean a cut of $50.4 million over the four-year period 2016-2019. Immediately, for a regional university like Charles Darwin there are some programs they would not be able to fund and courses that they would not be able to provide.


We know what the government is on about here. What they are doing is unfair, unreasonable and unwanted. They need to go back to the drawing board and do something which is reasonable, fair and wanted by the Australian community, and not discriminate against those people who aspire to have further education.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (16:59):  I like the member for Lingiari and it is an honour to follow a man who has been around as long as he has. I will take issue with one thing he said in his speech though. He said that people raised the issue of lawyers making a lot of money and paying a lot of tax, so why should they be paying for this? This was a question that Andrew Tillett from The West Australian asked Minister Christopher Pyne at a Press Club address. If I could quote the minister's answer because he may very well have been answering the question posed by the member for Lingiari. Christopher Pyne said:


Well, I think it's a bit of a specious argument, actually, since you asked me what I think about that. I think it's a specious argument because it's really an argument for not charging anyone anything because we all pay taxes and it's the same argument you could say that when I turn up to get my motor registration I shouldn't have to pay for it because I pay taxes anyway.


We believe that competition between higher education providers will force universities to be reasonable in setting fees. If they charge too much, they will have empty lecture theatres. Higher education providers will have to compete for students and when they compete for students, the students win. The government believe in the transformational power of higher education and that is why we will provide around $37 billion in funding for teaching at higher education institutions over the next four financial years.


It is with much pleasure that I speak on the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014 because this is something which I believe the country needs. I back my minister, Christopher Pyne, and my university, James Cook University, or JCU, in making sure that our higher education sector performs to its utmost ability and remains a supplier of quality, world-class education and is a sought after destination for education throughout the world. 


I was asked to attend a forum at James Cook University called by the National Tertiary Education Union. At that forum, the NTEU executive asked all those there the following questions. Who voted for the 20 per cent rise in the cost of university education? Where in the Liberal Party pre-election campaign did they clearly state that the cost of university education was to rise? Labor Senator Jan McLucas gleefully added, 'It's ridiculous to think that a government would go to an election and not be up-front about it.' Then I rose but did not make the obvious retort 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead' but asked the people there: 'Who voted to float the dollar in 1993 and was that taken to an election as a commitment? Did the Labor Party take the decision to push thousands of single mums off their pensions to the election? Did the Labor Party take the scrapping of the chronic disease dental scheme to an election to get a mandate?' The answer to all those is 'no'. I could go on and name 1,000 things which were not taken to an election yet have become law and are part of our lives. On each occasion, the elected government made decisions based on the data before it and acted on what it believed were in the best interests of the country. 


The new member for Rankin says it was a brilliant decision to float the dollar. They had an election in February 1983 and there was not a word about floating the dollar. Yet, 10 months later they made a decision to alter our currency policy and we have been the better country for it. Did Dr Chalmers in his extensive interview on the subject castigate Hawke and Keating on their decision to act and not put it to an election? No, he did not. His confected outrage and that of his party and his mates in the Greens only extend as far as they need for a cheap political headline, and that is what really bugs me about this.


Bob Hawke went to the 1983 election with a huge range of popular promises, only to be confronted with a larger than expected deficit and simply junked most of his agenda. To a large extent, this is what our government has had to face. We have come into office knowing there was a real issue of debt and deficit and we promised we would address the debt and deficit issue, but not to the extent needed when we discovered the mess Labor left. 


I have used the floating dollar analogy for a specific purpose. It was a decision which had many benefits for the majority of Australians. It has transformed our economy. Not everyone was happy with the decision and not everyone was a winner, but we as a nation have prospered because of it. Some people still want to wind-back the clock and change it back. That is what we see Labor standing for today. Their rhetoric today is more about free education than student participation in the cost of their education. Labor seem to have forgotten conveniently that they brought about the co-contribution to university education. Their political opportunism and relentless negativity on this knows no bounds. 


This bill will spread opportunity to many students, including disadvantaged students and rural and regional students. These reforms will equip our universities to face the challenges of the 21st century in a global education market. We need to unleash the capacity of our universities to be as good as they can be, to specialise if necessary, or possible, to ensure that they have the best possible outcome for their students. 


Universities Australia came out last week and called for the parliament to support the deregulation of Australian universities. Universities Australia Chief Executive, Belinda Robinson, said that the parliament had a once in a generation opportunity to shape an Australian higher education system that is sustainable, affordable and equitable in serving the best interests of students and the nation. She said:


With budgets under pressure, governments faced with a myriad of competing priorities for public funding, and successive governments being disinclined to invest at the level that repeated independent reports have shown to be needed, full deregulation of higher education is needed.


Either the status quo of ongoing inadequate investment, or further cuts without deregulation will condemn Australia's great university system to inevitable decline, threaten our international reputation and make it increasingly difficult for universities to meet the quality expectations of our students …


In transforming lives, Australian universities transform the nation. They make for a civil society, are the lifeblood of our regions and provide the means for securing Australia's place in the highly competitive knowledge-based global market of the future. Education is Australia's third largest export.


The introduction into Parliament of the Federal Government's higher education legislation is a chance for all parliamentarians to seize the opportunity for making real, lasting changes that are needed in positioning our universities for the challenges of the future.


Are they happy with absolutely everything we have proposed? The answer is obviously 'no'. But do they see the greater good here and a critically important sector of our society and economy that is under great pressure? The answer is a resounding 'yes'. I will come to the objections later.


Australian National University Vice-Chancellor, Professor Ian Young, in his address to the National Press Club gave an impassioned and wide-ranging speech across a number of issues. His first words were:


Higher education and research in Australia is at a cross-road. It is time for us to make choices about what we want for our country and what we want for future generations. Time to make choices about the future of our universities.


Some of the other things he raised in that address were:


Australia is a nation that has yet to realise its full potential.


We all like to believe that the Australian education system is envied around the world.


And further:


Hard analysis shows that our rhetoric is better than our performance. Australian higher education is not bad but it is not yet brilliant.


To build an education system that is brilliant, we have to stop funding universities the same way regardless of how they teach. We have to stop the endless per-student funding cuts to higher education.


We have created a perverse incentive that rewards universities for enrolling as many students as possible and teaching them as cheaply as possible. That’s what our current system does.


Those are not my words; those are the words of Professor Ian Young, Vice-Chancellor of the ANU. That is the damning indictment in this whole matter. 


When the budget came down we were able to speak about these reforms. I started by asking my daughter the following questions: 'What is the cost of your degree? What will be your HECS debt level at the end of that degree? And what is your current debt to the HECS system?' She was unable to answer any of these questions. My daughter is no dill and she clearly understands the nature of the system. Her response was that to get the job she wants she needs the degree and to get the degree she has to go to university and complete the course.


The day after the budget was handed down my staff conducted a basic poll. I acknowledge all the way through that my survey is hardly scientific, but it did produce a result which mirrored my own family experience. While we all knew there was a HECS style co-contribution, of the 140 people we asked those questions of at James Cook University that morning, 70 per cent had no idea, 20 per cent had some idea and 10 per cent knew the answers.


Labor seem to be preaching free education. All their rhetoric, all their speeches seem to preach free education. That is what they are saying. The speeches I have heard seem to be saying that they want it free again. Incidentally, Labor did not take the original HECS scheme to an election, either. So, please, can we just drop this thing about what bad governments do in between. You have to get on and govern with the decisions you have been able to face. Talk of degrees and debts in the hundreds of thousands of dollars is just that—it is talk. For every person who says that they will owe $200,000 for a degree, there is a university which says that is just not the case.


I note that Labor does not like this kind of talk, but it is called a market. If someone is charging too much or not providing value for money, the market will move elsewhere. While some courses will cost more, it will be the market which sets the price for them. A degree in science at James Cook University will be a brilliant degree. And, again, this is where I disagree with the member for Lingiari because, with its access to facilities on Orpheus Island, the Great Barrier Reef, the beautiful campuses in Townsville and Cairns, and out to a working cattle station, the demand for this course and JCU's work in the tropical world will mean that this will be a valuable commodity. But will JCU be able to saddle students with debts of $200,000 just because they want to? No, because Griffith, UQ, QUT or Sydney uni will all be in that market as well.


Our reforms mean that the biggest winner will be the students, especially low-SES students. As Minister Pyne said yesterday, in answer to a question:


… the biggest winners from the government's higher education reforms will be the university students, especially first-generation university goers … to the tune of 80,000 more students a year by 2018. They will also benefit by the introduction of the largest Commonwealth scholarship fund in Australia's history and they will benefit by more revenue for universities, leading to more research and better quality teaching. In return, the government is asking, on behalf of the taxpayers, that students contribute 50 per cent of the cost of their education—when they are currently contributing 40 per cent. So we are asking for a 50-50 split—that is, 50 per cent from the taxpayer and 50 per cent from students, when currently it is 60-40 in favour of the student.


They do not have to pay one single cent up-front and they do not have to pay anything until they earn over $53,000. This talk about a US-style education system is just not true. Why change? Why not do what Australian governments did for decades in industries such as the motor vehicle industry—just keep putting funds in, with no plan, where you will end up with no industry? That is what happens.


I would just like to also quote from Minister Pyne's second reading speech. He said:


Currently our universities are at risk of being left behind and overtaken by the growing university systems in our region and across the globe as these systems increase their capacity and new forms of online and blended delivery take hold. 


We must aspire to not only keep up with our competitors, but keep ahead of them. 


The government's changes will give Australian universities the freedom and autonomy to work to their strengths, be internationally competitive and manage economic and social changes to the best of their abilities.


This bill provides a level playing field for students, no matter what their study choices are. It removes the punitive loan fee of 20 per cent for VET FEE-HELP—helping tens of thousands of Australians undertaking VET courses—and gets rid of the 25 per cent loan fee for FEE-HELP for those who study with private institutions. It removes the lifetime limits on all Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) schemes and discontinues the ineffective HECS-HELP benefit.


He went on:


Regional students and regional higher education institutions will benefit significantly as we expand the demand driven system to enable study in more places in more ways. 


Universities, TAFEs and private providers will have new incentives and opportunities to develop innovative partnerships, particularly in outer-metropolitan and regional areas, where they can work together to offer the skills and knowledge that local employers want in their employees.


In conclusion, I raise the example of Central Queensland University. They see nothing but opportunity here to the point where they have bought a TAFE. They want that. Sandra Harding is vice-chancellor of James Cook University. She is not happy with absolutely everything in the package. But from a regional university perspective, she says, 'Bring on the competition.' She is hungry for the opportunity to compete, because James Cook University will stand on its own. CQU will stand on its own; it knows where it is. These people want to get up and make more from their opportunity and deliver more for their students. That is what this legislation is about. It is not about what used to be; it is about what can be. It is not about what you used to do; it is about what you will do. It is not about the education system we have; it is about where we are in the world. We have to value our education system. All this talk of free education must stop. These reckless promises must stop. 


I commend the bill to the House and I stand right beside the value of my university.

"Ryan, Joanne, MP",ALP,2014-09-02,"



Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (17:14):  I rise to outline my strong opposition to the government's Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014. I declare straight out that I had a free university education. I would correct the member for Herbert: I have not heard one Labor member suggest in a speech given today that university education should be completely free—not one—and those assertions do not do this place justice. This government continues to be full of surprises, despite their assertions before the election. The higher education bill confirms that this government has introduced cuts to every level of education, from child care all the way through to postgraduate study. Combined, these decisions act to entrench inequity at all levels of education. This is done while those opposite scream at our young people: 'You must earn or learn.' Today's legislation closes the loop on access and equity in education and makes the ability of young people in this country to meet that demand so much harder.


These changes will again hit low- and middle-income families and will risk locking people from my community out of university. In Lalor, people of all ages want to talk about this unfair change. Families are seriously looking at their options to assess if university is possible for their children, and, meanwhile, the minister cruelly quips that he is not asking for their left kidney. No, just their future. Here we see the final nail in the coffin. With this bill they have basically told people in Lalor to just give up. They have closed the door on opportunity. Andrea Toohey, a resident of Lalor, wrote to me this morning and said:


Joanne my son has been working long hrs at Coles during his gap year to help support himself at Uni in Ballarat next yr. He may need to keep working for a long while yet? It's a shame to think his career choice may be totally out of reach.


This bill threatens to lock people out of future prosperity.


The member for Herbert has left, but I would point out a discriminatory difference regarding some of the assertions that he made. Governments may have to bring in legislation beyond an election. That is not what we are talking about. We are talking about a government that made promises—plural—before an election and is now breaking them. Despite the promises, it acted to the contrary. On education, the Prime Minister said:


… I want to give people this absolute assurance, no cuts to education …


I cannot count the number of times I have heard it repeated. That was on 1 September 2013—that is, before the election. On universities, he said:


If we have to change it, we will consult beforehand rather than impose it unilaterally and argue about it afterwards.


It is clear to me that that spoke to an intent. That was in February 2013. It could not be clearer, really. Minister Pyne said:


We want university students to make their contribution, but we're not going to raise fees …


That was in November 2013—emphatic, after the election. When the interviewer asked, 'Why not raise university fees?' Minister Pyne said:


Because we promised we wouldn't before the election …


Doubly emphatic, even after the election. My favourite quote of all would have to be from their own Liberal Party policy document. Even when he puts things in writing, you cannot rely on what the Prime Minister says. In their 'Real Solutions' policy document, in chapter 17, page 40 and 41, they say:


We will ensure the continuation of the current arrangements of university funding.


That is in writing: 'current arrangements will continue'. That is right: the document is called 'Real Solutions'. It seems to have gone from the memories of those opposite. It was the contract they put to the Australian people, but it was not real; it reflects the fantasy they took to the election.


Actions speak louder than words, and this bill proves once again that they were an opposition prepared to promise anything to get into power and now they are a government that cannot be trusted to keep their word. What they fail to understand is the real impact the decisions they are making are having on the Australian people. What they fail to understand is that these measures are unfair.


Let me go through this bill. It strips money away from universities and gives them no choice but to hit students with higher fees. This bill will see $100,000-plus university degrees. It rips $5.8 billion out of Australian universities. This bill adds to the Abbott and Hockey rap sheet of cruel, unfair cuts. There are $3.2 billion in cuts by taking the scalpel to HELP; $1.9 billion in cuts to universities by reducing government course subsidies; $202 million in cuts by indexing university grants to the CPI; $172.4 million in cuts to fund, promote and reward universities for enrolling low-SES students; $173.7 million in cuts to the training of Australia's research students—the scientists and academics of tomorrow; a $75 million cut to the Australian Research Council; a $31 million cut to the national regulator; and it abolishes the $3.5 billion Education Investment Fund. That is quite a resume. But that is only the beginning. What we have now seen in addition is the full deregulation of student fees from 1 January 2016, which will lead to higher fees and spiralling student debt, and there is the increase in the interest rate burden on that student debt. Most alarming, though, is that the fantasy continues opposite. Members opposite deny people will be deterred under this so-called reform. This could not be further from the truth.


I have spent most of my adult life working in secondary schools in my electorate where the majority of people are what we would call traditional working-class families. For most of those years, I taught senior English to year 11 and 12 students, and I was a senior years coordinator for many years. I know from personal experience what it takes to build aspiration in students, to build confidence and to get them to open their eyes to the possibilities their talents and potential can lead to. I have worked with students and their parents to look seriously at tertiary education as an option. Many of the students who left my care were the first in their families to attend university. One of the biggest hurdles in this was income—families had to forgo a working young person's contribution to the family income. They had to overcome the idea of a reasonable debt, with a payback safety net, as a means to an end to a brighter future. I call on all students from low socioeconomic circumstances in my electorate and across the country who made it to university to stand up and defend the next generation's ability to do so.


Just this year I heard the compelling story of a student who was being supported by Western Chances, a not-for-profit organisation that supports senior secondary students to get to university in the western suburbs of Melbourne. This student is now completing medicine at Monash University. She detailed how hard it was to ask for money in her family when her father had been laid off at work—money for books and excursions. She thought uni was out of reach despite her teachers having identified her talent. Here was a student, clearly identified as being among the brightest and the best, who without help from a not-for-profit did not think she would get to university. With support, she got the books she needed and some tutoring in targeted subjects to ensure she met the tertiary requirements—that subject, in her case, was English. She got to university and she is now a second-year medical student.


But where would she have been now with the government's changes? Indeed, how is she responding to the idea that the interest rate on her HELP debt will increase and compound? How will these changes impact on her future life choices? Most importantly, would she make the same decisions today and will next year's brightest students in the same position make the same decisions? The fact is that those who will be the most deterred by this reform package are from working class families in electorates like mine. What we have seen with this bill is yet another significant barrier being put in place for those seeking long-term prosperity through education.


Some residents of my electorate wrote to me this morning when I said I was going to be making a speech on higher education today. Heather Taylor said:


Many opportunities for students who are bright and intelligent will be lost if higher fees are brought in. University should be an option for all who are capable of passing the enter scores, not just for those who can afford it.


Yajaira, a former student of mine, said:


These changes are just going to put more pressure on young high school students to decide what they want to do their entire future. These things have the potential to affect someone's entire life!


She wanted that read in the chamber today. She wanted those opposite to hear her voice. And Janine Luttick made a really important point:


Increases in undergraduate and postgrad fees will preclude mature-age students from ever paying off their debt during their working life. That makes tertiary education only for the young and the rich. Threats to funding for research students will mean the contributions of some of the nation's best minds to the development of our quality of life will be lost.


These fine people deserve a government that will provide them with real opportunities. And they had a government that provided them with real opportunities—they had a Labor federal government. The fundamental principles of the Labor Party could not be further removed from the measures put forward in this draconian bill. Labor does not support cuts to university funding and student support. Labor does not support a system of higher fees, bigger student debt, reduced access and greater inequality. And Labor does not believe that you should only have an opportunity to go to university if you are rich. When Labor was in government we removed the caps on public university places. From 2009 to 2013 the number of Commonwealth supported places went from 440,000 to 541,000. In my electorate, that saw an increase of more than 50 per cent in the number of students attending university and a 48 per cent increase in the number of students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Under Labor they had opportunity. But under this government they are having the door shut in their face.


The people of Lalor are rightly confused by a government that is ripping away our social compacts, that disregards the community benefit of the best and brightest attending university to ensure that their contribution to our society and to our economy is maximised—not just for their benefit but for all. We are hearing a lot about international competition. We are hearing people say that Australia's universities need to be able to compete. It is as though tertiary education fishes at Australia's border. But one of the unforeseen things that could happen with this reform is that we might find more of our best and brightest studying overseas without any intention of returning to make a contribution here.


I will finish with a question that I have asked in this House a few times, a question that young people have asked me to ask the Prime Minister: why is it that some debt is so bad but student debt is so good? I reject this bill and will firmly stand against it in this House.

"Whiteley, Brett, MP",LP,2014-09-02,"



Mr WHITELEY
 (Braddon) (17:29):  I am thrilled this afternoon to be able to speak as a member of the government in support of the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014. Mr Deputy Speaker, no-one needs to tell you or anyone else in this chamber that higher education is essential to this government's commitment to protecting and improving Australia's economic prosperity. We know that, in order to remain globally competitive, Australia needs a strong and successful knowledge based community. We also know that, while Australian universities have served us well in the past, they are now dropping in world rankings as they face intensifying global competition from institutions that are focused on delivering new and emerging technologies and creating first-class graduates to meet the world's changing demand for skills.


An interesting point about tertiary education in this country—I suspect it is a little-known fact to many of our constituents—is that higher education is our third-largest export. People from around the world, particularly the Asia Pacific region, see this as a happy studying ground for their future. Sadly, over the years of the Labor government in recent times our rankings in this area, our credibility and our integrity of education has dropped to a standard that we have not seen before. 


These reforms that we promote today are exactly that. They are reforms. They are changing the structure of higher education in this country, and it needs to be the case. Professor Ian Young is Vice-Chancellor of ANU. He said that it would be a 'great tragedy' for Australia if parliament blocks the federal government's plan to deregulate university fees. He went on to say it is 'a game-changer and a building block to making our universities brilliant.' In my view, any political party that rails against this fact for political expediency is a disgrace. This was highlighted most recently by the former ALP foreign minister and now Chancellor of the Australian National University, Professor the Hon. Gareth Evans, one of the very staunch, long-term Labor members of this parliament. (Quorum formed) He said: 


It is time to change our one size fits all funding system and let diversity develop. Changes to the system will be controversial, but real change is required if Australia is to offer its young people a real choice in education and produce graduates to match the best in the world.


There is no question within the higher education system about the need to reform the sector. Despite the Labor Party's rallying of radicalised left-wing student groups to oppose these reforms, in fact they are welcomed by a majority of providers and prospective students. They are welcomed because it is only through these reforms that we can continue to maintain and grow prosperity and ensure that our students remain educationally best equipped to meet market needs into the future. 


The Leader of the Opposition's willingness to go around the country aligning himself with radicalised, hard left-wing unionists and professional student politicians—who have shown themselves to be the rabble they are as they try to argue the case for reform by burning effigies and bullying ministers and former members of parliament—is simply due to the fact that the red-flag wavers are the only ones opposing these reforms. Those opposite attend these rallies with great enthusiasm, not because they want to but because they cannot find anyone else willing to stand next to them. David Gonski, Chancellor of the University of New South Wales, and former Labor minister Gareth Evans have both given their broad support for these reforms. 


It was only a few months ago in my office that I hosted a number of university students who wanted to put their case to me in relation to the budget measures that had been announced. What I found very interesting about that meeting was, firstly, they did not come in too many a number. That surprised me. I thought they might have needed a coach. Secondly, when I asked those who did turn up what the cost of their degree was they did not exactly know. They had a rough figure. I asked them, 'How much of that does the government pay?' And their quick response—both of them—was: 'Nothing. We have to pay it back through this damned HECS.' I asked: 'Is that right? You pay it all? So, if your university degree is $40,000, your HECS debt is $40,000.' He said, 'Well, no, my debt's nowhere near that.' And I said, 'Exactly.'


What the university students themselves do not realise, as mentioned by the member for Herbert a moment or two ago, is that the Australian taxpayer, up until this point in time today, meets 60 per cent of the cost of every university degree in this country. The 40 per cent that remains is in fact the HECS debt to be paid by that student when they get to an income of over $53,000. These university students did not know that fact. I cannot believe that in this country people believe that they pick up the total tab. It is not true.


Importantly, for the people in the north-west and west coast of Tasmania, there are a number of measures that are provided for in this bill that are of particular importance but that are conveniently overlooked by Labor senators in my state. It is these measures that I will speak about now. First is the fact that the bill provides important and improved opportunities and support to more students, especially disadvantaged and rural and regional students. Second, the reforms will support students wishing to undertake sub-bachelor degrees through the FEE-HELP scheme. We all know that diploma courses have long provided an important pathway into higher education for less-prepared students, giving them the opportunity to develop the skills needed to further their education. This is particularly important in regional and low-socioeconomic areas such as my electorate of Braddon, where students are far less likely to enter directly into higher education than students living in metropolitan areas. With less than 43 per cent of the Braddon school leavers having completed year 12 studies, alternative pathways to higher education are of fundamental importance to many young people in my electorate. By expanding the current system of Commonwealth subsidies and providing support to students completing accredited diplomas, advanced diplomas and associate degrees, the government is allowing students greater opportunity to either enter university or undertake education through a private provider.


Has anyone in this chamber today heard Tasmanian Labor senators—or any senator, or any Labor member of parliament, for that matter—talk about these exciting opportunities? The answer is clearly no. The member for Lalor, who spoke just before me, using very alarmist language, said that young people in her electorate have given up. I will tell you why they have given up. It is not because of anything we have done. This bill was introduced only this week, and we are only today debating it. People are giving up because leaders in that electorate, such as the member for Lalor, have told them to give up, using scaremongering and alarmist language, painting a dim picture that would certainly turn most people off pursuing their dream of further education. The member for Lalor is responsible for the young people in her electorate giving up and looking to the ground instead of to the sky. It was her party that in the last four years of its term cut $6.6 billion out of the budget for higher education—




Ms O'Dwyer:
  How much?




Mr WHITELEY:
  $6.6 billion—nearly $3 billion of that in the last 12 months alone—not to mention the cutting of research funds across the country.


We have two important outcomes in this bill for students. Firstly, the bill ensures that they are able to study at little or no up-front cost to themselves, even if it is not through a university or TAFE. This alarmist language that says that these reforms will price people out of commencing a higher education journey is absolutely false. There are no up-front costs. Nothing has changed. So, a person from the lowest-income, most-disadvantaged family in my electorate can step to the plate tomorrow and enter into a university degree that will change their life forever. They can enter into a diploma or associate degree that will change their life forever—at no up-front cost. And people opposite, including the Greens, should stop the scaremongering. If they want to have a debate, that is fine. Talk about the facts that are on the table, the measures in the bill that are fact, not alarmist language that scares the daylights out of people with untruths.


Secondly, and just as importantly, the bill provides the student with the due recognition that undertaking a sub-bachelor degree is of equal value to our community as undertaking a university degree. In the north-west of Tasmania that may mean that a student undertaking a course through a private education provider will not face the difficulty of needing to save for up-front course fees but, rather, can defer those fees through the FEE-HELP scheme. That will be a massive help to prospective students in regional Tasmania.


Despite the feigned outrage of members opposite, particularly the Leader of the Opposition, who claim that students will be worse off under these reforms and that the sky will fall in, the truth is that under their government many students not only paid interest tied to the CPI for their loans but were slugged with a 20-plus per cent loan fee. That means that if a university charged $30,000 for a degree then students who were unable to pay up-front were actually charged $36,000 for the degree, plus interest. This bill proposes to remove that fee and instead use the 10-year bond rate to determine the interest rate and then cap it at six per cent. By removing all FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP loan fees that are currently imposed on some students who are undertaking higher education and vocational education and training, the government is making a real contribution to improving educational and employment outcomes for regional Tasmanian students.


I welcome these reforms, because the delivery of the government's commitment to introduce these reforms will change the face of higher education in this country forever. It will give us a fighting chance to place our universities back in the top of the rankings, not see them falling down the league ladder as we are seeing at the moment.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2014-09-02,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (17:44):  Earlier today I was lucky enough to attend a Smart Science Symposium held in his parliament where a hundred scientists, or so it seemed, from around the country gathered to talk about the future vision of this country. The cuts to parliamentary screening procedures must have kicked in. I am sure the government would not knowingly have let that many scientists into the building all at once to talk about what Australia's future might look like and the importance of putting money into research. On the very day that researchers and scientists came here to say that unless we secure the future of research in this country we are going to witness more brain drain as our best and brightest go overseas; that we are not going to secure the type of future economy for this country which would mean that in the 21st century we might have something to sell to the rest of the world, something which is not just coal but is, instead, based on our brains and on the things that people here produce; on the very same day those people have come here to say, 'Let's finally have a vision for a smart Australia where we respect education, where we respect research and where a job in research is treated as importantly as building a car,' this government comes along with a bill that will be a body blow to a smart Australia.


This is not only vital to our future but it is in the Greens' DNA to stand up for research and education. It is personal for me as well. My dad was the first person in his family to go to university. His dad before him worked in the post office as well as serving for his country. My dad's mum spent her life raising the kids, as many women of that generation did. My dad went to university because he could. It was an odd thing for someone in his position to do, but he went because it was affordable and he had the support—including from the government—to continue to study and then not leave with a crippling debt.


 When I was at the university in the 1990s, the first campaigns I started getting involved with were on the rise in costs of education under the then Labor government. I still keep in my office a picture of me at a demonstration with a banner in the early 1990s in my best denim jacket with a Dawson's Creek haircut saying, 'Stop the ALP loans scheme.' I apologise to the students of today that we were not able to stop the Labor Party loans scheme. The point we were making then is the same as the point we are making now—that is, in a wealthy country like Australia we should have a higher education system where everyone can go to university no matter how much they earn. 


I can see the cost of university rising to the point where people like my dad will not be able to go in the first place and this bill will hasten that trend. Secondly, it is vital to a functioning democracy that the population is as educated as they want to be and that everyone can continue to learn throughout their whole lives and not be deterred because they might graduate with a debt the size of a mortgage. If education becomes something only the privileged few can access or if some people start saying, 'Hang on, I don't know if I want to graduate with a $100,000 debt and, at the same time, have to find a house and a mortgage and then meet all the other costs of life,' then people who are highly educated will be the only ones who can afford to carry the burden of that debt and they in turn will govern and rule for themselves and for themselves alone. 


An educated population is the cornerstone of a democracy, but over the years the pressures on our universities and on our students have been ratcheted up and up. Base funding has been cut under successive governments. Whether governments have been Labor or Liberal, university funding has not been increased to the level that it should, to the point where the Bradley review of higher education, when it was commissioned by the former Labor government, reported that universities need a 10 per cent boost to their base funding just to keep up. Of course, that never happened under either Labor or now under the current government.


The level of HECS increased. For me, it was something I was able to pay off within a couple of years, but that is not what students face now. The pressures on students have grown with youth allowance, Austudy as it was in my day, now not being indexed with other kinds of benefits. As an example, when I studied the income support I received was the equivalent of double my rent, sharing a three-bedroom place near the university. Now, if you want to rent near a university in a capital city you are lucky to have any change at all. Your full youth allowance pays for your rent.  So students now are working 15 or 20 and sometimes even full-time hours while studying full-time, just to make ends meet. 


On top of that, staff have been placed under more and more pressure. People may have an idea of universities being places full of tenured academics where people have life-long security, but only about 30 per cent of people  working in higher education at the moment have ongoing secure employment. I spoke to people who worked in academia, who worked in research and teaching in university departments. I spoke to a woman who had worked there for 10 years without a day of sick leave in her life because she was on rolling contracts for those 10 years. You come to the end of every year and do not know whether you have another job. That affects university staff being able to plan their lives, to have a family or to buy a house. 


Then of course in the last parliament we had the Labor government threatening to cut $2.3 billion out of higher education and putting that debt onto students. We took to the streets and beat that proposal but this proposal now, from a government which went to the election saying 'No cuts to education,' will be a body bl 


Five billion dollars is the impact on spending on higher education, on research and on students. It is going to hit those researchers that the people here in parliament today, the scientists and the researchers, were saying are going to safeguard Australia's economy in the 21st century.


The bill proposes a 10 per cent across-the-board cut for the Research Training Scheme, and charges a fee of up to $4,000 a year for PhD students. So if you want to undertake research in the medical field—an area where Australia is leading the world in many respects, and an area we should be boosting—you could be facing a cost of up to $20,000 plus interest.


The interest component here is vital as well. We know that the government are governing for the one per cent in this country—I think fewer than a quarter of the members of the front bench went to a public school, and the others are private-school born and bred. What this bill will mean is that lower-income graduates could be forced to pay twice as much for their degrees as those on higher incomes, as a result of the compounding interest rates on their HELP debt. And it is going to be worse for women because, when women take time out of the workforce to raise a family, their debt is going to keep on going up and up at these higher rates. So women will find themselves at the end of their working lives with higher debts that have taken longer to pay off, thanks to this government.


This government says, 'We've got to reduce the debt and get rid of it,' but they are not reducing it; they are just shifting it onto students and people who have been to university. Plot the graph and you will find that in a couple of years the debt levels of students crosses over with the debt level of the Commonwealth, and you will see that the level of student debt, percentagewise, increases and the level of Commonwealth debt, percentagewise, decreases. That is because they are in a process of shifting debt onto the population, who are not in as good a position to bear it as the government. The government can borrow much more cheaply than students can. But that is of no concern to this government. 'Let's put people into more debt'—that is this government's mantra.


Then of course the bill allows for the deregulation of fees. Expect university degrees to cost you a second mortgage—especially in those areas like medicine or those higher demand areas where now, the government boasts, the market will rule. Well, if universities can charge as much as they like, they certainly will. And it will be of no concern to them that people like my dad would not be able to get in; that will be of no concern, because it will be, 'Let the market rule,' and they will charge whatever they like.


The minister says, 'It's okay, because we'll have Commonwealth scholarships'—taking an old term that used to mean something good and, in a move that would please George Orwell, turning it into something that will hit universities and students even more, because there is not one dollar in this bill for Commonwealth scholarships; the universities have to fund them themselves. These are the same universities that are being met with a 20 per cent funding cut. How will they fund them? They will fund them by putting up fees. And that is the hypocrisy that lies at the heart of this bill that the minister needs to come in here and explain. How can he say that there will be Commonwealth scholarships and that university funding will be cut but that fees will not go up? Of course they will. The universities are going to have to make up the shortfall somehow.


Lastly I will turn to something that slipped under the radar a little in this debate but which needs to be put up in lights: for the first time, Commonwealth funding is going to be redirected from universities to private providers. So universities are now going to have to compete not just against each other; they are going to have to compete against new private entrants who want to come in and make a quid thanks to a new government subsidy. I want our universities to manage their money properly, of course. But I do not want our universities to be businesses—that is not what they are. Businesses exist to make a profit, and some businesses go bankrupt and new ones arise, and it is a constant churn and a constant quest to make as much money as possible. That is all right; that is the business world. But that is not what I want for our universities. I want our universities to be centres of learning and teaching and research, where the people who work in them are well looked after and where students are able to go, regardless of their wealth, and come out without a debt the size of a mortgage.


This government talks about competition amongst universities as if it is a great thing. Well, I would much rather the money that universities spend on television ads and tram ads and glossy brochures went into teaching and research, and into helping us find the next cure for cancer or into creating the next Nobel laureate, because once we start saying, 'Our universities are just like businesses,' then we redirect money that could be going to students and to staff into the pockets of advertising agencies. And that is what is happening at the moment. Worse: if you take it to its logical conclusion, under this government's proposal we might see some universities fall over, not because the staff there are not good and not because students cannot go there, but because now we will have two tiers of universities in this country—we will have the wealthy ones that can charge as much as they like, and we will have the others, in regional areas or perhaps servicing smaller populations or offering smaller niche subjects, that will struggle under the might of the bigger universities that they now have to compete with.


I congratulate the efforts of the National Union of Students and the National Territory Education Union in bringing a national fight up to this government—this government that told us that there would be no cuts to education—because what is at stake is the future of this country and whether we will have an educated population and whether we will invest in research and education or whether we will gut them. This is being brought in by a bunch of people who had the benefit of a free education themselves, and who could probably afford to pay whatever was charged, but we will not let them pull the ladder up behind them.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2014-09-02,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (16:53):  I am so disappointed that that earlier contribution was cut so short!


When I was so rudely interrupted by an event earlier today, I was talking about regional universities and the impact of the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014, particularly about regional universities, students, their families and communities in the Northern Territory.


We do know that universities which will be most disadvantaged by these cuts are those most reliant on public funding—the smaller regional universities in particular.


Minister Pyne says :


Regional students and their communities will be among the big winners from the Abbott Government’s higher education reforms …


Well, blah, blah, blah—we all know that is wrong. Let me just give the contrary view, as expressed by the former vice-chancellor of Melbourne University, Prof Kwong Lee Dow, who said:


Whatever finally emerges from the political machinations with the Senate, students will be paying significantly more, and rural and regional students will be disproportionately affected.


Which is precisely what I have been saying.


The minister argues that regional universities will benefit in attracting students by keeping fees low. He has the Bunnings model of higher education for regional students, based on keeping costs and prices low and keeping volume of throughput high. I have news for him: this is based on what I think is a very poor and mistaken assumption that regional universities will be in a position to reduce their fees and absorb the funding cuts. Regional students and universities will be reduced in this process—the process being imposed upon them by this government—to second-rate institutions!


Regional universities enrol well above the sector average when it comes to the proportion of domestic students who are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, who come from low-SES backgrounds and who are from regional and rural areas. For example, Charles Darwin University has the highest Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander enrolment in the country at 7.3 per cent. Monash University has 0.4 per cent. Charles Darwin University has a low-SES student cohort of 19.6 per cent. The University of Sydney—that great sandstone university which really wants these processes—has only 7.8 per cent. And Charles Darwin University has students from a regional and remote background at 63 per cent and Macquarie University has 5.9 per cent. Those are just three examples of the way in which Charles Darwin University, in this case, is looking after the interests of those people who we want to target to make sure they get a better educational outcome.


The minister says that new scholarships will produce record levels of scholarships for disadvantaged students and will be of particular benefit to regional students and regional universities. However, as we know, this scheme is basically funded by an internal 20 per cent tax on increased course fees. An increase in fees for any university where more than 20 per cent of its student cohort comes from a disadvantaged low-SES background will be more than the average value of the Commonwealth scholarship. Therefore, if the university wanted to award every low-SES student a scholarship this would be less than the increase in fees used to fund them and the university would be losing.


By contrast, universities with the lowest levels of disadvantaged student enrolments will be in position to offer more generous scholarships—that is, Sydney, Melbourne and the like—and to attract the best students from the bush. I know this to be the case: this is what regional universities fear. That is, regional unis might be unable to compete to keep the best students from their own communities. This poses a significant threat to viability and long-term educational opportunities for those communities, and particularly puts the social and economic health of regional communities at risk.


Professor Andrew Van, the vice-chancellor of Charles Sturt University said:


The second concern I have is with the impacts on workforce supply. In the existing system we have been able to boost the supply of skilled professionals in regional areas. I worry that this may be undermined by these changes as regional students are put off studying.


Universities like CDU are a key social, cultural and economic part of their local and regional communities. Considerable public investment has been put into establishing these universities where people live and work in regional Australia. It would be highly regressive to the prosperity of our nation—and it is clear that this will be the case—if our regional universities are closed down or reduced to cut-price, or find that they cannot offer the breadth of courses that they currently offer to compete with other universities—the sandstone universities and private companies—which have no long-term investment in the community.


A 20 per cent cut to Commonwealth grants funding—as I said earlier today, in CDU's case—will mean a cut of $50.4 million over the four-year period 2016-2019. Immediately, for a regional university like Charles Darwin there are some programs they would not be able to fund and courses that they would not be able to provide.


We know what the government is on about here. What they are doing is unfair, unreasonable and unwanted. They need to go back to the drawing board and do something which is reasonable, fair and wanted by the Australian community, and not discriminate against those people who aspire to have further education.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (16:59):  I like the member for Lingiari and it is an honour to follow a man who has been around as long as he has. I will take issue with one thing he said in his speech though. He said that people raised the issue of lawyers making a lot of money and paying a lot of tax, so why should they be paying for this? This was a question that Andrew Tillett from The West Australian asked Minister Christopher Pyne at a Press Club address. If I could quote the minister's answer because he may very well have been answering the question posed by the member for Lingiari. Christopher Pyne said:


Well, I think it's a bit of a specious argument, actually, since you asked me what I think about that. I think it's a specious argument because it's really an argument for not charging anyone anything because we all pay taxes and it's the same argument you could say that when I turn up to get my motor registration I shouldn't have to pay for it because I pay taxes anyway.


We believe that competition between higher education providers will force universities to be reasonable in setting fees. If they charge too much, they will have empty lecture theatres. Higher education providers will have to compete for students and when they compete for students, the students win. The government believe in the transformational power of higher education and that is why we will provide around $37 billion in funding for teaching at higher education institutions over the next four financial years.


It is with much pleasure that I speak on the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014 because this is something which I believe the country needs. I back my minister, Christopher Pyne, and my university, James Cook University, or JCU, in making sure that our higher education sector performs to its utmost ability and remains a supplier of quality, world-class education and is a sought after destination for education throughout the world. 


I was asked to attend a forum at James Cook University called by the National Tertiary Education Union. At that forum, the NTEU executive asked all those there the following questions. Who voted for the 20 per cent rise in the cost of university education? Where in the Liberal Party pre-election campaign did they clearly state that the cost of university education was to rise? Labor Senator Jan McLucas gleefully added, 'It's ridiculous to think that a government would go to an election and not be up-front about it.' Then I rose but did not make the obvious retort 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead' but asked the people there: 'Who voted to float the dollar in 1993 and was that taken to an election as a commitment? Did the Labor Party take the decision to push thousands of single mums off their pensions to the election? Did the Labor Party take the scrapping of the chronic disease dental scheme to an election to get a mandate?' The answer to all those is 'no'. I could go on and name 1,000 things which were not taken to an election yet have become law and are part of our lives. On each occasion, the elected government made decisions based on the data before it and acted on what it believed were in the best interests of the country. 


The new member for Rankin says it was a brilliant decision to float the dollar. They had an election in February 1983 and there was not a word about floating the dollar. Yet, 10 months later they made a decision to alter our currency policy and we have been the better country for it. Did Dr Chalmers in his extensive interview on the subject castigate Hawke and Keating on their decision to act and not put it to an election? No, he did not. His confected outrage and that of his party and his mates in the Greens only extend as far as they need for a cheap political headline, and that is what really bugs me about this.


Bob Hawke went to the 1983 election with a huge range of popular promises, only to be confronted with a larger than expected deficit and simply junked most of his agenda. To a large extent, this is what our government has had to face. We have come into office knowing there was a real issue of debt and deficit and we promised we would address the debt and deficit issue, but not to the extent needed when we discovered the mess Labor left. 


I have used the floating dollar analogy for a specific purpose. It was a decision which had many benefits for the majority of Australians. It has transformed our economy. Not everyone was happy with the decision and not everyone was a winner, but we as a nation have prospered because of it. Some people still want to wind-back the clock and change it back. That is what we see Labor standing for today. Their rhetoric today is more about free education than student participation in the cost of their education. Labor seem to have forgotten conveniently that they brought about the co-contribution to university education. Their political opportunism and relentless negativity on this knows no bounds. 


This bill will spread opportunity to many students, including disadvantaged students and rural and regional students. These reforms will equip our universities to face the challenges of the 21st century in a global education market. We need to unleash the capacity of our universities to be as good as they can be, to specialise if necessary, or possible, to ensure that they have the best possible outcome for their students. 


Universities Australia came out last week and called for the parliament to support the deregulation of Australian universities. Universities Australia Chief Executive, Belinda Robinson, said that the parliament had a once in a generation opportunity to shape an Australian higher education system that is sustainable, affordable and equitable in serving the best interests of students and the nation. She said:


With budgets under pressure, governments faced with a myriad of competing priorities for public funding, and successive governments being disinclined to invest at the level that repeated independent reports have shown to be needed, full deregulation of higher education is needed.


Either the status quo of ongoing inadequate investment, or further cuts without deregulation will condemn Australia's great university system to inevitable decline, threaten our international reputation and make it increasingly difficult for universities to meet the quality expectations of our students …


In transforming lives, Australian universities transform the nation. They make for a civil society, are the lifeblood of our regions and provide the means for securing Australia's place in the highly competitive knowledge-based global market of the future. Education is Australia's third largest export.


The introduction into Parliament of the Federal Government's higher education legislation is a chance for all parliamentarians to seize the opportunity for making real, lasting changes that are needed in positioning our universities for the challenges of the future.


Are they happy with absolutely everything we have proposed? The answer is obviously 'no'. But do they see the greater good here and a critically important sector of our society and economy that is under great pressure? The answer is a resounding 'yes'. I will come to the objections later.


Australian National University Vice-Chancellor, Professor Ian Young, in his address to the National Press Club gave an impassioned and wide-ranging speech across a number of issues. His first words were:


Higher education and research in Australia is at a cross-road. It is time for us to make choices about what we want for our country and what we want for future generations. Time to make choices about the future of our universities.


Some of the other things he raised in that address were:


Australia is a nation that has yet to realise its full potential.


We all like to believe that the Australian education system is envied around the world.


And further:


Hard analysis shows that our rhetoric is better than our performance. Australian higher education is not bad but it is not yet brilliant.


To build an education system that is brilliant, we have to stop funding universities the same way regardless of how they teach. We have to stop the endless per-student funding cuts to higher education.


We have created a perverse incentive that rewards universities for enrolling as many students as possible and teaching them as cheaply as possible. That’s what our current system does.


Those are not my words; those are the words of Professor Ian Young, Vice-Chancellor of the ANU. That is the damning indictment in this whole matter. 


When the budget came down we were able to speak about these reforms. I started by asking my daughter the following questions: 'What is the cost of your degree? What will be your HECS debt level at the end of that degree? And what is your current debt to the HECS system?' She was unable to answer any of these questions. My daughter is no dill and she clearly understands the nature of the system. Her response was that to get the job she wants she needs the degree and to get the degree she has to go to university and complete the course.


The day after the budget was handed down my staff conducted a basic poll. I acknowledge all the way through that my survey is hardly scientific, but it did produce a result which mirrored my own family experience. While we all knew there was a HECS style co-contribution, of the 140 people we asked those questions of at James Cook University that morning, 70 per cent had no idea, 20 per cent had some idea and 10 per cent knew the answers.


Labor seem to be preaching free education. All their rhetoric, all their speeches seem to preach free education. That is what they are saying. The speeches I have heard seem to be saying that they want it free again. Incidentally, Labor did not take the original HECS scheme to an election, either. So, please, can we just drop this thing about what bad governments do in between. You have to get on and govern with the decisions you have been able to face. Talk of degrees and debts in the hundreds of thousands of dollars is just that—it is talk. For every person who says that they will owe $200,000 for a degree, there is a university which says that is just not the case.


I note that Labor does not like this kind of talk, but it is called a market. If someone is charging too much or not providing value for money, the market will move elsewhere. While some courses will cost more, it will be the market which sets the price for them. A degree in science at James Cook University will be a brilliant degree. And, again, this is where I disagree with the member for Lingiari because, with its access to facilities on Orpheus Island, the Great Barrier Reef, the beautiful campuses in Townsville and Cairns, and out to a working cattle station, the demand for this course and JCU's work in the tropical world will mean that this will be a valuable commodity. But will JCU be able to saddle students with debts of $200,000 just because they want to? No, because Griffith, UQ, QUT or Sydney uni will all be in that market as well.


Our reforms mean that the biggest winner will be the students, especially low-SES students. As Minister Pyne said yesterday, in answer to a question:


… the biggest winners from the government's higher education reforms will be the university students, especially first-generation university goers … to the tune of 80,000 more students a year by 2018. They will also benefit by the introduction of the largest Commonwealth scholarship fund in Australia's history and they will benefit by more revenue for universities, leading to more research and better quality teaching. In return, the government is asking, on behalf of the taxpayers, that students contribute 50 per cent of the cost of their education—when they are currently contributing 40 per cent. So we are asking for a 50-50 split—that is, 50 per cent from the taxpayer and 50 per cent from students, when currently it is 60-40 in favour of the student.


They do not have to pay one single cent up-front and they do not have to pay anything until they earn over $53,000. This talk about a US-style education system is just not true. Why change? Why not do what Australian governments did for decades in industries such as the motor vehicle industry—just keep putting funds in, with no plan, where you will end up with no industry? That is what happens.


I would just like to also quote from Minister Pyne's second reading speech. He said:


Currently our universities are at risk of being left behind and overtaken by the growing university systems in our region and across the globe as these systems increase their capacity and new forms of online and blended delivery take hold. 


We must aspire to not only keep up with our competitors, but keep ahead of them. 


The government's changes will give Australian universities the freedom and autonomy to work to their strengths, be internationally competitive and manage economic and social changes to the best of their abilities.


This bill provides a level playing field for students, no matter what their study choices are. It removes the punitive loan fee of 20 per cent for VET FEE-HELP—helping tens of thousands of Australians undertaking VET courses—and gets rid of the 25 per cent loan fee for FEE-HELP for those who study with private institutions. It removes the lifetime limits on all Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) schemes and discontinues the ineffective HECS-HELP benefit.


He went on:


Regional students and regional higher education institutions will benefit significantly as we expand the demand driven system to enable study in more places in more ways. 


Universities, TAFEs and private providers will have new incentives and opportunities to develop innovative partnerships, particularly in outer-metropolitan and regional areas, where they can work together to offer the skills and knowledge that local employers want in their employees.


In conclusion, I raise the example of Central Queensland University. They see nothing but opportunity here to the point where they have bought a TAFE. They want that. Sandra Harding is vice-chancellor of James Cook University. She is not happy with absolutely everything in the package. But from a regional university perspective, she says, 'Bring on the competition.' She is hungry for the opportunity to compete, because James Cook University will stand on its own. CQU will stand on its own; it knows where it is. These people want to get up and make more from their opportunity and deliver more for their students. That is what this legislation is about. It is not about what used to be; it is about what can be. It is not about what you used to do; it is about what you will do. It is not about the education system we have; it is about where we are in the world. We have to value our education system. All this talk of free education must stop. These reckless promises must stop. 


I commend the bill to the House and I stand right beside the value of my university.

"Ryan, Joanne, MP",ALP,2014-09-02,"



Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (17:14):  I rise to outline my strong opposition to the government's Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014. I declare straight out that I had a free university education. I would correct the member for Herbert: I have not heard one Labor member suggest in a speech given today that university education should be completely free—not one—and those assertions do not do this place justice. This government continues to be full of surprises, despite their assertions before the election. The higher education bill confirms that this government has introduced cuts to every level of education, from child care all the way through to postgraduate study. Combined, these decisions act to entrench inequity at all levels of education. This is done while those opposite scream at our young people: 'You must earn or learn.' Today's legislation closes the loop on access and equity in education and makes the ability of young people in this country to meet that demand so much harder.


These changes will again hit low- and middle-income families and will risk locking people from my community out of university. In Lalor, people of all ages want to talk about this unfair change. Families are seriously looking at their options to assess if university is possible for their children, and, meanwhile, the minister cruelly quips that he is not asking for their left kidney. No, just their future. Here we see the final nail in the coffin. With this bill they have basically told people in Lalor to just give up. They have closed the door on opportunity. Andrea Toohey, a resident of Lalor, wrote to me this morning and said:


Joanne my son has been working long hrs at Coles during his gap year to help support himself at Uni in Ballarat next yr. He may need to keep working for a long while yet? It's a shame to think his career choice may be totally out of reach.


This bill threatens to lock people out of future prosperity.


The member for Herbert has left, but I would point out a discriminatory difference regarding some of the assertions that he made. Governments may have to bring in legislation beyond an election. That is not what we are talking about. We are talking about a government that made promises—plural—before an election and is now breaking them. Despite the promises, it acted to the contrary. On education, the Prime Minister said:


… I want to give people this absolute assurance, no cuts to education …


I cannot count the number of times I have heard it repeated. That was on 1 September 2013—that is, before the election. On universities, he said:


If we have to change it, we will consult beforehand rather than impose it unilaterally and argue about it afterwards.


It is clear to me that that spoke to an intent. That was in February 2013. It could not be clearer, really. Minister Pyne said:


We want university students to make their contribution, but we're not going to raise fees …


That was in November 2013—emphatic, after the election. When the interviewer asked, 'Why not raise university fees?' Minister Pyne said:


Because we promised we wouldn't before the election …


Doubly emphatic, even after the election. My favourite quote of all would have to be from their own Liberal Party policy document. Even when he puts things in writing, you cannot rely on what the Prime Minister says. In their 'Real Solutions' policy document, in chapter 17, page 40 and 41, they say:


We will ensure the continuation of the current arrangements of university funding.


That is in writing: 'current arrangements will continue'. That is right: the document is called 'Real Solutions'. It seems to have gone from the memories of those opposite. It was the contract they put to the Australian people, but it was not real; it reflects the fantasy they took to the election.


Actions speak louder than words, and this bill proves once again that they were an opposition prepared to promise anything to get into power and now they are a government that cannot be trusted to keep their word. What they fail to understand is the real impact the decisions they are making are having on the Australian people. What they fail to understand is that these measures are unfair.


Let me go through this bill. It strips money away from universities and gives them no choice but to hit students with higher fees. This bill will see $100,000-plus university degrees. It rips $5.8 billion out of Australian universities. This bill adds to the Abbott and Hockey rap sheet of cruel, unfair cuts. There are $3.2 billion in cuts by taking the scalpel to HELP; $1.9 billion in cuts to universities by reducing government course subsidies; $202 million in cuts by indexing university grants to the CPI; $172.4 million in cuts to fund, promote and reward universities for enrolling low-SES students; $173.7 million in cuts to the training of Australia's research students—the scientists and academics of tomorrow; a $75 million cut to the Australian Research Council; a $31 million cut to the national regulator; and it abolishes the $3.5 billion Education Investment Fund. That is quite a resume. But that is only the beginning. What we have now seen in addition is the full deregulation of student fees from 1 January 2016, which will lead to higher fees and spiralling student debt, and there is the increase in the interest rate burden on that student debt. Most alarming, though, is that the fantasy continues opposite. Members opposite deny people will be deterred under this so-called reform. This could not be further from the truth.


I have spent most of my adult life working in secondary schools in my electorate where the majority of people are what we would call traditional working-class families. For most of those years, I taught senior English to year 11 and 12 students, and I was a senior years coordinator for many years. I know from personal experience what it takes to build aspiration in students, to build confidence and to get them to open their eyes to the possibilities their talents and potential can lead to. I have worked with students and their parents to look seriously at tertiary education as an option. Many of the students who left my care were the first in their families to attend university. One of the biggest hurdles in this was income—families had to forgo a working young person's contribution to the family income. They had to overcome the idea of a reasonable debt, with a payback safety net, as a means to an end to a brighter future. I call on all students from low socioeconomic circumstances in my electorate and across the country who made it to university to stand up and defend the next generation's ability to do so.


Just this year I heard the compelling story of a student who was being supported by Western Chances, a not-for-profit organisation that supports senior secondary students to get to university in the western suburbs of Melbourne. This student is now completing medicine at Monash University. She detailed how hard it was to ask for money in her family when her father had been laid off at work—money for books and excursions. She thought uni was out of reach despite her teachers having identified her talent. Here was a student, clearly identified as being among the brightest and the best, who without help from a not-for-profit did not think she would get to university. With support, she got the books she needed and some tutoring in targeted subjects to ensure she met the tertiary requirements—that subject, in her case, was English. She got to university and she is now a second-year medical student.


But where would she have been now with the government's changes? Indeed, how is she responding to the idea that the interest rate on her HELP debt will increase and compound? How will these changes impact on her future life choices? Most importantly, would she make the same decisions today and will next year's brightest students in the same position make the same decisions? The fact is that those who will be the most deterred by this reform package are from working class families in electorates like mine. What we have seen with this bill is yet another significant barrier being put in place for those seeking long-term prosperity through education.


Some residents of my electorate wrote to me this morning when I said I was going to be making a speech on higher education today. Heather Taylor said:


Many opportunities for students who are bright and intelligent will be lost if higher fees are brought in. University should be an option for all who are capable of passing the enter scores, not just for those who can afford it.


Yajaira, a former student of mine, said:


These changes are just going to put more pressure on young high school students to decide what they want to do their entire future. These things have the potential to affect someone's entire life!


She wanted that read in the chamber today. She wanted those opposite to hear her voice. And Janine Luttick made a really important point:


Increases in undergraduate and postgrad fees will preclude mature-age students from ever paying off their debt during their working life. That makes tertiary education only for the young and the rich. Threats to funding for research students will mean the contributions of some of the nation's best minds to the development of our quality of life will be lost.


These fine people deserve a government that will provide them with real opportunities. And they had a government that provided them with real opportunities—they had a Labor federal government. The fundamental principles of the Labor Party could not be further removed from the measures put forward in this draconian bill. Labor does not support cuts to university funding and student support. Labor does not support a system of higher fees, bigger student debt, reduced access and greater inequality. And Labor does not believe that you should only have an opportunity to go to university if you are rich. When Labor was in government we removed the caps on public university places. From 2009 to 2013 the number of Commonwealth supported places went from 440,000 to 541,000. In my electorate, that saw an increase of more than 50 per cent in the number of students attending university and a 48 per cent increase in the number of students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Under Labor they had opportunity. But under this government they are having the door shut in their face.


The people of Lalor are rightly confused by a government that is ripping away our social compacts, that disregards the community benefit of the best and brightest attending university to ensure that their contribution to our society and to our economy is maximised—not just for their benefit but for all. We are hearing a lot about international competition. We are hearing people say that Australia's universities need to be able to compete. It is as though tertiary education fishes at Australia's border. But one of the unforeseen things that could happen with this reform is that we might find more of our best and brightest studying overseas without any intention of returning to make a contribution here.


I will finish with a question that I have asked in this House a few times, a question that young people have asked me to ask the Prime Minister: why is it that some debt is so bad but student debt is so good? I reject this bill and will firmly stand against it in this House.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,10,2,speech
"Whiteley, Brett, MP",LP,2014-09-02,"



Mr WHITELEY
 (Braddon) (17:29):  I am thrilled this afternoon to be able to speak as a member of the government in support of the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014. Mr Deputy Speaker, no-one needs to tell you or anyone else in this chamber that higher education is essential to this government's commitment to protecting and improving Australia's economic prosperity. We know that, in order to remain globally competitive, Australia needs a strong and successful knowledge based community. We also know that, while Australian universities have served us well in the past, they are now dropping in world rankings as they face intensifying global competition from institutions that are focused on delivering new and emerging technologies and creating first-class graduates to meet the world's changing demand for skills.


An interesting point about tertiary education in this country—I suspect it is a little-known fact to many of our constituents—is that higher education is our third-largest export. People from around the world, particularly the Asia Pacific region, see this as a happy studying ground for their future. Sadly, over the years of the Labor government in recent times our rankings in this area, our credibility and our integrity of education has dropped to a standard that we have not seen before. 


These reforms that we promote today are exactly that. They are reforms. They are changing the structure of higher education in this country, and it needs to be the case. Professor Ian Young is Vice-Chancellor of ANU. He said that it would be a 'great tragedy' for Australia if parliament blocks the federal government's plan to deregulate university fees. He went on to say it is 'a game-changer and a building block to making our universities brilliant.' In my view, any political party that rails against this fact for political expediency is a disgrace. This was highlighted most recently by the former ALP foreign minister and now Chancellor of the Australian National University, Professor the Hon. Gareth Evans, one of the very staunch, long-term Labor members of this parliament. (Quorum formed) He said: 


It is time to change our one size fits all funding system and let diversity develop. Changes to the system will be controversial, but real change is required if Australia is to offer its young people a real choice in education and produce graduates to match the best in the world.


There is no question within the higher education system about the need to reform the sector. Despite the Labor Party's rallying of radicalised left-wing student groups to oppose these reforms, in fact they are welcomed by a majority of providers and prospective students. They are welcomed because it is only through these reforms that we can continue to maintain and grow prosperity and ensure that our students remain educationally best equipped to meet market needs into the future. 


The Leader of the Opposition's willingness to go around the country aligning himself with radicalised, hard left-wing unionists and professional student politicians—who have shown themselves to be the rabble they are as they try to argue the case for reform by burning effigies and bullying ministers and former members of parliament—is simply due to the fact that the red-flag wavers are the only ones opposing these reforms. Those opposite attend these rallies with great enthusiasm, not because they want to but because they cannot find anyone else willing to stand next to them. David Gonski, Chancellor of the University of New South Wales, and former Labor minister Gareth Evans have both given their broad support for these reforms. 


It was only a few months ago in my office that I hosted a number of university students who wanted to put their case to me in relation to the budget measures that had been announced. What I found very interesting about that meeting was, firstly, they did not come in too many a number. That surprised me. I thought they might have needed a coach. Secondly, when I asked those who did turn up what the cost of their degree was they did not exactly know. They had a rough figure. I asked them, 'How much of that does the government pay?' And their quick response—both of them—was: 'Nothing. We have to pay it back through this damned HECS.' I asked: 'Is that right? You pay it all? So, if your university degree is $40,000, your HECS debt is $40,000.' He said, 'Well, no, my debt's nowhere near that.' And I said, 'Exactly.'


What the university students themselves do not realise, as mentioned by the member for Herbert a moment or two ago, is that the Australian taxpayer, up until this point in time today, meets 60 per cent of the cost of every university degree in this country. The 40 per cent that remains is in fact the HECS debt to be paid by that student when they get to an income of over $53,000. These university students did not know that fact. I cannot believe that in this country people believe that they pick up the total tab. It is not true.


Importantly, for the people in the north-west and west coast of Tasmania, there are a number of measures that are provided for in this bill that are of particular importance but that are conveniently overlooked by Labor senators in my state. It is these measures that I will speak about now. First is the fact that the bill provides important and improved opportunities and support to more students, especially disadvantaged and rural and regional students. Second, the reforms will support students wishing to undertake sub-bachelor degrees through the FEE-HELP scheme. We all know that diploma courses have long provided an important pathway into higher education for less-prepared students, giving them the opportunity to develop the skills needed to further their education. This is particularly important in regional and low-socioeconomic areas such as my electorate of Braddon, where students are far less likely to enter directly into higher education than students living in metropolitan areas. With less than 43 per cent of the Braddon school leavers having completed year 12 studies, alternative pathways to higher education are of fundamental importance to many young people in my electorate. By expanding the current system of Commonwealth subsidies and providing support to students completing accredited diplomas, advanced diplomas and associate degrees, the government is allowing students greater opportunity to either enter university or undertake education through a private provider.


Has anyone in this chamber today heard Tasmanian Labor senators—or any senator, or any Labor member of parliament, for that matter—talk about these exciting opportunities? The answer is clearly no. The member for Lalor, who spoke just before me, using very alarmist language, said that young people in her electorate have given up. I will tell you why they have given up. It is not because of anything we have done. This bill was introduced only this week, and we are only today debating it. People are giving up because leaders in that electorate, such as the member for Lalor, have told them to give up, using scaremongering and alarmist language, painting a dim picture that would certainly turn most people off pursuing their dream of further education. The member for Lalor is responsible for the young people in her electorate giving up and looking to the ground instead of to the sky. It was her party that in the last four years of its term cut $6.6 billion out of the budget for higher education—




Ms O'Dwyer:
  How much?




Mr WHITELEY:
  $6.6 billion—nearly $3 billion of that in the last 12 months alone—not to mention the cutting of research funds across the country.


We have two important outcomes in this bill for students. Firstly, the bill ensures that they are able to study at little or no up-front cost to themselves, even if it is not through a university or TAFE. This alarmist language that says that these reforms will price people out of commencing a higher education journey is absolutely false. There are no up-front costs. Nothing has changed. So, a person from the lowest-income, most-disadvantaged family in my electorate can step to the plate tomorrow and enter into a university degree that will change their life forever. They can enter into a diploma or associate degree that will change their life forever—at no up-front cost. And people opposite, including the Greens, should stop the scaremongering. If they want to have a debate, that is fine. Talk about the facts that are on the table, the measures in the bill that are fact, not alarmist language that scares the daylights out of people with untruths.


Secondly, and just as importantly, the bill provides the student with the due recognition that undertaking a sub-bachelor degree is of equal value to our community as undertaking a university degree. In the north-west of Tasmania that may mean that a student undertaking a course through a private education provider will not face the difficulty of needing to save for up-front course fees but, rather, can defer those fees through the FEE-HELP scheme. That will be a massive help to prospective students in regional Tasmania.


Despite the feigned outrage of members opposite, particularly the Leader of the Opposition, who claim that students will be worse off under these reforms and that the sky will fall in, the truth is that under their government many students not only paid interest tied to the CPI for their loans but were slugged with a 20-plus per cent loan fee. That means that if a university charged $30,000 for a degree then students who were unable to pay up-front were actually charged $36,000 for the degree, plus interest. This bill proposes to remove that fee and instead use the 10-year bond rate to determine the interest rate and then cap it at six per cent. By removing all FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP loan fees that are currently imposed on some students who are undertaking higher education and vocational education and training, the government is making a real contribution to improving educational and employment outcomes for regional Tasmanian students.


I welcome these reforms, because the delivery of the government's commitment to introduce these reforms will change the face of higher education in this country forever. It will give us a fighting chance to place our universities back in the top of the rankings, not see them falling down the league ladder as we are seeing at the moment.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2014-09-02,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (17:44):  Earlier today I was lucky enough to attend a Smart Science Symposium held in his parliament where a hundred scientists, or so it seemed, from around the country gathered to talk about the future vision of this country. The cuts to parliamentary screening procedures must have kicked in. I am sure the government would not knowingly have let that many scientists into the building all at once to talk about what Australia's future might look like and the importance of putting money into research. On the very day that researchers and scientists came here to say that unless we secure the future of research in this country we are going to witness more brain drain as our best and brightest go overseas; that we are not going to secure the type of future economy for this country which would mean that in the 21st century we might have something to sell to the rest of the world, something which is not just coal but is, instead, based on our brains and on the things that people here produce; on the very same day those people have come here to say, 'Let's finally have a vision for a smart Australia where we respect education, where we respect research and where a job in research is treated as importantly as building a car,' this government comes along with a bill that will be a body blow to a smart Australia.


This is not only vital to our future but it is in the Greens' DNA to stand up for research and education. It is personal for me as well. My dad was the first person in his family to go to university. His dad before him worked in the post office as well as serving for his country. My dad's mum spent her life raising the kids, as many women of that generation did. My dad went to university because he could. It was an odd thing for someone in his position to do, but he went because it was affordable and he had the support—including from the government—to continue to study and then not leave with a crippling debt.


 When I was at the university in the 1990s, the first campaigns I started getting involved with were on the rise in costs of education under the then Labor government. I still keep in my office a picture of me at a demonstration with a banner in the early 1990s in my best denim jacket with a Dawson's Creek haircut saying, 'Stop the ALP loans scheme.' I apologise to the students of today that we were not able to stop the Labor Party loans scheme. The point we were making then is the same as the point we are making now—that is, in a wealthy country like Australia we should have a higher education system where everyone can go to university no matter how much they earn. 


I can see the cost of university rising to the point where people like my dad will not be able to go in the first place and this bill will hasten that trend. Secondly, it is vital to a functioning democracy that the population is as educated as they want to be and that everyone can continue to learn throughout their whole lives and not be deterred because they might graduate with a debt the size of a mortgage. If education becomes something only the privileged few can access or if some people start saying, 'Hang on, I don't know if I want to graduate with a $100,000 debt and, at the same time, have to find a house and a mortgage and then meet all the other costs of life,' then people who are highly educated will be the only ones who can afford to carry the burden of that debt and they in turn will govern and rule for themselves and for themselves alone. 


An educated population is the cornerstone of a democracy, but over the years the pressures on our universities and on our students have been ratcheted up and up. Base funding has been cut under successive governments. Whether governments have been Labor or Liberal, university funding has not been increased to the level that it should, to the point where the Bradley review of higher education, when it was commissioned by the former Labor government, reported that universities need a 10 per cent boost to their base funding just to keep up. Of course, that never happened under either Labor or now under the current government.


The level of HECS increased. For me, it was something I was able to pay off within a couple of years, but that is not what students face now. The pressures on students have grown with youth allowance, Austudy as it was in my day, now not being indexed with other kinds of benefits. As an example, when I studied the income support I received was the equivalent of double my rent, sharing a three-bedroom place near the university. Now, if you want to rent near a university in a capital city you are lucky to have any change at all. Your full youth allowance pays for your rent.  So students now are working 15 or 20 and sometimes even full-time hours while studying full-time, just to make ends meet. 


On top of that, staff have been placed under more and more pressure. People may have an idea of universities being places full of tenured academics where people have life-long security, but only about 30 per cent of people  working in higher education at the moment have ongoing secure employment. I spoke to people who worked in academia, who worked in research and teaching in university departments. I spoke to a woman who had worked there for 10 years without a day of sick leave in her life because she was on rolling contracts for those 10 years. You come to the end of every year and do not know whether you have another job. That affects university staff being able to plan their lives, to have a family or to buy a house. 


Then of course in the last parliament we had the Labor government threatening to cut $2.3 billion out of higher education and putting that debt onto students. We took to the streets and beat that proposal but this proposal now, from a government which went to the election saying 'No cuts to education,' will be a body bl 


Five billion dollars is the impact on spending on higher education, on research and on students. It is going to hit those researchers that the people here in parliament today, the scientists and the researchers, were saying are going to safeguard Australia's economy in the 21st century.


The bill proposes a 10 per cent across-the-board cut for the Research Training Scheme, and charges a fee of up to $4,000 a year for PhD students. So if you want to undertake research in the medical field—an area where Australia is leading the world in many respects, and an area we should be boosting—you could be facing a cost of up to $20,000 plus interest.


The interest component here is vital as well. We know that the government are governing for the one per cent in this country—I think fewer than a quarter of the members of the front bench went to a public school, and the others are private-school born and bred. What this bill will mean is that lower-income graduates could be forced to pay twice as much for their degrees as those on higher incomes, as a result of the compounding interest rates on their HELP debt. And it is going to be worse for women because, when women take time out of the workforce to raise a family, their debt is going to keep on going up and up at these higher rates. So women will find themselves at the end of their working lives with higher debts that have taken longer to pay off, thanks to this government.


This government says, 'We've got to reduce the debt and get rid of it,' but they are not reducing it; they are just shifting it onto students and people who have been to university. Plot the graph and you will find that in a couple of years the debt levels of students crosses over with the debt level of the Commonwealth, and you will see that the level of student debt, percentagewise, increases and the level of Commonwealth debt, percentagewise, decreases. That is because they are in a process of shifting debt onto the population, who are not in as good a position to bear it as the government. The government can borrow much more cheaply than students can. But that is of no concern to this government. 'Let's put people into more debt'—that is this government's mantra.


Then of course the bill allows for the deregulation of fees. Expect university degrees to cost you a second mortgage—especially in those areas like medicine or those higher demand areas where now, the government boasts, the market will rule. Well, if universities can charge as much as they like, they certainly will. And it will be of no concern to them that people like my dad would not be able to get in; that will be of no concern, because it will be, 'Let the market rule,' and they will charge whatever they like.


The minister says, 'It's okay, because we'll have Commonwealth scholarships'—taking an old term that used to mean something good and, in a move that would please George Orwell, turning it into something that will hit universities and students even more, because there is not one dollar in this bill for Commonwealth scholarships; the universities have to fund them themselves. These are the same universities that are being met with a 20 per cent funding cut. How will they fund them? They will fund them by putting up fees. And that is the hypocrisy that lies at the heart of this bill that the minister needs to come in here and explain. How can he say that there will be Commonwealth scholarships and that university funding will be cut but that fees will not go up? Of course they will. The universities are going to have to make up the shortfall somehow.


Lastly I will turn to something that slipped under the radar a little in this debate but which needs to be put up in lights: for the first time, Commonwealth funding is going to be redirected from universities to private providers. So universities are now going to have to compete not just against each other; they are going to have to compete against new private entrants who want to come in and make a quid thanks to a new government subsidy. I want our universities to manage their money properly, of course. But I do not want our universities to be businesses—that is not what they are. Businesses exist to make a profit, and some businesses go bankrupt and new ones arise, and it is a constant churn and a constant quest to make as much money as possible. That is all right; that is the business world. But that is not what I want for our universities. I want our universities to be centres of learning and teaching and research, where the people who work in them are well looked after and where students are able to go, regardless of their wealth, and come out without a debt the size of a mortgage.


This government talks about competition amongst universities as if it is a great thing. Well, I would much rather the money that universities spend on television ads and tram ads and glossy brochures went into teaching and research, and into helping us find the next cure for cancer or into creating the next Nobel laureate, because once we start saying, 'Our universities are just like businesses,' then we redirect money that could be going to students and to staff into the pockets of advertising agencies. And that is what is happening at the moment. Worse: if you take it to its logical conclusion, under this government's proposal we might see some universities fall over, not because the staff there are not good and not because students cannot go there, but because now we will have two tiers of universities in this country—we will have the wealthy ones that can charge as much as they like, and we will have the others, in regional areas or perhaps servicing smaller populations or offering smaller niche subjects, that will struggle under the might of the bigger universities that they now have to compete with.


I congratulate the efforts of the National Union of Students and the National Territory Education Union in bringing a national fight up to this government—this government that told us that there would be no cuts to education—because what is at stake is the future of this country and whether we will have an educated population and whether we will invest in research and education or whether we will gut them. This is being brought in by a bunch of people who had the benefit of a free education themselves, and who could probably afford to pay whatever was charged, but we will not let them pull the ladder up behind them.

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (21:00):  In mid-August I was fortunate to travel to the remote Aboriginal community of Ntaria, or Hermannsberg, 130 kilometres west of Alice Springs. This is Western Arranta country on the edge of the beautiful McDonnell Ranges and the birthplace and former home of great Australian artist Albert Namatjira. I was in Ntaria to volunteer at the local school as a member of the National Aboriginal Sporting Chance Academy's role model tour. NASCA is a wonderful not-for-profit that uses leadership figures and trained professionals to encourage healthy living, education and employment amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians.


Over the course of my week in Ntaria, I was fortunate to meet some very special people: the hardworking teachers and staff of the school whose passion for and dedication to Aboriginal education is inspiring; the wise elders and community leaders striving to give their kids more opportunity through education; and of course the wonderfully talented students whose infectious spirit and broad smiles brighten your day.


Our role as members of the NASCA tour was to help out in the school, but also to experience firsthand the challenge of improving living standards in remote Aboriginal communities and, importantly, providing Aboriginal kids with a decent education. My time volunteering in Ntaria highlighted the enormous challenge of remote community education. Australia is a wealthy country, with a modern economy and high living standards, yet the ancestors of our First Australians in some communities still live with unacceptably high rates of preventable disease, unhealthy diets, domestic violence, alcoholism, incarceration and low levels of literacy and numeracy. When you experience the tragedy that is many remote Indigenous communities, you cannot help but ask yourself: where did we go wrong? How could it be that in modern day Australia we have treated and failed our First Peoples so badly? And how do we right this wrong? The truth is that there is no easy answer to those questions. Although we are making some very slow progress in improving Indigenous living standards and opportunities, we have a very long way to go in closing the gap, particularly when it comes to Aboriginal education. Despite the bleak social outcome, you cannot be immune to the happiness and positive attitude of the kids whose energy and innocence brighten your day.


Our days in the Ntaria community began early, travelling around on the school bus to pick kids up from their homes. Despite the freezing morning temperatures, many of the students coped remarkably better than we did with the cold, often hoping on the bus in shorts and T-shirts oblivious to bone-chilling wind. Once at school, it was breakfast and then playtime. Throughout the day, I was fortunate to sit in on classes and assist teachers stretched to the absolute limit by some very spirited students. We also helped out with school sports and healthy lifestyle activities. The sporting prowess of these kids is something to behold. A touching community unity occurs at the footy oval as the kids kick the ball with the senior players from the Ntaria Bulldogs AFL Club.


The challenge of remote Aboriginal education is not only mammoth but complex. How do we as a nation and government provide the kids with a decent education that offers the same opportunity as other Australians, yet still allow them to maintain the very important connection with their land, their Dreamtime, their heritage and their culture? It is great to see the kids communicating with each other in Western Arranta language. They all speak it and they all understand it. Yet some start school without having spoken a word of English and naturally struggle with literacy. The teachers expressed frustration at kids who are doing well in literacy and numeracy and then disappear from school for a couple of weeks and return behind the eight ball.


My experience highlighted the importance of one reform that we can and should make that will make a difference: reform and the introduction of a needs based school funding model. All the problems with the current system perfectly highlighted by the Gonski panel were acutely on display in my week in Ntaria. The teachers are stretched to the limit and often without trained teachers aids in classes. The teachers simply cannot devote the necessary time to many kids who are challenged when it comes to learning. As a result they achieve substandard results. The Gonski model was put in place to rectify this. Unfortunately, the Abbott government is removing this.


I want to thank NASCA for the opportunity to join the wonderful role models on this tour.
