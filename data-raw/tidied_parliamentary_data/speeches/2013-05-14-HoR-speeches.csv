Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson) (12:03):  I rise to speak on the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013 and the related bills. For the many of us who have had a relative requiring care, the experience can be a daunting and at times personally distressing experience. Irrespective of their financial position, our grandfather, grandmother, mother or father deserve respect, dignity and quality in their senior years. As family members we want to know what options are available for our loved ones. The simpler the system is to navigate, the better for all concerned. There should be opportunities for appropriate care in the home. Understandably, so many want to stay in the surroundings they love and that are familiar to them and their family. If they require residential care—low or high care—there should be options readily available, preferably in their local community.


I do respect the intent of aspects of the reforms that have been proposed. We know that there are many, many challenges ahead and the proportion of the population over 70 years of age is expected to double over future decades. The incidence of chronic disease continues to grow rapidly. One million Australians receive aged-care services subsidised by the Commonwealth, and that is expected to more than double by 2050. Despite this, the government's approach to aged care and much promised reform has been protracted to say the least. The government announced the Productivity Commission's terms of reference almost three years ago. The draft report was released in January 2011, and the final report was provided to the government in June of that year. The minister and Prime Minister did not publicly release the report until August 2011, and it took a further 250 days to respond to the PC's recommendations in the form of the Living Longer Living Better policy.


The government trumpeted the release on the day as a revolution for the sector. The government continues to claim that this policy is a $3.7 billion investment when it is not. Not surprisingly, stakeholders were initially enthusiastic given the flashy headlines. Looking at the finer detail, the proposals are nowhere near as ambitious as first made out. That has been a current theme across the last six years under the stewardship of this government. The government is saving over $560 million through means testing, and they include that as part of the so-called $3.7 billion investment. Over $2½ billion is being redirected from existing programs, including $1.6 billion from the Aged Care Funding Instrument. Places and funding are to be transferred from residential care to home care, and funding will be cut from the Long Stay Older Patients initiative. The net investment over four years is just $284.6 million, not $3.7 billion. In fact, it is less than one per cent of the existing aged-care budget over the forward estimates. The unanticipated changes to ACFI and how they are applied have reduced confidence in a sector already struggling to break even.


It is, to say the least, a ham-fisted and counterproductive way to initiate reforms. In the few months following the policy's release, $3.5 billion of capital projects were found to be in jeopardy as a result of the uncertainty caused. In fact, independent analysis undertaken by the Centre for International Economics for Leading Age Services Australia found a revenue black hole of more than $750 million for providers due to the ACFI cuts. The average reduction for each affected resident is estimated at between $20,000 and $30,000 in care funding every year. This corresponds with what we are hearing from providers, and it is particularly hard on the smaller operators and those in regional and rural areas.


The minister has implied that there has been rorting and 'unusual claiming'. However, at Senate estimates it was confirmed that there has not been a single prosecution in the last five years. The sector is crying out for incentives to invest in new capital to open new beds. The government's actions so far appear to have had the opposite effect. The other significant aspect, recently launched by the government, is the workforce compact. This complex arrangement appears to be linked to the funding lost through the ACFI changes. Under the compact, providers with 50 beds or more must have an enterprise bargaining agreement to receive that funding. Those with fewer than 50 beds do not require an EBA but must still comply with the compact obligations to access funding. In itself, this will impose further cost pressures, again particularly affecting smaller providers in rural and regional areas. Providers unable to comply with these requirements will not be able to access the funding.


Across the sector there is recognition that the hardworking staff in aged care need to be paid well for the demanding and important work they perform, but this proposal, certainly by any objective analysis, seems more about propping up the beleaguered HSU than about genuinely helping the workers, those in care or, indeed, the providers.


The bills before the parliament today enacting the government's Living Longer Living Better policy reflect a small hit-and-miss selection of the Productivity Commission's recommendations. Specifically, the bills: (1) remove the distinction between low-level and high-level residential care; (2) provide a new means test combining income and assets tests and new annual and lifetime caps on means tested care fees; (3) allow accommodation costs to be paid through a refundable lump sum, a rental periodic style supplement or combination; (4) make changes to home care, including requiring contributions for people that enter home care on or after 1 July 2014; (5) establish a new aged-care pricing commissioner; (6) extend the operation of the accommodation bond guarantee scheme to new bond arrangements reflected in the government's reforms; and, finally, establish the new Australian Aged Care Quality Agency to replace the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency from 1 January 2014.


The Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013 removes the distinction between low care and high care, which is intended to provide one approval process for residential care. It is argued by the minister that this will reduce reassessments and allow individuals requiring a permanent residential care place to access services according to need. The bill proposes changes to the residential care subsidies and fees for residents who enter care on or after 1 July 2014. This includes a new means test combining income and asset tests and new annual and lifetime caps on means tested care fees. As stated in the minister's second reading speech an annual cap of $25,000 will apply for means tested fees, with a lifetime cap of $60,000. Both are to be indexed. Any contribution does require an appropriate safety net. We do not want a situation where people are precluded from necessary care because of what they are required to pay. It is appropriate that the proposed contributions and respective caps are examined as part of the Senate inquiry.


I recognise that there is a delicate balance between funding quality care, ensuring affordability of care and the sustainability of the system overall. In relation to accommodation costs the bill will allow fees to be paid through a refundable lump sum, or a rental periodic-style supplement, or a combination of the two. It is stated that aged care providers will not be able to distinguish between care recipients based on means of payment. Clause 52G(3) provides that the minister may by legislative instrument determine the maximum amount of accommodation that an approved provider may charge, including the maximum daily accommodation payment amount and the method for working out the refundable accommodation deposit. The bill also proposes a new form of home care to replace community aged care packages, extended aged care at home and dementia packages. An income tested care fee will apply to home care for all except pensioners. This again will be capped by year and by lifetime.


The Aged Care Pricing Commissioner is also established for the stated purpose of making decisions on pricing issues. The functions of the commissioner are as follows: to approve extra service fees; to approve accommodation payments that are higher than the maximum amount of accommodation payment determined by the minister; and other functions as determined by other acts or by the minister by determination. Whilst I acknowledge that there are lead times for these changes, the independent review proposed in the legislation is not to commence until 2016 and will not report to parliament until 30 June 2017.


The two bond security amendment bills extend the operation of the Accommodation Bond Guarantee Scheme to new accommodation payment arrangements. The Australian Bond Guarantee Scheme, prescribed in the 2006 act, provides a mechanism by which the Commonwealth may repay outstanding bond balances to care recipients should a provider become insolvent or be unable to refund the balances. There is also the capacity for the Commonwealth to recover the cost of refunding these bonds which is amended through the relevant act to reflect the changes to accommodation payments.


The Australian Aged Care Quality Agency Bill 2013 establishes a new agency. This is to replace the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency from January next year. Aged care providers will be responsible to it for quality assurance of aged care services delivered in the home or a residential facility. The functions of the new agency are as follows: accrediting residential care facilities; conducting quality reviews of home care services; promoting high quality care, innovation and continuous improvement amongst approved providers of aged care; and providing information, education and training to approved providers of aged care.


I am yet to be convinced that red tape in what is already a highly regulated sector has been appropriately streamlined or that it has even been genuinely a priority for the government in this process. I do support high standards and efficient regulation to ensure consistent, quality services for the many vulnerable people in care, but nothing is achieved by unnecessary red tape except a diversion of much needed resources away from those most in need. If we want an innovative and efficient sector, unnecessary red tape cannot be ignored.


The related Australian Aged Care Quality Agency (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 enables the transfer of assets and liabilities from the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency Ltd to the Commonwealth to facilitate the establishment of the new agency. Over $20 million was included in the budget for the Aged Care Financing Authority and over $14 million for the Aged Care Reform Implementation Council. About half the council's budget is for communications. The financing authority's role will be to provide independent advice on pricing and financing issues. It will make recommendations about subsidies and payments. It will also approve higher fees for accommodation and extra services not covered by subsidies. While there may be good intent and while we do not disagree with some of the functions performed, there has been a proliferation of separate bureaucratic structures under this government; in fact, it is a hallmark of this government. We believe more focus should be on the resources for front-line services and reducing where possible costly bureaucracy.


The government's time lines are peculiar on these bills. Despite years of deliberation, the bills were only introduced in the last sitting period, and the minister has said that they should be passed immediately. The government has set the snail pace of these reforms to date. The government has not brought the bills on for debate until today. I am not sure why or how procedurally the minister was expecting to ram the bills through the parliament. This is far from what should be normal process.


The coalition is keen to support good reform in this important area. Disappointingly for some, the reforms proposed fall very well short of what was promised. The House should remember that this is the minister who is responsible for delivering 16 early psychosis prevention and intervention centres, yet since 2010, when that promise was made, a grand total of zero of the 16 has been delivered. This is despite the Prime Minister herself saying: 


I want to be absolutely clear—mental health will be a second term priority for this Government.


Those people right across the Australian community in the mental health sector, those people who access services provided by mental health providers or, indeed, those people in the aged-care sector can add that quote from the Prime Minister to the long list of broken promises that has come to plague this government. For the aged-care sector, this is not a good track record, and it comes on the back of so many other implementation blunders across the rest of government.


The bills have rightly been referred to a Senate inquiry, and the coalition will carefully consider the findings and the submissions. A number of changes will be enacted by regulation rather than legislation, and some of that detail is yet to be provided and will also require responsible scrutiny. This House should have the opportunity to properly consider any complex changes to aged care. The Senate inquiry provides that opportunity. We need to ensure that we can at least achieve the best outcome from what is before us.


In closing, I want to say to the many providers that I have spoken to around the country, particularly regional providers, that we hear their concerns. We do share their view that this minister has a tin ear when it comes to the concerns that they have raised either with the government or through the peak bodies about some of the sections within this act. It is exactly the reason that we set up the Senate inquiry and asked for people across the sector to provide input so that we can improve this legislation. As I say, the time lines on this legislation have been protracted. It has gone on for the last six years. It is interesting to note that out of the billions of dollars that this government wasted in its response to the GFC not one dollar was spent on aged care: no money for additional infrastructure or for providers, no money in wage compacts, no money for patients and services provided to the clients and residents within aged-care facilities—not a dollar.


This government came into power in 2007 promising that it would reform the aged-care sector. This minister has only been in the portfolio since the second half of these six years of the disastrous Rudd-Gillard government, but the dysfunction has continued up until this very day, and we are seeing it play out in this bill. We all want to see a better outcome for older Australians in terms of their interaction with the aged-care system, and the coalition is committed to trying to resolve some of those outstanding issues. We wanted to entertain consideration of this bill, but we also wanted to ask for providers, for care givers, for people of good intent to come forward to that Senate inquiry to make sure that their detail was provided, that their concerns were aired, and we expected that the government would listen to some of those concerns. This is a government that cannot be trusted. It says, 'Trust us in the detail; we've got the bare bones of the legislation now and we'll rush all of the other detail through in another process,' but this government cannot be trusted.


The Treasurer will deliver the speech tonight that people are anticipating will chart some way forward from the disaster of the last five or six years, but people will not get the outcome that they want from this Treasurer, they will not get the outcome that they want from this government, because that has been the track record over the last six years. Because of this government's dysfunction, because of distractions with leadership, because it has promised surpluses and then failed to deliver them, because it has spent money and run us into enormous debt, it is unfortunate that people who are looking for aged care-services in our country today have suffered because of that distraction. They have suffered because this government decided that aged care was not a priority for the Rudd government and it has not been a priority for the Gillard government.


I think the responsible course of action for this government to take would be to listen to the concerns of those who raised them, quite rightly, in the Senate process and to look at sensible amendments that could be proposed to try and improve this bill. As a parting gesture to the Australian people, with only a few months to go before the next election, in the dying days of the Gillard government, please listen to those concerns of the aged-care sector, of the aged-care providers and the people who seek care and are being cared for in these facilities around the country. Listen to the expertise that they bring to the table. 


Listen to their concerns about this compact. They do not want to feather the lifestyle of people like Craig Thomson who now occupy the upper echelons of the HSU. That is what this bill provides: it is taking money away from one part of the aged-care sector and seeing it, at least in part, dispersed back through the HSU. The HSU is a disgraced union body in this country. The member for Dobell, I note, has just been told that he cannot run again for the Labor Party—three months before the election. It is absolute contempt that the Labor Party has for the people in the seat of Dobell and, indeed, that through his own actions he has.


This bill seeks to confer an ultimate benefit on the HSU. People are asking why is that the case, why divert money away from aged care and impose another cost burden on aged-care providers in terms of having to engage with the HSU? Why do they need to do that? I will tell you why: because they decide the preselections of people who sit on this government bench. They decide the preselections of people like Craig Thomson and others who come into this parliament and ultimately decide whether or not they will direct their backbenchers, and frontbenchers, to vote for Julia Gillard or Wayne Swan or Kevin Rudd or Bill Shorten or Mark Butler or—



The SPEAKER:  Order! The member will refer to members by their appropriate titles.




Mr DUTTON:
  whoever it is, Madam Speaker, that seeks leadership of the ALP. That, when you cut it all down, is what a significant part of this bill is all about. And that is why the Australian public continue to express disgust in this government.


They cannot sort out their own internal issues and therefore those in the aged-care sector have suffered. They do not want to listen to the outcome of the Senate inquiry because essentially all they have sought to deliver through this bill is not reform to the aged-care sector but a blank cheque to the HSU and to the other unions involved. That will be an albatross around this minister's neck. This minister will seek leadership of the Labor Party at some point into the future—I am sure he will; he is an ambitious person.



The SPEAKER:  The member will return to the bill before the House.




Mr DUTTON:
  For a long time, Madam Speaker, this minister has fooled the industry, but I find as I move around the country talking to providers that they are now starting to see through all of the smoke and mirrors. They are now starting to see this bill for what it is. It is not about a reform of the aged-care sector. If they were serious about doing that they would have done it five or six years ago. They would have applied at least one dollar of the billions of dollars they wasted to the aged-care sector to help build infrastructure and to make it more affordable for people on low incomes to go into aged care, but they sought to do none of that. They pushed it off to the Productivity Commission to try to get through the last election. Then, when they had the Productivity Commission recommendations, they sat on them and pushed them aside because they had run out of money. That is what happened with this government's approach to aged care. Then they tried to pretend that they had some $3.7 billion huge investment, but when you strip it down it is a net extra spend of $250 million over that four-year period and a shameful exercise in deception by this government and by this minister. They need to be called for it.


So what have we done? We have tried to engage constructively with the sector to work out how this bad bill could be improved. What could be changed to improve the situation for aged care in this country? How could we make it easier for people to find their way through the mess of aged care and find a place for that grandmother, grandfather, mother, father or loved one? That is what we sought to do through the Senate inquiry process, and yet what does this minister do? This minister says, 'We are going to ignore that Senate inquiry process, we are not going to listen to the recommendations of the sector, we are not going to listen to people of good will who sought to make this bill better; we just want to deliver for the HSU.' That is really the only objective that the government seeks in this bill. They want to make sure that they repay a dividend to their union bosses, and that really sums up what this whole sad, six-year period in our country's history is about.


This is what it amounts to. The puppeteers have pulled the strings for the last six years, and we have seen it play out through leadership changes which have impacted on the government's desire in this area. This is the point. This government has been distracted by its own leadership deliberations, by the knifing of Kevin Rudd and by the proposed resurrection of Kevin Rudd—not to be. This government, whilst it has been distracted by that, has not concentrated on aged care or the millions of Australians in the future who will seek aged-care services for their loved ones. The government brings this bill in at the eleventh hour of this dying government because they seek to repay a dividend to those union bosses who supported their entry into this place. Craig Thomson—



The SPEAKER:  The member will refer to members by their appropriate titles.




Mr DUTTON:
  I am sorry. The member for Dobell stands as the monument of the HSU and the government's activities in this place. He stands here as a reminder to all Australians that this government has not had its eye on aged care. In this bill they have one focus, and that is to repay their very heavy due to the HSU. That is what this minister needs to account for.


Accordingly, I move:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""the House is of the opinion that further consideration of this bill, and the related bills, should be deferred until the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs has reported on its inquiry into the bills.""



The SPEAKER:  Is the amendment seconded?





Dr Southcott:
  I second the amendment.



The SPEAKER:  The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Dickson has moved that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. If it suits the House, I will state the question in the form that the amendment be agreed to. The question now is that the amendment be agreed to.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2013-05-14,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh—Second Deputy Speaker) (12:28):  I am very pleased and very honoured to speak on the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013 today, because this bill delivers security, certainty and fairness for millions of older Australians. It delivers fairer and more flexible arrangements for people looking to stay at home or to move into aged care. This bill is very important to me and to many of my constituents. As I have said many times in this place, the electorate of Hindmarsh has one of the oldest demographics in the country. Twenty per cent of the residents of Hindmarsh are age 65 and over. Many say it is the oldest electorate in the country; I like to say it is the wisest electorate in the country, because with age comes wisdom, and I have benefited greatly from the many older constituents in my electorate.


In my electorate, there are an extra 870 high-care places and 968 low places thanks to the extra funding in 2010 and 2011. On 20 April 2012 we heard the minister announce the $3.7 billion for the Living Longer, Living Better aged care reform. That is a huge increase, and what it means is that people are being looked after when they need to be. As we have heard, many of these people have worked all their lives and paid their taxes. Many have fought in wars. They deserve the best treatment and care that we can possibly give. These people have contributed so much to this wonderful nation. They built the foundations that have allowed us to prosper.


There are a lot of wonderful facilities in and around my electorate that are providing these new places and they deserve, very quickly, due credit for their hard work in this process. They include places like St Hilarion, an Italian nursing home that looks after many more people than just Australians with Italian backgrounds; the ECH; Southern Cross; Masonic Homes; St Basil's; St Martin's; Kilparrin Nursing Home; and the Ridleyton Greek Home for the Aged. All of them do a wonderful job in caring for and looking after those in need in their old age. In addition, I would like to thank the tireless efforts of the staff from each facility who look after those residents to ensure that their lives are happy and comfortable.


This government has also delivered 475 community aged packages in my electorate of Hindmarsh. This is in addition to the 54 extended aged-care at home packages and 20 extended aged-care at home dementia packages. We know how important it is for people to be able to stay in their homes. When you speak to people in my electorate, the majority say that they wish to stay in their homes and be cared for there. These extra packages are very beneficial.


The committee that I currently sit on recently finished an inquiry into dementia and how as a nation we can best care for people living with this condition. Australia is a wealthy nation and Australians are living longer. It is fantastic that we are living longer. Medical breakthroughs allow us to live longer. They allow our bodies to keep going and to keep supporting us for many more years than people in the past. Medical breakthroughs have been good for us. But there is another story. People with dementia are unfortunately growing in numbers. We know that by 2050 the number of Australians with dementia will quadruple. We will have quite an epidemic on our hands unless we do things now to put things in place to look after those people.


We know that not everyone is going to need aged care when they get older. In fact, we would all probably—as I said earlier—prefer to stay home and have the care required to look after us offered there. That is why the government also gave over $3 million in 2011-12 to centres in my electorate for day therapy. Day therapy gives older people the chance to come along and take part in activities away from home. This is a big thing. When you get older, you may lose some mobility and confidence. Having support so that you can get out to one of these day centres is a great thing.


This bill also addresses some of the issues facing those who care for our older Australians. Aged-care workers are some of the lowest-paid workers in Australia. They perform the vital task of looking after our parents, our grandparents and our great-grandparents—the older Australians in our community. We know that most Australians who pursue a career in aged care do it for much more than the financial reward. But pay rises are a big incentive to work in this growing industry. With the aged-care workforce needing to almost triple in size by 2050 to support our ageing population, we need to act now to attract and retain aged-care workers.


That is all part of the Living Longer, Living Better aged-care reforms. The Australian government announced that up to $1.2 billion will be provided to address the workforce pressures. We know that the current workforce is one of the oldest workforces. That is what the demographics of the aged-care workforce in Australia tell us.


Funding will flow through from July by way of a workforce supplement, delivering pay rises for aged-care nurses, care workers and others in the aged-care industry who look after older Australians. An additional one per cent pay rise will be available, above minimum annual wage increases or other wage rises which are negotiated through enterprise bargaining agreements, for workers who are employed by aged-care providers who meet the requirements of a workforce compact.


What does that mean? A personal care worker, who is currently paid the award rate and who is employed by an aged-care provider who meets those requirements would, effectively, see a pay rise close to 18 per cent over four years. Enrolled nurses will receive 25 per cent higher pay and registered nurses close to 30 per cent, in the same situation.


The second part of the Addressing Workplace Pressures initiative is the Aged Care Workforce Development Plan, which will begin in mid-2013. An expert advisory group will be established to focus on better ways to support the aged-care workforce. This group will seek to ensure that, on top of wage increases, those aged-care workers get benefits, including improved career structures; better training and education; and better work practices, including lowering the high rate of workplace injuries in aged care.


The workforce supplement is part of the Addressing Workforce Pressures initiative, which will be delivered in two parts through the aged-care workforce compact and through the Aged Care Workforce Development Plan. These are very important initiatives. As I get around in my electorate and talk to aged-care providers, one of the biggest issues they raise is maintaining and retaining the workforce required to look after older Australians in their facilities.


Another big and fairly complex issue in my electorate is multicultural aged care. The Australian government is committed to ensuring equitable access to high-quality, culturally-appropriate aged care for all people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. As I said, this is extremely important for my electorate because I have a very high number of Greek Australians and Italian Australians who migrated here in the fifties and sixties, all as young men and women, perhaps in their 20s, perhaps even in their teens or late 20s, who today are the fastest ageing Australians in my electorate. They are now at the stage where they are already needing services or are starting to need them. They are not the only ones. People from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds have specific needs that must be addressed. Those needs can be as basic as having familiar food available.


We know that when people develop, for example, dementia, nothing is worse than not being able to speak the language or know what people are saying to you. We know that many older Australians revert to their native tongue when they develop dementia. It might simply be a case of employing bilingual workers who can speak the language of the resident, make them feel comfortable so they feel they are being listened to. All these things are contained within the new strategy, which aims to ensure that aged care is inclusive of people from all backgrounds. 


Initiatives outlined in the strategy also include a rolling review of the National Aged Care Advocacy Program, to include an emphasis on promoting, supporting and maximising access to advocacy for older people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, their families and their carers. It also includes ensuring that the Aged Care Complaints Scheme is promoted to those linguistically diverse background communities, including the use of interpreting and translating services, and working with the culturally and linguistic diverse background sector to provide the cultural competency training for promotion and incorporation into all aged-care services. It also includes developing structured pathways to facilitate the employment of appropriate bilingual staff in the aged-care system. There has been a lot of work going towards ensuring that we have in place a system that caters for all Australians, no matter where they come from or what their background is.


I am very proud of this bill and that is why I am supporting it. One day we as a nation will be judged on how we have looked after our elderly. As I said earlier, many of the people that we are talking about today have paid their taxes all their lives, have worked hard and have gone through wars just to ensure that the foundations of this country are steadfast so that we can live a better life than they did. I am proud to support this bill and I commend it to the House.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2013-05-14,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (12:40):  I support the amendments moved by the shadow minister, because we know that under this government the aged-care system in Australia is rapidly approaching crisis point, particularly if you live in an electorate like mine, which is a rural and regional one, or one of those that involve smaller providers. Prime examples are in Western Australia, where last year the federal government allocated 1,564 additional residential aged-care places to our state. However, only 314 of these beds were actually taken up—it is a great indication. In the preceding year, of the 1,208 beds on offer only 507, or 42 per cent, were taken up in WA. What is worse, over the last three years 786 bed licences, the licence that provides the funding for aged-care beds were handed back to the government—283 of those were from Western Australia. Now in WA we are some 2,400 beds short of our aged-care requirements. That is a lot of people in my state and in my part of the south-west.


The government has chosen not to fund aged care in the way it needs to. Instead, it has wasted billions of dollars on unrealistic dreams and schemes that often have turned out to be nothing less than a nightmare. This is a at time when the group referred to as the baby boomers, those born between 1946 and 1964, start to enter retirement—that section of our community who are now between 46 and 65 years old and are looking at their retirement and aged-care solutions. It also looks as though we will have to defend their superannuation savings from being grabbed by what is just an incredibly wasteful Labor government.


Around nine per cent of our population is aged 70 years or older. That is expected to rise to 13 per cent by 2021 and 20 per cent, around 5.7 million people, in 2051—and this government has sat on its hands. By 2050 over 3.5 million Australians are expected to use aged care each year. As we are ageing we are acquiring more complex healthcare conditions and changing disease patterns, resulting in increasing and changing aged-care needs. The challenges include a larger, increasingly culturally diverse, ageing population. I see that in my electorate.


The dependency ratio in 2007 was six people of working age for every person aged 67. By 2047 this will be almost halved, to 3.2 people of working age for every person aged over 67. So with fewer people generating taxation revenue, care options of concessional and assisted aged-care residents, those with the least resources, will be jeopardised. And at this crucial time, under a dysfunctional Labor government, the agenda in Australia has been to remove support for residential-aged-care provision and waste taxpayers funds hand over fist in so many ways.


The fact that we are debating this bill prior to an election shows that this government has not prioritised aged care at all. It is no wonder that residential aged-care providers are not taking up those bed licences. Despite promises of reform, five years on under this government there is very little actual change in the communities—my communities and your communities—where it is so desperately needed. We have seen the government undertake a litany of reports and reviews, including 20 reviews and three Productivity Commission reports. They were continually ignored. They were put off until now when here we are, just prior to election, discussing aged care. They were continually ignored or responded to with more inquiries without a decision being made or anything being done to secure aged care into the future. However, the bills only cherry-pick a few recommendations of the Productivity Commission report Caring for older Australians, which brings us to the focus of the bill before the House today. 


The government's changes to aged-care funding which came into effect on 1 July last year under the Living Longer Living Better program represent, in effect, a knife to the heart of small regional aged-care service providers. I know that because they have told me. When the Labor Party and the Labor government spruiked their plan as the panacea for our aged-care system, they deliberately failed to tell the Australian people that this program in fact claws back $750 million from the aged-care sector over the next 2½ years. The actual practical result, as opposed to the misrepresentations of the government, is that residential aged-care providers will receive less funding for new patients than they got for patients last year. That is what my aged-care providers are telling me. The 2012-13 budget alone will see $500 million of ACFI funding ripped out of a sector that is already under pressure. 


Grant Thornton reported, in the Living Longer, Living Better reform report #2, of June 2012:


In the last two months since the Government's reform announcements, over $3.5 billion in planned aged care development projects have been shelved.


That is the actual result. A very frail elderly Australian entering aged care in the current year brings with them federal funding of around $56 to $63 a day less than a resident admitted in the last financial year. Given the average turnover rate in aged-care facilities of around 50 per cent per annum, by the end of the current financial year half of the residents will be supported at this new lower rate. One can only imagine what it is doing in the smaller facilities. I know you can well imagine it, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott. At the end of the next financial year, nearly all of the residents will be on the lower rate of funding. For a 40-bed unit, this would represent a loss of funding of close to half a million dollars by 2014-15. With only 40 per cent of residential aged-care providers operating in the black, I just wonder whether this government has been asleep in developing this policy and presenting it at this late date, so close to the election.


In its media release of 10 August 2012 entitled 'Aged care providers facing a $750 million revenue shortfall', Leading Age Services Australia asserts:


Aged care providers face a revenue black hole of more than $750 million over the next two-and-a-half years …


It also outlines research findings as follows: 


… 89 per cent of aged care facilities will face ""unrecoverable"" losses of revenue under the revised funding model, which came into effect on 1 July, 2012.


""This ultimately means an average reduction of between $20,000 and $23,000 in care funding for each affected resident every year"" …


…   …   …


""The average loss per aged care facility is more than $125,000 each year, with some facing revenue shortfalls of up to $560,000. Smaller and rural facilities are potentially the most affected.


I know that also for the reason that these are the providers that come and speak to me directly.


Many aged-care providers in regional Australia are already losing money. The government members need to come out into the regional areas and see exactly what this is doing. Funding for residential aged care is managed under ACFI, the Aged Care Funding Instrument, in which levels of acuity—nil, low, medium and high—are assessed over a range of biological and behavioural factors determining the funding received. The factors are categorised as activities of daily living, behaviour and complex health care, and there are 12 in total. The levels are frequently reviewed in individual patients. In one case recently, from my electorate, the patient's level of acuity rose from low to medium in the behavioural section, due to deteriorating behaviour; however, the payments actually dropped by $18 a day. Astoundingly, as the need increased, the funding reduced. 


Given the impending increase in aged-care needs bearing down on Australia in the form of our ageing population, this assault on the viability of residential aged-care providers is not acceptable or sustainable. A $56-a-day loss equates to $392 a week, or $20,440 a year, per patient. The onset of this issue will be insidious; it will be gradual, as more and more residents are turned over and lower payments become far more common. Crunch time will probably be at the end of the current financial year, when the new budgets for these providers are prepared. And if, as I heard, we are to be judged on how we treat our most vulnerable, the Labor government's new funding model is definitely a fail. This is why aged-care providers cannot afford the additional beds: they are already losing on each and every bed, so extra beds means greater losses. And that is why, of the 5,278 new residential aged-care places allocated to Western Australia since 2007, only 910, or 36 per cent, have been taken up, simply because they do not attract sufficient funding. Well, now they are going to attract even less. This government is making it even harder for our elderly by cutting support to the most needy and the most frail.


The other issue to be addressed in the government's changes is Labor's new agenda of interfering in management through the workplace supplement. In aged care the Labor government, as it has in childcare, has sought to enhance union control and government interference. It offers more money for wages, but receiving it can cost providers more than they actually receive. Aged and Community Services WA estimates that an aged-care provider who operates a small 31-bed regional facility would be eligible to receive $17,000 under the workforce supplement principles but in order to receive this would have to commit to an additional $30,000 in wages. That is a false economy—and a devious manipulation from a government becoming famous for such actions.


At the last federal election the coalition outlined our plan for the first-ever four-year agreement, and we set out some areas that we believe ought to be included in any agreement. We are committed to the delivery of a high-quality, affordable and accessible aged-care scheme that meets the needs and the preferences of older Australians. Our goal has always been to provide the very best care, whether in the community or in residential care, and particularly for people in rural and regional areas like my own electorate. The fundamental work on the first-ever aged-care provider agreement is certainly going to be retained. I certainly support the amendments moved by the member for Dickson. And I would say to those members opposite who have not spent time discussing how Labor's policies are actually impacting smaller rural and regional providers that I strongly encourage you (1) not to have aged care as a last resort of this government just prior to an election and (2) to actually get out there and talk to them on the ground; go and talk to the people in my electorate this is affecting so badly—perhaps the people at Tuia Lodge in Donnybrook. I had a whole raft of different providers, not just from my electorate but from other electorates, come to visit me just to say how badly this is affecting them. They are concerned about their ongoing viability. They are desperate to be able to provide the supports and services the people in their care need, and they so desperately want to provide these supports and services. But the government is putting all of that at risk.


I know in talking not only to the providers but to the staff as well that they are very passionate about what they do; they are passionate about the people in their care. And I know that the people who live in those communities desperately want to be able to spend their last years in small facilities in their own communities, and that is the type of facility that is on offer out in our electorates. We need to work hard to make sure these providers are in a position to offer opportunities for people in those smaller communities to actually receive the aged care they need in their local community. So, on that basis, I support the amendments moved by the member for Dickson.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2013-05-14,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (12:54):  My electorate of Canberra is the largest by population in Australia, so I proudly represent a very large number of older Australians, older Canberrans and older people who look to government to help them make sure that as they live longer they also live better. There are more than 1,100 residents in mainstream residential aged-care facilities in my electorate and I have had the pleasure of visiting many of them. I have spent a lot of time talking with residents and staff and families. Most recently, last week, I was out at Brindabella Gardens visiting Eileen Pegrum, who turned 100 last week, and I am visiting a number of other people who are turning 100 throughout this year, Canberra's centenary year, to drop flowers off for them and take some cake and just catch up with them. 


Just recently, I visited Alice Lukac at her home in Isaacs and I spent a wonderful morning with her family—her grandchildren, her daughter her granddaughter and her great granddaughters. They are very interested in education and it was wonderful not just talking to the family about their aspirations for education but also talking to this woman in the family home about her history. I visit many Canberrans throughout the course of my job every week, and it is a great pleasure in many ways to sit at their feet and just listen to the stories and the contributions they have made to Australia and, most importantly, to Canberra—people out at Araluen and St Andrews and Goodwin and Brindabella. I have also hosted a very well-attended aged-care forum with Minister Butler and I have taken the minister to meet with aged-care providers and residents around the electorate as well. He has always been very well received and has always listened very closely to the needs and the discussions with those residents, staff and families at those aged-care providers. 


Canberra is fortunate to have so many quality aged-care providers and services; however, we all recognise that the system needs to be constantly improved to meet changing demands. The current aged-care system needs to be reformed to meet the needs of an ageing Australia, and that is what we are doing. I know that, when it comes to aged care, the preference is for people to stay in their family home for as long as possible. We all want to be able to age with dignity in our own home. But, when that is not possible, we all want to be assured that there are aged-care services offering certainty and stability and dignity.


I know, from speaking to the many people in my electorate in aged-care services and the providers, that there are three things of particular concern to my community. The first is the quality of care that is being provided in the aged-care sector, the second is the financial cost associated with aged care, and the third is being confident of access to the right information to make the right choices. I have no doubt that the legislation the government is introducing today will vastly improve the way aged care is delivered in Australia. 


The government's $3.7 billion Living Longer Living Better reform package contains five bills that build on the Productivity Commission's recommendations. Many Canberrans who are involved in the aged-care sector made submissions to the Productivity Commission inquiry into caring for older Australians, and these bills represent Labor's plan for the future aged-care needs of all Australians. These are major reforms that will benefit both the key providers of aged-care services and those who need them.


Others will speak in more detail about the specifics contained in these bills, but I want to talk today about the positive impact these reforms will have in my electorate. These reforms will increase and improve the supply of aged-care services so that the sector can better address changes in demand. In a generation's time the population of people aged over 65 is expected to increase from about 3,000,000 to over 8,000,000. Labor recognises that current and future demographic changes are placing increasing pressures on the aged-care sector, which is why we are aiming to increase and improve the supply of services.


In a growing electorate like Canberra, which also serves as a regional hub and provides care to many people living in the capital region, this is a significant and welcome reform. Labor understands that families and those receiving aged-care services want to have better information so they can have greater choice and greater control. That is why we have sat down with industry and with aged-care consumers and age-care workers to create these reforms. 


In all areas of health care, access to transparent information and choice is vital. Labor has initiated a raft of improvements for consumers in all areas of health care. Most importantly, empowering people to meet their aged-care and healthcare needs is at the centre of our reforms. I know these measures will be welcomed by aged-care providers and aged-care consumers.


In my many visits to aged care homes and in my conversations with providers and residents, workforce issues are almost always raised with me. They are always, if not at the start of the conversation, in the middle of the conversation. They are up there. We must have a stable, skilled and dedicated workforce to deliver the reforms Labor is bringing about. These bills specifically address the workforce issues in aged care with measures to attract and retain a skilled and capable workforce. There is up to $1.2 billion in funding to address workplace pressures.


I note that the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing just recently announced 72 new aged-care nursing scholarships as part of Labor's commitment to boost the aged-care workforce. This was in addition to an investment of more than 2,800 scholarships over four years. The scholarships provide financial support for people to study nursing at university or to undertake continuing professional development. They also support people who wish to undertake nurse re-entry studies—that is particularly important. These scholarships are part of the government's efforts to address workforce pressures, with the aged-care workforce needing to almost triple in size—as my colleague pointed out—by 2050 to support our ageing population.


I am particularly supportive of the measures that will expand, support and improve access to aged-care services for people with diverse needs. I know the Greek population here has its own aged-care facility and it is particularly important that the diverse needs of Australia's population and of Canberra's population are factored into future aged-care services. My electorate is not just large but very diverse. In all areas of service provision, understanding and catering to a range of different people's needs is critical. This is something the government truly understands and is acting upon. For my electorate, this means the quality of aged-care provision will continue to improve, and Canberrans can feel confident that their loved ones will receive the best quality care possible.


The other issue raised with me is the financial cost of aged-care provision. This is a vexed issue, and I know there are different views in the sector about how to address it. In these bills we see measures that will improve the equity and the sustainability of aged-care sector financing. People entering the aged-care system need to understand exactly how much they have to pay, what they are paying for and why. The current system of government subsidies and user contributions for both residential and home care can vary. The changes we are introducing will greatly improve transparency and provide greater clarity. These reforms will result in better alignment of financial arrangements and ensure a more sustainable future for aged-care funding. Under these reforms, those who can afford to help pay for the aged care will be asked to do so while those who cannot afford to pay will still be able to access aged care.


Through these bills, the government is building a more sustainable future for aged-care funding and giving consumers real choices about how they pay for their care. For the first time, people will have real choice in how they pay for the accommodation they receive. At the same time, we are also improving the regulation of residential aged care. We are making sure there is more opportunity for care recipients and their families to purchase additional services. We are creating an aged-care system that will be simpler to navigate, will be fairer and that will create a better pathway for transition from home to residential care.


We are creating a new veterans supplement, dementia supplement and workforce supplement. We are investing millions into dementia research and help for those affected by this condition. From 1 July next year there will be just one type of approval for permanent residential care. There will also be greater continuity of services, and it will be easier under these reforms for people to move through the aged-care system.


In broad terms, these are the major changes contained in these bills. They are measures that have undergone extensive consultation, particularly here in my electorate of Canberra. I understand that the consultation process has been welcomed and was positive, and that following the introduction of these bills there will be ongoing information sessions both here in Canberra and throughout the country.


Labor is introducing landmark legislation that will create an aged care system that will meet the demands and wishes of our ageing population. I commend the bills to the House.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2013-05-14,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (13:05):  I rise, following on from the member for Canberra, who spoke about the importance of seniors wanting to live with dignity in their own homes and that if that were not possible, with certainty and stability in aged care facilities such as retirement villages and nursing homes. On that point I certainly agree with her wholeheartedly, as I am sure all members in this House would.


We do have an ageing population, and that is why discussion about the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013, Australian Aged Care Quality Agency Bill 2013, Australian Aged Care Quality Agency (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013, Aged Care (Bond Security) Amendment Bill 2013 and Aged Care (Bond Security) Levy Amendment Bill 2013 is so vitally important. Whilst I agree with the member for Canberra on some of the statements she made on the Commonwealth being able to provide for those people in their twilight years, certainly her side of politics has not helped our aged people to be able to live with the dignity that they deserve.


During the 2010 election campaign, the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, stated that aged care reform would be a second-term priority. In the same election campaign the Prime Minister had to deny that she had not supported big increases to the age pension because 'old people never vote for us'. Last year this Labor government, which tonight will deliver its sixth successive budget deficit, cut $1.6 billion from the aged care funding instrument, the ACFI, to fund a $1.2 billion workforce compact. The ACFI is the means by which Commonwealth subsidies are allocated to residential aged care providers. The government justified this by publicly suggesting widespread rorting was occurring amongst aged care providers, even though there has not been a single—not one!—prosecution in five years. An entire sector has been tainted—sullied—by this outrageous claim.


This government has undertaken numerous reports and reviews, including 20 reviews and three Productivity Commission reports. These reviews and reports have either been ignored continually or responded to with even more inquiries without any decisions being made to secure aged care into the future. Five years on, there is still no change on the ground—five years on.


In 2010 the government asked the Productivity Commission to undertake an inquiry into the aged care system, and the final report, Caring for older Australians, was released by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Mark Butler, on 8 August 2011. Eight months later, on 20 April 2012, the Prime Minister and Minister Butler announced the government's response to the report entitled Living longer. Living better.


The bills before the House today implement those parts of the package which require legislative changes, whilst implementations that required no legislative action began in April 2012. The Living Longer Living Better package of the five bills we are debating now does not resolve many outstanding viability issues for providers. These bills seek to: (1) remove the distinction between low-level and high-level residential care so there will be only one approval process for residential aged care; (2) provide a new means test, combining income and assets tests and new annual and lifetime caps on means-tested care fees; (3) allow accommodation costs to be paid for through a refundable lump sum, a rental periodic-style supplement or combination; (4) make changes to home care, including requiring a contribution for people who enter home care on or after 1 July 2014; (5) establish a new aged-care pricing commissioner; (6) extend the operation of the Accommodation Bond Guarantee Scheme to new bond arrangements reflected in the government's reforms; and, finally, establish the new Australian Aged Care Quality Agency to replace the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency from 1 January next year.


In typical Labor style, the government has cherry-picked from the Productivity Commission report, with industry sources estimating that only five to eight per cent of the recommendations have been adopted. We heard the member for Canberra just moments ago talking about how the government had consulted, how it had made wide-ranging representations to the sector. However, we all know, certainly in this House and certainly on this side of the House, just what the level of Labor consultation goes to. It is not sufficient, it is not adequate; it is never anywhere good enough. The final report received extensive industry support, with 500 submissions made to the Productivity Commission during the inquiry and an additional 500 made following the release of the draft report. Yet Labor all too often ignores the advice it has been given, as it certainly did when it decided to come out with a report following on from the Productivity Commission's, and it does not go far enough to talk to the industry sectors, whether it is agriculture, defence or, in this case, aged care.


According to a Grant Thornton report from June 2012 following the announcement of the Living Longer Living Better package, more than $3.5 billion worth of planned aged-care development projects have been shelved. Further, an August 2012 media release from Leading Aged Care Services stated that aged-care providers face a 'black hole of more than $750 million over the next 2½ years'.


The Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013 will remove the distinction between low-level and high-level residential care, so there will be only one type of approval for residential aged care. The minister has argued this will mean fewer reassessments and allow individuals requiring a permanent residential care place to access any service to meet their needs. The bill will make significant changes to the residential care subsidies and fees for recipients who enter care on or after 1 July next year. This will include a new means test combining incomes and assets tests and new annual and lifetime caps on means tested care fees. As the minister outlined in his second reading speech, the annual cap of $25,000 will be applied for means tested care fees, with a lifetime cap of $60,000. These fees are also both to be indexed.


With regard to accommodation costs, this bill will allow fees to be paid through a refundable lump sum, a rent or periodic style supplement, or combination thereof. Aged-care providers will not be able to distinguish between care recipients based on how they will pay for their accommodation. Clause 52G-3 will provide that the minister may, by legislative instruments, determine the maximum amount of accommodation payment which an approved provider may charge a person, including the maximum daily accommodation payment amount, and a method of working out the refundable accommodation deposit.


This bill will also introduce a new form of care, home care, from 1 July 2013 which will replace community aged-care packages, extended aged care at home and extended aged care at home dementia. An income tested care fee will also be applied to home care for all except full pensioners. This fee will also be capped by year and lifetime, starting on 1 July 2014. The Aged Care Pricing Commissioner will be established under this bill to make decisions on pricing issues. The functions of the commissioner will be to approve extra service fees, to approve accommodation payments which are higher than the maximum amount of accommodation payment determined by the minister, and other functions as determined by other legislation or by the minister. Furthermore, this bill provides for an independent review to commence in 2016 and a report to the parliament by 30 June 2017.


The Aged Care (Bond Security) Amendment Bill 2013 and the Aged Care (Bond Security) Levy Amendment Bill 2013 will extend the operation of the accommodation bond guarantee scheme to new bond arrangements reflected in the government's reforms. The Australian bond guarantee scheme as prescribed in the 2006 act provides a mechanism by which the Commonwealth may repay outstanding bond balances to care recipients should a provider become insolvent or unable to refund balances. There is also the capacity for the Commonwealth to recover the costs of refunding those bonds according to the Aged Care (Bond Security) Levy Act 2006, which is amended to reflect the changes to accommodation in the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013.


The new Australian Aged Care Quality Agency, to replace the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency from 1 January next year, is established under the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency Bill 2013. This new body will be the sole agency which providers of aged care will deal with in relation to quality assurance of aged-care services providers, whether in the home or in a residential facility. The functions of the new agency will be to accredit residential care facilities; conduct quality reviews of home care services; promote high-quality care innovation in quality management and continuous improvement amongst approved providers of aged care; and provide information, education and training to approved providers of aged care. The Australian Aged Care Quality Agency (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 will enable the transfer of assets and liabilities from the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency Ltd to the Commonwealth to facilitate the establishment of the new Australian Aged Care Quality Agency from New Year's Day 2014.


On 7 November last year I hosted the shadow minister for ageing and mental health, Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, in my electorate of Riverina. We held a forum attended by a large number of aged-care providers and interested people at Griffith to discuss their thoughts and concerns about the Living Longer Living Better proposals specifically and aged-care services more broadly. We also visited Scalabrini Village, Griffith, where Lauren Kingsbury showed us through before we visited the Griffith Neighbourhood House to discuss with Monica Beckman the facility and the funding needs it has to continue to provide much-needed services to the community—a community, I might add, which has been hard-hit in recent times by poor water policy from this government, and a community which has an ageing population. Many of those people came to this country to start a new life after the ravages of World War II. They did everything this government required of them in building a wonderful city and a wonderful community, and they now deserve the very best treatment in aged-care services that this country and this government can provide, because they have done their bit to help this nation—certainly to grow food to help feed this nation and others—and now we owe it to them to repay that faith that they showed in this country. Many of them, of course, are Australian born, and they too have done their bit—more than their bit, I might add—to help this country and to make it the great food provider that it is. It behoves us to make sure that we look after those people in their twilight years.


One of the major failings of this package is the opportunity the government has missed to reduce the administrative burden—and haven't we heard that on so many levels, in so many speeches that I and many of my colleagues have given—and the red tape and, in too many cases, the green tape. In a sector already swaddled in red tape, this package will deliver even more regulation. The point is repeatedly made—and indeed, was made at the aged-care forum in Griffith that I hosted—that aged-care nurses spend a significant amount of time on unnecessary paperwork. This package is only going to make the piles of paperwork grow and grow and, unfortunately, grow.


The coalition wants reform in partnership with the aged-care sector, and we will provide that. Hopefully, we will be able to do that after 14 September. We do not believe fundamental reform should be imposed from above. Should we be elected to government, we will deliver the first ever aged-care providers' agreement framework, which will be the cornerstone of all of our policy. We want this agreement in place within a year of our taking office in order to begin the real reform that this sector so desperately needs and that Labor has continually failed to deliver.


In my time available, I will also mention the Haven's recent $7.8 million upgrade, which was completed and opened on 27 March. I was fortunate enough to be at that opening with the general manager of that fine organisation, Shane McMullen. Interestingly, the renovation and enlargement of 36 single rooms within the Nan Roberts Community, the construction of two more rooms, improvements to staff facilities and all of the rest were done without government grants. Recurrent funding was used to complete the upgrade, and the South Wagga Lions Club, a wonderful community organisation, did so much work and so much fundraising to make that a reality. All too sadly, in regional areas communities are left to fund their own projects. I could mention the radiotherapy centre at Wagga Wagga, where the community pitched in when there was no—or very little—government help forthcoming to make sure that they got their own facility, which is now the pride of southern New South Wales as far as those facilities are concerned. It is used all too frequently, I might add, because of the number of cancer sufferers and patients in southern New South Wales. But it is still a marvellous and necessary facility. At the moment, there is a very dedicated group of people working to provide palliative care services in Wagga Wagga. Hopefully, this government or a future government will be able to provide much-needed funding for that particular issue and that particular cause, which is so very vital in Wagga Wagga and, indeed, the Riverina electorate I represent.

"Markus, Louise, MP",LP,2013-05-14,"



Mrs MARKUS
 (Macquarie) (13:20):  I rise to speak on the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013 and cognate bills. I believe that one of the ways we as a society are judged is the way in which we look after and care for our elderly. Those in aged-care facilities are at a very vulnerable and sometimes difficult stage in life. We have all been in a position where a grandmother, grandfather or parent has had to go into aged care, and as fellow human beings we know that our elderly deserve not only dignity but also respect at this stage of their lives. We have a responsibility to the aged—to our seniors—to provide them with the best services and care available and to support the service providers who engage and respond to their needs.


During the 2010 election campaign the Prime Minister said, 'If re-elected, further aged-care reform will be a second-term priority for my government.' Australians can add that statement to the list of broken promises by this Prime Minister. We have seen a government undertake a litany of reports and reviews, including 20 reviews and three Productivity Commission reports, which are continually ignored or responded to with more inquiries without making any decisions to secure aged care into the future.


Despite promises of reform, five years on there is very little evidence of real change on the ground, where it counts the most. After five years of Labor's neglect our aged-care system needs urgent change to provide viable and effective aged-care services for older Australians. Labor has failed to undertake proper and sustainable reform and to make the hard decisions to give effect to it. It is clear that the Living Longer Living Better package of five bills does not resolve many outstanding viability issues for providers. Under these reforms there have been cuts from the Aged Care Funding Instrument—ACFI—that have placed substantially more pressure on the sector. The bills only cherry pick a few recommendations of the Productivity Commission report Caring for older Australians from August 2011. They add to regulation in what is already a highly regulated sector. The bills establish the framework for the workforce compact, which has created uncertainty, potentially will be costly for providers, relies on cuts to ACFI and appears to be a political mechanism to unionise the sector.


Only the coalition has a clear plan for the future of aged care in this nation. We understand that it is only by working closely with the sector and consulting those who are on the front line that real reform can be achieved. We want to work in partnership with the ageing and aged-care sector to achieve sustainable reform through our first-ever four-year aged-care provider agreement. Older Australians in the sector are no closer to knowing how structural reform would be introduced and how it would affect the care they receive and where they receive it.


The ageing of our population is one of the biggest social issues facing Australians and is an issue that needs to be addressed now, not somewhere down the track or into the future. Australians are living longer, but we have a rapidly ageing population. In its Global ageing 2010: an irreversible truth, Standard & Poor's rating service said that age related spending on health, pensions and aged care in Australia is estimated to rise to 14.4 per cent of gross domestic product in 2050. It is currently 9.6 per cent. Around nine per cent of our population is aged 70 years or older, and this is expected to rise to 13 per cent by 2021 and to 20 per cent—around 5.7 million people—in 2051. As we are ageing we are acquiring more complex health conditions and changing disease patterns, resulting in increasing and changing aged-care needs. With fewer people generating taxation revenue, care options for concessional and assisted aged-care residents—those with the least resources—will be jeopardised.


There is growing and alarming evidence that the aged-care sector cannot provide the care that Australians expect. There are real economic implications for our nation because of our ageing population, and these implications have not been taken seriously by this government. Until there is a proper structural reform of the sector, the care and wellbeing of senior Australians is in jeopardy. Australia has one of the most advanced aged-care systems in the world. However, it can be complex and difficult to navigate. Currently over one million older Australians are receiving aged-care services subsidised by the Australian government. It is expected that by 2050 over 3.5 million Australians will be using aged care each year. Formal aged-care services are delivered through around 8,000 outlets across Australia, including about 3,660 agencies registered as delivering services funded through the HACC program, 2,095 operational community care services delivering community packages, and more than 2,700 operational residential aged-care facilities. The number of over-85-year-olds, which are the main users of aged-care services, will increase from around 400,000, or 1.7 per cent of the total population, in 2007 to 1.6 million by 2047—about 5.6 per cent for the population. The Department of Health and Ageing estimates that by 2050 aged-care expenditure will account for three per cent of GDP and a bit more than 827,000, or five per cent, of the Australian workforce may be engaged in the provision of aged care.


If there was ever a call to action for reform of aged care, this is it. These statistics are alarming and call for careful planning and action. However, at a time when there is increasing demand for services, providers are walking away from the sector because of the lack of viability of providing high-care beds and the increase in compliance demands of the government. It has been reported that up to 60 per cent of aged-care facilities are operating in the red. That is a staggering amount and reflects the economic situation that many providers find themselves in. Providers are handing back licences, and senior Australians are having to wait longer or travel further to find a bed, thereby placing extra pressure on the public hospital system and, most importantly and unfortunately, on their families. This is in contrast with the situation that we would hope to achieve under the coalition. 


The Productivity Commission's final report, Caring for older Australians, was publicly released by the Prime Minister and minister on 8 August 2011. This report focuses on a shift from the current ration system based on licences and packages to an entitlement based system whereby aged care would become part of the health system. Other key features of the report include the creation of a single Australian seniors gateway agency and the recommendation that funding be replaced by a single national care co-contribution regime, which would apply across the aged-care system, whether services are delivered in the community or in a residential aged-care facility. It took the Australian government over 250 days to respond to 58 recommendations within the Productivity Commission's report. When that response finally came it was announced with great fanfare as supposedly extensive reform of the aged-care system. Whilst the headline figure of $3.7 billion over five years sounded impressive, the actual amount of new money to be spent was $577 million. Furthermore, many of the changes will not start until 1 July 2014, so the effect will not be felt until well after the next federal election. The coalition and I acknowledge that one of the failures in the aged-care reform package is the missed opportunity to reduce red tape. This is something that the sector has been urgently demanding. In a sector already wallowing in red tape, this package will heap on them more red tape and more bureaucracies to deal with. The coalition has been advised that aged-care nurses spend on average a third of their time on paperwork. Under this package, things are only going to get worse.


This is not real reform; this is another case of Labor talking but not doing anything. Some key issues have caused major concern to stakeholders: the decision to rip $1.6 billion out of the ACFI, the $1.2 billion workforce compact, and the establishment of the Aged Care Financing Authority. One critical need to be addressed is the almost 321,600 Australians living with dementia. When in government, the coalition committed $320 million in the 2005 budget to help fund the Dementia Initiative, making dementia a national health priority. Despite this initiative proving invaluable to help dementia sufferers, and a government evaluation of October 2009 finding the initiative successful, Labor deliberately dropped funding for this program. It was pleasing to see that at a subsequent meeting of health ministers dementia has now been made a national health priority. The coalition is committed to delivering a high quality, affordable and accessible aged-care scheme that meets the needs and preferences of older Australians.


At the last federal election, the coalition outlined its plan for the first ever four-year agreement and we set out some areas which we believe ought to be included in any agreement. We undertook to provide certainty of care through the first ever four-year aged-care provider agreement with the aged-care sector, and as part of that process we outlined various areas for inclusion in such an agreement. There was a very positive response. Since the last federal election, the coalition has continued to listen to the aged-care sector. We will be revising our policy before the next federal election. The fundamental framework—the first ever aged-care provider agreement framework—will be retained. It is important to stress that this is the first ever aged-care provider agreement. It would ensure certainty and engagement for the aged-care sector. In much the same way as the pharmacy agreement shapes that sector, this agreement would set the framework for aged care in Australia for the next four years.


The coalition plan to reduce red tape as an important component of our four-year agreement. Providing flexibility and certainty, we want to work with the sector to cut red tape in ways which will provide efficiencies without compromising the quality of care. The agreement will deliver better and more affordable aged care by: reducing red tape and enabling nurses to get back to nursing residents; providing certainty for aged care for older Australians, underpinned by a high quality framework; delivering value for money through revised subsidy arrangements; ensuring certainty for the aged-care workforce; establishing a more flexible and viable aged-care provider network to meet care needs now and in the future; and ensuring that the comfort and safety of older Australians is maximised.


The coalition want reform in partnership with the aged-care sector. We do not believe that fundamental reform should be imposed from above. Given the opportunity to govern following the next federal election, we will immediately commence consultation with stakeholders in the ageing and aged-care sector on the framework for the aged-care provider agreement, including consideration of the recommendations of the Productivity Commission. The coalition want an agreement in place within a year of taking office.


The coalition does not want to pre-empt the contents of any negotiated agreement. The agreement framework establishes a formal pathway for future dialogue between the minister, the government and stakeholders to more effectively consider ongoing issues regarding timely and appropriate access to aged care. It will guarantee flexibility and much needed certainty in the sector. Principal Endeavour aged-care facility, in the electorate of Macquarie, have the following statement in their mission statement:


Our aim is not just to provide a home, but to provide a lifestyle surrounded by a caring, active, wholesome community.


I too believe that this should be the aim of every aged-care facility, but this can only happen by real change and reform and through the government partnering with the sector to allow them to do what they do best. I support the amendment moved by the shadow minister today and commend it to the House.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (13:33):  I strongly support these bills finally passing into the House. It has been disappointing that it has taken so long for them to finally make it to the chamber, but I hope that they do pass this House and the other place relatively quickly, because I know there are many, both in the workforce and as aged-care providers, in the sector who are very keen to see this legislation pass.


In my electorate on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales and, indeed, on the east coast, aged care is the boom industry of the moment. Quite often, it is not seen as an economic driver and an economic sector, but for my region and, indeed, for the east coast, we are seeing more growth in aged care than in industries such as mining and more jobs in health and community services than in the mining sector. It does fly under the radar, but this is an incredibly important economic driver for the east coast and for regions like the mid-North Coast of New South Wales as service provision for our ageing demographic becomes more and more important in Australia over the coming years. I am certainly a strong advocate of getting the aged-care sector right and making sure that we provide the best quality of care possible for the many residents in our area who, in a number of different ways, require services. 


By way of a stocktake, in the Lyne electorate on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales, we currently have 409 community aged-care packages; 40 Extended Aged Care at Home packages, known as EACH packages; and 24 Extended Aged Care at Home Dementia packages. All of those touch only the surface of what is really required. I think that is a mood shared by all members in this chamber. Whilst each of these packages is certainly welcome, the need far outweighs what is being provided to date by all levels of government and by both sides of parliament. Ensuring that a quality level of service is provided in what is a growing market in communities such as those on the mid-North Coast is an enormous challenge. In 2012-13, 144 home care package places were also advertised in the mid-North Coast aged-care planning region. 


I am not one to criticise the aged-care sector at all. At times, various stories emerge in this parliament or in various communities that shock you, but they are rare. I believe that the quality of care in Australia today is at a level of excellence that we as a country should actually be very proud of. Both our monitoring and reporting standards are some of the best in the world and, again, I do not think we sing the praises enough of our culture of care for the various stages through the ageing process.


Every day on the mid-North Coast I see quality providers, a quality workforce and families of carers who really do rally around their family members, who work their way through the spectrum of care and who really want to see the best outcome possible for them. We as Australians should enhance that culture and, hopefully, this range of bills today will be another step along that journey.


I have tracked these bills pretty closely with the support of some local aged-care providers, whom I would like to mention: Dennis Marks, the CEO of Bundaleer Care Services; John Butler, the CEO of Nambucca Valley Care Ltd; Errol Curran, the Director of Residential Aged Care Services and the Chief Financial Officer of the Bushland Health Group; and Steven Quirk, Chief Executive Officer of St Agnes' Parish, Catholic Care of the Aged, in Port Macquarie. Others have been involved at various times in our roundtable meetings that we have been holding. The group wanted to take up with the government a range of detailed issues that have emerged, in particular with Minister Butler, to the point where, three or four months ago, I brought them down to Canberra and the minister kindly met them. It looks as though, as a consequence of some of those meetings, there have been some changes to the final bills. That has been a worthwhile process. The feedback from the group at this stage is that this package of bills is not going to cure all ills. It is not going to get the workforce pay to the level it should be, to be competitive to attract the absolute best staff possible, but it is a step forward.


Likewise, there are some issues for mid-tier residential providers in lower socioeconomic communities. There are still some question marks about this aged care reform package continuing to allow those very noble and important providers to stay viable. But I am fully aware that the government is watching and tracking that and, if there are issues that emerge, hopefully all governments will be very quick in responding to that. As one part of a suite of measures, this package of reforms I think is one to support, and hopefully the House supports it relatively swiftly.


This fits in well with some local work that we have been doing. The mid-North Coast is one of the first regions in Australia to develop a dementia care plan. We do have an epidemic in Australia coming, if not arrived, in the area of dementia. Rather than just wallow in the concerns of the epidemic hitting us, I am really pleased that our community has come together and put a bit of a strategy together that will align well with these aged care reforms. And I would encourage government to have a look at the work we have done and to provide what resources are possible to allow our region to maximise the work we have been doing locally in trying to deal with the very high number of dementia patients now, and with the significant growth expected in the near term. 


The other point I did want to make is on the jobs plan we put together locally. As I said before, the health and community service area is our boom industry of the moment on the mid-North Coast, and so aged care workforce needs are really important to us. I wanted to take this chance to thank the many people who have been involved in the many meetings in making sure our workforce needs meet the demands. They include the local employment coordinator, Renee Hawkins, the aged care workforce coordinator, Jan Johnson, and the new group that has come into town, the Aged Care Workforce Innovation Network. This group is now funded by the Australian government and led by the aged care peak bodies in partnership with the Community Services and Health Industry Skills Council and is now starting to pull together some really good work in our region to address a lot of these workforce needs today and into the future.


I am pleased that, because our region has been working so hard with so little and had to collaborate a lot, we have now become one of the regions to lead in this workforce innovation network. Collaboration is one of the keys that allows that industry development work to take shape. Very quickly, of the 10 regions funded, the mid-North Coast is looking like one of the standouts because we have been collaborating on the smell of an oily rag for a long time, and had to do that to basically survive as a region. I thank everyone involved in that process, both within and around government but also more importantly at a committee level, for really investing time and energy into the many meetings—everyone hates meetings, but they have made a difference and they certainly are setting us up as a region where our aged care workforce will be viable and strong, our providers will be viable and strong and our quality of care, therefore, will be viable and strong. 


I think the mid-North Coast is one of the best places in Australia for anyone to hit retirement age. That is not only for the healthy living issues and all of our wonderful beaches and rivers, but also for that spectrum of care around aged care, when and if required. I hope these bills go through, I hope they go through with bipartisan support and I hope they make a big difference in once again taking a step forward in the quality of care for the aged care sector in Australia today.


Debate adjourned.

"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2013-05-14,"



Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson) (12:03):  I rise to speak on the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013 and the related bills. For the many of us who have had a relative requiring care, the experience can be a daunting and at times personally distressing experience. Irrespective of their financial position, our grandfather, grandmother, mother or father deserve respect, dignity and quality in their senior years. As family members we want to know what options are available for our loved ones. The simpler the system is to navigate, the better for all concerned. There should be opportunities for appropriate care in the home. Understandably, so many want to stay in the surroundings they love and that are familiar to them and their family. If they require residential care—low or high care—there should be options readily available, preferably in their local community.


I do respect the intent of aspects of the reforms that have been proposed. We know that there are many, many challenges ahead and the proportion of the population over 70 years of age is expected to double over future decades. The incidence of chronic disease continues to grow rapidly. One million Australians receive aged-care services subsidised by the Commonwealth, and that is expected to more than double by 2050. Despite this, the government's approach to aged care and much promised reform has been protracted to say the least. The government announced the Productivity Commission's terms of reference almost three years ago. The draft report was released in January 2011, and the final report was provided to the government in June of that year. The minister and Prime Minister did not publicly release the report until August 2011, and it took a further 250 days to respond to the PC's recommendations in the form of the Living Longer Living Better policy.


The government trumpeted the release on the day as a revolution for the sector. The government continues to claim that this policy is a $3.7 billion investment when it is not. Not surprisingly, stakeholders were initially enthusiastic given the flashy headlines. Looking at the finer detail, the proposals are nowhere near as ambitious as first made out. That has been a current theme across the last six years under the stewardship of this government. The government is saving over $560 million through means testing, and they include that as part of the so-called $3.7 billion investment. Over $2½ billion is being redirected from existing programs, including $1.6 billion from the Aged Care Funding Instrument. Places and funding are to be transferred from residential care to home care, and funding will be cut from the Long Stay Older Patients initiative. The net investment over four years is just $284.6 million, not $3.7 billion. In fact, it is less than one per cent of the existing aged-care budget over the forward estimates. The unanticipated changes to ACFI and how they are applied have reduced confidence in a sector already struggling to break even.


It is, to say the least, a ham-fisted and counterproductive way to initiate reforms. In the few months following the policy's release, $3.5 billion of capital projects were found to be in jeopardy as a result of the uncertainty caused. In fact, independent analysis undertaken by the Centre for International Economics for Leading Age Services Australia found a revenue black hole of more than $750 million for providers due to the ACFI cuts. The average reduction for each affected resident is estimated at between $20,000 and $30,000 in care funding every year. This corresponds with what we are hearing from providers, and it is particularly hard on the smaller operators and those in regional and rural areas.


The minister has implied that there has been rorting and 'unusual claiming'. However, at Senate estimates it was confirmed that there has not been a single prosecution in the last five years. The sector is crying out for incentives to invest in new capital to open new beds. The government's actions so far appear to have had the opposite effect. The other significant aspect, recently launched by the government, is the workforce compact. This complex arrangement appears to be linked to the funding lost through the ACFI changes. Under the compact, providers with 50 beds or more must have an enterprise bargaining agreement to receive that funding. Those with fewer than 50 beds do not require an EBA but must still comply with the compact obligations to access funding. In itself, this will impose further cost pressures, again particularly affecting smaller providers in rural and regional areas. Providers unable to comply with these requirements will not be able to access the funding.


Across the sector there is recognition that the hardworking staff in aged care need to be paid well for the demanding and important work they perform, but this proposal, certainly by any objective analysis, seems more about propping up the beleaguered HSU than about genuinely helping the workers, those in care or, indeed, the providers.


The bills before the parliament today enacting the government's Living Longer Living Better policy reflect a small hit-and-miss selection of the Productivity Commission's recommendations. Specifically, the bills: (1) remove the distinction between low-level and high-level residential care; (2) provide a new means test combining income and assets tests and new annual and lifetime caps on means tested care fees; (3) allow accommodation costs to be paid through a refundable lump sum, a rental periodic style supplement or combination; (4) make changes to home care, including requiring contributions for people that enter home care on or after 1 July 2014; (5) establish a new aged-care pricing commissioner; (6) extend the operation of the accommodation bond guarantee scheme to new bond arrangements reflected in the government's reforms; and, finally, establish the new Australian Aged Care Quality Agency to replace the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency from 1 January 2014.


The Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013 removes the distinction between low care and high care, which is intended to provide one approval process for residential care. It is argued by the minister that this will reduce reassessments and allow individuals requiring a permanent residential care place to access services according to need. The bill proposes changes to the residential care subsidies and fees for residents who enter care on or after 1 July 2014. This includes a new means test combining income and asset tests and new annual and lifetime caps on means tested care fees. As stated in the minister's second reading speech an annual cap of $25,000 will apply for means tested fees, with a lifetime cap of $60,000. Both are to be indexed. Any contribution does require an appropriate safety net. We do not want a situation where people are precluded from necessary care because of what they are required to pay. It is appropriate that the proposed contributions and respective caps are examined as part of the Senate inquiry.


I recognise that there is a delicate balance between funding quality care, ensuring affordability of care and the sustainability of the system overall. In relation to accommodation costs the bill will allow fees to be paid through a refundable lump sum, or a rental periodic-style supplement, or a combination of the two. It is stated that aged care providers will not be able to distinguish between care recipients based on means of payment. Clause 52G(3) provides that the minister may by legislative instrument determine the maximum amount of accommodation that an approved provider may charge, including the maximum daily accommodation payment amount and the method for working out the refundable accommodation deposit. The bill also proposes a new form of home care to replace community aged care packages, extended aged care at home and dementia packages. An income tested care fee will apply to home care for all except pensioners. This again will be capped by year and by lifetime.


The Aged Care Pricing Commissioner is also established for the stated purpose of making decisions on pricing issues. The functions of the commissioner are as follows: to approve extra service fees; to approve accommodation payments that are higher than the maximum amount of accommodation payment determined by the minister; and other functions as determined by other acts or by the minister by determination. Whilst I acknowledge that there are lead times for these changes, the independent review proposed in the legislation is not to commence until 2016 and will not report to parliament until 30 June 2017.


The two bond security amendment bills extend the operation of the Accommodation Bond Guarantee Scheme to new accommodation payment arrangements. The Australian Bond Guarantee Scheme, prescribed in the 2006 act, provides a mechanism by which the Commonwealth may repay outstanding bond balances to care recipients should a provider become insolvent or be unable to refund the balances. There is also the capacity for the Commonwealth to recover the cost of refunding these bonds which is amended through the relevant act to reflect the changes to accommodation payments.


The Australian Aged Care Quality Agency Bill 2013 establishes a new agency. This is to replace the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency from January next year. Aged care providers will be responsible to it for quality assurance of aged care services delivered in the home or a residential facility. The functions of the new agency are as follows: accrediting residential care facilities; conducting quality reviews of home care services; promoting high quality care, innovation and continuous improvement amongst approved providers of aged care; and providing information, education and training to approved providers of aged care.


I am yet to be convinced that red tape in what is already a highly regulated sector has been appropriately streamlined or that it has even been genuinely a priority for the government in this process. I do support high standards and efficient regulation to ensure consistent, quality services for the many vulnerable people in care, but nothing is achieved by unnecessary red tape except a diversion of much needed resources away from those most in need. If we want an innovative and efficient sector, unnecessary red tape cannot be ignored.


The related Australian Aged Care Quality Agency (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 enables the transfer of assets and liabilities from the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency Ltd to the Commonwealth to facilitate the establishment of the new agency. Over $20 million was included in the budget for the Aged Care Financing Authority and over $14 million for the Aged Care Reform Implementation Council. About half the council's budget is for communications. The financing authority's role will be to provide independent advice on pricing and financing issues. It will make recommendations about subsidies and payments. It will also approve higher fees for accommodation and extra services not covered by subsidies. While there may be good intent and while we do not disagree with some of the functions performed, there has been a proliferation of separate bureaucratic structures under this government; in fact, it is a hallmark of this government. We believe more focus should be on the resources for front-line services and reducing where possible costly bureaucracy.


The government's time lines are peculiar on these bills. Despite years of deliberation, the bills were only introduced in the last sitting period, and the minister has said that they should be passed immediately. The government has set the snail pace of these reforms to date. The government has not brought the bills on for debate until today. I am not sure why or how procedurally the minister was expecting to ram the bills through the parliament. This is far from what should be normal process.


The coalition is keen to support good reform in this important area. Disappointingly for some, the reforms proposed fall very well short of what was promised. The House should remember that this is the minister who is responsible for delivering 16 early psychosis prevention and intervention centres, yet since 2010, when that promise was made, a grand total of zero of the 16 has been delivered. This is despite the Prime Minister herself saying: 


I want to be absolutely clear—mental health will be a second term priority for this Government.


Those people right across the Australian community in the mental health sector, those people who access services provided by mental health providers or, indeed, those people in the aged-care sector can add that quote from the Prime Minister to the long list of broken promises that has come to plague this government. For the aged-care sector, this is not a good track record, and it comes on the back of so many other implementation blunders across the rest of government.


The bills have rightly been referred to a Senate inquiry, and the coalition will carefully consider the findings and the submissions. A number of changes will be enacted by regulation rather than legislation, and some of that detail is yet to be provided and will also require responsible scrutiny. This House should have the opportunity to properly consider any complex changes to aged care. The Senate inquiry provides that opportunity. We need to ensure that we can at least achieve the best outcome from what is before us.


In closing, I want to say to the many providers that I have spoken to around the country, particularly regional providers, that we hear their concerns. We do share their view that this minister has a tin ear when it comes to the concerns that they have raised either with the government or through the peak bodies about some of the sections within this act. It is exactly the reason that we set up the Senate inquiry and asked for people across the sector to provide input so that we can improve this legislation. As I say, the time lines on this legislation have been protracted. It has gone on for the last six years. It is interesting to note that out of the billions of dollars that this government wasted in its response to the GFC not one dollar was spent on aged care: no money for additional infrastructure or for providers, no money in wage compacts, no money for patients and services provided to the clients and residents within aged-care facilities—not a dollar.


This government came into power in 2007 promising that it would reform the aged-care sector. This minister has only been in the portfolio since the second half of these six years of the disastrous Rudd-Gillard government, but the dysfunction has continued up until this very day, and we are seeing it play out in this bill. We all want to see a better outcome for older Australians in terms of their interaction with the aged-care system, and the coalition is committed to trying to resolve some of those outstanding issues. We wanted to entertain consideration of this bill, but we also wanted to ask for providers, for care givers, for people of good intent to come forward to that Senate inquiry to make sure that their detail was provided, that their concerns were aired, and we expected that the government would listen to some of those concerns. This is a government that cannot be trusted. It says, 'Trust us in the detail; we've got the bare bones of the legislation now and we'll rush all of the other detail through in another process,' but this government cannot be trusted.


The Treasurer will deliver the speech tonight that people are anticipating will chart some way forward from the disaster of the last five or six years, but people will not get the outcome that they want from this Treasurer, they will not get the outcome that they want from this government, because that has been the track record over the last six years. Because of this government's dysfunction, because of distractions with leadership, because it has promised surpluses and then failed to deliver them, because it has spent money and run us into enormous debt, it is unfortunate that people who are looking for aged care-services in our country today have suffered because of that distraction. They have suffered because this government decided that aged care was not a priority for the Rudd government and it has not been a priority for the Gillard government.


I think the responsible course of action for this government to take would be to listen to the concerns of those who raised them, quite rightly, in the Senate process and to look at sensible amendments that could be proposed to try and improve this bill. As a parting gesture to the Australian people, with only a few months to go before the next election, in the dying days of the Gillard government, please listen to those concerns of the aged-care sector, of the aged-care providers and the people who seek care and are being cared for in these facilities around the country. Listen to the expertise that they bring to the table. 


Listen to their concerns about this compact. They do not want to feather the lifestyle of people like Craig Thomson who now occupy the upper echelons of the HSU. That is what this bill provides: it is taking money away from one part of the aged-care sector and seeing it, at least in part, dispersed back through the HSU. The HSU is a disgraced union body in this country. The member for Dobell, I note, has just been told that he cannot run again for the Labor Party—three months before the election. It is absolute contempt that the Labor Party has for the people in the seat of Dobell and, indeed, that through his own actions he has.


This bill seeks to confer an ultimate benefit on the HSU. People are asking why is that the case, why divert money away from aged care and impose another cost burden on aged-care providers in terms of having to engage with the HSU? Why do they need to do that? I will tell you why: because they decide the preselections of people who sit on this government bench. They decide the preselections of people like Craig Thomson and others who come into this parliament and ultimately decide whether or not they will direct their backbenchers, and frontbenchers, to vote for Julia Gillard or Wayne Swan or Kevin Rudd or Bill Shorten or Mark Butler or—



The SPEAKER:  Order! The member will refer to members by their appropriate titles.




Mr DUTTON:
  whoever it is, Madam Speaker, that seeks leadership of the ALP. That, when you cut it all down, is what a significant part of this bill is all about. And that is why the Australian public continue to express disgust in this government.


They cannot sort out their own internal issues and therefore those in the aged-care sector have suffered. They do not want to listen to the outcome of the Senate inquiry because essentially all they have sought to deliver through this bill is not reform to the aged-care sector but a blank cheque to the HSU and to the other unions involved. That will be an albatross around this minister's neck. This minister will seek leadership of the Labor Party at some point into the future—I am sure he will; he is an ambitious person.



The SPEAKER:  The member will return to the bill before the House.




Mr DUTTON:
  For a long time, Madam Speaker, this minister has fooled the industry, but I find as I move around the country talking to providers that they are now starting to see through all of the smoke and mirrors. They are now starting to see this bill for what it is. It is not about a reform of the aged-care sector. If they were serious about doing that they would have done it five or six years ago. They would have applied at least one dollar of the billions of dollars they wasted to the aged-care sector to help build infrastructure and to make it more affordable for people on low incomes to go into aged care, but they sought to do none of that. They pushed it off to the Productivity Commission to try to get through the last election. Then, when they had the Productivity Commission recommendations, they sat on them and pushed them aside because they had run out of money. That is what happened with this government's approach to aged care. Then they tried to pretend that they had some $3.7 billion huge investment, but when you strip it down it is a net extra spend of $250 million over that four-year period and a shameful exercise in deception by this government and by this minister. They need to be called for it.


So what have we done? We have tried to engage constructively with the sector to work out how this bad bill could be improved. What could be changed to improve the situation for aged care in this country? How could we make it easier for people to find their way through the mess of aged care and find a place for that grandmother, grandfather, mother, father or loved one? That is what we sought to do through the Senate inquiry process, and yet what does this minister do? This minister says, 'We are going to ignore that Senate inquiry process, we are not going to listen to the recommendations of the sector, we are not going to listen to people of good will who sought to make this bill better; we just want to deliver for the HSU.' That is really the only objective that the government seeks in this bill. They want to make sure that they repay a dividend to their union bosses, and that really sums up what this whole sad, six-year period in our country's history is about.


This is what it amounts to. The puppeteers have pulled the strings for the last six years, and we have seen it play out through leadership changes which have impacted on the government's desire in this area. This is the point. This government has been distracted by its own leadership deliberations, by the knifing of Kevin Rudd and by the proposed resurrection of Kevin Rudd—not to be. This government, whilst it has been distracted by that, has not concentrated on aged care or the millions of Australians in the future who will seek aged-care services for their loved ones. The government brings this bill in at the eleventh hour of this dying government because they seek to repay a dividend to those union bosses who supported their entry into this place. Craig Thomson—



The SPEAKER:  The member will refer to members by their appropriate titles.




Mr DUTTON:
  I am sorry. The member for Dobell stands as the monument of the HSU and the government's activities in this place. He stands here as a reminder to all Australians that this government has not had its eye on aged care. In this bill they have one focus, and that is to repay their very heavy due to the HSU. That is what this minister needs to account for.


Accordingly, I move:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""the House is of the opinion that further consideration of this bill, and the related bills, should be deferred until the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs has reported on its inquiry into the bills.""



The SPEAKER:  Is the amendment seconded?





Dr Southcott:
  I second the amendment.



The SPEAKER:  The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Dickson has moved that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. If it suits the House, I will state the question in the form that the amendment be agreed to. The question now is that the amendment be agreed to.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2013-05-14,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh—Second Deputy Speaker) (12:28):  I am very pleased and very honoured to speak on the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013 today, because this bill delivers security, certainty and fairness for millions of older Australians. It delivers fairer and more flexible arrangements for people looking to stay at home or to move into aged care. This bill is very important to me and to many of my constituents. As I have said many times in this place, the electorate of Hindmarsh has one of the oldest demographics in the country. Twenty per cent of the residents of Hindmarsh are age 65 and over. Many say it is the oldest electorate in the country; I like to say it is the wisest electorate in the country, because with age comes wisdom, and I have benefited greatly from the many older constituents in my electorate.


In my electorate, there are an extra 870 high-care places and 968 low places thanks to the extra funding in 2010 and 2011. On 20 April 2012 we heard the minister announce the $3.7 billion for the Living Longer, Living Better aged care reform. That is a huge increase, and what it means is that people are being looked after when they need to be. As we have heard, many of these people have worked all their lives and paid their taxes. Many have fought in wars. They deserve the best treatment and care that we can possibly give. These people have contributed so much to this wonderful nation. They built the foundations that have allowed us to prosper.


There are a lot of wonderful facilities in and around my electorate that are providing these new places and they deserve, very quickly, due credit for their hard work in this process. They include places like St Hilarion, an Italian nursing home that looks after many more people than just Australians with Italian backgrounds; the ECH; Southern Cross; Masonic Homes; St Basil's; St Martin's; Kilparrin Nursing Home; and the Ridleyton Greek Home for the Aged. All of them do a wonderful job in caring for and looking after those in need in their old age. In addition, I would like to thank the tireless efforts of the staff from each facility who look after those residents to ensure that their lives are happy and comfortable.


This government has also delivered 475 community aged packages in my electorate of Hindmarsh. This is in addition to the 54 extended aged-care at home packages and 20 extended aged-care at home dementia packages. We know how important it is for people to be able to stay in their homes. When you speak to people in my electorate, the majority say that they wish to stay in their homes and be cared for there. These extra packages are very beneficial.


The committee that I currently sit on recently finished an inquiry into dementia and how as a nation we can best care for people living with this condition. Australia is a wealthy nation and Australians are living longer. It is fantastic that we are living longer. Medical breakthroughs allow us to live longer. They allow our bodies to keep going and to keep supporting us for many more years than people in the past. Medical breakthroughs have been good for us. But there is another story. People with dementia are unfortunately growing in numbers. We know that by 2050 the number of Australians with dementia will quadruple. We will have quite an epidemic on our hands unless we do things now to put things in place to look after those people.


We know that not everyone is going to need aged care when they get older. In fact, we would all probably—as I said earlier—prefer to stay home and have the care required to look after us offered there. That is why the government also gave over $3 million in 2011-12 to centres in my electorate for day therapy. Day therapy gives older people the chance to come along and take part in activities away from home. This is a big thing. When you get older, you may lose some mobility and confidence. Having support so that you can get out to one of these day centres is a great thing.


This bill also addresses some of the issues facing those who care for our older Australians. Aged-care workers are some of the lowest-paid workers in Australia. They perform the vital task of looking after our parents, our grandparents and our great-grandparents—the older Australians in our community. We know that most Australians who pursue a career in aged care do it for much more than the financial reward. But pay rises are a big incentive to work in this growing industry. With the aged-care workforce needing to almost triple in size by 2050 to support our ageing population, we need to act now to attract and retain aged-care workers.


That is all part of the Living Longer, Living Better aged-care reforms. The Australian government announced that up to $1.2 billion will be provided to address the workforce pressures. We know that the current workforce is one of the oldest workforces. That is what the demographics of the aged-care workforce in Australia tell us.


Funding will flow through from July by way of a workforce supplement, delivering pay rises for aged-care nurses, care workers and others in the aged-care industry who look after older Australians. An additional one per cent pay rise will be available, above minimum annual wage increases or other wage rises which are negotiated through enterprise bargaining agreements, for workers who are employed by aged-care providers who meet the requirements of a workforce compact.


What does that mean? A personal care worker, who is currently paid the award rate and who is employed by an aged-care provider who meets those requirements would, effectively, see a pay rise close to 18 per cent over four years. Enrolled nurses will receive 25 per cent higher pay and registered nurses close to 30 per cent, in the same situation.


The second part of the Addressing Workplace Pressures initiative is the Aged Care Workforce Development Plan, which will begin in mid-2013. An expert advisory group will be established to focus on better ways to support the aged-care workforce. This group will seek to ensure that, on top of wage increases, those aged-care workers get benefits, including improved career structures; better training and education; and better work practices, including lowering the high rate of workplace injuries in aged care.


The workforce supplement is part of the Addressing Workforce Pressures initiative, which will be delivered in two parts through the aged-care workforce compact and through the Aged Care Workforce Development Plan. These are very important initiatives. As I get around in my electorate and talk to aged-care providers, one of the biggest issues they raise is maintaining and retaining the workforce required to look after older Australians in their facilities.


Another big and fairly complex issue in my electorate is multicultural aged care. The Australian government is committed to ensuring equitable access to high-quality, culturally-appropriate aged care for all people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. As I said, this is extremely important for my electorate because I have a very high number of Greek Australians and Italian Australians who migrated here in the fifties and sixties, all as young men and women, perhaps in their 20s, perhaps even in their teens or late 20s, who today are the fastest ageing Australians in my electorate. They are now at the stage where they are already needing services or are starting to need them. They are not the only ones. People from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds have specific needs that must be addressed. Those needs can be as basic as having familiar food available.


We know that when people develop, for example, dementia, nothing is worse than not being able to speak the language or know what people are saying to you. We know that many older Australians revert to their native tongue when they develop dementia. It might simply be a case of employing bilingual workers who can speak the language of the resident, make them feel comfortable so they feel they are being listened to. All these things are contained within the new strategy, which aims to ensure that aged care is inclusive of people from all backgrounds. 


Initiatives outlined in the strategy also include a rolling review of the National Aged Care Advocacy Program, to include an emphasis on promoting, supporting and maximising access to advocacy for older people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, their families and their carers. It also includes ensuring that the Aged Care Complaints Scheme is promoted to those linguistically diverse background communities, including the use of interpreting and translating services, and working with the culturally and linguistic diverse background sector to provide the cultural competency training for promotion and incorporation into all aged-care services. It also includes developing structured pathways to facilitate the employment of appropriate bilingual staff in the aged-care system. There has been a lot of work going towards ensuring that we have in place a system that caters for all Australians, no matter where they come from or what their background is.


I am very proud of this bill and that is why I am supporting it. One day we as a nation will be judged on how we have looked after our elderly. As I said earlier, many of the people that we are talking about today have paid their taxes all their lives, have worked hard and have gone through wars just to ensure that the foundations of this country are steadfast so that we can live a better life than they did. I am proud to support this bill and I commend it to the House.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2013-05-14,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (12:40):  I support the amendments moved by the shadow minister, because we know that under this government the aged-care system in Australia is rapidly approaching crisis point, particularly if you live in an electorate like mine, which is a rural and regional one, or one of those that involve smaller providers. Prime examples are in Western Australia, where last year the federal government allocated 1,564 additional residential aged-care places to our state. However, only 314 of these beds were actually taken up—it is a great indication. In the preceding year, of the 1,208 beds on offer only 507, or 42 per cent, were taken up in WA. What is worse, over the last three years 786 bed licences, the licence that provides the funding for aged-care beds were handed back to the government—283 of those were from Western Australia. Now in WA we are some 2,400 beds short of our aged-care requirements. That is a lot of people in my state and in my part of the south-west.


The government has chosen not to fund aged care in the way it needs to. Instead, it has wasted billions of dollars on unrealistic dreams and schemes that often have turned out to be nothing less than a nightmare. This is a at time when the group referred to as the baby boomers, those born between 1946 and 1964, start to enter retirement—that section of our community who are now between 46 and 65 years old and are looking at their retirement and aged-care solutions. It also looks as though we will have to defend their superannuation savings from being grabbed by what is just an incredibly wasteful Labor government.


Around nine per cent of our population is aged 70 years or older. That is expected to rise to 13 per cent by 2021 and 20 per cent, around 5.7 million people, in 2051—and this government has sat on its hands. By 2050 over 3.5 million Australians are expected to use aged care each year. As we are ageing we are acquiring more complex healthcare conditions and changing disease patterns, resulting in increasing and changing aged-care needs. The challenges include a larger, increasingly culturally diverse, ageing population. I see that in my electorate.


The dependency ratio in 2007 was six people of working age for every person aged 67. By 2047 this will be almost halved, to 3.2 people of working age for every person aged over 67. So with fewer people generating taxation revenue, care options of concessional and assisted aged-care residents, those with the least resources, will be jeopardised. And at this crucial time, under a dysfunctional Labor government, the agenda in Australia has been to remove support for residential-aged-care provision and waste taxpayers funds hand over fist in so many ways.


The fact that we are debating this bill prior to an election shows that this government has not prioritised aged care at all. It is no wonder that residential aged-care providers are not taking up those bed licences. Despite promises of reform, five years on under this government there is very little actual change in the communities—my communities and your communities—where it is so desperately needed. We have seen the government undertake a litany of reports and reviews, including 20 reviews and three Productivity Commission reports. They were continually ignored. They were put off until now when here we are, just prior to election, discussing aged care. They were continually ignored or responded to with more inquiries without a decision being made or anything being done to secure aged care into the future. However, the bills only cherry-pick a few recommendations of the Productivity Commission report Caring for older Australians, which brings us to the focus of the bill before the House today. 


The government's changes to aged-care funding which came into effect on 1 July last year under the Living Longer Living Better program represent, in effect, a knife to the heart of small regional aged-care service providers. I know that because they have told me. When the Labor Party and the Labor government spruiked their plan as the panacea for our aged-care system, they deliberately failed to tell the Australian people that this program in fact claws back $750 million from the aged-care sector over the next 2½ years. The actual practical result, as opposed to the misrepresentations of the government, is that residential aged-care providers will receive less funding for new patients than they got for patients last year. That is what my aged-care providers are telling me. The 2012-13 budget alone will see $500 million of ACFI funding ripped out of a sector that is already under pressure. 


Grant Thornton reported, in the Living Longer, Living Better reform report #2, of June 2012:


In the last two months since the Government's reform announcements, over $3.5 billion in planned aged care development projects have been shelved.


That is the actual result. A very frail elderly Australian entering aged care in the current year brings with them federal funding of around $56 to $63 a day less than a resident admitted in the last financial year. Given the average turnover rate in aged-care facilities of around 50 per cent per annum, by the end of the current financial year half of the residents will be supported at this new lower rate. One can only imagine what it is doing in the smaller facilities. I know you can well imagine it, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott. At the end of the next financial year, nearly all of the residents will be on the lower rate of funding. For a 40-bed unit, this would represent a loss of funding of close to half a million dollars by 2014-15. With only 40 per cent of residential aged-care providers operating in the black, I just wonder whether this government has been asleep in developing this policy and presenting it at this late date, so close to the election.


In its media release of 10 August 2012 entitled 'Aged care providers facing a $750 million revenue shortfall', Leading Age Services Australia asserts:


Aged care providers face a revenue black hole of more than $750 million over the next two-and-a-half years …


It also outlines research findings as follows: 


… 89 per cent of aged care facilities will face ""unrecoverable"" losses of revenue under the revised funding model, which came into effect on 1 July, 2012.


""This ultimately means an average reduction of between $20,000 and $23,000 in care funding for each affected resident every year"" …


…   …   …


""The average loss per aged care facility is more than $125,000 each year, with some facing revenue shortfalls of up to $560,000. Smaller and rural facilities are potentially the most affected.


I know that also for the reason that these are the providers that come and speak to me directly.


Many aged-care providers in regional Australia are already losing money. The government members need to come out into the regional areas and see exactly what this is doing. Funding for residential aged care is managed under ACFI, the Aged Care Funding Instrument, in which levels of acuity—nil, low, medium and high—are assessed over a range of biological and behavioural factors determining the funding received. The factors are categorised as activities of daily living, behaviour and complex health care, and there are 12 in total. The levels are frequently reviewed in individual patients. In one case recently, from my electorate, the patient's level of acuity rose from low to medium in the behavioural section, due to deteriorating behaviour; however, the payments actually dropped by $18 a day. Astoundingly, as the need increased, the funding reduced. 


Given the impending increase in aged-care needs bearing down on Australia in the form of our ageing population, this assault on the viability of residential aged-care providers is not acceptable or sustainable. A $56-a-day loss equates to $392 a week, or $20,440 a year, per patient. The onset of this issue will be insidious; it will be gradual, as more and more residents are turned over and lower payments become far more common. Crunch time will probably be at the end of the current financial year, when the new budgets for these providers are prepared. And if, as I heard, we are to be judged on how we treat our most vulnerable, the Labor government's new funding model is definitely a fail. This is why aged-care providers cannot afford the additional beds: they are already losing on each and every bed, so extra beds means greater losses. And that is why, of the 5,278 new residential aged-care places allocated to Western Australia since 2007, only 910, or 36 per cent, have been taken up, simply because they do not attract sufficient funding. Well, now they are going to attract even less. This government is making it even harder for our elderly by cutting support to the most needy and the most frail.


The other issue to be addressed in the government's changes is Labor's new agenda of interfering in management through the workplace supplement. In aged care the Labor government, as it has in childcare, has sought to enhance union control and government interference. It offers more money for wages, but receiving it can cost providers more than they actually receive. Aged and Community Services WA estimates that an aged-care provider who operates a small 31-bed regional facility would be eligible to receive $17,000 under the workforce supplement principles but in order to receive this would have to commit to an additional $30,000 in wages. That is a false economy—and a devious manipulation from a government becoming famous for such actions.


At the last federal election the coalition outlined our plan for the first-ever four-year agreement, and we set out some areas that we believe ought to be included in any agreement. We are committed to the delivery of a high-quality, affordable and accessible aged-care scheme that meets the needs and the preferences of older Australians. Our goal has always been to provide the very best care, whether in the community or in residential care, and particularly for people in rural and regional areas like my own electorate. The fundamental work on the first-ever aged-care provider agreement is certainly going to be retained. I certainly support the amendments moved by the member for Dickson. And I would say to those members opposite who have not spent time discussing how Labor's policies are actually impacting smaller rural and regional providers that I strongly encourage you (1) not to have aged care as a last resort of this government just prior to an election and (2) to actually get out there and talk to them on the ground; go and talk to the people in my electorate this is affecting so badly—perhaps the people at Tuia Lodge in Donnybrook. I had a whole raft of different providers, not just from my electorate but from other electorates, come to visit me just to say how badly this is affecting them. They are concerned about their ongoing viability. They are desperate to be able to provide the supports and services the people in their care need, and they so desperately want to provide these supports and services. But the government is putting all of that at risk.


I know in talking not only to the providers but to the staff as well that they are very passionate about what they do; they are passionate about the people in their care. And I know that the people who live in those communities desperately want to be able to spend their last years in small facilities in their own communities, and that is the type of facility that is on offer out in our electorates. We need to work hard to make sure these providers are in a position to offer opportunities for people in those smaller communities to actually receive the aged care they need in their local community. So, on that basis, I support the amendments moved by the member for Dickson.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2013-05-14,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (12:54):  My electorate of Canberra is the largest by population in Australia, so I proudly represent a very large number of older Australians, older Canberrans and older people who look to government to help them make sure that as they live longer they also live better. There are more than 1,100 residents in mainstream residential aged-care facilities in my electorate and I have had the pleasure of visiting many of them. I have spent a lot of time talking with residents and staff and families. Most recently, last week, I was out at Brindabella Gardens visiting Eileen Pegrum, who turned 100 last week, and I am visiting a number of other people who are turning 100 throughout this year, Canberra's centenary year, to drop flowers off for them and take some cake and just catch up with them. 


Just recently, I visited Alice Lukac at her home in Isaacs and I spent a wonderful morning with her family—her grandchildren, her daughter her granddaughter and her great granddaughters. They are very interested in education and it was wonderful not just talking to the family about their aspirations for education but also talking to this woman in the family home about her history. I visit many Canberrans throughout the course of my job every week, and it is a great pleasure in many ways to sit at their feet and just listen to the stories and the contributions they have made to Australia and, most importantly, to Canberra—people out at Araluen and St Andrews and Goodwin and Brindabella. I have also hosted a very well-attended aged-care forum with Minister Butler and I have taken the minister to meet with aged-care providers and residents around the electorate as well. He has always been very well received and has always listened very closely to the needs and the discussions with those residents, staff and families at those aged-care providers. 


Canberra is fortunate to have so many quality aged-care providers and services; however, we all recognise that the system needs to be constantly improved to meet changing demands. The current aged-care system needs to be reformed to meet the needs of an ageing Australia, and that is what we are doing. I know that, when it comes to aged care, the preference is for people to stay in their family home for as long as possible. We all want to be able to age with dignity in our own home. But, when that is not possible, we all want to be assured that there are aged-care services offering certainty and stability and dignity.


I know, from speaking to the many people in my electorate in aged-care services and the providers, that there are three things of particular concern to my community. The first is the quality of care that is being provided in the aged-care sector, the second is the financial cost associated with aged care, and the third is being confident of access to the right information to make the right choices. I have no doubt that the legislation the government is introducing today will vastly improve the way aged care is delivered in Australia. 


The government's $3.7 billion Living Longer Living Better reform package contains five bills that build on the Productivity Commission's recommendations. Many Canberrans who are involved in the aged-care sector made submissions to the Productivity Commission inquiry into caring for older Australians, and these bills represent Labor's plan for the future aged-care needs of all Australians. These are major reforms that will benefit both the key providers of aged-care services and those who need them.


Others will speak in more detail about the specifics contained in these bills, but I want to talk today about the positive impact these reforms will have in my electorate. These reforms will increase and improve the supply of aged-care services so that the sector can better address changes in demand. In a generation's time the population of people aged over 65 is expected to increase from about 3,000,000 to over 8,000,000. Labor recognises that current and future demographic changes are placing increasing pressures on the aged-care sector, which is why we are aiming to increase and improve the supply of services.


In a growing electorate like Canberra, which also serves as a regional hub and provides care to many people living in the capital region, this is a significant and welcome reform. Labor understands that families and those receiving aged-care services want to have better information so they can have greater choice and greater control. That is why we have sat down with industry and with aged-care consumers and age-care workers to create these reforms. 


In all areas of health care, access to transparent information and choice is vital. Labor has initiated a raft of improvements for consumers in all areas of health care. Most importantly, empowering people to meet their aged-care and healthcare needs is at the centre of our reforms. I know these measures will be welcomed by aged-care providers and aged-care consumers.


In my many visits to aged care homes and in my conversations with providers and residents, workforce issues are almost always raised with me. They are always, if not at the start of the conversation, in the middle of the conversation. They are up there. We must have a stable, skilled and dedicated workforce to deliver the reforms Labor is bringing about. These bills specifically address the workforce issues in aged care with measures to attract and retain a skilled and capable workforce. There is up to $1.2 billion in funding to address workplace pressures.


I note that the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing just recently announced 72 new aged-care nursing scholarships as part of Labor's commitment to boost the aged-care workforce. This was in addition to an investment of more than 2,800 scholarships over four years. The scholarships provide financial support for people to study nursing at university or to undertake continuing professional development. They also support people who wish to undertake nurse re-entry studies—that is particularly important. These scholarships are part of the government's efforts to address workforce pressures, with the aged-care workforce needing to almost triple in size—as my colleague pointed out—by 2050 to support our ageing population.


I am particularly supportive of the measures that will expand, support and improve access to aged-care services for people with diverse needs. I know the Greek population here has its own aged-care facility and it is particularly important that the diverse needs of Australia's population and of Canberra's population are factored into future aged-care services. My electorate is not just large but very diverse. In all areas of service provision, understanding and catering to a range of different people's needs is critical. This is something the government truly understands and is acting upon. For my electorate, this means the quality of aged-care provision will continue to improve, and Canberrans can feel confident that their loved ones will receive the best quality care possible.


The other issue raised with me is the financial cost of aged-care provision. This is a vexed issue, and I know there are different views in the sector about how to address it. In these bills we see measures that will improve the equity and the sustainability of aged-care sector financing. People entering the aged-care system need to understand exactly how much they have to pay, what they are paying for and why. The current system of government subsidies and user contributions for both residential and home care can vary. The changes we are introducing will greatly improve transparency and provide greater clarity. These reforms will result in better alignment of financial arrangements and ensure a more sustainable future for aged-care funding. Under these reforms, those who can afford to help pay for the aged care will be asked to do so while those who cannot afford to pay will still be able to access aged care.


Through these bills, the government is building a more sustainable future for aged-care funding and giving consumers real choices about how they pay for their care. For the first time, people will have real choice in how they pay for the accommodation they receive. At the same time, we are also improving the regulation of residential aged care. We are making sure there is more opportunity for care recipients and their families to purchase additional services. We are creating an aged-care system that will be simpler to navigate, will be fairer and that will create a better pathway for transition from home to residential care.


We are creating a new veterans supplement, dementia supplement and workforce supplement. We are investing millions into dementia research and help for those affected by this condition. From 1 July next year there will be just one type of approval for permanent residential care. There will also be greater continuity of services, and it will be easier under these reforms for people to move through the aged-care system.


In broad terms, these are the major changes contained in these bills. They are measures that have undergone extensive consultation, particularly here in my electorate of Canberra. I understand that the consultation process has been welcomed and was positive, and that following the introduction of these bills there will be ongoing information sessions both here in Canberra and throughout the country.


Labor is introducing landmark legislation that will create an aged care system that will meet the demands and wishes of our ageing population. I commend the bills to the House.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2013-05-14,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (13:05):  I rise, following on from the member for Canberra, who spoke about the importance of seniors wanting to live with dignity in their own homes and that if that were not possible, with certainty and stability in aged care facilities such as retirement villages and nursing homes. On that point I certainly agree with her wholeheartedly, as I am sure all members in this House would.


We do have an ageing population, and that is why discussion about the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013, Australian Aged Care Quality Agency Bill 2013, Australian Aged Care Quality Agency (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013, Aged Care (Bond Security) Amendment Bill 2013 and Aged Care (Bond Security) Levy Amendment Bill 2013 is so vitally important. Whilst I agree with the member for Canberra on some of the statements she made on the Commonwealth being able to provide for those people in their twilight years, certainly her side of politics has not helped our aged people to be able to live with the dignity that they deserve.


During the 2010 election campaign, the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, stated that aged care reform would be a second-term priority. In the same election campaign the Prime Minister had to deny that she had not supported big increases to the age pension because 'old people never vote for us'. Last year this Labor government, which tonight will deliver its sixth successive budget deficit, cut $1.6 billion from the aged care funding instrument, the ACFI, to fund a $1.2 billion workforce compact. The ACFI is the means by which Commonwealth subsidies are allocated to residential aged care providers. The government justified this by publicly suggesting widespread rorting was occurring amongst aged care providers, even though there has not been a single—not one!—prosecution in five years. An entire sector has been tainted—sullied—by this outrageous claim.


This government has undertaken numerous reports and reviews, including 20 reviews and three Productivity Commission reports. These reviews and reports have either been ignored continually or responded to with even more inquiries without any decisions being made to secure aged care into the future. Five years on, there is still no change on the ground—five years on.


In 2010 the government asked the Productivity Commission to undertake an inquiry into the aged care system, and the final report, Caring for older Australians, was released by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Mark Butler, on 8 August 2011. Eight months later, on 20 April 2012, the Prime Minister and Minister Butler announced the government's response to the report entitled Living longer. Living better.


The bills before the House today implement those parts of the package which require legislative changes, whilst implementations that required no legislative action began in April 2012. The Living Longer Living Better package of the five bills we are debating now does not resolve many outstanding viability issues for providers. These bills seek to: (1) remove the distinction between low-level and high-level residential care so there will be only one approval process for residential aged care; (2) provide a new means test, combining income and assets tests and new annual and lifetime caps on means-tested care fees; (3) allow accommodation costs to be paid for through a refundable lump sum, a rental periodic-style supplement or combination; (4) make changes to home care, including requiring a contribution for people who enter home care on or after 1 July 2014; (5) establish a new aged-care pricing commissioner; (6) extend the operation of the Accommodation Bond Guarantee Scheme to new bond arrangements reflected in the government's reforms; and, finally, establish the new Australian Aged Care Quality Agency to replace the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency from 1 January next year.


In typical Labor style, the government has cherry-picked from the Productivity Commission report, with industry sources estimating that only five to eight per cent of the recommendations have been adopted. We heard the member for Canberra just moments ago talking about how the government had consulted, how it had made wide-ranging representations to the sector. However, we all know, certainly in this House and certainly on this side of the House, just what the level of Labor consultation goes to. It is not sufficient, it is not adequate; it is never anywhere good enough. The final report received extensive industry support, with 500 submissions made to the Productivity Commission during the inquiry and an additional 500 made following the release of the draft report. Yet Labor all too often ignores the advice it has been given, as it certainly did when it decided to come out with a report following on from the Productivity Commission's, and it does not go far enough to talk to the industry sectors, whether it is agriculture, defence or, in this case, aged care.


According to a Grant Thornton report from June 2012 following the announcement of the Living Longer Living Better package, more than $3.5 billion worth of planned aged-care development projects have been shelved. Further, an August 2012 media release from Leading Aged Care Services stated that aged-care providers face a 'black hole of more than $750 million over the next 2½ years'.


The Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013 will remove the distinction between low-level and high-level residential care, so there will be only one type of approval for residential aged care. The minister has argued this will mean fewer reassessments and allow individuals requiring a permanent residential care place to access any service to meet their needs. The bill will make significant changes to the residential care subsidies and fees for recipients who enter care on or after 1 July next year. This will include a new means test combining incomes and assets tests and new annual and lifetime caps on means tested care fees. As the minister outlined in his second reading speech, the annual cap of $25,000 will be applied for means tested care fees, with a lifetime cap of $60,000. These fees are also both to be indexed.


With regard to accommodation costs, this bill will allow fees to be paid through a refundable lump sum, a rent or periodic style supplement, or combination thereof. Aged-care providers will not be able to distinguish between care recipients based on how they will pay for their accommodation. Clause 52G-3 will provide that the minister may, by legislative instruments, determine the maximum amount of accommodation payment which an approved provider may charge a person, including the maximum daily accommodation payment amount, and a method of working out the refundable accommodation deposit.


This bill will also introduce a new form of care, home care, from 1 July 2013 which will replace community aged-care packages, extended aged care at home and extended aged care at home dementia. An income tested care fee will also be applied to home care for all except full pensioners. This fee will also be capped by year and lifetime, starting on 1 July 2014. The Aged Care Pricing Commissioner will be established under this bill to make decisions on pricing issues. The functions of the commissioner will be to approve extra service fees, to approve accommodation payments which are higher than the maximum amount of accommodation payment determined by the minister, and other functions as determined by other legislation or by the minister. Furthermore, this bill provides for an independent review to commence in 2016 and a report to the parliament by 30 June 2017.


The Aged Care (Bond Security) Amendment Bill 2013 and the Aged Care (Bond Security) Levy Amendment Bill 2013 will extend the operation of the accommodation bond guarantee scheme to new bond arrangements reflected in the government's reforms. The Australian bond guarantee scheme as prescribed in the 2006 act provides a mechanism by which the Commonwealth may repay outstanding bond balances to care recipients should a provider become insolvent or unable to refund balances. There is also the capacity for the Commonwealth to recover the costs of refunding those bonds according to the Aged Care (Bond Security) Levy Act 2006, which is amended to reflect the changes to accommodation in the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013.


The new Australian Aged Care Quality Agency, to replace the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency from 1 January next year, is established under the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency Bill 2013. This new body will be the sole agency which providers of aged care will deal with in relation to quality assurance of aged-care services providers, whether in the home or in a residential facility. The functions of the new agency will be to accredit residential care facilities; conduct quality reviews of home care services; promote high-quality care innovation in quality management and continuous improvement amongst approved providers of aged care; and provide information, education and training to approved providers of aged care. The Australian Aged Care Quality Agency (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 will enable the transfer of assets and liabilities from the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency Ltd to the Commonwealth to facilitate the establishment of the new Australian Aged Care Quality Agency from New Year's Day 2014.


On 7 November last year I hosted the shadow minister for ageing and mental health, Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, in my electorate of Riverina. We held a forum attended by a large number of aged-care providers and interested people at Griffith to discuss their thoughts and concerns about the Living Longer Living Better proposals specifically and aged-care services more broadly. We also visited Scalabrini Village, Griffith, where Lauren Kingsbury showed us through before we visited the Griffith Neighbourhood House to discuss with Monica Beckman the facility and the funding needs it has to continue to provide much-needed services to the community—a community, I might add, which has been hard-hit in recent times by poor water policy from this government, and a community which has an ageing population. Many of those people came to this country to start a new life after the ravages of World War II. They did everything this government required of them in building a wonderful city and a wonderful community, and they now deserve the very best treatment in aged-care services that this country and this government can provide, because they have done their bit to help this nation—certainly to grow food to help feed this nation and others—and now we owe it to them to repay that faith that they showed in this country. Many of them, of course, are Australian born, and they too have done their bit—more than their bit, I might add—to help this country and to make it the great food provider that it is. It behoves us to make sure that we look after those people in their twilight years.


One of the major failings of this package is the opportunity the government has missed to reduce the administrative burden—and haven't we heard that on so many levels, in so many speeches that I and many of my colleagues have given—and the red tape and, in too many cases, the green tape. In a sector already swaddled in red tape, this package will deliver even more regulation. The point is repeatedly made—and indeed, was made at the aged-care forum in Griffith that I hosted—that aged-care nurses spend a significant amount of time on unnecessary paperwork. This package is only going to make the piles of paperwork grow and grow and, unfortunately, grow.


The coalition wants reform in partnership with the aged-care sector, and we will provide that. Hopefully, we will be able to do that after 14 September. We do not believe fundamental reform should be imposed from above. Should we be elected to government, we will deliver the first ever aged-care providers' agreement framework, which will be the cornerstone of all of our policy. We want this agreement in place within a year of our taking office in order to begin the real reform that this sector so desperately needs and that Labor has continually failed to deliver.


In my time available, I will also mention the Haven's recent $7.8 million upgrade, which was completed and opened on 27 March. I was fortunate enough to be at that opening with the general manager of that fine organisation, Shane McMullen. Interestingly, the renovation and enlargement of 36 single rooms within the Nan Roberts Community, the construction of two more rooms, improvements to staff facilities and all of the rest were done without government grants. Recurrent funding was used to complete the upgrade, and the South Wagga Lions Club, a wonderful community organisation, did so much work and so much fundraising to make that a reality. All too sadly, in regional areas communities are left to fund their own projects. I could mention the radiotherapy centre at Wagga Wagga, where the community pitched in when there was no—or very little—government help forthcoming to make sure that they got their own facility, which is now the pride of southern New South Wales as far as those facilities are concerned. It is used all too frequently, I might add, because of the number of cancer sufferers and patients in southern New South Wales. But it is still a marvellous and necessary facility. At the moment, there is a very dedicated group of people working to provide palliative care services in Wagga Wagga. Hopefully, this government or a future government will be able to provide much-needed funding for that particular issue and that particular cause, which is so very vital in Wagga Wagga and, indeed, the Riverina electorate I represent.

Mrs MARKUS
 (Macquarie) (13:20):  I rise to speak on the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013 and cognate bills. I believe that one of the ways we as a society are judged is the way in which we look after and care for our elderly. Those in aged-care facilities are at a very vulnerable and sometimes difficult stage in life. We have all been in a position where a grandmother, grandfather or parent has had to go into aged care, and as fellow human beings we know that our elderly deserve not only dignity but also respect at this stage of their lives. We have a responsibility to the aged—to our seniors—to provide them with the best services and care available and to support the service providers who engage and respond to their needs.


During the 2010 election campaign the Prime Minister said, 'If re-elected, further aged-care reform will be a second-term priority for my government.' Australians can add that statement to the list of broken promises by this Prime Minister. We have seen a government undertake a litany of reports and reviews, including 20 reviews and three Productivity Commission reports, which are continually ignored or responded to with more inquiries without making any decisions to secure aged care into the future.


Despite promises of reform, five years on there is very little evidence of real change on the ground, where it counts the most. After five years of Labor's neglect our aged-care system needs urgent change to provide viable and effective aged-care services for older Australians. Labor has failed to undertake proper and sustainable reform and to make the hard decisions to give effect to it. It is clear that the Living Longer Living Better package of five bills does not resolve many outstanding viability issues for providers. Under these reforms there have been cuts from the Aged Care Funding Instrument—ACFI—that have placed substantially more pressure on the sector. The bills only cherry pick a few recommendations of the Productivity Commission report Caring for older Australians from August 2011. They add to regulation in what is already a highly regulated sector. The bills establish the framework for the workforce compact, which has created uncertainty, potentially will be costly for providers, relies on cuts to ACFI and appears to be a political mechanism to unionise the sector.


Only the coalition has a clear plan for the future of aged care in this nation. We understand that it is only by working closely with the sector and consulting those who are on the front line that real reform can be achieved. We want to work in partnership with the ageing and aged-care sector to achieve sustainable reform through our first-ever four-year aged-care provider agreement. Older Australians in the sector are no closer to knowing how structural reform would be introduced and how it would affect the care they receive and where they receive it.


The ageing of our population is one of the biggest social issues facing Australians and is an issue that needs to be addressed now, not somewhere down the track or into the future. Australians are living longer, but we have a rapidly ageing population. In its Global ageing 2010: an irreversible truth, Standard & Poor's rating service said that age related spending on health, pensions and aged care in Australia is estimated to rise to 14.4 per cent of gross domestic product in 2050. It is currently 9.6 per cent. Around nine per cent of our population is aged 70 years or older, and this is expected to rise to 13 per cent by 2021 and to 20 per cent—around 5.7 million people—in 2051. As we are ageing we are acquiring more complex health conditions and changing disease patterns, resulting in increasing and changing aged-care needs. With fewer people generating taxation revenue, care options for concessional and assisted aged-care residents—those with the least resources—will be jeopardised.


There is growing and alarming evidence that the aged-care sector cannot provide the care that Australians expect. There are real economic implications for our nation because of our ageing population, and these implications have not been taken seriously by this government. Until there is a proper structural reform of the sector, the care and wellbeing of senior Australians is in jeopardy. Australia has one of the most advanced aged-care systems in the world. However, it can be complex and difficult to navigate. Currently over one million older Australians are receiving aged-care services subsidised by the Australian government. It is expected that by 2050 over 3.5 million Australians will be using aged care each year. Formal aged-care services are delivered through around 8,000 outlets across Australia, including about 3,660 agencies registered as delivering services funded through the HACC program, 2,095 operational community care services delivering community packages, and more than 2,700 operational residential aged-care facilities. The number of over-85-year-olds, which are the main users of aged-care services, will increase from around 400,000, or 1.7 per cent of the total population, in 2007 to 1.6 million by 2047—about 5.6 per cent for the population. The Department of Health and Ageing estimates that by 2050 aged-care expenditure will account for three per cent of GDP and a bit more than 827,000, or five per cent, of the Australian workforce may be engaged in the provision of aged care.


If there was ever a call to action for reform of aged care, this is it. These statistics are alarming and call for careful planning and action. However, at a time when there is increasing demand for services, providers are walking away from the sector because of the lack of viability of providing high-care beds and the increase in compliance demands of the government. It has been reported that up to 60 per cent of aged-care facilities are operating in the red. That is a staggering amount and reflects the economic situation that many providers find themselves in. Providers are handing back licences, and senior Australians are having to wait longer or travel further to find a bed, thereby placing extra pressure on the public hospital system and, most importantly and unfortunately, on their families. This is in contrast with the situation that we would hope to achieve under the coalition. 


The Productivity Commission's final report, Caring for older Australians, was publicly released by the Prime Minister and minister on 8 August 2011. This report focuses on a shift from the current ration system based on licences and packages to an entitlement based system whereby aged care would become part of the health system. Other key features of the report include the creation of a single Australian seniors gateway agency and the recommendation that funding be replaced by a single national care co-contribution regime, which would apply across the aged-care system, whether services are delivered in the community or in a residential aged-care facility. It took the Australian government over 250 days to respond to 58 recommendations within the Productivity Commission's report. When that response finally came it was announced with great fanfare as supposedly extensive reform of the aged-care system. Whilst the headline figure of $3.7 billion over five years sounded impressive, the actual amount of new money to be spent was $577 million. Furthermore, many of the changes will not start until 1 July 2014, so the effect will not be felt until well after the next federal election. The coalition and I acknowledge that one of the failures in the aged-care reform package is the missed opportunity to reduce red tape. This is something that the sector has been urgently demanding. In a sector already wallowing in red tape, this package will heap on them more red tape and more bureaucracies to deal with. The coalition has been advised that aged-care nurses spend on average a third of their time on paperwork. Under this package, things are only going to get worse.


This is not real reform; this is another case of Labor talking but not doing anything. Some key issues have caused major concern to stakeholders: the decision to rip $1.6 billion out of the ACFI, the $1.2 billion workforce compact, and the establishment of the Aged Care Financing Authority. One critical need to be addressed is the almost 321,600 Australians living with dementia. When in government, the coalition committed $320 million in the 2005 budget to help fund the Dementia Initiative, making dementia a national health priority. Despite this initiative proving invaluable to help dementia sufferers, and a government evaluation of October 2009 finding the initiative successful, Labor deliberately dropped funding for this program. It was pleasing to see that at a subsequent meeting of health ministers dementia has now been made a national health priority. The coalition is committed to delivering a high quality, affordable and accessible aged-care scheme that meets the needs and preferences of older Australians.


At the last federal election, the coalition outlined its plan for the first ever four-year agreement and we set out some areas which we believe ought to be included in any agreement. We undertook to provide certainty of care through the first ever four-year aged-care provider agreement with the aged-care sector, and as part of that process we outlined various areas for inclusion in such an agreement. There was a very positive response. Since the last federal election, the coalition has continued to listen to the aged-care sector. We will be revising our policy before the next federal election. The fundamental framework—the first ever aged-care provider agreement framework—will be retained. It is important to stress that this is the first ever aged-care provider agreement. It would ensure certainty and engagement for the aged-care sector. In much the same way as the pharmacy agreement shapes that sector, this agreement would set the framework for aged care in Australia for the next four years.


The coalition plan to reduce red tape as an important component of our four-year agreement. Providing flexibility and certainty, we want to work with the sector to cut red tape in ways which will provide efficiencies without compromising the quality of care. The agreement will deliver better and more affordable aged care by: reducing red tape and enabling nurses to get back to nursing residents; providing certainty for aged care for older Australians, underpinned by a high quality framework; delivering value for money through revised subsidy arrangements; ensuring certainty for the aged-care workforce; establishing a more flexible and viable aged-care provider network to meet care needs now and in the future; and ensuring that the comfort and safety of older Australians is maximised.


The coalition want reform in partnership with the aged-care sector. We do not believe that fundamental reform should be imposed from above. Given the opportunity to govern following the next federal election, we will immediately commence consultation with stakeholders in the ageing and aged-care sector on the framework for the aged-care provider agreement, including consideration of the recommendations of the Productivity Commission. The coalition want an agreement in place within a year of taking office.


The coalition does not want to pre-empt the contents of any negotiated agreement. The agreement framework establishes a formal pathway for future dialogue between the minister, the government and stakeholders to more effectively consider ongoing issues regarding timely and appropriate access to aged care. It will guarantee flexibility and much needed certainty in the sector. Principal Endeavour aged-care facility, in the electorate of Macquarie, have the following statement in their mission statement:


Our aim is not just to provide a home, but to provide a lifestyle surrounded by a caring, active, wholesome community.


I too believe that this should be the aim of every aged-care facility, but this can only happen by real change and reform and through the government partnering with the sector to allow them to do what they do best. I support the amendment moved by the shadow minister today and commend it to the House.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (13:33):  I strongly support these bills finally passing into the House. It has been disappointing that it has taken so long for them to finally make it to the chamber, but I hope that they do pass this House and the other place relatively quickly, because I know there are many, both in the workforce and as aged-care providers, in the sector who are very keen to see this legislation pass.


In my electorate on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales and, indeed, on the east coast, aged care is the boom industry of the moment. Quite often, it is not seen as an economic driver and an economic sector, but for my region and, indeed, for the east coast, we are seeing more growth in aged care than in industries such as mining and more jobs in health and community services than in the mining sector. It does fly under the radar, but this is an incredibly important economic driver for the east coast and for regions like the mid-North Coast of New South Wales as service provision for our ageing demographic becomes more and more important in Australia over the coming years. I am certainly a strong advocate of getting the aged-care sector right and making sure that we provide the best quality of care possible for the many residents in our area who, in a number of different ways, require services. 


By way of a stocktake, in the Lyne electorate on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales, we currently have 409 community aged-care packages; 40 Extended Aged Care at Home packages, known as EACH packages; and 24 Extended Aged Care at Home Dementia packages. All of those touch only the surface of what is really required. I think that is a mood shared by all members in this chamber. Whilst each of these packages is certainly welcome, the need far outweighs what is being provided to date by all levels of government and by both sides of parliament. Ensuring that a quality level of service is provided in what is a growing market in communities such as those on the mid-North Coast is an enormous challenge. In 2012-13, 144 home care package places were also advertised in the mid-North Coast aged-care planning region. 


I am not one to criticise the aged-care sector at all. At times, various stories emerge in this parliament or in various communities that shock you, but they are rare. I believe that the quality of care in Australia today is at a level of excellence that we as a country should actually be very proud of. Both our monitoring and reporting standards are some of the best in the world and, again, I do not think we sing the praises enough of our culture of care for the various stages through the ageing process.


Every day on the mid-North Coast I see quality providers, a quality workforce and families of carers who really do rally around their family members, who work their way through the spectrum of care and who really want to see the best outcome possible for them. We as Australians should enhance that culture and, hopefully, this range of bills today will be another step along that journey.


I have tracked these bills pretty closely with the support of some local aged-care providers, whom I would like to mention: Dennis Marks, the CEO of Bundaleer Care Services; John Butler, the CEO of Nambucca Valley Care Ltd; Errol Curran, the Director of Residential Aged Care Services and the Chief Financial Officer of the Bushland Health Group; and Steven Quirk, Chief Executive Officer of St Agnes' Parish, Catholic Care of the Aged, in Port Macquarie. Others have been involved at various times in our roundtable meetings that we have been holding. The group wanted to take up with the government a range of detailed issues that have emerged, in particular with Minister Butler, to the point where, three or four months ago, I brought them down to Canberra and the minister kindly met them. It looks as though, as a consequence of some of those meetings, there have been some changes to the final bills. That has been a worthwhile process. The feedback from the group at this stage is that this package of bills is not going to cure all ills. It is not going to get the workforce pay to the level it should be, to be competitive to attract the absolute best staff possible, but it is a step forward.


Likewise, there are some issues for mid-tier residential providers in lower socioeconomic communities. There are still some question marks about this aged care reform package continuing to allow those very noble and important providers to stay viable. But I am fully aware that the government is watching and tracking that and, if there are issues that emerge, hopefully all governments will be very quick in responding to that. As one part of a suite of measures, this package of reforms I think is one to support, and hopefully the House supports it relatively swiftly.


This fits in well with some local work that we have been doing. The mid-North Coast is one of the first regions in Australia to develop a dementia care plan. We do have an epidemic in Australia coming, if not arrived, in the area of dementia. Rather than just wallow in the concerns of the epidemic hitting us, I am really pleased that our community has come together and put a bit of a strategy together that will align well with these aged care reforms. And I would encourage government to have a look at the work we have done and to provide what resources are possible to allow our region to maximise the work we have been doing locally in trying to deal with the very high number of dementia patients now, and with the significant growth expected in the near term. 


The other point I did want to make is on the jobs plan we put together locally. As I said before, the health and community service area is our boom industry of the moment on the mid-North Coast, and so aged care workforce needs are really important to us. I wanted to take this chance to thank the many people who have been involved in the many meetings in making sure our workforce needs meet the demands. They include the local employment coordinator, Renee Hawkins, the aged care workforce coordinator, Jan Johnson, and the new group that has come into town, the Aged Care Workforce Innovation Network. This group is now funded by the Australian government and led by the aged care peak bodies in partnership with the Community Services and Health Industry Skills Council and is now starting to pull together some really good work in our region to address a lot of these workforce needs today and into the future.


I am pleased that, because our region has been working so hard with so little and had to collaborate a lot, we have now become one of the regions to lead in this workforce innovation network. Collaboration is one of the keys that allows that industry development work to take shape. Very quickly, of the 10 regions funded, the mid-North Coast is looking like one of the standouts because we have been collaborating on the smell of an oily rag for a long time, and had to do that to basically survive as a region. I thank everyone involved in that process, both within and around government but also more importantly at a committee level, for really investing time and energy into the many meetings—everyone hates meetings, but they have made a difference and they certainly are setting us up as a region where our aged care workforce will be viable and strong, our providers will be viable and strong and our quality of care, therefore, will be viable and strong. 


I think the mid-North Coast is one of the best places in Australia for anyone to hit retirement age. That is not only for the healthy living issues and all of our wonderful beaches and rivers, but also for that spectrum of care around aged care, when and if required. I hope these bills go through, I hope they go through with bipartisan support and I hope they make a big difference in once again taking a step forward in the quality of care for the aged care sector in Australia today.


Debate adjourned.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2013-05-14,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (13:46):  I am pleased to rise to speak in the debate on the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013 and cognate bills and to follow those speakers who have been speaking before me. I think it is important in the context of a debate about aged care to get an appreciation of what is happening to the demographics of Australian society. We know and we hear frequently that Australia is an ageing nation, like many other Western democracies. We have seen our birth rate decline, so much so that in fact we are now below replacement level with respect to our population. The reason that Australia continues to see an overall net increase in population is migration.


The fundamental point that we have with respect to this cognate debate is what is taking place across Australian society. We know that our population is ageing. The ageing of our population is in every respect the biggest social issue that faces Australia. Australians are generally living longer and as a consequence we have a rapidly ageing population. To put some context around it, about nine per cent of our population is aged 70 years or older. That is anticipated to rise to 13 per cent by 2021 and to reach 20 per cent by 2051. That will be just shy of six million Australians aged 70 and over.


The consequences of the proportion those aged 70 and over increasing from nine per cent of our population to 20 per cent are profound. It is appropriate that today of all days—budget day—we consider what the ramifications of an ageing population actually are. The ramifications are significant and varied. In many respects it was the recognition of the ageing of Australia's population that gave rise to an important major public policy change to take place: the introduction of the GST. That reform was a coalition reform that we undertook because we knew it to be in Australia's long-term interest. It was opposed by the Labor Party, despite the fact that only years earlier the Labor Party had championed the cause for a broad based consumption tax, on the basis of political opportunism while the coalition took the hard decision to introduce a new tax. It was a tax that we knew would not be popular. It was a reform that we undertook not because we knew it was going to win us votes on the street but because we knew it to be necessary for Australia's long-term interest. It stands in remarkable contrast, frankly, to the way that Labor has gone about introducing the carbon tax. Unlike the coalition, who said, 'We will introduce a GST if you elect us,' the Labor Party said, 'We will not introduce a carbon tax', and they did the exact opposite. In fact, who can forget the Prime Minister saying, only six days out from the last election, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'? Lo and behold, we discovered only weeks later that, in fact, she was going to impose not only a carbon tax but the biggest carbon tax in the world. That is the difference between the approach of the coalition historically and the approach of the government.


With an ageing population the question is: how do we from a public policy perspective deal with the challenges we will face? For example, one of the consequences of an ageing population is that there will be an increasing dependency ratio. Whereas in 2007 approximately six people of working age for every person aged over 67 was the dependency ratio, by 2047 that ratio will be down to 3.2 people of working age for every person aged 67 and over. What does that mean? What does a decrease from six people for every person aged over 67 to 3.2 people for every person aged over 67 mean in terms of the fiscal consequences for all Australians? The fundamental inescapable truth is that it is basically bad news. It is good that Australians are living longer; it is good that Australians are ageing, but the fiscal challenges it presents are profound. Whereas the Australian government can now rely on approximately six working Australians for every one person aged 67 or over, by the late 2040s there will only be three working Australians for every person aged over 67.


The reason that it is a significant problem from a fiscal perspective is that those aged 67 and older, not always but generally, have a heavier reliance on the public purse. Whether it be in healthcare costs, in the pension or in other forms of support and concessions they would like to have available to them, the fact is that Australians that live beyond the age of 67 typically take the view—and in many respects they are entitled to take this view—that: 'I've worked my entire life, I've paid my taxes, I've made my contribution to Australian society, and I expect henceforth to reap some of the dividends of a lifetime of earning income.' The fiscal problem with someone aged over 67 is that with a greater reliance on the public purse comes an increased need for it to be funded. As the proportion of people aged 67 and over goes from nine per cent of the population to 20 per cent of the population—more and more people being a bigger drain on the public purse with fewer and fewer people to pay for it—it represents a challenge that somehow must be funded.


Those that are not particularly charitable might take the view that it is a problem that only this side of the House concerns itself with. Those less charitable might say that only the coalition is genuinely concerned about how we fund future challenges. We know, based on the form of this government, that the Labor Party do not particularly care about how we fund future challenges. That is the reason why the Labor Party will stand up and make announcements such as during this Living Longer Living Better cognate debate and package of bills. That is why they will put forward reforms such as Gonski or the NDIS without the appropriate safeguards to make sure there is funding in place to provide the necessary future funding required to meet those liabilities. That is important because any government that signs up the Australian population to future liabilities—be it Gonski, be it NDIS, be it aged-care reform—needs to make sure it is not putting on future generations of Australians a tax burden so significant that they are no longer able or willing to fund it.


In the debate around aged care, this is the consequence. When you shift from six taxpayers funding every person aged 67 and over down to just over three taxpayers funding every person aged 67 and over, it means that the tax burden on those people is significant. When you view that in the context of the current debate that will be taking place in this chamber tonight, we know that there are some serious challenges ahead. That is part of the reason why the coalition introduced the GST, but more importantly it is the reason the coalition was so committed to paying down debt. It is the recognition of the fact that Australia's population is ageing that drove the coalition to pay off the $96 billion of debt the Labor left when they were last in office. It was at the core of the coalition's economic approach: to pay down debt and to put our economy and our country on a strong, stable footing, knowing full well that in future decades there will be very significant drawdowns on the public purse. Those drawdowns must be met by taxation across the population. That is why we paid down debt.


The problem that we have now is that as we shift over the coming decades to having only three people paying all the liabilities expected by a person aged 67 and over—with only three people shouldering the tax burden to support the generous pensions and generous healthcare entitlements and concessions that that person is expecting—it makes it very expensive. And not only will meeting the recurrent liabilities that exist be expensive; this government has racked up $172 billion worth of deficits in the last five years. Australia's net debt currently sits at around $140 billion. We know that it is going to get a hell of a lot worse tonight.


We saw two weeks ago Labor saying—despite on over 400 occasions promising that this year's budget would be in surplus—that this year's budget will in fact be yet another deficit. On 400 occasions, Labor said, 'We will deliver a budget surplus.' The member for Oxley, who is at the table, circulated a newsletter to his electorate that said, 'We delivered a budget surplus.' But what do we actually know? Two weeks ago they said, 'No, cancel that. There's not going to be a budget surplus. It was going to be $1 billion of surplus but now it is going to be a $7.5 billion deficit.' That was two weeks ago. One week ago, they changed it. They said: 'Scratch that. It's not going to be a $7 billion deficit; it's actually going to be a $12 billion deficit.' That was one week ago. Then a matter of about 72 hours ago—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Moncrieff might refer to the bill before the chair.




Mr CIOBO:
  I am talking about the challenges of an ageing population, Speaker.



The SPEAKER:  It would be great if you talked about the actual bill before the chair.




Mr CIOBO:
  We know that 72 hours ago it shifted from a $12 billion deficit to a $17 billion deficit. If we are going to be serious and look older Australians in the eye and say, 'We can afford to pay for aged care,' and if the government wants to be serious about saying that they can meet the challenges of an ageing population when we shift from nine per cent of the population being over 65 to 20 per cent of the population being over 65, then I say that it is crucial that this government tells us how much debt and deficit they have racked up over the past five years. The reckless spending by the Labor Party must stop. For as long as Labor keeps spending and borrowing and spending and borrowing, the simple reality is that the Australian population in decades to come will have to shoulder the burden. And it is unfair not only for older Australians but for new Australians. The consequences of Labor's policies affect both ends of the spectrum. It is young Australians who will have to shoulder this debt and deficit burden for decades to come. It is young Australians who are in schools today who will have to carry the heavy tax burden as a consequence of Labor's reckless spending over the past five years. Older Australians will also pay the price.


While the Labor Party can have packages of bills entitled 'Living Longer Living Better', while they can claim to be introducing $500 million of new spending, the simple reality is that this is not new money that has come from fiscal prudence; it is money that is being borrowed from abroad. That is entirely consistent with an approach that the Labor Party has had over the last five years that has seen them borrow money from aboard to spend locally on all sorts of projects that they deem to be warranted. Unlike for much of the spending, there is some support for the Living Longer Living Better package and the need to make sure that older Australians are well cared for. But there has been so much waste from the Labor Party. Who can forget pink batts? Who could forget the blow-outs on border protection? We have seen so many blow-outs under this Labor government—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Moncrieff should not forget the bill that he is referring to.




Mr CIOBO:
  over the last five years. I know that aged Australians are very concerned about it. Aged Australians know that they have worked hard and for decades they have paid their taxes, and they expect the government to look after them. But now when the real pressure is on, the Labor Party has abandoned older Australians just as it has abandoned young Australians who will have to carry the burden and pay the taxes. That is the reason the coalition has a problem with these bills.

 (14:11):  I make a brief statement to the House. I am choosing to do it now so that I have everybody's attention. In view of the significance of proceedings tonight and on Thursday night, and the need to ensure that the dignity of the House is protected, I wish to make some general remarks for the information of members to ensure that the proceedings and arrangements for chamber galleries, for the budget tonight and for budget reply night on Thursday, run smoothly.


As with any other proceedings of the House, there is the principle that any member with the call is entitled to speak without interruption. The Chair will take the necessary action to ensure that that is the case for both addresses. Where appropriate, I will take action under standing order 94(a) and will advise any offending member by written note. Any further action that I consider warranted will be initiated at the commencement of the next sitting day.


I ask members to ensure that their guests arrive at the galleries in a timely way for the address. Guests should arrive at the galleries about 30 minutes prior to the budget speech to ensure they can undertake the security clearance and be seated in the galleries in a timely way. I trust there will be cooperation from members and their guests in the galleries, and that the budget night and the budget night reply will proceed smoothly for the benefit of the House and for those watching and indeed for our nation so that we can ensure everyone who is listening hears the budget and the budget in reply.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2013-05-14,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (15:12):  The Treasurer will get to his feet tonight and engage in what can only be described as another act of fiscal fantasy. Such will be the fictional nature of what the Treasurer will say tonight that I suggest that he begins his budget speech with the phrase 'Once upon a time …'. What will be true about tonight's revelations by the Treasurer is that while Labor's record failures on our borders mean that they have not been able to stop the boats those record failures under this Treasurer have, however, ensured that they have been able to stop a surplus.


Labor's record border failures have no peer. That is why they are records. This afternoon there is an opportunity to go through in some detail the nature of those border failures, which are entirely an act of this government's own making. What is important is to understand the impacts and consequences of this record level of failure.


Under this government, what we have seen occur in the short space of time of just five years is an average of two people illegally entering Australia by boat every month in 2007-08 expanded this financial year to an average of over 2,000 per month. From two per month to over 2,000 per month: that is an extraordinary act of growth on this government in terms of the border failures that we have seen—it is absolutely extraordinary. It is important to note that, over this period of time, what we have seen is a constancy in the level of pressures that have been brought to bear. As we all know, push factors are, sadly, a tragedy that is always present. What changes is government policy that enables the border failures to present as they have under this government. So we have gone from an average of two per month to over 2,000 per month. And just this year we have set two monthly records. In March we had a record of over 2,500. In April we had a record of over 3,300. And in May, in just less than 10 days, we have had over 1,500 people arrive in this manner. We had a record last financial year, 2011-12, of 8,300 people arrive, and more; but this financial year we have had a record of 20,861 people arrive in this manner—and we are not even at the end of the year yet.


What we also note is one of the other records this government achieved in 2011-12—the 2012-13 figures will be released at some time. I will refer here to the Parliamentary Library publication which refers to IMA refugee status determination requests received—that is, those who have arrived by boat. In 2011-12 the figure for those who came by boat was 7,379. For those who came by air, it was 7,036. For the first time, in 2011-12, more people came by boat than came by air, according to the Parliamentary Library and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. That was at a time when the arrivals for that year were 8,300. This year they are almost 21,000, and we are not even at the end of the year, so one can only imagine the disparity between the figures.


That is the record, but what has been the impact? This government, while in government and in opposition, always took the opportunity to lecture the coalition side of politics on the morality of their policies. One area in particular where it was particularly keen to talk about the impact of the Howard government's policies was the impact on children. But this government's record, because of these record arrivals, is that more children are turning up on boats than at any other time in our nation's history. In this financial year alone, more than 3,000 children have come on the boats. That is up on around 2,000 in the year before that and around 1,000 the year before that. It is estimated that around 40 per cent of those coming on boats now are in family groups. In addition, we have more than 2,000 children who are in the detention network as we speak and over 1,000 of those are in formal detention itself. The previous peak was back in 2000-01, which was under the Howard government, and it was 1,344.


The government have set the record for children coming on boats, flowing as a consequence from their failed policies. So their lecturing and their hectoring of the Howard government over our border policies and their impact on children is dumbfounded by their own record. They should be ashamed of themselves, with their grand acts of pretence to compassion. Their policies have put those children on boats for years, and now in record numbers. They should be aware of their own record of failures and of the impact: when you fail on the borders, children and families get on boats. That has occurred in record numbers under the government.


It was the Prime Minister herself in 2010 and the former minister, Minister Bowen, who said they were going to remove children out of formal detention. There were about 750 in detention at that time. Today there are more than a thousand. She said:


We did not believe that children should be held … in high-security detention … And so, we have worked to have more appropriate accommodation for family groups and for children.


What that turns out to be is more children now in formal detention and, if that is not enough, they have just announced they are going to build more facilities at Curtin and at Wickham Point to take more children into formal detention and, as the minister himself has said, for a period of around 120 days. That is the consequence, the implications and the impact of the government's failed border policies. The hypocrisy is breathtaking. If they are going to make those accusations and criticisms of the Howard government policy then it is time to look in the mirror of their own policy record and policy failings.


The record detention population today is a result of the record level of arrivals. We had four people in immigration detention who had arrived illegally by boat in November 2007. Today? I should say at the end of February, because the government have not released the figures since the end of February, but there were 7,528 at the end of February and another 10,000 on top of that who are on bridging visas.



Government members interjecting—




Mr MORRISON:
  No amount of shouting from those opposite will change that fact. It will not change the fact that 17,528 people, at least at the end of February, had arrived illegally by boat and were in detention. Since the end of February there have been over 7,500 more who have turned up. So on top of these record figures even more have arrived. And if we go to just in May, we know that there were 2,962 people on Christmas Island. I do not need to remind the government, I suppose, that when they burnt down, and the Australian Federal Police had to retake by force, the facility on Christmas Island there were roughly 2,500 in the facility at that time. 


The compounding border failures of this government continue to compound the problems and the impacts that flow from that, which are children getting on boats, children going into detention, and detention centres overcrowding and overloading. The riots and various other things that we have seen that flow as a consequence of those things stem from one key problem: a failure to be able to deliver on the responsibility of a government to protect our borders and ensure proper border security.


Labor is putting the consequences of their failed policies off to the other side of the election, and they did this before at the last election as well. Before the last election, Senator Evans was the minister who failed to act on recommendations and reports, which were coming through his department at the time, that said that more detention capacity needed to be created, and he sat on his hands. It was only after the election that the incoming minister, who was given that hospital pass by Senator Evans, went and, I admit, expanded that network—and we commended him at the time—but it was all too late. The consequences of that stalling before the last election were already set in train, and nothing the government could even do at that stage would be able to take them off the fast train they were on to the crisis that we saw in the immigration detention network, which literally exploded in February, March and April of the following year.


We are seeing the same thing happen again today, because there are currently around 18,255 people who have turned up on boats since 14 August last year and what we do know is the government have not been processing the people that have turned up since that time. So what we have now is a detention population, and a population within the system more broadly, that is growing by the thousands and currently sits around an estimated level of 18,000 to 20,000. I am happy for the government to confirm the numbers and give me a fresh number if they have got one, but by the time we get to an election that number could well be over 30,000 of a backlog in the system, pushing the consequences and responsibilities for dealing with this issue until after an election.


All of this comes at a record cost, and the record cost of this government is spectacular. Since the last election alone, the blow-out in the government's budget—actual figures from the government's budget based on the estimates released in February this year—is $5.2 billion. They said it would cost something just over $1 billion, and it ended up costing, based on the estimates we have at the end of February, $6 billion plus—a $5.2 billion blow-out since the last election. So tonight the Treasurer has the opportunity to be honest in the budget and tell us what the real costs over the next few years will be. If you simply just put into the budget for the next three years what the estimated cost for this year is then the Treasurer has a $5 billion hole in the budget as we speak today. The Treasurer will need to detail tonight whether he is going to budget on this issue on the basis of the coalition's policies that will stop the boats or he is going to budget on the policies of his own government that have failed to stop the boats. If that budget tonight does not come up with at least the $5 billion that is missing currently in the estimates, then he must be budgeting for a change of government, because that is the only way we are going to see a change in those figures.


The budget blow-outs are extraordinary and they are costing Australians every single day. They have led to record chaos more broadly in the immigration department and they have led to the chaos we have seen not just in immigration detention but also in the bridging visa program in the community. We have now seen the government not engage in a policy of community release; we have seen the government engage in a policy of community dumping. This is a government that is dumping people into the community with no care and no responsibility—out of sight, out of mind. It is putting more and more pressure on the charitable organisations that are out there and other service providers who have to step into the gap created by this government.


Do not kid yourself that this government has somehow embarked on this policy of bridging visas out of a sense of compassion. They have embarked on this policy because they cannot cope with the level of arrivals. Not only did the detention network get overrun—they had to let single males out on bridging visas—but now the community detention facilities have been overrun and they are now going to dump families into the same situation we have seen single adult males in over the last 18 months. So it is not surprising that the Salvation Army's Major Paul Moulds has said:



We are stepping into a gap created by the federal government. … These emergency relief services are usually for people who desperately need help here, but what else are we meant to do? What else do you do when a hungry child turns up at your door?


Anthony Thornton, the national president of the St Vincent de Paul Society said:



It is a matter of great sadness for the St Vincent de Paul Society that the federal government is abandoning asylum-seekers to fend for themselves in the community with minimal, or even no, support and no right to work.



They are the comments of the St Vincent de Paul Society.


These are the policies and the consequences that have come as a result of the government's border policy failures. The coalition's alternative has always been there for this government to adopt, and they have used excuse after excuse not to embrace that and they still continue to do that today. That will not change between now and the election, and so the opportunity at the election is to change the government and change the outcome by changing the policy. That is what the Australian people will have the opportunity to do on 14 September.

"Clare, Jason, MP",ALP,2013-05-14,"



Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Cabinet Secretary) (15:27):  We had this debate late last year just before Christmas, and at that time I told the House of my fears and concerns about more people dying over the Christmas period. Unfortunately, all of my fears have been well founded. On 25 January this year, Customs intercepted a boat 17 nautical miles off Christmas Island that was carrying 15 people. The people on board reported that four men had left on a makeshift raft of inner tubes and bamboo poles approximately 24 hours earlier in a bid to swim to Christmas Island. A search was commenced, and on 30 January one man was found at Ethel Beach on Christmas Island. He was reported saying that four men had been separated from the raft, possibly as it broke up. Those three other men have never been found.


In January, 20 more asylum seekers were rescued by Indonesian fishermen after their boat sank off the coast of Indonesia. It was reported that two more asylum seekers perished. In March, minutes after being boarded by two border protection officers, a vessel capsized after being struck by two freak waves. Ninety-four people were rescued, two people died, and one of those people was a young boy. In April, another vessel crashed off the coast of Indonesia with 66 people on board; 14 were rescued, 52 have still not been recovered—presumed perished.


Forget the politics. That is what this debate is essentially all about—stopping people from dying, stopping the constant repetition of this. That is what this debate is about, or at least it is what this debate should be about. But it is a debate that has been poisoned by politics—by politicians seeking political advantage. That is the reason that we are debating this and why this debate has gone on now for almost 12 years. It is not about the policy as much as it is about the politics. I made this point last year in the same debate. We agree on most of the policy. The differences here are really at the margins. It is the politics that are poisoning this debate and, if you want proof of that, there is no better place to look than the contribution by David Marr in his Quarterly Essay where, at page 36, he talks about the WikiLeaks cable that showed what was happening back in 2009. It said:


In late 2009, in the dying days of Malcolm Turnbull's leadership of the Opposition, a ""key Liberal party strategist"" popped in to the US embassy in Canberra to say how pleased the party was that refugee boats were, once again, making their way to Christmas Island. The issue was 'fantastic', he said. And 'the more boats that come the better.' But he admitted they had yet to find a way to make the issue work in their favour: his research indicated only a 'slight trend' towards the Coalition.""


There you have a senior Liberal Party strategist in the US embassy saying 'the more boats … the better' and it is a pity that it has not yet worked well enough as a political device. That is why we are having this debate. That is why the Liberal Party refuses to allow the government to implement our own policies—because of Liberal Party strategists who think the more boats is in their political interest.


We do not agree on everything, but on big issues of life and death where people's lives are at risk we should agree on this principle: that the government of the day—Labor or Liberal or whatever it might be—should be given the power that it thinks it needs to stop people getting on boats and perishing at sea. That is what the Labor Party did in opposition in 2001 when John Howard asked for more powers after the Tampa. That is what John Howard would do now if John Howard were the Leader of the Opposition.


But that is what we are being denied right now by both the Liberal Party and by the Greens, who have refused to give us the powers that this government genuinely believes will help to stop people getting onto boats and risking their lives. That is why we are here. That is why we are having this debate—because of the politics, because of the fight for political advantage. I am sick of it. The people of Australia are sick of it. They are sick of this fighting and they want us to work together.


So what works? We know this: the fear of drowning has not put people off; offshore processing has not put people off; but the threat of being flown back has. The threat of being flown back home has had a significant impact. Last year there was a big increase in the number of people coming to Australia by boat from Sri Lanka—more than 5,000 people. Most of these people are not refugees. They are economic migrants, people looking for a better life, people looking for a job. They are not entitled to asylum in Australia. Last year we made the decision to screen these people quickly and fly them back when it was determined that they were not refugees. The impact of flying people back to Sri Lanka has been dramatic. The number of boats coming to Australia from Sri Lanka has dropped significantly. In the last four months of last year there were 70 boats coming to Australia from Sri Lanka. So far this year, there have been seven. This shows that flybacks work. The fear of death does not put people off, but the fear of being sent home a few days or a few weeks after they set out to sea certainly does. It shows how critical this is in stopping people getting onto boats and risking their lives. If we want to stop the boats, we have got to do this, and we have to do it elsewhere.


The biggest group of people coming to Australia by boat at the moment are people from Iran, and like most of the people coming from Sri Lanka, most of them are economic migrants. They are not fleeing persecution; they are looking for a better life; they are looking for a job. They are not entitled to asylum. 


But unlike Sri Lankans, we cannot fly them home. Unlike Sri Lanka, the country of Iran refuses to take them so we cannot fly them back. But what we can do is fly them halfway back. We can fly them back to the countries they transit through to get on a boat to come to Australia. And one of those countries is Malaysia. The fear of death, as I said, does not put people off, but the threat of being sent back home does. That is why the plan to fly people back to Malaysia is an important part of the solution. Flybacks work, and if you cannot fly people all the way back to Iran, fly them halfway back, to Malaysia. 


The agreement with Malaysia is limited. But it is a start. It is one that we Australians can build on with them and it is the type of program that we can do with other transit countries. In many senses, it is the same as the opposition's pushback policy except for this important difference: it is safer, a lot safer. This is what we have to do, I sincerely believe, if we are going to reduce the incentive for people to get on a boat and risk their lives.


Here is the frustrating part of this: the opposition has refused to give us the power to implement this policy, a policy that we think will reduce the risk of people dying. Their argument is that you cannot fly people back to Malaysia because they are not signatories to the UN convention on refugees. That is a fake excuse. It has been contrived as something to hide behind. Their own pushback policy is designed to send people back to another country that also has not signed the UN convention on refugees, and that is Indonesia. Our policy is exactly the same, only safer. The opposition say that if they are elected they will push back boats where it is safe to do so. My question is: when is it safe to do so? The answer to that question is, of course, never. That is the advice of the Navy and that is what experience tells us. 


I have gone back and I have had a look at the attempts by the Howard government to push boats back in the past, and what happened in those instances is revealing. SIEV I on 7 September 2001 showed that Navy personnel were threatened and forced to withdraw after they boarded the vessel. On SIEV II on 9 September 2001, there were 30 knives found concealed on the boat and the passengers threatened self-harm. On SIEV III on 11 September 2001, naval personnel were met with violence and they could not control the wheelhouse. The boarding party had to leave the vessel. On SIEV V on 12 October 2001, equipment was thrown overboard and the boat was sabotaged. SIEV VI on 19 October 2001 was also sabotaged. When naval personnel attempted to repair the ship, fires were started, the deck boards were turned up and the boat ended up sinking. SIEV VII on 22 October had 15 people dive overboard; others doused themselves in fuel. They damaged the mast and started a fire in the hold 


SIEV IX on 31 October 2001 was also sabotaged—fuel lines were cut. On SIEV XII on 16 December 2001 there was more sabotage, more fires and more threats of self-harm. This is what happens when you attempt to push boats back; it is why the Navy say it is not safe to do this. That is why I am making the argument today that a much better option, a much safer option and proven effective option, is to fly people back.


Perhaps the best example of how dangerous this practice is, and how dangerous this practice would be, is what happened with SIEV XXXVI in 2009. This was not a boat that was turned around, but the people who were on the boat thought that they were about to be turned back. This is what Coroner Greg Cavanagh said in his subsequent report:


…the vessel's engine was sabotaged and subsequent petrol was spilt into the bilge and ignited.


There was an explosion; five asylum seekers drowned, 40 people were injured, including ADF personnel, who were subsequently treated for burns and other injuries. The important point here is that what happened in this terrible incident could have been much, much worse. The coroner, Greg Cavanagh, says that one of the ADF personnel, Corporal Jager—a medical officer—would have died if not for the efforts to rescue her. In his findings he found that all of this happened on this vessel because the people on the boat thought that the boat was going to be turned around. That is why the Navy has criticised the idea of turning boats back. That is why they say that it is never safe to do so because it puts the lives of their men and women at risk.


Compare all of that—compare all the chaos of what happened on these boats and what happened on SIEV XXXIV—to the policy of flying people back: boarding the vessel and getting the people who are on the boat, putting them on a plane and flying them safely back, whether it is Sri Lanka or whether it is Malaysia. It is a lot safer, we have proven that it is much more effective and it is something they can and should be rolled out more broadly.


This is not easy stuff; it is very hard. It is a wretchedly difficult area of policy, and the opposition know that. We have seen in recent weeks the opposition leader saying that instead of stopping the boats he will 'reduce the boats'. This is difficult but there is a way through. As I say, it involves flying people back; that means legislation. It means we have to work together. We have been fighting about this since Tampa—for more than a decade. The issue has been rancid with politics ever since. As I have said in this debate—and as I have said elsewhere—all we are saying is that the government of the day should be given the power that it thinks it needs to stop people dying at sea. We think that is fly-backs. The evidence shows that it works. We need the Liberal Party and we need the Greens to let us do that. While ever we do not, more people will come and more people will die. That is just a simple fact. And that should weigh on the minds of all of us here. These are not just numbers; they are people. They are mothers, they are fathers, they are sisters, they are brothers, they are boys and girls and we should condemn the political strategists I quoted earlier who say, 'the more boats the better'. That sort of attitude diminishes all of us; we are better than that. I am disgusted by those comments. I think all my colleagues on both sides of the House should be disgusted by those sort of comments. This is not going to be solved with politics. It is going to be solved with policies. With every boat there is the risk of death. We have seen too much death in the past few years. We have seen too much death in the past few months. If we are going to stop this we need to work together and that involves voting for one simple piece of legislation which is before this parliament. I ask all members to support that legislation and fly people back to Malaysia.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2013-05-14,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (15:42):  The MPI that we are discussing today is about the consequences of the terrible failure of the Labor Party to control our borders since they came to office. Members will know—and of course this will be revealed later tonight in the budget—about the cost to Australian taxpayers of what is possibly Labor's most significant policy failure since arriving on the treasury bench in 2007.


We also know, and we know very well, about the enormous toll that it has taken on people who have sought the services of a people smuggler and drowned in the attempt to come to Australia. I want to highlight some of the other consequences of this failure to control our borders—issues that have not been raised as extensively in this place, but very serious issues that go to national security in Australia.


Clearly, when you have a circumstance of criminals being in charge of who comes to Australia, and when there is enormous weakness on our borders, criminals will seek to exploit that weakness in the same way that if you leave your doors unlocked that criminals will seek to exploit this sort of weakness if they come to burgle your home. It is the same if you are not controlling your borders—criminals will eye the opportunities that are available to them through that policy failure. When you have over 40,000 people having arrived here courtesy of people smugglers, it is clearly impossible for us to rigorously assess the background of everyone who arrives in this way. I want to make clear that the vast majority of people who arrive using the services of a people smuggler are not in this category. But, clearly, when you are talking about such a large number of people, the opportunity for people of bad character to arrive by paying a people smuggler is very real and we would be naive and we would be foolish to overlook the fact that criminals will exploit the border weaknesses that have resulted from the Labor Party's policy failures.


I wanted to talk about a few cases in particular that have been highlighted in the media, but that we have not had an opportunity to highlight in the parliament. I want to call on the government to use the parliament to explain the circumstances surrounding three cases that I am going to raise. The three I am talking about were highlighted in a report in the West Australian toward the end of last month. They are people who have arrived here by paying a people smuggler. One is an accused Egyptian terrorist, one is an alleged Sri Lankan murderer and the third is an Iranian who is apparently wanted for drug trafficking in his home country. The cases were revealed in a report in the West Australian. 


What is most concerning about this is, first, the fact that people of this character would have used the services of a people smuggler to get here. Second, and most important, is the manner in which they have been treated since they have arrived. That report revealed that the accused Egyptian terrorist was the subject of an Interpol red notice, the highest level of alert from Interpol. That should have said to Australian law-enforcement authorities that this was somebody who needed to be apprehended on arrival in the country. A red notice is essentially an international arrest warrant.



Mr Dreyfus interjecting—




Mr KEENAN:
  He was in detention. I will get to this now. It would be very good if the minister would actually—




Mr Dreyfus:
  Demonising refugees. It is a disgrace.




Mr KEENAN:
  'Demonising refugees'? This is a typical example of an overreaction from the Attorney-General. What he should be explaining is why he has allowed a situation in this country where national security has been breached, firstly, because people smugglers have smuggled people in of this character and, secondly, the manner in which they have been held in this country since they have arrived.



Government members interjecting—




Mr KEENAN:
  In the case of the accused Egyptian terrorist, he was apparently held in Inverbrackie, a detention centre in the home state of one of the members who is interjecting. That is a low-security environment protected by the equivalent of a pool fence. This is a person who is serious enough to appear on an Interpol red notice and the government thinks that an appropriate way to hold him is to release him into Inverbrackie.




Mr Dreyfus:
  In detention.




Mr KEENAN:
  The Attorney-General—and I will just get this on the record—is foolish enough to keep interjecting, saying the man is in detention. I am talking about the manner in which he was detained. There is a very big difference between being held in Inverbrackie, a low-security environment, and being held in Villawood, where apparently this person was moved once the media reported on the circumstances of his detention.


The question for ministers like the Attorney-General is: why would an accused Egyptian terrorist be held with such a low-security environment? I would really welcome the Attorney-General taking the opportunity in the parliament to respond to that. Why would you put somebody, an accused terrorist subject to an Interpol red notice, within a low-security detention environment? This is the question that the government has refused to answer. The question is: did the immigration minister even know that he had a person subject to such serious allegations or perhaps even convictions? We do not know. Did he even know that this person was held within such a low-security environment, because once the media report was published in the West Australian on the Saturday apparently the government then took action to move this person from Inverbrackie to Villawood? The question for ministers like the Attorney-General, who is supposed to actually protect Australia's national security, is: why would a person of such a character be placed within such a low-security environment? I hope that the Attorney-General takes the opportunity to answer that question to the Australian people in the parliament today.


The Sri Lankan who was accused of murdering his girlfriend was not held in low-security detention. He was released into community detention, again something that seems highly and totally inappropriate for somebody accused of such a serious crime. I wrote to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship asking him why. The first question I posed to him—and a question that he has not answered—is: was he even aware that he had these three people within the detention network? I posed that question to him because he only took action after these cases appeared in the media. I also posed some other questions that he has so far refused to answer, even though he has responded to my letter, but unfortunately he has not responded to the questions that I put to him.


I asked when did he become aware that he was housing within the detention network people who have been accused of such serious crimes. What action had he taken to assure that appropriate security in these cases was available to manage the risk of flight in the community? When somebody is being released into community detention, clearly there are serious questions to be asked about managing that flight risk. I asked, for each case, when did the individuals arrive and in what boat? Where were they located now and what is the current status of their refugee assessment? Finally, how have these accusations been further investigated, by whom and what are the implications for the findings of their refugee assessments?


The minister did respond to my letter but he did not address any of these questions that have been put to him. They are serious questions on which he owes the Australian people an explanation as to what has gone on here. Sure, people are going to exploit the weaknesses of the Labor Party's failed border protection policies, but it raises very serious concerns when they are housed in such low-security detention environments. The minister by his letter to me and by his public comments has given every indication that he had absolutely no idea that this was happening until he was alerted by the West Australian newspaper. He was asked on 22 April, for example, on 6PR radio in Perth about the specific people by the radio commentator Howard Sattler. The minister said that he was going to get a brief on it, which really strikes me as somebody who had no idea what was going on within the detention network. Two days later, on Sky News, he was asked about these cases as well. His response was that he was going to examine the circumstances. This is clearly a case, as so often we see with this government, of them doing something well and truly after the horse has bolted. 


The Australian people are owed an explanation as to what has gone on in all three of these cases. The most serious is that of the accused Egyptian terrorist who was the subject of an Interpol red notice. One of the reasons the government is struggling to cope with looking at the security background of the 40,000-odd people who have arrived here courtesy of a people smuggler is that they have astonishingly cut the budget that ASIO has to conduct these character assessments. In last year's budget, $6.9 million was cut out of the ASIO budget for them to conduct character assessments of people who have arrived here on illegal boats. That I think is an astonishing fact that goes to the heart of Labor's failure to protect national security in these instances. We now have an apparently light touch character assessment that does not even seem to establish the identity of a person before giving them what is essentially a tick and flick exercise. These are very serious allegations on which the government owes an explanation to the Australian people and I call on them to use this parliament to provide that explanation.

"Champion, Nick, MP",ALP,2013-05-14,"



Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (15:52):  This is a long debate, isn't it? We have had debates before on boat arrivals and we will probably have them again before this parliament rises and the election happens. It is a long debate for a reason. There are 46 million displaced people around the world. Periodically it has been a national debate since about the middle of the 1970s. It is very interesting to look at the different national approaches we have taken over that time.


Not many people understand that a mere 1,700 or so Vietnamese boat people arrived here in the 1970s. There were 111 in 1976, about 868 in 1978 and about 304 in 1979. There were two approaches that could have been taken by the Labor Party at that time. We could have sought to demonise these people and take political advantage of it or we could have sought to work with the government to resolve the issue. It is a great credit to Mick Young and Ian Macphee, the then minister, that those members of the House got together and put together an agreement to resolve that issue and bring people here by an appropriate mechanism rather than having them risk their lives by coming here by boat.


Fast forward to the Howard era. You hear the opposition talking about the glories of the Howard era, but of course Howard fixed a problem that he had presided over. In 1999, 3,700 people arrived by boat. In the year 2000, 2,939 people arrived by boat. In 2001, 5,516 people arrived here by boat. I am not seeking to blame the former Prime Minister. He introduced TPVs, but they had very little effect. Some 4,000 people arrived after that. Those movements were not driven by domestic policy; they were driven by people being displaced by wars in places like Afghanistan and Iraq. Through a combination of events that number shrank to very little the next year—one, and then we got a few more along the way.


What was the Labor Party's approach during that time? It was to support the Howard government. Let us look at this opposition. We heard from the minister how they bragged to the American Embassy. We heard about the cables. A Liberal Party strategist bragged to the US Embassy about what a great issue this is for them. Despite the government's attempt to bring a rational, less heated, less partisan approach to this debate and commissioning the expert panel, what we have seen from the opposition is partisanship. This MPI reeks of a dark partisanship and the speeches given in support of it reek of a dark partisanship with the politics of division, florid language and aspersions being cast on the government's motives and their competence. We see all the Nixonian tricks you would expect from an opposition bent on serving its own interests rather than the national interest. That is I think the whole approach of the Liberal Party in this area. They have sought to gain partisan advantage at a time of national crisis.


The tragedy is that the opposition really are as sanctimonious as they are partisan. You hear sanctimonious reciting of the great triumphs of the Howard government but never talk about the amount of people who came here during those years. They never talk about the thousands that arrived during those years. They never talk about the fact that, even if the former Prime Minister solved a problem, it was a problem that had occurred on his watch. It did not occur on Labor's watch; it occurred during the Howard years—1999, 2000 and 2001. Let us not forget that the Howard government had the benefit of a parliamentary majority and an opposition that supported the government and did not, most importantly, frustrate its ability to act.


What have we seen from this opposition? Rejection of the Malaysian transfer agreement. After all of their rhetoric and sanctimonious lecturing about offshore processing, they marched into this parliament, sided with the Greens, not just in this House but in the Senate, and prevented the government from acting. It was an extraordinary thing for them to do given how sanctimonious and partisan they have been on this subject.


We need to talk about the facts of this year. You hear the opposition talking about arrivals, and there have been serious numbers of arrivals. There were more than 6,000 Sri Lankan irregular maritime arrivals in 2012-13 compared to 1,356 in the previous year. That is a significant increase. We know that is in part because there has been terrible strife in Sri Lanka. There have been a couple of hundred thousand people herded into barbed wire camps and a very serious war. Notwithstanding that very serious war, we know that some of those people are coming here for economic reasons and that is why, since that time, we have sent 1,073 people back to Sri Lanka.


As a government we are using all the tools available to us in order to deal with this issue. We have not sought from the opposition partisanship, sanctimonious lectures and entirely self-serving history lessons; we have always sought from the opposition cooperation in the national interest—the same cooperation that Mick Young gave Ian Macphee and the same cooperation that Kim Beazley gave former Prime Minister John Howard. Instead, what have we got from the opposition? No matter what the facts, no matter what the expert panel recommends and no matter what the Australian people want, the opposition are dedicated to coming into this parliament and frustrating the government's ability to do anything. They rejected the Malaysian transfer agreement, rejected the prospects of transfer agreements with other countries, demonised Malaysia for their attempts to cooperate with the government and rejected the expert panel—not just its recommendations but the prospect of it. They rejected its authority. They deliberately set out to undermine it. They said: 'It doesn't matter what the expert panel say, we'll reject it. We won't listen to them, because we know best.' They have undermined regional cooperation and the Bali process. They have attacked Malaysia. They have second-guessed Indonesia. They have refused to acknowledge what Indonesia has said—what the foreign minister and the chair of the foreign affairs committee have said over there. It does not matter what the Indonesians say. 'No, don't worry about them; we'll push the boats back.' That is what the opposition are telling people.


They have embraced a dangerous policy—this idea that you can turn boats back safely. Well, you cannot, and everybody knows you cannot. The Navy has told the parliament that you cannot, because, as the Navy's tactics change, so will the people smugglers'. We know that they are far more ruthless than we are, so they will burn boats. If you want some evidence of it, listen to Vice Admiral Ray Griggs, who said:


… there were incidents during these activities, as there have been incidents subsequently, which have been risky. There have been fires lit, there have been attempts to storm the engine compartment of these boats, there have been people jumping in the water and that sort of thing … yes, there are obviously risks involved in this process.


That is what the head of the Navy says. The opposition say, 'We're going to embrace this policy,' and they do not care what the evidence is. They do not care what the feedback is; they are going to do it.


This is an amazingly dangerous and short-sighted approach for the opposition to take, because they have set expectations very high indeed about the consequences of their policies, haven't they? Their rhetoric and their florid partisanship, their dark partisanship, have—let's face it—inflamed the passions of the Australian people, who are legitimately concerned about the arrivals on our border. But let us make no mistake: with this policy of theirs—frustrating the parliament and the government and trying to squeeze every vote out of this situation for themselves to try and change the government of Australia, instead of cooperating, ending this issue and saving lives—ultimately they have the tiger by the tail, and ultimately all of their dark partisanship will rebound on them and it will be to their everlasting disgrace.

"Griggs, Natasha, MP",CLP,2013-05-14,"



Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (16:02):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance, the impact of the record number of people illegally entering Australia by boat under this government. The boats keep coming, and that is why again I have to speak about the Gillard Labor government's absolute failure to protect our nation by efficiently protecting our borders and our immigration program. It is clear to all that the Gillard Labor government has lost control of our borders, and the people smugglers are jumping for joy because they still have a product to sell and will do that at any cost.


Australians know that it is the Gillard Labor government that undid the border protection policies introduced by the Howard government. As I have said in this place before, it does not surprise me to hear very concerning reports that the people smugglers are racing to fill their boats before 14 September, and we all know why: because the Gillard Labor government has the welcome mat out and that will be laid out until then. With the election date fast approaching and with a possible change of government, the people smugglers are doing all they can to fill their boats as fast as they can. The Gillard Labor government is complicit in this because it removed the border protection policies that have been proven to work. The people smugglers know that the coalition will stop the boats.


We are seeing evidence that Labor's border protection failures continue day after day—so much so that the people smugglers are looking for any chink in the armour after the Gillard Labor government's cuts have left our hardworking border protection service overworked and understaffed for the increasing number of boat arrivals. What we can infer from the recent influx of boat arrivals approaching the Top End of Australia is that the recent people smuggler boats have been targeting the mainland of Australia in a bid to exploit the legal loophole that would exclude people from being sent offshore for processing. Let's all remember that it is the Gillard Labor government that has been messing around with this excision bill and failed to get it to pass through the Senate whilst it was too busy pushing through its media reform bills. The Gillard Labor government foolishly pursued its media reform bills instead of passing legislation to excise the mainland of Australia. This just meant that the people smugglers can continue to sell their product: to get to the Australian mainland so their clients can avoid being processed offshore.


Many people in my electorate tell me that they are tired of the Gillard Labor government wasting money when Darwin and Palmerston, like so many other jurisdictions across the country, are in desperate need of funding for improvements in health, education, community safety, housing and child care. After almost six years at its disposal, the Gillard Labor government has not stopped and will not stop the boats. It cannot. We are seeing record numbers of arrivals. The Northern Territory News reported last week that the number of illegal arrivals by boat had hit 40,000. The Northern Territory News also reported the disgusting conditions people smugglers are inflicting on their clients.


So let's just look at how many arrivals have been intercepted off the shores of Darwin this year alone. On 1 January HMAS Armidale intercepted a boat west of Darwin carrying 43 people. On 28 February HMAS Launceston intercepted a boat north-north-west of Darwin carrying 33 people. On 20 March HMAS Pirie intercepted a boat west-north-west of Darwin carrying 78 people. On 24 March HMAS Pirie again intercepted a boat north-west of Darwin carrying 41 people. On 27 March HMAS Pirie again intercepted a boat south-west of Darwin carrying 147 people. On 3 April HMAS Bundaberg intercepted a boat north-west of Darwin carrying 41 people. On 9 April HMAS Ararat intercepted a boat north-west of Darwin carrying 73 people. On 17 April HMAS Childers intercepted a boat west-south-west of Darwin carrying 78 people. On 21 April HMAS Maryborough intercepted a boat north-west of Darwin carrying 67 people. On 23 April, ACV Ocean Protector intercepted a boat north-north-east of Darwin carrying 65 people. On 26 April, HMAS Maitland intercepted a boat west-north-west of Darwin carrying 75 people. On 3 May, HMAS Albany intercepted a boat west-north-west of Darwin carrying 160 people. On 4 May, ACV Botany Bay andMV OMS Endurance intercepted a boat north-west of Darwin carrying 105 people. That is 13 boats targeted for Darwin, carrying 1,006 people. Clearly, there is a new approach for the people smugglers and they are targeting the Top End. That is over 1,000 extra people putting pressure on our services in the Top End, where our services are already under pressure and completely thin on the ground.


Let's just look at the track record for all of the arrivals. Two hundred and eighty-eight boats and 18,255 people have arrived in Australia since August 14 last year. This was when the Gillard Labor government agreed to open Nauru as an offshore processing centre. This was their big deterrent. Clearly that has not worked either. Since the last federal election there have been 673 boats and 40,772 people that have arrived illegally on our shores. What a great track record—they should be so proud!


Let's look at the cost. It is over $5 billion. As I have said in this place before, I can only imagine what I could do in Solomon with $5 billion. $5 billion would go a long way towards the NDIS too, wouldn't it? But clearly we have spent it on different things. Five billion dollars would be able to fund a desperately needed hospital in Palmerston. It would be able to fund new police to improve community safety, perhaps a new school for our ever-increasing population, affordable housing for the Territorians who are being forced into homelessness every day due to the housing crisis, improvements to our roads to combat the ever-increasing traffic due to our population growth. No wonder the people of my electorate are fed up with the Gillard Labor government and its failed border protection policies—policies that give the people smugglers a product to sell.


People in my electorate know very well that every dollar spent on combating people smugglers is a dollar not spent in our community. Darwin has become the Gillard Labor government's front line failure for border protection policies. Our detention centres are full. The Prime Minister was in Darwin last weekend when 18 detainees escaped from our detention centre. She knows first-hand how she and her border protection policies have failed, and have impacted significantly on my electorate, because the boats continue to arrive to the point where families and children are now being transferred to detention centres that were previously used for males. After the Gillard Labor government promised children would be removed from formal detention and removed from being behind barbed wire, they are now being relocated to a site previously only suitable for males in detention. Another Labor broken promise.


There is a different way. The coalition does have a plan, an alternative to mitigate the disastrous impact that the Gillard Labor government has had on border protection. We have stopped the boats before and we will do it again. The coalition will restore what the Labor Party abandoned: a strong border protection regime developed by the coalition as a priority to protect our nation's borders.


The coalition will reintroduce off-shore processing of illegal boat arrivals as part of a series of measures to stop the boats and protect our borders. We will prevent this problem by minimising the numbers coming from both initial countries of origin and first asylum countries. We will disrupt the business of people smuggling and intercept the boats where it is safe to do so. We will make it a priority to identify and assist those in genuine need of refugee protection as early as possible. We have done it before and we will do it again.


The Howard government successfully reduced the flood of illegal arrivals to a mere trickle. Between 2002 and 2007, 10 illegal entry boats arrived with fewer than 250 passengers. Compare this with over 400 boats and 25,000 people arriving illegally since the last federal election. It is fair to say Labor's management of this issue has been a disaster. The boats must be stopped. There is no argument that people smuggling is a good result for anyone. It is unsafe for asylum seekers and every year people die from taking this risk. Stopping the boats is a priority in my electorate, and given the opportunity, the coalition has made it a priority to fix this disaster and the legacy of the Gillard-led Labor government.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (16:12):  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, for recognising me this far away from you. It is a bit unusual for me to be this far away from you.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Are you in your right seat?




Mr PERRETT:
  I am, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have been moved—promoted.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Moreton has the call and I recognise his elevation to Deputy Whip.




Mr PERRETT:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. We have heard a range of speakers on this topic, and some interesting ideas from both sides. I will take out the member for Solomon's contribution, because that was just a stitching-together of election slogans. But there were some interesting ideas put forward in this MPI, because it is an important issue.


The world has changed significantly since the Howard government came to power in 1996, and significantly since those years in 1999, 2000 and 2001 when a significant number of boats started heading towards Australia. Let's look at things that have happened. Australia's population has obviously increased—we have now reached 23 million people, and I think that the world's population has reached nine billion. Climate change is recognised by all—leaving aside a few people on the opposite side of the chamber—of the world's serious scientists as being a significant problem. Now, today, there are approximately 46 million displaced people within their own countries—46 million people displaced around the world—and we see it playing out in war in horrible places like Syria; with climate change impacting on many countries both in terms of agricultural production or rising sea levels; and also with some political challenges that have come. Over 15 million people have registered with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and they are seen to have a legitimate case.


Australia has a proud history of accepting immigrants. We are a nation of immigrants, as you know by looking around at the surnames, religions and backgrounds of people in this chamber. Since the end of World War II, almost six million people have migrated to Australia from other nations. So we do understand migration. We are not a xenophobic nation, even though ever since 1788 we have had an almost pathological fear as a nation of people coming in boats. Whether we are worried about the French that were only a couple of days late, the Russians, the Japanese, the Germans, the Vietnamese or whoever, it seems to be part of Australia's DNA to have a fear of boats, but also to welcome the person from overseas who lives next door to you, even though they seem to be contradictory concepts. In my electorate about one in three people were born overseas, but throughout Australia it is about one in four. I think we are No. 2 in the world in terms of taking refugees in—I think we went past Canada the other day—and it is basically the United States, Australia, Canada and then a fair bit of daylight before you get to anyone that takes any significant numbers. I think some of those Scandinavian countries take 100 or 200 and then it is basically no-one else. You can count the number of countries that do accept refugees on two hands. 


In stripping out some of the politics and passion about this topic, it is important to remember that approximately 90 per cent of the asylum seekers who arrived by boat were found to be refugees. It does vary from year to year depending on where the people are coming from, and I think the minister indicated that there had certainly been a change in terms of people coming from Sri Lanka. In terms of people arriving by plane, where there is nowhere near the hysteria, less than 50 per cent of those seeking asylum have been found to have genuine cases. We need to put that in that context. It is a horrible fact that if people are coming because they are starving to death that is not a genuine claim to be a refugee. If you are coming because your island is being covered by waves and you are drowning, you do not have a genuine claim as a refugee. It is a horrible fact that some people do not realise that you must be fleeing extreme persecution on the grounds of race, religion, nationality or the membership of a particular social group or political opinion. I have certainly got refugees in my electorate that have come both by boat and by plane who have those characteristics—and I particularly mention many of the Vietnamese in my suburb of Oxley who made that journey and many of the Sudanese in my suburbs of Moorooka and Annerley as well as Hazari throughout my electorate who came for all sorts of different reasons.


That is one of those facts that we do not realise, that we could watch someone starve to death and that will not enliven our treaty obligations given the treaty that we on both sides of the chamber support. I particularly thank the member for Wakefield for touching on that history of bipartisanship in this area—a proud history of bipartisanship in this area—where people did not play the race card. Instead, they played the national interest card: the right thing to do, the Christian thing to do, the 'what would a good neighbour do? thing' That has been the case in the past where we see those figures for the Vietnamese. I had not realised that the actual number of Vietnamese people arriving was so low in terms of those coming by boat—1,700 people throughout the late seventies—but the number of Vietnamese who then came under other programs is obviously much more significant and they continue, as a whole, to make a great contribution to our economy and to our nation.


What to do to set up a situation where we manage this flow, this reality of a changed world? We cannot just put the mirror up and say, 'This is what we did in 2001-02.' As we heard from the minister, that policy was of a time and was flawed at that time. We must accept the advice of the people who know, and that is the Navy, the people who actually go out there on the waves and put their lives at risk. They have said very clearly that it is too dangerous and that we put ADF lives at risk. I have stood in this chamber too many times commemorating the loss of ADF personnel lives, and to think that a political decision could result in more ADF personnel dying scares me horribly. Along with the member for Stirling, who spoke earlier, and the member for Wakefield, I was a part of the joint select committee chaired by Senator Gavin Marshall that looked into the Christmas Island tragedy. We stood on the cliffs at Christmas Island and many of you have seen the footage of that boat breaking up there, except we then had to watch the entire footage and see those young girls drowning—the footage that did not make it onto our news at night. That event was significant because we had the footage, but there are so many other untold stories of lives lost at sea. 


Every day that I go for a walk in Canberra I walk through the SIEV X memorial to those 300 other lives that were lost. We need to do all we can as a nation to stop people making that journey in boats, because the reality is that about one in 20 of them will drown. Lots of things motivate people to get into boats, but the reality is that it is about a one in 20 ratio of people drowning at sea. That is why we asked Angus Houston, the former chief of our Defence Force and very well respected by both sides of the chamber, to pull an expert panel together and find out what we should do. All of their recommendations must be in place for the whole suite of measures for us to be able to stop people making those dangerous journeys.


However all of them were supported, apart from the politics that came into play in the Malaysian solution, where we had that dreadful hypocrisy of, 'We will tow boats back to Indonesia, even though they are not a signatory to the UNHCR treaty,' and at the very same time saying, 'We won't send people to Malaysia because they are not a signatory to the UNHCR treaty'. It is that rank hypocrisy from those opposite, where they are prepared to milk this situation for every available vote.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2013-05-14,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (16:22):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance: the impact of the record numbers of people illegally entering Australia by boat under this government. No other issue that faces the Australian people today better illustrates the outcomes of the chaotic, divided and dysfunctional government. What better manifestation of an incompetent government could there actually be than the deliberate removal of policy walls that were protecting our home and our nation, just as we have seen under these Labor Rudd and Gillard governments? Perhaps tonight's budget might actually be a better manifestation, but let us not forget the impact that losing control of our borders is going to have on tonight's budget, and all the budgets. More than $5 billion of border protection blow-outs have occurred since the last election, and all that has contributed to the substantial black hole that the Treasurer will preside over tonight.


The blow-outs result from Labor's remarkable ability to spot something that has been solved—something that is fixed—and turn it into a problem, and then quickly turn it into a crisis. Having watched the former Prime Minister, John Howard, effectively stop the flow of illegal boat arrivals, this Labor government proceeded to dismantle the solution and create a problem. It has turned into a crisis, and the boats keep coming and coming and coming.


Since November 2007, when the successful Howard government ended, we have seen a staggering 40,772 illegal arrivals in our country. The sheer scale of Labor's border protection failure now surpasses the population of most towns in my electorate of Dawson. The Labor Party must be wishing that those illegal arrivals could all vote, because they must have imported almost half an electorate in the past 5½ years.


But I have to tell you that the other 150 real electorates around the nation are not so impressed. People have genuine concerns about their country throwing its doors open to economic refugees and throwing the immigration program over to people smugglers, human traffickers and perhaps terrorists. In this post-9/11 world we see airport security getting tighter and tighter, but in the post-Howard years we see Australia's maritime border security getting looser and looser. When this government sets new benchmarks for porous borders on a daily basis, Australians rightly question how many illegal arrivals are genuine refugees who will become tomorrow's citizens and how many are using the back door to become a threat to our nation.


Illegal immigration through people smuggling is a threat to all Australians. It is a threat because it raises serious security and criminal concerns, it raises quarantine and health issues, it costs time and money in processing and a lot of time and a lot of money under this government. Most importantly, it infringes on our nation's sovereignty and gives us less control over who comes into this country.


These are not actually my claims: what I have paraphrased there is from the Australian Federal Police website. To rebut what was said by the previous speaker, the member for Moreton: arrival in illegal people-smuggling vessels is actually different, and more of an issue, from illegal arrival by plane. We know who you are when you get here by plane; you have to have identification to get on the plane. We probably know where you are from as well. When you arrive by boat, without identification, there is a serious issue in working out whether you are a security risk to this nation.


While those on the opposite side would have us believe that all of these concerns are just unfounded, the facts actually speak for themselves. Last week on 7 May, Nine News reported that four Vietnamese asylum seekers, including a teenage boy, were on the run after escaping from the Darwin detention centre. What about the public revelation in April that recent unauthorised arrivals included a Sri Lankan man who allegedly fled his home after killing his girlfriend, an Egyptian man who was the subject of a high-level Interpol red notice for terrorism activities and an Iranian man accused of drug trafficking in Teheran?


A month ago I noticed a report that asylum seekers who had actually been branded as national security threats were protesting and asking the government to release them from detention or kill them. The article where I read about this went on to say that most of the asylum seekers had been in detention for two or three years following adverse security assessments from ASIO. They were among 56 in Australia who have been deemed threats to national security, without the ability to challenge those decisions. But they have been deemed by our agency which looks after national security as national security threats.


On 4 September last year the Australian reported that asylum seekers with violent histories were being released on bridging visas or into community detention. One was even allowed to marry in detention and make home visits to his wife. The 31-year-old was considered by ASIO to be a risk to security. Again, on 16 August last year the Australian reported that asylum seekers travelling to Australia had been identified by Sri Lankan authorities as members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The identification of the terrorist group members was based on photographs of new arrivals published in the Australian media. Back in 2010, on 14 July, the Australian reported that Indonesian authorities believed they had captured a senior Afghan al-Qaeda link figure posing as an asylum seeker and trying to reach Australia. There is this overwhelming body of evidence that Labor's open-doors policy is a real and direct threat to our national security and our way of life.


We can look to the experience in Britain to see the impact of unfettered illegal immigration. In an op ed piece back in 2009, the foreign editor of the Australian, Greg Sheridan, wrote about a discussion he had had with the then British Foreign Secretary, David Miliband. Miliband said to him that 75 per cent of all terrorist plots that were aimed at Britain actually originated in the federally administered tribal areas of Pakistan. He noted that some 800,000 Pakistanis lived in Britain. He said:


The vast majority, it goes without saying, are law-abiding citizens. But there is a link between uncontrolled Muslim immigration and terrorism.


The real historic significance of the illegal immigration crisis in our northern waters is that this could, if things go wrong, be the moment Australia loses control of our immigration program, and that would be a disaster.


If we are importing potential security risks because we are too scared to be labelled racist, bigots, dog whistlers or whatever then we are condemning this nation to an inevitable terrorist attack. The real danger that we face is that most Australians are too scared to mention the elephant in the room and this Labor government is too gutless to acknowledge that the elephant they rolled out the red carpet for is a very dangerous thing to actually have in your room.


Never one to wear the gutless tag, the former member for O'Connor, Wilson Tuckey, said, in 2009, he believed terrorists could be masquerading as asylum seekers. His reasoning was:


If you wanted to get into Australia and you have bad intentions, what do you do?


You insert yourself in a crowd of 100 for which there is great sympathy for the other 99.


You go on a system where nobody brings their papers, you have no identity, you have no address.


At the time, the member for Griffith, then Prime Minister, predictably condemned those comments, but the fact is that Wilson Tuckey was right. The facts speak for themselves.


The Gillard Labor government, not content with having the worst border security crisis in the history of our nation because of their dismantling of policies that worked, are now trying to pull the rug out from our national security agencies. These are the agencies charged with the responsibility of ensuring those who arrive illegally on our shores do not pose a risk to our nation. This is what the Labor Party wants them to do. On 1 May, two weeks ago, Radio National reported that Labor backbenchers were pressuring the government on ASIO assessments. It said the federal government was considering calls by its own backbench for increased scrutiny of the way ASIO makes adverse assessments of asylum seekers. They are upset because those 55 alleged asylum speakers I spoke of before have no prospect of release in sight because they are deemed by a national security agency to be a threat to this nation. So, far from recognising the dangers of security threats to this country, the Labor Party wants to ignore what ASIO says and just let them in.


We ignore the advice of ASIO at our peril. I am reminded of a story printed in the Australian on 4 September 2001, a week before the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. It reported that the US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs, James Kelly, said the flow of illegal immigrants from South Asia and the Middle East into Indonesia was a source of concern. He said:


If it's easy to move people under strange identities around, that's a capability that terrorists who we know exist can then use.


Labor has removed our border controls. They have put this nation at risk. A nation without borders is like a house without walls. Anyone can get in. (Time expired)

"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2013-05-14,"



Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (16:32):  I thought that, given that the government has no more speakers on the MPI, I would stand and have my comments as well. We have heard a lot about what has happened in the six years since the last time the coalition was in government. The story is not good. The story is a tragedy for a lot of people who have lost their lives along the way. The story is a tragedy for the finances of this country: some $6 billion in overspending and waste this government has presided over when there was a working system which discouraged people from risking their lives, because they knew the chances of making it to Australia were very slim. The trickle of boats that took place from 2001, when the Howard government saw a problem and created a solution, became a flood when the current government, under the former Prime Minister and continued in every respect by the current Prime Minister, changed the system completely, encouraging people to come to this country, risking their lives and putting money into the pockets of people smugglers and other international criminals. That is a tragedy. This is what happens to this country when a government that does not understand the priorities and wisdom of strong borders is let loose.


Look at what actually took place. We hear a lot from those on the other side about compassion. We hear a lot from those on the other side about the circumstances of those who come to this country. No-one says that the people who come by boats are coming from a great place. The point is that this immigration system—even our humanitarian refugee program—must have integrity. Currently, all those who come by boats take the emphasis away from all those stuck in refugee camps around the world.


I have plenty of refugees in my electorate—plenty of people who have come from Africa, plenty of people who have come from Burma. There are a lot of places in the world where we need to do our best to support refugees and to give people a better life, but the fact that you have money should not matter; your need should matter. I have been to a refugee camp up on the Burma-Thailand border. I have been to a refugee camp and seen the faces of little children who are going to be stuck longer in those refugee camps because this government cannot do the job the Australian people are paying them to do. That is a damn tragedy. Why should the children in refugee camps in Thailand—those Karen and Chin children, those strongly persecuted minority groups—finish second? Why should they be delayed any day longer than they have to be because this government cannot get its priorities right? What about those who know their families are stuck in refugee camps back in Africa and are desperate to get their families out of those circumstances? Why are those people stuck in refugee camps in Africa with no chance of coming here? The answer is that this government has dropped the ball. They created the problem out of the solution that the Howard government had.


I hear this a lot in schools and from the government as well. They talk about the terrible circumstances of those who come by boat and why they want to come here. As I said before, no-one doubts that there are bad circumstances in other countries—in Afghanistan, in the Middle East. No-one doubts that these circumstances are unpleasant and desperate, but it remains a matter of priorities.


I was at a function last year—just upstairs in Parliament House—where there were a lot of refugee advocates. I heard some people questioning the coalition's knowledge of the refugee convention. Article 31 is the main part of the convention that a lot of us think about when we talk about those who come by boat. Article 31 talks about people coming directly. In case there is any doubt that I am trying to paraphrase this, article 31 of the refugee convention prohibits states and parties from imposing penalties on refugees who come:


… directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened … enter or are present in their territory without authorization, provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence.


This is often held up by some as the reason there should be no detention of those who come by boat, but the key part of article 31 is that it talks about people who come directly from a territory. I say to everyone here that, when you talk about directly from Afghanistan, there is a big difference between Afghanistan and Christmas Island or the Australian mainland or Ashmore Reef. You cannot hop on a boat in Kabul—or, in fact, anywhere in Afghanistan—and go to a different country. It is a landlocked country. So none of this 'directly' business comes into it. Those who come from Afghanistan do not move directly to Australia; they would have to go normally through Pakistan and, of course, as we know, hop on a plane. So they would go maybe from Karachi airport or maybe Islamabad airport—I am not sure—and probably then go to Malaysia or to Indonesia. So they wait in that departure lounge and then hop on a plane—maybe they get a meal or something like that—and then they land, maybe even in Jakarta. There is not a lot of directness in these circumstances. It really does bring into question how article 31 of the refugee convention comes into it. There is no moving directly from a territory where their life or freedom is threatened. That does not apply whatsoever. Of course, article 31 also talks about illegal entry.


I cast doubt on the legitimacy of many of those who come by boat to be considered as a refugee under article 31. Despite the fact that the circumstances in their old country are terrible circumstances—there is no doubt about it—it is not like they are coming directly from a threat and landing here. They go through other places where that threat does not apply and yet they still hop on a boat and take the places of those people that I spoke about before: those in refugee camps in Africa or in places like the Burma-Thailand border.


I say again, as I have said so many times in this place in numerous speeches: I might be accused of dog whistling or being a racist or something like that, but the reality is that what this government has done since 2008 when it changed the policies is take the emphasis away from those who are legitimately in need, those who are stuck behind barbed wire in refugee camps around the world, and, instead, give the opportunities through numerous places and through the support systems that they have here to those who come by boat. Under article 31 of the refugee convention I cast doubt on those who come by boat and I certainly cast doubt on their legitimacy to be received here under the humanitarian program in contrast to those who are stuck behind wire. This is an indictment of this government and in September the Australian people will get their chance to pass judgement.

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Attorney-General, Minister for Emergency Management, Minister for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State) (16:43):  by leave—I am pleased today to be able to table two very important reviews on Australia's counterterrorism legislation.


The first review I am tabling is the annual report of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor for 2012. The monitor's role is created by legislation, to review Australia's national security laws and counterterrorism laws on an ongoing basis and determine whether they remain necessary, effective, proportionate and consistent with our international human rights obligations.


In his 2012 report the monitor, Mr Bret Walker SC, examined the definition of a terrorist act, the control order provisions, the preventative detention order regime and ASIO's questioning and detention powers. I thank Mr Walker for the extensive work he has done in compiling this report.


The second review is the Council of Australian Governments review into counterterrorism legislation. In 2005, COAG considered the evolving security environment in the context of the terrorist assaults in London that year and agreed that there was a clear case for strengthening Australia's counterterrorism laws. The Commonwealth government and the states and territories then enacted legislation to better deter and prevent potential acts of terrorism and prosecute them if they occurred. The legislation included control orders, preventative detention orders and certain emergency stop, question and search powers held by police. COAG agreed that they would review the necessity and effectiveness of the new laws after a period of time.


The COAG review committee consisted of six members, including the chair, the Hon. Anthony Whealy QC, a retired judge from the New South Wales Court of Appeal, as well as two accountability members, two law enforcement members and a prosecutorial member. Two of those members were from Commonwealth agencies, the remaining four represented the states and territories. The COAG review committee made 47 recommendations. I thank the review committee, and especially the chair of the committee, the Hon. Anthony Whealy, for the hard work and time they have put into this review.


Both reviews are very thorough and thought provoking. There is some overlap of the provisions that the monitor and the COAG review committee reviewed. However, the monitor only reviewed Commonwealth legislation whereas the COAG review committee reviewed Commonwealth as well as complementary state and territory legislation. With two such detailed reports from two different review processes it is inevitable that there will be differences of perspectives and indeed that is a value of having the two separate processes. These reviews enable governments to better assess the different options available to serve the Australian people. The government values both these reports and serious consideration will be given to them. Given the overlap in recommendations of the reports, the government will be considering both reports together, after consulting with the states and territories.


These reviews were both undertaken as part of the government's commitment to protect Australia, its people and its interests, while instilling confidence that our national security and counterterrorism laws will be administered in a just and accountable way. While these matters are not easily resolved, the matter foremost in my mind is ensuring the security and the freedom of the Australian people. In light of the recent terror attack in Boston, it is clear that it is as important now as it ever was to maintain strong capabilities in the fight against terrorism. Our counterterrorism framework has held us in good stead so far, but we cannot afford to stop being vigilant.


Both reviews will be available online later this afternoon. Mr Deputy Speaker, I present the COAG Review of counter-terrorism legislation and the annual report of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and a copy of my ministerial statement. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Stirling to speak for four minutes.


Leave granted. 




Mr DREYFUS:
  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Keenan speaking for a period not exceeding four minutes.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2013-05-14,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (16:48):  I rise to welcome the Attorney-General's tabling of the annual report of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the Council of Australian Governments Review of counter-terrorism legislation. The coalition looks forward to giving careful consideration to these two documents. The suite of federal, state and territory laws that comprise our counterterrorism regime were controversial at the time when they were introduced and, mercifully, there have only been a few instances in which they have needed to be invoked, at least to their full extent. However, it cannot be denied that the threat of terrorism persists.


I endorse the Attorney-General's observation that, in light of the recent terror attack in Boston, it is clear that the maintenance of our counterterrorism capabilities is as important as it ever was and that, as the Attorney-General also observed, in keeping with our own traditions and way of life, the maintenance of these capabilities must be done in a just and accountable way. That is why in 2005, when the national suite of legislation was enacted by agreement amongst the Commonwealth, the states and the territories, the relevant governments agreed at COAG that the necessity and effectiveness of the laws should be subject to a coordinated review.


The annual report of the independent monitor is particularly welcomed by the coalition. The monitor was established only after a concerted effort on the part of the coalition back when the Rudd government was still young. A bill for the establishment of an independent monitor was introduced by the then member for Kooyong, Petro Georgiou, in early 2008. Mr Georgiou was immediately gagged by the Leader of the House, the member for Grayndler. In the other place an identical bill was introduced, by the then Liberal senator for Victoria Senator Judith Troeth, where it passed despite being opposed by the government. However, the government prevented it from proceeding beyond its first reading in this place. The government finally introduced its own flawed legislation, which only passed the parliament in 2010 after extensive amendment to ensure the monitor's independence. The coalition therefore derives considerable satisfaction from the tabling of the monitor's annual report.


The principle behind the establishment of the independent monitor and the COAG review is the protective principle. It is to add to the armoury of parliamentary surveillance another mechanism designed to ensure that the counterterrorism laws, which were amended so as to expand the executive and policing powers of the state in extraordinary times by introducing into our laws extraordinary measures, are not allowed to become ordinary measures by the passing of time. The government and the parliament were of the view that some traditional protections should be reviewed and the policing functions of the state should be extended through devices such as preventative detention and control orders, which were very controversial at the time, in service of the fundamental obligation of governments and parliaments—that is, to protect the public interest. 


Those of us who remember those debates also remember that the government that introduced them, the Howard government, made it clear that these were extraordinary measures. It is to be hoped that the time comes when these laws are no longer necessary. However, it is clear, as the Attorney-General did observe, that that time is not yet. In the meantime it is appropriate that all Australian governments remain vigilant as to the appropriate use of these laws, and that is why the coalition welcomes the statement here today.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (16:52):  I ask leave of the House to make a statement on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit concerning the draft budget estimates for the Australian National Audit Office and the Parliamentary Budget Office for 2013-14, and also for leave to present a copy of my statement.


Leave granted.




Mr OAKESHOTT:


As the committee responsible for oversight of the Parliamentary Budget Office and the Australian National Audit Office, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit is required by legislation to consider the draft budget estimates for each office with the chair making recommendations to both houses of parliament. Therefore, on budget day each year the committee makes a statement on whether, in its opinion, these offices have been given sufficient funding to carry out their respective mandates of oversight.


In support of this process, both the PBO and the ANAO are empowered through their legislation to disclose to us, as a committee, their draft budget estimates, which the committee then considers in making any representations to government and the two houses. In layman's terms, this is the budget speech for those that are interested in the oversight bodies and their scrutiny powers.


Firstly, the new and welcomed Parliamentary Budget Office: in accordance with the Parliamentary Service Act, the committee received a copy of the PBO's draft budget estimates and met with the Parliamentary Budget Officer in March to review the office's position. The committee has subsequently received an update from the Parliamentary Budget Officer identifying revisions to his estimates.


The Parliamentary Budget Office has had a small level of additional savings allocated to it over the next two years. However, it did receive additional funding to increase its permanent staffing in response to a decision by government to extend the PBO's mandate.


The PBO's total revenue from government will be $10.752 million in 2013-14. The Parliamentary Budget Officer has given assurances to the committee that overall the budget approved for 2013-14 provides the necessary funding for the PBO to operate effectively and meet its legislated mandate. On this basis, the bipartisan Public Accounts and Audit Committee endorses the proposed budget for the Parliamentary Budget Office in 2013-14.


Secondly, the Australian National Audit Office: in accordance with the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act and the Auditor-General Act, the committee received a copy of the Australian National Audit Office draft budget estimates and met with the Auditor-General in February to review these estimates. The committee has subsequently received updates from the Auditor-General identifying revisions to his estimates.


The Auditor-General's funding proposals were made in the context of considerable cost pressures. To place the Audit Office on a more sustainable footing, the Auditor-General advised the committee that he had sought modest supplementation in the 2013-14 budget: firstly, to fund the auditing of financial statements for newly created government entities, which is a statutory requirement of the Auditor-General; and secondly, to fund the continuation of a pilot audit of agency key performance indicators using powers given to the Auditor-General in 2011 following a recommendation by the Public Accounts and Audit Committee.


In response, the committee has been advised that in today's budget: (1) the Audit Office will be receiving some $0.7 million to cover additional financial statement workload in 2013-14 and no additional funding has been provided for the forward years, but the Audit Office has been requested to develop a longer term funding arrangement for consideration by government; (2) the Audit Office has not received the requested supplementation for its KPI initiatives—however, it has been given the opportunity to bring back the proposal in the 2014-15 budget process; and (3) finally, targeted savings measures will result in a reduction to the Audit Office's annual appropriation over the forward years.


The Audit Office's total revenue from government is $74.965 million in 2013-14. The Auditor-General has advised that while this appropriation is not as much as was requested, with the help of prior surpluses, it is sufficient for him to discharge his statutory obligations and his work program for the year ahead. On this basis, the committee endorses the proposed budget for the Audit Office in 2013-14 and recommends its passage.


However, the committee is strongly concerned about the level of funding uncertainty for the forward years. As it stands, the Auditor-General has indicated that the Audit Office will need to reduce its work program in the forward years unless new funding is provided in next year's budget.


The Audit Office is unable to reduce its financial statement audit work because of its mandatory nature and the need to adhere to professional standards. Proportional funding increases need to be provided as new entities are created. It is highly unusual that in this budget no funding has been set aside for the audit of new entities in the out-years. This sets a concerning precedent for future budgets.


The committee notes the government's request for the Auditor-General to develop options for longer term funding arrangements for new agency financial audits, and strongly encourages the results of this work to be seriously considered by government.


The committee will also closely monitor funding provided to implement a full audit work program for key performance indicators in the 2014-15 budget, informed by the outcomes of the current pilot project. The Audit Office has indicated that a broader KPI audit framework will not be able to be funded from its existing resource base.


The bipartisan Public Accounts and Audit Committee therefore recommends that steps be taken in next year's budget to place the Audit Office on a more financially sustainable footing to ensure that its essential work in scrutinising government processes and expenditure is properly resourced.


In conclusion, the committee is concerned about the increasing pressures being placed on both the PBO and the ANAO. Both agencies only received partial funding for their extended mandates. On top of this, additional savings measures have been applied that further reduce the available funding. As independent authorities, both the PBO and the ANAO need to be sufficiently funded to fulfil their legislative requirements and adequately support the work of this parliament. It is also incumbent on all members of this chamber, regardless of political persuasion, to support the independence of these statutory offices by ensuring that their work is not misrepresented in public forums.


The committee appreciates the efforts of both the Parliamentary Budget Officer and the Auditor-General in maintaining strong working relationships across the parliament and particularly with the Public Accounts and Audit Committee. They have made themselves available for regular briefings and have been responsive to requests for information on a variety of topics. The committee looks forward to continuing these productive relationships. I present a copy of my statement on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit.

The committee also recommends that the Treasury undertake further consultation with industry groups on an aspect of schedule 5 of the bill.


There are eight schedules in the bill. The committee did not receive any submissions on schedules 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8. The report focuses on issues raised in the other schedules—1, 5 and 6. Schedule 1 defines a 'documentary' for the purpose of accessing film tax offsets and makes explicit that game shows are not eligible programs. Currently, there is no definition of a documentary in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. The definition of 'documentary' to be inserted is based on the Australian Communications and Media Authority Guidelines, as was used by Screen Australia prior to the Lush House case. In the committee's view, it is a reasonable response by the Australian government to reinstate the definition that Screen Australia had previously used in administering the producer offset. The committee noted industry stakeholder concerns that the definition lacks flexibility. The committee believes there is a need for ongoing dialogue between Screen Australia and the industry to ensure that the application of the definition in schedule 1 remains responsive to the evolving documentary genre.


Schedule 2 exempts from income tax the ex-gratia payment made to people affected by natural disasters in Australia during June 2011-12 and 2012-13. It is warranted to extend these disaster assistance plan payments and their tax exempt status to New Zealand citizens holding non-protected special category visas who were affected by these disasters.


Schedule 3 enables eligible businesses to continue to pay GST instalments if they subsequently move into a net refund position. It will allow businesses to continue to make their business activity statements annually and retain the cost advantage of not having to submit a quarterly statement. Entities that are not paying GST by instalments and are already in a net refund position remain ineligible to use the instalment option.


Schedule 4 adds six entities to the list of deductible gift recipients, making donations to these organisations tax deductible. Schedule 5 will provide a legislative basis for identifying and merging multiple superannuation accounts within the same fund. Many super funds are already performing these mergers. Groups who participated in the inquiry supported the intent of schedule 5 to reduce the amount affected members pay in multiple sets of administration fees and insurance premiums and consequently increase retirement savings.


However, some industry groups expressed concern that the wording of the proposed subsection 108A(1)(c) could place undue liability on trustees by obligating them to examine each individual member's best interests rather than on a general trust fiduciary law basis, which is understood as acting in the collective best interests of members. The committee's view is that schedule 5 is making an important change to help super members maximise their retirement savings but recommends further Treasury consultation with industry groups to ensure that undue liability is not being inadvertently placed on trustees who are working in good faith for the benefit of their members. The committee also urges the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to provide funds with guidance on circumstances which should trigger individual consideration of what constitutes a member's 'best interests'. Where funds are dealing with complex cases, the committee believes trustees should seek input from the affected members.

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (17:06):  by leave—I will be brief. In terms of additional comments to the committee report, coalition members of the committee raised some concerns we had with respect to two schedules of the bill. In broad brushstrokes—and with emphasis on the word 'broad'—coalition members would agree with a number of the assertions made by the committee chair but, specifically with respect to schedule 1, coalition members felt it necessary to highlight that it was very clear there had been for all intents and purposes no consultation with industry with respect to the proposed changes as outlined in this schedule 1. Whether it was SPAA, the Screen Producers Association of Australia, or others that appeared on the day, it was clear that the first they really knew about it, the first opportunity that industry had with respect to the proposed changes, was when the draft bill itself had been put into the public domain. It would appear they took the view that it was, for all intents and purposes, a foregone conclusion. Coalition members highlight the fact that this is hardly the way to conduct good public policy and on that basis made some comments in our additional comments. 


Schedule 6 is the super co-contributions. The reality is—and coalition members believe Australians recognise this but we want to highlight the fact—that the Gillard Labor government is again seeking to cut government super co-contribution benefits for low-income earners. As much as the Labor Party like to make out that they are a friend of low-income earners, the simple reality is that there have been so many changes on so many occasions that now it is clear that they are far from being a friend.


After promising not to make any changes to superannuation in the lead-up to the 2007 election there have been, in fact, numerous changes invariably designed to undermine incentives for people to voluntarily save more toward their retirement. As well as reducing the concessional contribution caps, the government has cut super co-contribution benefits for low-income earners and imposed additional taxes of more than $8 billion on people's retirement. They have reduced concessional contribution caps from $50,000 and $100,000 per year, depending on your age, under the previous coalition government down to $25,000 per year across the board—a substantial reduction. This means anyone wanting to save more super per year than that low threshold has to pay the top marginal tax rate. 


Targeting low-income earners saving for their retirement, Labor has also already reduced super co-contribution benefits for low-income earners from a maximum of $1,500 down to $1,000, while also reducing the matching rate from 1.5 down to one to one. This legislation proposes to cut the maximum super co-contribution benefit for low-income earners again, this time in half, down to just $500,with a similarly reduced matching rate halved from one to one down to 0.5 to one. Overall, the Labor government has cut super co-contribution benefits for low-income earners by more than $3.3 billion by far. 


In summary, coalition members want to highlight and make very quickly on the record that this is not a government that is committed to low-income earners, despite all the rhetoric to the contrary. The simple and inescapable conclusion to reach is that, beyond the headlines, this legislation is going to make it tougher for low-income earners, not easier.

Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (20:01):  I move:


That this bill be read a second time.



Appropriation Bill (No.


2) 2013-2014, together with Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2013-2014, is a principal bill underpinning the government's budget.


This bill proposes appropriations for agencies to:


make payments to the states, territories and local government;


make payments tocertainCommonwealth authorities and companies;


meet requirements for departmental equity injections; and


meet requirements to create or acquire administered assets and to discharge administered liabilities.


The bill seeks approval for appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of just over $4.8 billion. I will now outline six of the more significant amounts. 


First, the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy would, will receive approximately $1.3 billion to contribute equity to NBN Co Limited to allow the continuation of the rollout of the National Broadband Network. 


Second, AusAID, the Australian Agency for International Development, will receive approximately $604 million. The majority of this amount is to provide for Australia's contribution towards the 17th replenishment of the International Development Association, which is part of the World Bank. Australia's contribution will allow the International Development Association to provide loans and grants for programs that enhance economic growth, reduce inequalities, and improve living conditions in low-income countries.


Third, the Department of Defence will receive an equity injection of approximately $683 million to enable the purchase of military equipment and the construction of support facilities, as announced in the 2013 Defence White Paper.


Fourth, the bill will provide the Department of Infrastructure and Transport with approximately $383 million for the Roads to Recovery program under which funds are distributed to local councils, and state and territory governments responsible for local roads in areas where there are no councils. 


Fifth, the Department of Finance and Deregulation will receive an equity injection of approximately $318 million. This relates mainly to three matters:


the relocation of Department of Defence facilities from the Moorebank Intermodal Terminal site in Western Sydney to a purpose-built facility through the development of the Holsworthy Barracks;


the construction of a new facility for the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service to safely monitor the importation of animals and plant material before release into Australia; and


the redevelopment of the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre to meet current standards for design and fit-out of immigration detention facilities.


Sixth, the government will provide the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry with $210 million for the provision of concessional loans under the Farm Finance initiative. The loans are for viable agricultural businesses for the purpose of productivity enhancements and debt financing. 


All the appropriations in Appropriation Bill (No.2) 2013-2014 are other than for the ordinary annual services of the government. 


Debate adjourned.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2013-05-14,"



Mr Albanese:
  The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:


I am aware that there have been calls from some in the Deaf community for access to emergency services to be available by Short Message Service (SMS). I understand that currently, people who are deaf, hearing and/or speech impaired who use text based communication can access emergency services via the National Relay Service (NRS) using a teletypewriter (TTY) to connect to 106, or using internet relay to connect to Triple Zero. 


On 8 February 2013, I issued a media release announcing that the Government had delivered an improved NRS, including mobile text-based access to emergency services for people who are deaf, hearing-impaired and/or speech-impaired. New contracts have been signed with existing providers Australian Communication Exchange and WestWood Spice to deliver a new and improved NRS from 1 July 2013. 


One of the new services to be implemented progressively in the second half of 2013 will be SMS Relay which will allow access to Triple Zero via text to the NRS for people who are deaf, or who are hearing-impaired and/or speech impaired. Some of the new services, including SMS Relay, require regulatory change and I have directed my department to immediately begin work on these changes and engage with the disability sector in their development. 


The new contracts have achieved the Government's objective of ensuring that existing NRS services are maintained, and that new services are introduced that enhance the NRS for the deaf, hearing-impaired and/or speech-impaired communities.
