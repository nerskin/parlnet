"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2008-06-24,"—It is very important that people understand the concerns surrounding the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (Assessments and Advertising) Bill 2008 that have been brought to us by a number of groups, including the ACL. There are concerns that we are starting to move towards self-regulation of the industry and, in so doing, are opening up potential loopholes for people who have the capacity to put themselves in positions in relation to classifications that may not reflect the true aspirations of the community.
There are strong concerns held about this area, and I think that as we go forward we need to make sure that we keep in contact especially with families who have seen the problems that can occur when there is endorsement by the public of a certain classification and the issues that can arise for certain members of the community who can be affected. We are affected by what we see and what we hear, and we see classifications as an endorsement of a community’s view about how they see a certain issue. We also note that the views and self-assessment of someone who has a vested interest in getting a media product such as a publication, a film or a computer game out into the public may not be the same as the community’s views when that product actually arrives out in the public. So what is going to be a mechanism that will truly take it back to a reflection of the family’s view of how these things should be classified?
This bill increases the exposure of minors to violent and graphic adult material in the interests of advertising and industry profiteering. The safeguards to the bill include industry assurances that organisations will act responsibly and in compliance with the scheme; however, there is a question about the validity of these assurances should profits ever be threatened. Schedule 1 of the bill contains amendments to the current advertising arrangements. The current prohibitions are considered to unduly restrict advertising because, due to the risk of piracy, products are held back from classification until very close to their release date. The intention is to create a regime under which the likely classification of a product is assessed in advance for the purposes of advertising. Exposure to the advertising will be restricted to the appropriate classification level. However, we have always got the issue of the juxtaposition between what the market deems appropriate and what the community believes is appropriate to maintain some structure and control over what their families—especially children—are exposed to. This is why, especially in today’s arena, we possibly need to be a little bit more vigilant about this bill.
The growth of the computer games industry is driven by technological advances. However, the proposed scheme can be reviewed only in three years time. This is not in line with the speed of technology and leaves a question as to the speed at which schemes will date. The American Psychological Association has concluded that scientific evidence shows a cause-and-effect relationship between television and computer game violence and aggression in children. Children are more likely to affiliate with and imitate the actions of the character with whom they identify: in computer games this is often the shooter, the wielder of weapons or the driver of out-of-control vehicles. This indicates a requirement for strict regulations to ensure that materials of a violent nature are not viewed by minors or inappropriate audiences.
Research also indicates that exposure to violent computer games increases aggressive thoughts, emotions and actions amongst children. That comes from a study by Anderson and Bushman, Effects of violent video games on aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal and prosocial behavior: a meta-analytic review of the scientific literature. The quality of graphics is such that the violence depicted in some computer games matches the quality of that seen in movies. This makes it very hard for children to differentiate between fact and fiction. We are affected by what we see; we are affected by what we hear.
In 2006, sales of computer and video game hardware and software in Australia exceeded $1 billion. Australians purchase 12.5 million computer and video games each year. A survey of popular Sega and Nintendo games taken a few years ago found that 80 per cent of them primarily featured violence or aggression. According to Bushman and Huesmann of the University of Michigan, the effect of media violence on aggressive behaviours is nearly as great as the effect of smoking on lung cancer.
The University of Michigan study also reports that playing violent video games actually changes brain function. Chronic players are desensitised to real life violence. Desensitising reduces emotional responses to repeated stimulus. We have seen this in our own country, especially in the intervention, and that is why we try to get unrated and X-rated material away from children. We do not want these children desensitised. We know that it is a form of reprogramming of those children. There is nothing more insidious, I feel, than to see four- and five-year-old kids being open to pornography that—to be brutally honest—might involve animals and a whole range of things.
We have to always be aware of what this does to a child’s brain, regardless of the colour of their skin, and the desensitising effects that forms of media can be responsible for. We have to try to always make sure that we have got unaffected kids and quiet streets. The ways to deliver that are not just through security but also through the formation of the child, the formation of the person. What children see through their surroundings as the norm is important, but what is more important is what they see endorsed by the community as the norm. If they are not receiving those meters, mechanisms and indicators from their immediate family then at least the community should endorse what is acceptable and what is unacceptable.
I believe strongly that self-regulation is a move away from that. We should not allow that. We should be making sure we have a clear mechanism that provides our nation with the community values that we hold. This should not be done through a self-regulating body, which has an inherent self-interest in making sure that what makes them money gets out in the community rather than what is appropriate.
I know that there is a belief that this bill is non-controversial. Distributors have a good idea what the classification will be and do not provide advance copies of the work to avoid piracy issues. I understand the issues around this. This bill is not going to create a lot of interest today—I note that there are only three speakers on it.
—There are five.
—I take the interjection—five. This legislation is something that I think we should give a little more attention to prior to it going forward.",SENATE,"<title>CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) AMENDMENT (ASSESSMENTS AND ADVERTISING) BILL 2008</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2008-06-24,"—This debate on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (Assessments and Advertising) Bill 2008 is taking place during a time when it is possible to have divisions or move amendments. We are not in a non-controversial period of the session. So if fellow senators do have objections or suggestions for changing the legislation before us, they can do so, regardless of the level of interest to date or, indeed, even the number of people on the speakers list. I might add—for Senator Joyce—that I thought it was three as well, but it has just grown in the last few moments. At any given time in this place—and I put this on record—there are usually only three or four speakers on a piece of legislation, sometimes not even that. Given it is our last week here as Australian Democrats, I note that nearly every bill in this place sees a Democrat speaker to that legislation, regardless of whether it is controversial or not.
In this case, the government will be pleased to see that the Democrats are supporting the legislation before us. In many respects, it is a pretty mechanical sort of bill, for lack of a better description. I rise again for the penultimate contribution—or maybe the third to last time—as the Australian Democrats Attorney-General spokesperson to speak to this bill.
This bill implements a number of amendments to the National Classification Scheme, some directly and some via the development of separate legislative instruments. I acknowledge there has been, among some of us in this place, a concern about the increase in delegated legislation for some time. I suspect that might be something for those with concerns, particularly for the speaker before me, that disallowable instruments can be disallowed. If there is concern with delegated legislation that may flow from such legislation, there are opportunities in the Senate to tackle those issues.
Complimentary state and territory legislation currently prohibits the advertising of films and computer games before they are classified. However, exemptions can be granted by the Classification Board to allow for advertising prior to classification for public exhibition films. We have probably all seen this in practice when an advertisement for a major cinema release is accompanied by that familiar disclaimer stating: ‘This film has advertising approval. Check the classification closer to the release date.’ However, exemptions are not available for other films, including DVDs, videos, compilations of TV series, or computer games. In practice this means that new DVDs or games that are yet to be released in Australia cannot be advertised. This clearly creates an inequality between major cinema release films and other products.
Schedule 1 of the bill rectifies this inequality. It provides for a new legislative instrument that allows for the creation of a new advertising scheme for unclassified films and computer games. An industry self-assessment scheme will be created whereby trained and authorised assessors are able to make an assessment of the likely classification of a film or computer game for the purpose of advertising that film or computer game before it has been classified.
Oversight of decisions by authorised assessors will be provided by the Classification Board as a safeguard. Authorised assessors may be barred from using the scheme by the Director of the Classification Board if the scheme is being abused. In addition, unclassified films and computer games will only be advertised with classified films or computer games of the same or higher level—for example, trailers on DVDs, and trailers or demos on computer games, which means that likely PG films are only to be advertised with films classified with a PG or higher rating et cetera. I think—and the Democrats believe—this is an important safeguard to ensure that people are not inadvertently exposed to potentially offensive material. We take on board Senator Joyce’s concerns in that regard.
Schedule 2 of the bill will enable the establishment of a scheme for the classification of films that are episodes of a television series. A trained and authorised person will be able to provide a report and a recommendation to the Classification Board to assist them in their classification of a box set of episodes of a television series. The Classification Board will retain responsibility for classifying the film. So, again, the Classification Board essentially reigns supreme.
Schedule 2 is designed to streamline and reduce the cost to industry of the classification scheme as it relates to TV series. It will also introduce a new requirement that at least one of the episodes in a series box set has been broadcast in Australia in recognition of the fact that many series produced and broadcast overseas will never be broadcast in full in Australia. This will allow producers and distributors to obtain a classification while the series is being broadcast so that it can be released for sale during or at the end of the season.
The idea is that the cumbersome nature of the existing classification scheme will not prevent producers and distributors from advertising and selling their products, thereby preventing them from being beaten to the punch by internet downloads and illegal piracy activities. The Democrats understand that these reforms are generated by industry concerns that the classification scheme is cumbersome, costly and does not keep up with technological developments that allow virtually instant access to films and games when they are released. As such, we will support the amendments.
However, the Democrats recognise that there is a risk that a move towards greater industry self-regulation when it comes to classification could undermine the integrity of the classification scheme if important safeguards are not maintained. We think that today this bill strikes an appropriate balance between creating a more streamlined and user-friendly classification system and maintaining high standards for classification.
In relation to advertisements for unclassified films, the Director of the Classification Board can call in any advertisement that has been inappropriately assessed, and disciplinary action can be taken against assessors. In relation to TV series, the board will retain ultimate responsibility for classification but will be informed by industry assessments. However, given that the bill leaves a significant amount of detail to be provided via legislative instrument—to which I referred in my opening remarks—I think it is important that the parliament keeps a close eye on, and a close interest in, further developments in this area, including, if need be, by disallowing any regulations which are not up to scratch.
Just on that parting note, as I have said during my time in this place and over the years that I have watched the parliament, there has been an increase—I think, Acting Deputy President Watson you are smiling knowingly; I am not sure—in the amount of delegated legislation that comes here. That is all right provided there are some accountability provisions through the parliament—that is, you can disallow—but I think there is a very strong argument for some things, which are almost shunted off to a disallowance framework or delegated legislation, to be enshrined in legislation: in the specifics of bills with which we deal. But today the Democrats will be supporting the legislation before us.",SENATE,"<title>CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) AMENDMENT (ASSESSMENTS AND ADVERTISING) BILL 2008</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2008-06-24,"—The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (Assessments and Advertising) Bill 2008 is, in substance, a legacy bill and it has the support of the opposition. The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (Advertising and Other Matters) Bill 2007 was introduced into the 41st parliament on 22 March 2007. The 2007 bill was referred to the Main Committee for the second reading debate and returned to the House of Representatives without amendment on 9 August 2007. The bill had not been passed, and lapsed when the parliament was prorogued in October 2007. The bill before the chamber has been introduced in the same form as the 2007 bill with one minor drafting change in schedule 2.
Senator Joyce raised a concern about the degree of scrutiny which had been given to this bill. Might I reassure Senator Joyce that the predecessor bill, which in all material respects this bill is identical to, received very close scrutiny by the former Attorney-General, the Hon. Phillip Ruddock, and by the coalition’s policy committee and party-room processes—hence the decision of the opposition to support the bill, as you would expect given it was germinated by the previous government.
The bill replaces the prohibition on advertising unclassified films and computer games with a new scheme to allow advertising, subject to conditions, and amends the classification procedures for compilations of episodes of a television series, subject to conditions. Both of those reforms were generated in discussion with the industry. The bill aims to streamline the classification process and reduce the regulatory burden on industry. Like Senator Stott Despoja, the opposition believes that the bill strikes an appropriate balance between self-regulation and necessary safeguards.
Schedule 1 of the bill amends the definition of advertisement to clarify that it includes advertising on the internet and excludes product merchandising and clothing products. Additionally, schedule 1 deals with the current prohibition that is considered to unduly restrict advertising because, due to the risk of piracy, products are held back from classification until very close to their release date. The intention is to create a regime under which the likely classification of a product is assessed in advance for the purposes of advertising. Schedule 1 will also amend the act to ensure that unclassified films and computer games are advertised with classified films or computer games of the same or higher level of classification. This amendment also reinforces the existing policy that the Classification Board must not approve an advertisement for a film or computer game that is or is likely to be classified RC, or ‘refused classification’.
Proposed subsection 31(1) is the key provision. It enables the Attorney-General to make a legislative instrument that determines the conditions for advertising unclassified films and computer games and provides for an industry self-assessment scheme of the likely classification of unclassified films and computer games. The section is notably broad in scope. The amendments in section 2 which relate to films of television series are intended to streamline the classification process for boxed compilations of episodes of television series.
I hear and share the observations of both Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Joyce about the importance of ensuring that there are appropriate safeguards where, particularly in this area of policy, legislative reform moves in the direction of self-regulation. The former government was satisfied—and I note the new government is satisfied—that the appropriate safeguards have been incorporated into the legislation and a proper balance has been struck.",SENATE,"<title>CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) AMENDMENT (ASSESSMENTS AND ADVERTISING) BILL 2008</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2008-06-24,"—The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (Assessments and Advertising) Bill 2008 has a couple of aims, which are to allow advertising of unclassified films and computer games and to allow the industry more influence in the classification of boxed sets of DVDs of programs broadcast on television. Family First is concerned that some of the changes in the bill seem to undermine the involvement of the Classification Board in what otherwise would be its day-to-day work. That is why Family First took this legislation out of non-controversial into controversial—to ensure that there was greater scrutiny of this bill going forward. It was Family First who brought it out of the non-controversial into controversial.
Family First is not aware of any public debate on increasing the industry’s involvement in classification. But Family First is concerned about the effectiveness of industry self-regulation in areas likes this where there is a commercial incentive to push the regulatory boundaries. Television classifiers are always under pressure to squeeze the programs they have into a commercially advantageous timeslot. It would not help a television network to have spent big money on a television series but not be able to maximise its viewers because the rating given to the program forced it into a later timeslot. That is just commercial reality.
Last year, the policy function of the Office of Film and Literature Classification, OFLC, was merged into the Attorney-General’s Department, and the Classification Board is now confined to classification work. Family First has had concerns in the past about some of the work by the OFLC and it is hopeful that an office in the Attorney-General’s Department might be more accountable to the public through the minister than the old system. But Family First does not want to move from a system that is accountable to the public to a system of increasing industry self-regulation, which is less accountable to the public. As far as Family First is aware, there is no resource problem with the Classification Board being able to do its work of being an independent classifier of films and computer games. Family First would be concerned if this were part of a move to shift more and more responsibility to the industry in a bid to marginalise or get rid of the Classification Board over time.
The bill makes changes to the current system for advertising films. It formalises a system whereby the industry assesses the classification of films so they can advertise well in advance of formal classification by the Classification Board. The industry has a quota of films where that can happen, but this bill opens the system up completely. Family First is concerned about the advertising of yet-to-be-classified films—that is, films that have not been classified, on the grounds that, when the industry determines a preliminary film classification and gets it wrong and the content of the trailer is inappropriate, children can be confronted by an ad classified at a higher classification than the film they actually came to see.
There was a move under the coalition government last year to loosen regulation on the film industry’s advertising of yet-to-be-classified films. I understand the industry was concerned that the final cut of films was often not received until late, which made it difficult to get films classified fast enough to advertise them. It was argued that the industry knew the content of the films better, so they could make an advance assessment of the likely film classification. But allowing industry a free hand on this does risk cinema audiences seeing, for example, violence at a higher level than the film will eventually be classified at. In the case that classification is inaccurate, it could involve exposing children to violent material.
The bill also makes changes to how boxed DVD sets are classified. Family First does not agree with the legislation allowing industry classifiers to recommend the classification of boxed sets of TV programs on DVD. There have been a number of examples of how the industry and the classification body are in disagreement on the appropriate classification for particular films. For example, some cartoon series, like Transformers or Power Rangers, have been broadcast on TV as G-rated but when sold on DVD the Office of Film and Literature Classification classified them as PG. The Line of Beauty TV series was screened on TV as an M-rated program but when it was classified by the Classification Board it was given a rating of MA15+ for the box set. It was the same story for Robin Hood, which was screened on ABC-TV as PG but sold on DVD as an M-rated box set. The series The War was screened on television on Sunday afternoons as PG but classified by the board as M for a box set. This is despite the TV and DVD versions not differing significantly.
If passed, this bill would give extra weight to recommendations made by the industry classifiers which may well be based on the classification used by the TV network that screened the program. Family First is not anti-industry but recognises that the industry has different motives from the government regulator’s. Industry classifiers are under pressure to classify programs so that they fit into the broadcast times that their employer wants. There will always be the temptation to stretch the boundaries. The Classification Board has expertise and resources independent of such pressures. On a positive note, it is a good and positive step that the legislation will stop the advertising of PG films with G-rated films. There has been some concern about the trailers, sometimes screened as advertising during kids’ films, which have contained material inappropriate for children.
Family First will be moving amendments in the committee stage to make sure that the classification system is not further undermined by allowing unclassified films to be advertised. Family First will also move an amendment to stop giving the industry greater role in the classification of box sets and TV programs when they go to DVD.",SENATE,"<title>CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) AMENDMENT (ASSESSMENTS AND ADVERTISING) BILL 2008</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2008-06-24,"—The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (Assessments and Advertising) Bill 2008 will streamline the classification process for, as we have heard, TV box sets, film and computer games and reduce a regulatory burden on the industry. The policy initiatives contained in this bill will benefit industry while continuing to protect the interests of consumers. Senator Fielding and Senator Joyce in particular should note that this bill does continue to protect the interests of consumers. The bill includes a raft of safeguards and sanctions to protect the integrity of the National Classification Scheme. Australian families can continue to rely on classification information to make informed entertainment choices for themselves and for those for whom they care.
I thank the various senators who have made a contribution to this debate today and concur with both Senator Brandis and Senator Stott Despoja that this bill has had considerable scrutiny and discussion in the Liberal Party and National Party party rooms, and also considerable consultation with industry, so I think it was a little naughty for Senator Joyce to suggest that there was not enough scrutiny of this bill. Senator Joyce expressed some concern about the impact of new media on children and on families. Senator Joyce and I are probably about the same age and in our home when I turned 13 there was black-and-white television. Things have changed considerably in that time. We have had to deal with enormous changes and to manage a classification system that continues to protect our children and ourselves from inappropriate and unwanted media. As Senator Brandis said, this bill does in fact find that line between protection of children in particular and facilitating an important industry that is operational in Australia. I do believe that Senator Joyce’s concerns are heartfelt, but we need to ensure that fear of new media does not overcome the need to protect our children.
I thank Senator Stott Despoja for her reasoned contribution and support for this legislation and I take this opportunity to acknowledge her work in this area over many, many years. I also thank Senator Brandis for the history of the passage of this legislation, both in the previous parliament and in this parliament. I think that that reinforces the level of scrutiny that the bill has had.
I note that Senator Fielding is intending to move some amendments, which we have just received, during this debate. We will address the contents of those amendments during the committee stage. Senator Fielding talked about the treatment of compilation box sets compared to how they are treated in a classification sense on television. The assessment of content for direct television broadcast does not translate directly to a classification under the Classification Act. Content of all television series is assessed before being broadcast under the television codes of practice. The TV codes of practice do not pick up the full scope of the principles contained in the Classification Act, the National Classification Code and the classification guidelines. Classification criteria for content under television codes of practice are similar but not identical to the National Classification Scheme. I hope that answers the question that you asked.
The classification of a television program received for broadcast will not be a factor in determining the appropriate classification for a box set of episodes of a television series under the new television series assessment scheme. Under the television series assessment scheme, industry assessors will make a recommendation based on the presence of any of the six classifiable elements and the impact of each of the classifiable elements. The six classifiable elements are: themes, sex, language, nudity, violence and drug use. Under the television series assessment scheme, the final decision will remain with the Classification Board. I hope that addresses some of the concerns that Senator Fielding raised.
The bill contains the first package of reforms that will allow films and computer games to be advertised before they are classified, subject to conditions. The new advertising scheme responds to industry concerns that the current advertising framework for unclassified materials is cumbersome and outdated. The increased risk of piracy and rapid advances in technology have led to products only being available for classification very close to their release date. The current system therefore causes difficulties for the marketing of films and computer games. It is no longer viable to prohibit the advertising of unclassified material but provide exemptions for some cinema release films. It is more equitable to permit cinema release and DVD or video films and computer games to be advertised on an equal footing in advance of classification, provided certain conditions are met.
The bill will also put in place a new scheme for compilations of episodes of a television series that has been broadcast in Australia. The purpose of these amendments is to reduce the cost to industry and the processing time for the Classification Board when television series are released for sale or hire.
The television series scheme has been designed to ensure that improvements in efficiency and the reduction of costs do not occur at the expense of consumer confidence in classification processes. The bulk of the advertising and television series self-assessment schemes will be contained in legislative instruments to be made by the Minister for Home Affairs, following consultation with state and territory censorship ministers. This will ensure that these aspects of the National Classification Scheme can remain flexible and responsive. This bill was developed in response to issues raised by industry, while continuing to ensure the integrity of the National Classification Scheme. It makes sensible changes to classification practices, in recognition of the rapidly changing technological environment of entertainment media.
Question agreed to.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2008-06-24,"—I now want to make some remarks on behalf of the opposition about the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008. There were six schedules in the original bill when it was first introduced into the Senate and those who follow these things closely could be forgiven for losing track of where these various measures went. The opposition made it clear that we had no objection to the non-controversial elements of the original bill—that is, schedules 2 to 6. We did however have significant concerns about the effects, both intended and unintended, of the schedule 1 measure to end the tax-deductibility of donations to political parties.
For this reason, the coalition referred the original schedule 1 to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. We believe that such an important measure that will affect the operation of democracy in this country ought to have been further scrutinised. Unfortunately, despite the significance of this matter, Labor did try to rush through the measure without due scrutiny, and I will comment on what we regard as their motives for doing so shortly. However, the Senate referred this measure to the committee. Not wanting to hold up the other worthwhile measures in the original bill, the opposition supported the government’s move to add schedules 2 to 6 to the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 2) Bill 2008 as amendments, and that of course was debated and passed last week.
Now that the committee has reported, we are here to discuss the measure in schedule 1. What a pity it is that Labor used its numbers on the committee to produce what I think has to be a very, shall we say, incomplete or perhaps even biased committee report—perhaps one of the most biased committee reports that I have seen in my time in this place. This bill provides that, from 1 July 2008, there will be no tax deduction for membership fees of political parties and gifts and contributions to political parties—for example, moneys paid to attend fundraisers.
In June 2006, the coalition government increased the deduction limit for these payments made by an individual from $100 to $1,500. Companies were allowed to claim a deduction for up to $100; previously no specific deduction had been allowed. Even though these measures have had positive impacts on democratic participation, the Labor government, for what can only be described as cynical motives, wants to reverse them and end tax-deductibility for political donations. I note that the government does not propose to end tax-deductibility for donations or membership fees paid to a trade union. Significantly, in the past on a number of occasions, the ALP has put on the record its support for tax-deductibility of political donations. In its submission to the JSCEM report on the 1987 election and 1989 referendums, the ALP claimed:
… the additional funds raised by political parties with tax-deductibility advantage would alleviate any pressure for increased levels of public funding, would encourage political parties to continue to seek direct support from the public and would help them more adequately fulfil their social functions.
On 19 December 1991, the House of Representatives, under the then Hawke government, voted along party lines to introduce tax-deductibility of up to $100 for political donations to parties. The Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991, assented to on 19 December, gave effect to the introduction of tax-deductibility of political donations of up to $100. The bill was introduced by the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Kim Beazley.
The ALP in government, making up the majority of the JSCEM, had nothing to say about the issue of tax-deductibility of contributions to political parties in the reports on the 1990 election and the 1993 election. In the JSCEM report on the 1996 election, a recommendation was included to make donations of up to $1,500 annually to a political party, whether from an individual or a corporation, tax-deductible. In the report on the 1996 election, the ALP nominated $1,500 as the maximum amount for tax-deductibility. The JSCEM report on the 1996 election was unanimous in recommending that
… donations to a political party of up to $1,500 annually, whether from an individual or a corporation, would be tax-deductible.
Membership of the 1997 JSCEM, which unanimously recommended tax-deductibility for donations of up to $1,500 from both individuals and corporations, included none other than Senator Stephen Conroy, the deputy chair of that committee; Mr Robert McClelland MP, who is now the Attorney-General; and Mr Laurie Ferguson MP, who is now a parliamentary secretary. So two cabinet ministers and one parliamentary secretary of the current government recommended at that time that the current regime for tax-deductibility of political contributions be adopted.
The minister claims that schedule 1 was a commitment made as part of Labor’s $3 billion savings plan, which was announced on 2 March 2007. Let us examine that. I believe this is trivial compared with the potential damage done to democratic participation by this reckless and ill-considered change. While the cost to democracy cannot be accurately measured, the cost to the taxpayer can be. Treasury estimates that the measures contained in the bill will save $31.4 million over four years to 2011-12, commencing in 2009-10. These costings comprise two components: party membership fees and donations. According to Treasury officials, the membership component of the costing is $4.3 million each year. Of course, there are a lot of assumptions in these figures. Treasury, I think it is fair to say, could not possibly have known, because it does not have accurate information about the number of members of political parties or accurate data on which to base its assumptions. Also, Treasury presumably does not have access to data on how many political party members even make a claim for tax deduction of their party membership. So any claim about budget savings should be measured against Treasury making a lot of assumptions and being absolutely unaware of how many political party members claim a tax deduction.
Likewise, as the coalition noted in its minority report, ‘Treasury had no knowledge of the amount or value of donations of less than $1,500’—which is the subject of this bill. Treasury has derived an estimate based on a series of assumptions to arrive at a figure. While coalition members of the committee do not doubt the internal logic of Treasury’s reasoning—it is very clever at making these kinds of assumptions—nevertheless, they conclude, ‘The result is totally arbitrary, as it relies completely on the reliability of the base data,’ which in this case was non-existent. No doubt later, during this debate, we will hear comments being made that failure to agree to this bill will have negative effects on the budget outcome. Some rather amazing claims seem to be coming from the government—for example, that raising taxes will reduce inflation. So it will be interesting to see Labor try to claim that opposing the removal of this tax deduction will cause inflation.
However, one thing is clear. That is that all the bleating from the government about budget savings is really rhetoric. The government has absolutely no idea of what the cost of this policy is. It is quite clear that this is a major change to campaign finance in Australia. What strikes me as odd is that a major change in campaign finance was placed in a schedule in a tax law amendment omnibus bill; political donations are quite clearly an electoral matter. If the government is so concerned with campaign finance reform—let us call it what it is; I think it is a rather worthy reform, I might add—why isn’t it including it as part of a reform or proposed reform of electoral matters?
The deductibility of political donations is entwined with the proper and effective functioning of Australia’s democratic and electoral processes. It is an issue that has been repeatedly considered by JSCEM in the context of reporting on the conduct of elections and Australia’s democratic system. Schedule 1 encompasses a matter substantially connected with the electoral process and it should be considered along with the democratic and electoral system, rather than be dealt with in an ad hoc fashion, by the back door, in a tax bill. I thereby call on the Labor Party to stop the talk and start a sensible conversation on campaign finance reform, rather than the nonsense that we have seen in this schedule.
One of the coalition’s most significant concerns about this bill is the fact that it will punish small individual donors but will make absolutely no difference to big corporate and union donors. A tax deduction for small donations—that is, of under $1,500—is a financial incentive for small individual donors to donate to a political party and participate in the democratic process. What this bill will do is see the removal of the financial incentive for smaller donors. Currently, only individuals can claim a tax deduction for up to $1,500 in donations. The Bills Digest prepared for this matter clearly summarises the small-donor argument when it states:
The availability of a $1500 tax deduction is of greater importance to individual donors than to corporate or wealthy donors. Insofar as the absence of a tax deduction discourages a large number of smaller donors from contributing, it allows corporate and wealthier donors to make up a greater proportion of a political party’s/candidate’s source of funding. It may be argued that this potentially increases the influence of corporatist and wealthier individual’s influence on political decision making.
That succinct summary of the issues makes it very clear why every senator should be opposed to this bill. What is the price of our democracy? And is it preferable to have many smaller donors or fewer larger donors?
Now that the horrors in the Labor Wollongong City Council corruption scandal have come to light, the Senate should be making moves to reform the system so that there are more small donations from individuals rather than fewer larger donations from corporations and unions. There has been a crisis of public confidence in the campaign finance system because of the bad behaviour of the New South Wales Labor Party. Labor are desperate to clean up their image—and so they should be. That is the real reason why they are trying to rush this schedule through. Quite clearly this bill will not be hurting the big players. Instead it will hurt smaller individual donors. Indirectly, this just means that big business and big unions will gain even more influence over political parties than they already have.
By far and away, though, the most concerning reason why the Labor government have tried to pull a swiftie and push through this legislation without scrutiny is the political advantage that it gives to the trade union movement and its political subsidiary, the ALP. This bill ends the tax-deductibility of a donation from an individual, but it still allows a tax deduction if you donate to a union. What happens, then, if that union runs a $10 million election campaign targeting marginal seats? How is it fair if a third party engages in political behaviour, yet membership fees and donations to that third party are tax-deductible?
The AEC political returns for 2006-07, published in February, revealed that the ACTU spent more than $10 million on political campaigns, while 41 other unions spent a combined total of $10.8 million. The 2006-07 political disclosure returns released by the AEC showed that unions declared donations to the ALP of more than $1.3 million. And union membership is tax-deductible, of course, under section 8.1 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. This would continue to be the case for Labor’s principal donors, while donations to other political parties would not be tax-deductible. Probably one of the biggest flaws in the schedule would be that it just allows Labor to funnel their money through the union movement and give their members a tax deduction by the back door, while members of non-Labor parties cannot do so. That is the real motive behind this bill: to give Labor the biggest financial advantage they can possibly have.
Unfortunately, but entirely predictably, Labor used their numbers on the committee to report that the committee supported the bill as written. This was because Labor knew the advantage that they would receive over other parties if this bill were to go through. The government are clearly seeking to use donation laws to gain political advantage here. The coalition will not allow the government to use the Senate to attack democracy and fair play, and we will oppose this legislation vehemently. I do hope that other non-Labor colleagues will join us in rejecting this very pointed attack on participatory democracy.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2008-06-24,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research (Senator Carr) to questions without notice asked today relating to the Commercial Ready program.
Of all the decisions taken in the Rudd government’s 2008 budget the one that has been labelled and is the saddest and dumbest, not surprisingly, is a decision that fell within Senator Carr’s area of responsibility. The short-sighted and vindictive cut to the Commercial Ready program puts up in lights for all to see that Labor is about spin and not substance. Before the election Senator Carr ran around telling anyone who cared to listen that the Howard government was neglecting innovation and that he and Mr Rudd would revitalise the sector. In typical Orwellian spin, less now means more to Messrs Rudd and Carr. But can I tell the minister that the sector is telling me that it would prefer the so-called neglect of the Howard years to the so-called care of Mr Rudd and Senator Carr.
You see the Commercial Ready program was a scheme designed to assist innovators commercialise their inventions and get them out into the marketplace. The test to get funding was rigorous and robust. It funded literally hundreds of science graduates and engineers and helped commercialise many, many innovations right around the country—innovations as diverse as cancer cures, fuel-efficient cars and cutting the road toll. Mr Rudd has his education revolution—and today for the first time we were told about a national innovation revolution, which of course is led by a $700 million cut to innovation; that is how we have a revolution. Senator Carr should know, with his extreme left-wing policies, that revolutions always come with a lot of blood on the floor. Of course that is what he has done in relation to the Commercial Ready program and innovation. There is a lot of blood on the floor. He has simply axed any program that has the word ‘commercial’ in it.
Mr Garrett warned, ‘Don’t listen to what we say; look at what we do.’ Weren’t those words prophetic? Senator Carr and Mr Rudd promised increase funding and increased support to the innovation sector. Yet what did they do in the very first budget they could control? They slashed the CSIRO. They slashed the innovation budget. These cuts were both cruel and unnecessary. The minister’s first attempt to justify this saddest and dumbest of decisions the day after the budget was to run the old class warfare line about not providing assistance to millionaires. Only one of the dumbest—and I had better be careful here; I cannot say one of the dumbest ministers, but can I say one of the most intellectually challenged of ministers—could take such a decision and then seek to justify it with this silly Marxist justification about not supporting millionaires. Australia’s future—which is inextricably interwoven with innovation and doing things better, more cleverly and increasing our competitiveness and our productivity—is being jeopardised by a government that is in disarray and engaged in ad hoc decision making. Increasing productivity, for example, is one of the best ways to fight inflation, and that is what innovation is all about: increasing productivity. So what do those opposite say? ‘We have to cut the budget for innovation, which will impact on productivity, to somehow fight inflation.’ It just goes to show the adhocery that went into this current budget.
When you have even a former Labor science minister willing to condemn this decision, when you have got somebody like Sir Gustav Nossal willing to condemn the decision, when you have got the CEO of Cochlear saying it is the saddest and dumbest decision of the entire budget—and can I say, Mr Deputy President, the competition was very high to get the tag of being the saddest and the dumbest; it was a competitive process—I agree with the CEO of Cochlear: this decision to cut the CRP, the Commercial Ready program, was the saddest and the dumbest, and the government stands condemned.

"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2008-06-24,"—I rise this afternoon to take note of answers given by Minister Carr in relation to questions directed to him by the opposition in relation to the Commercial Ready program. There was no question that the first budget delivered by the Rudd Labor government and by Treasurer Wayne Swan was going to be a tough one. We indicated that for some time, and everybody knew that it was going to be a tough budget. The reason for this is in part the inflation legacy that we inherited from the Howard government. People know that we have the highest inflation that we have had in 16 years. As a consequence of the legacy left to us by the Howard government it was necessary for the Rudd Labor government to take some very hard decisions, and that is what we did. People are very familiar with the range of savings measures that were outlined in the budget. These all demonstrate the fiscal responsibility and the clear commitment that the government have to modernising government spending in this country. It was necessary for us to take difficult decisions in order to secure Australia’s long-term prosperity. The disciplined savings measures that were contained in the budget will help to put downward pressure on the inflation, which I mentioned earlier, that is the highest in 16 years, because we in the Rudd Labor government understand that inflation is real and is hurting working families.
Turning now to the Commercial Ready program and its closure, there is no question that the closure of the Commercial Ready program was a difficult decision. While it is regrettable that there are some applicants who spent time and resources in preparing applications, the government made the hard decision which has been implemented. This decision will allow us to get on with the job of implementing a new streamlined set of programs following the review of the national innovation system. It is important to note that all existing commitments under the program will be met. This is worth about $200 million over four years. Also, it is important to emphasise that all of the regional AusIndustry offices originally established with the Commercial Ready funding will remain open, providing advice and support to regional small and medium sized businesses across the country. It is also important to remember that almost three-quarters of the savings from the Commercial Ready program in 2008-09 had already been earmarked in our election policy Clean Energy Plan to tackle climate change in order to offset the government’s new $240 million Clean Business Australia package that the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research mentioned here today in question time. We in the Rudd Labor government are meeting our election commitment to establish Clean Business Australia because we recognise just how important it is for governments to work in partnership with industry to meet the challenge of climate change.
The Rudd Labor government will continue to support Australia’s innovative businesses through R&D tax concessions, the tax offset, the COMET program and a range of venture capital measures including the Innovation Investment Fund Program as well as new initiatives such as Enterprise Connect, researchers in business, Clean Business Australia, which I have already mentioned, and the Green Car Innovation Fund, about which a lot has been said in the last few weeks.
The Rudd Labor government is determined to get the policy settings and programs for innovation right, and part of this is making tough decisions when necessary about spending priorities. The closure of the Commercial Ready program is one of the tough decisions that needed to be made in order to ensure that we are spending in a fiscally responsible manner.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Commercial Ready Program</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,8,1
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2008-06-24,"—I must say that as a doctor I am very, very disappointed by the fact that this government in the last budget had a pattern of cutting funding to medical projects and medical research. The cutting of the funding to Commercial Ready is yet another example of this. Up to 20 per cent, I believe, of Commercial Ready grants went to the high-risk biotechnology sector, where it is very hard to get private capital funding because there are not necessarily quick returns. In some cases, companies in this sector depended very heavily on the Commercial Ready program to provide them with seeding funding so that they could raise private capital against that financial base, and by taking away the Commercial Ready program this government has demonstrated its disregard for quality medical research in Australia.
Senator Carr even spoke of Australia’s high international reputation for innovation in the same breath as he was justifying the cuts to the Commercial Ready program. I find that incredible. Australia does have a very great reputation in medical research. We have had four or five Nobel Prize winners in medical research and, as Senator Abetz said in his speech today, Sir Gustav Nossal, one of Australia’s most renowned medical scientists, has been quoted as saying the decision to axe the Commercial Ready program was very regrettable. That is just a very polite way of saying that it was a totally irresponsible decision by this government.
Some of the medical programs supported by Commercial Ready have included clinical trials for treatments of cancer. In fact there are 11 such clinical trials, including one for prostatic cancer, which is very debilitating to men of course. With a very high mortality rate, it is one of the most common causes of death in men. It is very important that we find a way of treating it; cutting the funding for that trial with the axing of the Commercial Ready program is certainly not going to help realise that objective. Also gone is the development of an insulin nebuliser, which would have meant that diabetics, instead of having to have injections, could have had their insulin by inhaler. That would have been much easier and kinder for children in particular.
—Hear, hear!
—I hear Senator Barnett agreeing with that. He would know from his own experiences how difficult it is to get children to accept needing injections for diabetes. Then there was the Sienna program, which was developing innovative tests for the diagnosis of cancer. There was a grant of $120,000 over four years proposed for the Sienna program. Sienna were still negotiating in good faith with the government when this program was cut. They lost their $120,000 and are now going overseas to find other partners to develop their innovative diagnostic test, so we have lost another important medical development because of cutting of this program.
Senator Carr said 75 per cent of the money secretly cut from the Commercial Ready program would go to climate change. I wonder how he then justifies the cutting of funding to the Permadrive program, which was seeking to commercialise a new engine that would reduce fuel consumption by up to 25 per cent. Senator Carr can be assured that the mothers of diabetic children in Australia and the relatives of those with cancer will not thank him for cutting the Commercial Ready program.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Commercial Ready Program</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,8,1
"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2008-06-24,"—It is very encouraging to see those opposite showing such a keen interest in innovation these days, because they certainly did not when they were in government. They never showed much interest during their 11 years in government. Those 11 years saw Australia go backwards as our competitors forged ahead. Australia ranked eighth in the OECD for business expenditure on research and development as a share of GDP in 1995-96. By 2005-06 we had slipped to 15th—from eighth to 15th. Why? Because Australia was one of only three OECD countries to reduce its tax benefits for business research and development in the late nineties while 12 countries increased their level of support.
That was nothing compared to what those opposite did to our universities. Between 1995 and 2004, public funding for tertiary education rose 49 per cent on average across the OECD. In Australia, guess what? It fell four per cent. Australia was the only OECD country where the total level of public funding for tertiary education decreased during that time. Is it any wonder that the government’s review of the national innovation system has attracted over 630 submissions from all quarters of the Australian community and all sectors of the economy?
The Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research has said the decision to close the Commercial Ready program was not taken lightly. He has also said that the government will honour all existing contracts under the Commercial Ready program. The government will also continue to support Australia’s innovative businesses through research and development tax concessions, the research and development tax offset, the Commercialising Emerging Technologies program and a range of venture capital measures, as well as new initiatives such as Enterprise Connect, including Researchers in Business, Clean Business Australia and the Green Car Innovation Fund.
The budget that delivered the closure of Commercial Ready is also the budget that delivered new directions for innovation, competitiveness and productivity. It has delivered significant changes in Australian government innovation policy aimed at ending the brain drain, working in partnership with Australian businesses to tackle climate change and providing more effective support to small businesses and innovative companies.
Initiatives for the Innovation, Industry, Science and Research portfolio include: a $326.2 million investment over four years in Future Fellowships to attract and retain the best and brightest midcareer researchers; $240 million over four years for new Clean Business Australia initiatives; $42 million over four years to provide funding to over 30 business enterprise centres, providing business advisory services to small businesses; the introduction of a small business advisory committee to help monitor regulation; a range of saving measures aimed at contributing to the Australian government savings plan and fight against inflation; $251 million to establish Enterprise Connect innovation centres to connect businesses with new ideas and new technology; $209 million to double the number of Australian postgraduate awards for PhD or masters-by-research students; and $500 million for the Green Car Innovation Fund to encourage the development and manufacture of low-emission vehicles in Australia.
The new innovation program to help make Australia climate ready is also significant—$75 million for the Climate Ready competitive grants program as part of the Clean Business Australia election commitment. Climate Ready will encourage Australian businesses to develop and commercialise products, processes and services that save energy and water, reduce pollution and use waste products in innovative ways. This initiative demonstrates Labor’s commitment to working in partnership with Australian industry to meet future challenges through innovations. Innovations supported by the Climate Ready program could include new technologies for water recycling, waste recovery or small-scale renewable energy.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2008-06-24,"—I stand to take note of the answer from Minister Carr, and specifically to say that the scrapping of the Commercial Ready program is one of the worst decisions that this government has made. I think the underlying reason for the government’s decision is its inclination—I will not call it a hatred—towards not supporting, helping and encouraging small business and entrepreneurs in this country. The fact is that the coalition has been a friend of small business. We have been a friend and supporter and encourager of entrepreneurs throughout Australia in each state and territory of this great country. They are the backbone of our country, particularly in the rural and regional parts of this nation, and they need and deserve our support.
The Commercial Ready program was working. It had the runs on the board. It started in 2004 and has provided about $200 million per year in individual grants, from $250,000 to $5 million, to small companies, small businesses and entrepreneurs to assist them to bring new and innovative products to the market. It is not easy. This is a tough part of the business cycle. You get your plans ready and you do the research. Getting it to market is another matter. What this program has done is to get those products to market. It has worked. Since the program began there have been hundreds of successful businesses getting these products to market. It helps them to leverage extra venture capital, so for every dollar that goes in they get further funds invested by venture capital outfits and support for these private sector initiatives.
In fact, 20 per cent of the Commercial Ready grants went to the often high-risk biotech sector, where it is harder to get private venture capital. Insulin infusion products are very important for people with type 1 diabetes. It is hard, particularly for families with young kids who have type 1 diabetes, to get those injections and inject each day—up to five times per day in some instances. I had five injections per day for many years. Through medical technology I am now using an insulin pump, but I think of so many young Australians who potentially are missing out on this new intervention as a result of this mean-spirited approach by the Rudd Labor government.
The minister did acknowledge that there were many Australians who were very disappointed by his decision, and I am pleased he acknowledged that. What he did not do was apologise to them for the decision. In particular, he has not apologised to Mr Jimmy Seervai, who is an award-winning inventor, is financially supported by others and is working on solutions to Australia’s obesity epidemic. He is coming up with solutions; he is an innovator; he has won awards for this. Sadly, he, together with others, was described by the minister as ‘a millionaire’. Earlier I quoted from the Hansard, and the minister did not seem to recall what he said on 14 May—
—He didn’t say it.
—I will quote it again, because Senator O’Brien is querying it. He said:
We had this expectation that we should go on providing assistance and various other measures to millionaires ...
We can place on the record for the Senate today that Jimmy Seervai is not a millionaire. Nothing is further from the truth. I think the minister should come back into the chamber and apologise to all those small business owners and operators and those entrepreneurs who, as a result of this misinterpretation—that is the best way I can put it—from Senator Carr, have been maligned in that way.
Underneath all this, you can see that this is a government with no theme, no rationale, no narrative behind its programs and actions. Yes, it might be implementing some of its government measures but, in this case, it said before the election there was no promise to scrap this program, so in that sense it has broken an election promise as well. There is no heart in it from the government, no heart in what it is doing. There is no rationale to it and it does not, in my view, support the small business sector. (Time expired)

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2008-06-24,"—I present the report of the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Financial Services entitled Better shareholders—better company: shareholder engagement and participation in Australia together with the Hansard record of proceedings and submissions received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
Good corporate governance needs meaningful engagement between shareholders and company boards so that boards can be held to account by the informed decision of shareholders. Effective shareholder engagement is dependent on clear communication and transparent voting. A problem for companies wishing to engage with institutional shareholders is the difficulty of identifying beneficial share owners behind complex ownership arrangements. The committee recommends an amendment to the Corporations Act to allow owners to be more easily traced.
Some companies also seem reluctant to engage with shareholders on sustainability issues, concerned about their continuous disclosure requirements. The committee recommends that the Australian Stock Exchange clarify the scope of the continuous disclosure requirements as they relate to discussing these matters. A major barrier to engagement is incomprehensible company reports. Companies should be encouraged to voluntarily provide easily understandable, short reports for shareholders. This should replace the current mandatory concise report, which is no longer concise and is difficult to understand. The committee recommends that Australian Securities and Investments Commission establish best practice guidelines for company reporting.
The committee has also recommended that ASIC establish best practice guidelines for company annual general meetings, which could be more shareholder-friendly by being held at convenient times, allowing proper opportunity for discussion and using technology to reach a greater audience. Predatory share purchase offers are also detrimental to shareholder engagement, and the committee recommends that access to share registers be restricted to proper purposes. Previously I have raised this issue in relation to Mr David Tweed and his nefarious activities seeking from shareholders the sale of their shares at much less than their market value, so I welcome this particular recommendation from the committee.
The disclosure rules applying to short-selling and margin-lending activities also require improvement. Covered short sales should be required to be disclosed to the market, and institutional investors should disclose their stock-lending policies to members. The uncertainty over when director-shareholder margin loans are of material significance needs to be disclosed to the market, and this should also be clarified. The integrity of voting systems could be improved via electronic proxy voting systems to provide an audit trail and the prohibition of vote-renting and cherry-picking proxy votes. Direct voting would help overcome proxy voting flaws, and the committee recommends that the stock exchange encourage its uptake with an ‘If not, why not?’ provision in its corporate governance principles and recommendations. To assist shareholders in making informed voting decisions, the committee also recommends that shareholders be able to vote on the basis of AGM discussion by postponing voting until after the close of the meeting. The committee also recommends that director-shareholders be prevented from voting on their own remuneration packages.
The tabling of this report fulfils my final task with this committee, which I had the privilege of chairing for nearly 12 years—the life of the Howard government—and which I have continued to serve on as deputy chairman since early this year. I urge the government to take up these recommendations to enhance shareholder engagement, which I believe will become increasingly important in the years ahead. I thank Geoff Dawson, the secretary of the committee, and the committee staff for their work in supporting this particular inquiry.
In the valedictories for departing senators last week Democrat Senator Andrew Murray was kind enough to comment very favourably on the contribution I have made to Corporations Law and financial services regulation as chairman of this committee for so long. I thank him for that encouragement. Equally, Senator Murray has himself been a valued and thoughtful member of this committee through his contributions over the past 12 years and I want to thank him for the first-class work that he has done to enhance its deliberations.
Following the conclusion of my Senate term next Monday, 30 June, I will certainly continue to observe the work of this committee from afar with keen interest. Its work has probably been my key policy interest for these past 12 years and I certainly will not lose the interest that I have developed in that regard. So I wish its continuing members and staff well in their future work as I commend this report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Corporations and Financial Services Committee</title>,Committees,26,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-06-24,"—I initiated this reference to the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, but the committee was very pleased to take it up. I want to commence my remarks by thanking the previous chair of the committee for his wholehearted support and members of the previous opposition, the Labor Party, for their support for this inquiry. The essential understanding was that our markets and our corporations have grown so large and have become so complex that we need to find mechanisms which support improvements in accounting standards and governance practices in Corporations Law and market law with a better ability for very large companies to interact and relate to their shareholders.
One of the difficulties we have of course is that shareholders are often represented indirectly; they are either hidden behind nominee companies—and I do not mean that in the sense that they hide but rather that that is the vehicle they invest in—or hidden behind superannuation trust funds and other funds. It is important we recognise that these intermediaries between the ultimate beneficiary owners of the shares and the company themselves need to be given facilities and the ability to engage on behalf of the ultimate beneficiary shareholders and that the mechanisms for engagement should be as modern, as helpful and as technologically up to date as possible.
Essentially, if I were to capture one theme that emerges from the committee’s report Better shareholders—better company: shareholder engagement and participation in Australia, it would be that we do not want too much more black-letter law in this area but we do want much better practice. That is best facilitated through regulatory intervention and the development of a cross-sectoral understanding of how best to advance better engagement, better shareholder engagement and better participation in Australian companies. We had very much in mind a couple of good examples of how well things could be facilitated. The first was the committee’s strong endorsement, after interviewing the Chair of the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers in Great Britain, of the ability of bodies to develop practice which actually facilitated market acquisition and activity. This did not need too much of a change in law—obviously the law had to allow for the takeover panel themselves to be constituted but the actual practice was developed on a flexible basis. The second, and probably more directly relevant, example was the development of corporate governance principles by the ASX, ASIC and selected and representative members of the corporate community. That has been very effective indeed in keeping up to the mark on corporate governance.
We as a committee felt, and the recommendations clearly indicate this, that shareholder engagement was not up to the mark, and there are a number of areas, which Senator Chapman mentioned in his tabling remarks, which need further development. I think this is a particularly useful report not just because I originally motivated it but because I think its directions and its conclusions are intelligent and insightful. I think that if these recommendations were to be accepted then they would considerably improve shareholder engagement, not least of all through the processes for constituting boards that were in the past more effective in general than they are at present. Obviously there are some superb boards at present, but the ones at the other end of the spectrum are pretty ordinary. We in the committee hold to the view that, as far as possible, you want to not just weigh up the evidence but also come to a conclusion which most people are comfortable with, because if you can do that within the committee structure then you can start to anticipate that it can be done in the corporate world because it is not overly contentious.
One of the things which, unfortunately, characterised the Howard government was that its reaction time to the committee’s previous reports and recommendations was often abysmal. It took far too long and in our view did not facilitate the quick and efficient development of new law, new regulation or new or better practice in these areas. I would hope that the new government will take a shine to answering these reports quickly. I am deliberately addressing my remarks—through you, Madam Acting Deputy President—to the members of the Labor Party present. I have seen a huge improvement in how quickly questions are being answered on notice from estimates—a great improvement on previous practice. Let’s extend that improvement to answering committee reports as quickly as is reasonably possible.
Personally, I tend to take a more advanced view on shareholder engagement matters than do most of my colleagues. I think there are considerable opportunities for greater lateral thinking, and people who are acquainted with my arguments on corporate law will recognise that I have supported the idea of a corporate governance board for many years—that is, of course, a small board with a very limited remit, principally in the governance area, which is elected by shareholder and is not shareholding. I have always thought the main board has to remain elected by shareholding and must concentrate on the main job of the company, which is to do well and to advance the interests of the shareholders, but I have long thought that a separate corporate governance board, which a couple of writers think of as a corporate Senate, would be a considerable advance on corporate practice in Australia. And of course it is possible; it is not prohibited in law. You can do it in your own constitutions. So, in my very last speech with respect to corporate law matters, I would encourage the new committee to keep testing the boundaries to make sure we continue to be as proud of Australian companies as we should be.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Corporations and Financial Services Committee</title>,Committees,26,1
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2008-06-24,"—I would like to take the opportunity on the presentation of this report of the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Financial Services entitled Better shareholders—better company: shareholder engagement and participation in Australia to congratulate Senator Murray for originating this very important reference, focusing on shareholders. It is an appropriate time to recognise 12 years of outstanding service that have been given by the past chairman, Senator Chapman from South Australia. During his time, Senator Chapman raised a range of very significant issues, many of which have been adopted, and he has been recognised in the corporate community as a person promoting high ideals. At a time of such turbulence in the stock markets, as currently, there is always the opportunity of a knee-jerk reaction. To the credit of the committee, they presented a very balanced and objective report, rather than reacted to the particular issues of the moment.
Today company directors indeed face a lot of challenges. Australia, and Australian law and its enforcement, have stood up well in the face of this turmoil. We have not had the degree of volatility or difficulties that overseas countries have experienced. Corporate directors are facing increasing pressures in terms of corporate governance—risk management; changing accounting standards; meeting new international requirements; constant taxation issues; and also keeping an eye on the prospects and activities of a sudden appearance of hedge funds on their share register and the consequences that that can have, particularly when employing short selling. I was particularly pleased, Senator Chapman and Senator Murray, that you addressed this issue of short selling. It is a question of how best to regulate that in a meaningful manner. As you know, short selling in Australia is prohibited; however, I think there are about five or six exemptions under which it can operate, and it is in these areas that we ask the government and the regulator, particularly ASIC, to focus attention. Certainly, if they apply the skills within ASIC together with the expertise within Treasury, I believe we could get a good outcome in order that Australian companies can move forward to give directors the confidence to take manageable risks, whilst ensuring that their companies operate in an appropriate manner to the satisfaction and benefit of shareholders. I thank the Senate.

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2008-06-24,"—I present the report of the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Financial Services entitled Better shareholders—better company: shareholder engagement and participation in Australia together with the Hansard record of proceedings and submissions received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
Good corporate governance needs meaningful engagement between shareholders and company boards so that boards can be held to account by the informed decision of shareholders. Effective shareholder engagement is dependent on clear communication and transparent voting. A problem for companies wishing to engage with institutional shareholders is the difficulty of identifying beneficial share owners behind complex ownership arrangements. The committee recommends an amendment to the Corporations Act to allow owners to be more easily traced.
Some companies also seem reluctant to engage with shareholders on sustainability issues, concerned about their continuous disclosure requirements. The committee recommends that the Australian Stock Exchange clarify the scope of the continuous disclosure requirements as they relate to discussing these matters. A major barrier to engagement is incomprehensible company reports. Companies should be encouraged to voluntarily provide easily understandable, short reports for shareholders. This should replace the current mandatory concise report, which is no longer concise and is difficult to understand. The committee recommends that Australian Securities and Investments Commission establish best practice guidelines for company reporting.
The committee has also recommended that ASIC establish best practice guidelines for company annual general meetings, which could be more shareholder-friendly by being held at convenient times, allowing proper opportunity for discussion and using technology to reach a greater audience. Predatory share purchase offers are also detrimental to shareholder engagement, and the committee recommends that access to share registers be restricted to proper purposes. Previously I have raised this issue in relation to Mr David Tweed and his nefarious activities seeking from shareholders the sale of their shares at much less than their market value, so I welcome this particular recommendation from the committee.
The disclosure rules applying to short-selling and margin-lending activities also require improvement. Covered short sales should be required to be disclosed to the market, and institutional investors should disclose their stock-lending policies to members. The uncertainty over when director-shareholder margin loans are of material significance needs to be disclosed to the market, and this should also be clarified. The integrity of voting systems could be improved via electronic proxy voting systems to provide an audit trail and the prohibition of vote-renting and cherry-picking proxy votes. Direct voting would help overcome proxy voting flaws, and the committee recommends that the stock exchange encourage its uptake with an ‘If not, why not?’ provision in its corporate governance principles and recommendations. To assist shareholders in making informed voting decisions, the committee also recommends that shareholders be able to vote on the basis of AGM discussion by postponing voting until after the close of the meeting. The committee also recommends that director-shareholders be prevented from voting on their own remuneration packages.
The tabling of this report fulfils my final task with this committee, which I had the privilege of chairing for nearly 12 years—the life of the Howard government—and which I have continued to serve on as deputy chairman since early this year. I urge the government to take up these recommendations to enhance shareholder engagement, which I believe will become increasingly important in the years ahead. I thank Geoff Dawson, the secretary of the committee, and the committee staff for their work in supporting this particular inquiry.
In the valedictories for departing senators last week Democrat Senator Andrew Murray was kind enough to comment very favourably on the contribution I have made to Corporations Law and financial services regulation as chairman of this committee for so long. I thank him for that encouragement. Equally, Senator Murray has himself been a valued and thoughtful member of this committee through his contributions over the past 12 years and I want to thank him for the first-class work that he has done to enhance its deliberations.
Following the conclusion of my Senate term next Monday, 30 June, I will certainly continue to observe the work of this committee from afar with keen interest. Its work has probably been my key policy interest for these past 12 years and I certainly will not lose the interest that I have developed in that regard. So I wish its continuing members and staff well in their future work as I commend this report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,26,2
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-06-24,"—I initiated this reference to the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, but the committee was very pleased to take it up. I want to commence my remarks by thanking the previous chair of the committee for his wholehearted support and members of the previous opposition, the Labor Party, for their support for this inquiry. The essential understanding was that our markets and our corporations have grown so large and have become so complex that we need to find mechanisms which support improvements in accounting standards and governance practices in Corporations Law and market law with a better ability for very large companies to interact and relate to their shareholders.
One of the difficulties we have of course is that shareholders are often represented indirectly; they are either hidden behind nominee companies—and I do not mean that in the sense that they hide but rather that that is the vehicle they invest in—or hidden behind superannuation trust funds and other funds. It is important we recognise that these intermediaries between the ultimate beneficiary owners of the shares and the company themselves need to be given facilities and the ability to engage on behalf of the ultimate beneficiary shareholders and that the mechanisms for engagement should be as modern, as helpful and as technologically up to date as possible.
Essentially, if I were to capture one theme that emerges from the committee’s report Better shareholders—better company: shareholder engagement and participation in Australia, it would be that we do not want too much more black-letter law in this area but we do want much better practice. That is best facilitated through regulatory intervention and the development of a cross-sectoral understanding of how best to advance better engagement, better shareholder engagement and better participation in Australian companies. We had very much in mind a couple of good examples of how well things could be facilitated. The first was the committee’s strong endorsement, after interviewing the Chair of the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers in Great Britain, of the ability of bodies to develop practice which actually facilitated market acquisition and activity. This did not need too much of a change in law—obviously the law had to allow for the takeover panel themselves to be constituted but the actual practice was developed on a flexible basis. The second, and probably more directly relevant, example was the development of corporate governance principles by the ASX, ASIC and selected and representative members of the corporate community. That has been very effective indeed in keeping up to the mark on corporate governance.
We as a committee felt, and the recommendations clearly indicate this, that shareholder engagement was not up to the mark, and there are a number of areas, which Senator Chapman mentioned in his tabling remarks, which need further development. I think this is a particularly useful report not just because I originally motivated it but because I think its directions and its conclusions are intelligent and insightful. I think that if these recommendations were to be accepted then they would considerably improve shareholder engagement, not least of all through the processes for constituting boards that were in the past more effective in general than they are at present. Obviously there are some superb boards at present, but the ones at the other end of the spectrum are pretty ordinary. We in the committee hold to the view that, as far as possible, you want to not just weigh up the evidence but also come to a conclusion which most people are comfortable with, because if you can do that within the committee structure then you can start to anticipate that it can be done in the corporate world because it is not overly contentious.
One of the things which, unfortunately, characterised the Howard government was that its reaction time to the committee’s previous reports and recommendations was often abysmal. It took far too long and in our view did not facilitate the quick and efficient development of new law, new regulation or new or better practice in these areas. I would hope that the new government will take a shine to answering these reports quickly. I am deliberately addressing my remarks—through you, Madam Acting Deputy President—to the members of the Labor Party present. I have seen a huge improvement in how quickly questions are being answered on notice from estimates—a great improvement on previous practice. Let’s extend that improvement to answering committee reports as quickly as is reasonably possible.
Personally, I tend to take a more advanced view on shareholder engagement matters than do most of my colleagues.

Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
In speaking to this report, I want to particularly put on record my thanks to the other members of the committee, to the people who provided evidence and witness statements to our committee and most particularly to the secretariat of our committee because of the ridiculous time frame that was presented to our committee to present this report. This is a particularly complex issue. On that, the whole committee was agreed—there was no doubt about the process. However, we were presented with a time frame which meant that we needed to present this document today. I think that caused a degree of stress on all those who were engaged in the process, because we think this is an important issue. I think we would require more time to fully consider the range of the terms of reference with which we were provided. However, the terms of reference came down, in part, to whether the government’s decision to impose a higher tax on ready-to-drink beverages was an appropriate thing to do at the time. Other terms of reference looked at much wider issues of alcohol in our society. I do not think in the time given to us we were able to fully contemplate those other terms of reference.
In terms of the importance of the increased taxation on ready-to-drinks, the majority report has come down in favour of the government’s decision, unsurprisingly. We say that the government’s decision, which has been clearly enunciated by Minister Roxon and the Prime Minister, who has taken a personal interest in these issues, has been an important step in the ongoing consideration of the issues of alcohol, particularly with young people in our community. No-one denies that there is a problem. In the process of the committee we were absolutely drowned with data, graphs and statistics. However, there was one key issue: regardless of what the data and the statistics said about trends or processes, there is a problem—there is no doubt about that. We heard evidence from a range of people who work in the public health area, we heard evidence from people who have been studying this issue for many years and there is a consensus that there is a problem with alcohol, particularly with young people in our community.
Pleasingly, this issue has been taken up in the media. For a long time, it seemed like it was a sleeping issue and only appeared from time to time. But over the last few months there has been increasing coverage of these issues in the media. Partly in response to what is going on, which includes the horrific programs and data that have come to the committee’s attention, the government has decided that amongst a range of other issues—and it is important to absolutely concentrate on this point—there is no single response. Certainly the taxation issue and cost issue are but one response. But they are an important response. That has been borne out by information that we have received from other countries and by talking with young people about what they are doing with alcohol in their communities. This alone will not solve the issue—that certainly came out consistently. We refer throughout the report to the COAG process because this has been an issue on the agenda of COAG, which is looking at this issue across the country.
I think the term ‘binge drinking’ has been overused and I know that in the last couple of weeks there has been a move away, particularly in the national health and medical research area, from the term ‘binge drinking’. What we are talking about is use of alcohol to a risky level. That is a very important concept to keep before all of us. We need to consider the way people in our community view alcohol. We are not saying that people should not drink. I want to put that clearly on the open agenda. This is not a prohibitionist response to the issue of alcohol. What we are talking about is people working together to come up with solutions to the levels of violence, harm and misuse that have been identified in the community. There has been a response from all levels of government, from people who are working in the medical profession and from people who are researching in the public health area, and one solution amidst all of those actions will be the increase in cost for ready-to-drink alcohol beverages.
We know—and, again, I do not think there is any particular question about this either—that some of the ready-to-drink beverages mask the taste of alcohol and, as such, are more attractive to young people. The committee heard evidence that people were not even aware of how many drinks they were consuming or whether in fact they were alcoholic. We have limited data on underage drinking, and an area that must be considered more fully into the future is the way we collect data. Certainly, one of the key issues for our committee was the introductory phase—when people begin their journey with alcohol. Doing that in a way that is responsible and safe sets people up for better and more responsible use of alcohol throughout their lives. But if young people are caught up in irresponsible drinking at a young age, that is a recipe for future health issues. It is also a recipe for getting people into situations which are clearly unsafe.
This discussion will go on; this is not the end of the debate. However, we on this side of the Senate strongly believe that an important step has been taken in this taxation response. It is only one part of a wider need, but it is a start and it should not be delayed or dismissed for political purposes or because of arguments about whether it in itself is enough. It is not; it is a step in the right direction.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,32,1
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2008-06-24,"—The Chair of Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs has quite rightly said that we have a problem. Australia clearly does have a write-off culture, where it is acceptable in many quarters to go out of an evening and get blind drunk. The reasons for that are hard to understand in full, but the nature of the problem it presents to Australians in terms of cost and health impacts is very clear. We need to act on the problem that that write-off culture presents to us as a community.
The committee agreed that we have a problem. What the committee did not agree on is whether this solution, the imposition of an excise increase of some 70 per cent on ready-to-drink alcoholic products, was the solution to that problem. The fact is that if there were measures in this debate which were clearly directed, on an empirical basis, towards the solution of the problem then they would have the strong and unquestioning support of the opposition. But it is not clear that this measure does that. This measure imposes a $3.1 billion tax burden on Australian consumers, most of whom drink alcohol responsibly—at least, under present definitions. A $3.1 billion tax imposition on those drinkers has downstream effects which are very serious and which needs to be brought into account in this debate. It has an impact on employment levels in the alcohol and hospitality industries and it has the potential to change people’s behaviour in ways which are not anticipated and which may actually be damaging to public health measures that try to prevent people from drinking dangerously. Of course, there are simply those pressures on the ordinary Australians who consume alcohol responsibly. The cost of that recreational pastime is greater as a result of this tax burden.
It is therefore the contention of the Liberal senators who took part in this inquiry that the onus that must fall on the federal government to demonstrate that this measure will be effective—that it will make a difference in reducing levels of risky drinking in Australia, particularly amongst the young—has not been discharged. They have not demonstrated that this measure will actually achieve its goal.
One of the key reasons for that view was that it was acknowledged widely in evidence given to the inquiry that there will be significant substitution going on between ready-to-drink alcoholic products and other forms of alcoholic beverage, and possibly substitution of other substances altogether. There was evidence that already we are seeing a significant drop in ready-to-drink product sales. We are also seeing significant increases in spirits sales. If a young person is going to go out and drink, one needs to ask oneself: is it better to have the same amount of alcohol consumed through standard drinks or bottles of a ready-to-drink product or is it better to have it being poured directly out of a spirit bottle into a glass, perhaps with mixers added, with the potential for an incapacity to count the standard drinks that are being consumed and with the potential for drink spiking and other problems that might flow from that? We are not convinced that this measure will not result in considerable substitution and, in fact, people consuming other things in other, more dangerous ways.
The report Ready-to-drink alcohol beverages makes clear that Australia has not experienced an explosion in alcohol consumption in recent years and, on the evidence, it is not clear whether the problem with Australians, particularly young Australians, abusing alcohol is actually getting worse or better. Figures presented by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare demonstrate that the drinking patterns of Australians have in some ways moderated in recent years. For example, when the institute surveyed drinking status in the years between 1991 and 2007 it found that the number of people aged over 14 drinking daily in Australia had dropped from 10.2 per cent of the population to 8.1 per cent of the population. The number of people drinking weekly had risen from 30.4 per cent to 33.5 per cent—perhaps an indication of some moderation. The number of those who had never had a full serve of alcohol rose from 6.5 per cent to 10.1 per cent of the population.
That figure, which is reproduced on page 59 of the report, shows very clearly that there have been some quite significant changes in alcohol consumption in Australia, but overall levels have come down quite dramatically since the early 1970s. The consumption of wine has increased since that time but has been fairly stable over the last 20 years. The consumption level for beer has dropped quite dramatically—by about two-thirds—over that period of time. Spirits have remained fairly static—in fact, they have dropped somewhat in that time—but what has happened within that market is that ready-to-drink products have become much more popular. Is that the basis for a knee-jerk reaction or for a rushed response that is not based on clear evidence as to its positive effect on people’s drinking habits? I simply do not think that it is.
The fact is that there is every hallmark that this measure is all about increasing government revenue and very little about reducing the harmful effects of drinking in our community. As I said, there is a $3.1 billion hit on Australian drinkers in this measure. You might expect that the government’s focus in this development was on reducing the harm caused by alcohol and that you would see a significant slice of that $3.1 billion over four years redirected into measures to reduce the harmful effects of alcohol. In fact, it apparently is the case that none of it—not one cent of that $3.1 billion—will be directed in that particular way. There is a national binge-drinking strategy which attracts the grand investment of $53 million over four years, but even that is to be funded not by this revenue from alcohol but by a cut to the other programs operated by the Department of Health and Ageing—that is, an internal saving made by that agency. We are told that there are other measures being contemplated and that other things will be developed as part of the preventative health strategy of the Australian government. I welcome that focus; I think that is extremely important. But my fear and the fear of the Liberal senators who took part in this inquiry is that we are seeing the cart put before the horse. We are seeing a grab for money, and the thinking about how it will be used to reduce alcohol consumption will occur at some point in the future. In the meantime, we see the potential for very dangerous behaviour taking place.
Many of the parties who supported this measure before the committee’s inquiry said that they wanted to see Australia move to a volumetric approach to the taxation of alcohol products. This means that, no matter how you consume alcohol, the amount of taxation you are paying on each standard drink you are consuming and each millilitre of alcohol is the same so that people are not tempted to migrate to other products to escape taxes or because their taxation levels are lower than others. That was a well-supported—though not universally supported—contention. It would certainly attract some support, I think, from many people. The problem with the approach the government has taken is that it does not form the basis of a first step towards a volumetric approach to alcohol taxation. In fact, the committee was told that, if there were a revenue-neutral volumetric approach to the taxation of alcoholic products, the tax on an RTD would be 47c for each standard drink. In fact, as a result of the decision made in March this year by the federal government, the level of taxation is $1.25—2½ times the level it ought to be if you were taking a volumetric approach. This is clearly not the first step towards a volumetric approach to taxation. I think that the government needs to explain exactly what broader strategy it sees this measure achieving.
I repeat: the opposition is not opposed to strong, directed, well-researched and empirical measures to reduce the toll that alcohol takes in this country each and every year, particularly amongst young Australians. But we are not convinced that this measure is such a step, and we are not convinced that it will be effective. (Time expired)

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-06-24,"—I will speak briefly. I must say with respect to this inquiry that I would urge all those interested in this topic to read not only the majority report—which is a very interesting report, I might say—but also the dissenting report from the Liberals and the additional comments from both myself, for the Democrats, and Senator Siewert. I think that, when you read all of those together, you get a very good picture of where we should go and how we should advance this cause. There is one thing in the remarks of both the chair and the deputy chair that I agree with: universally, all senators recognise that there is a problem and it needs to be addressed. There is no doubt about that.
Once you have accepted there is a problem, you have got to come, of course, to the solution. I say with respect to the measures that are in the policy which is the subject of this report that the Democrats have no issue with the price of alcohol being increased via excise if the social intent is to reduce the harmful consumption of alcohol. We support measures, including price measures, that will significantly reduce the harm caused by the excessive consumption of alcohol. We have no set level of excise or alcohol tax in mind that will achieve this goal. The level at which excise is set for those purposes is always going to be a matter of judgement—a behavioural guess—and the Treasury is as good at that sort of estimate or guess as any. What we do take issue with is excise actions in one alcohol category—in this case RTDs—in isolation from action in other alcohol categories which are capable of being easily substituted for the targeted category. The behavioural logic is easy: price affects consumption; raising the price should lower consumption. However, if there are easy substitutes, no significant fall in consumption will occur, so you have to raise the price of all substitutes too.
What was disturbing at both the June Senate budget estimates and at the committee inquiry was that the question of substitution seems to have been swept aside or diminished in importance. Yet it is central to the question of whether a premixed drink excise increase will work at all in reducing the harmful consumption of premixed drinks, particularly by young people.
At the time of the announcement of this excise increase for premixed drinks, the Democrats said that it must be matched by other action. That is exactly what the chair has said; it is exactly what the deputy chair has said. Despite helpful reform in the last decade, for which they should get credit, the federal government’s alcohol tax policy lacks integrity and consistency.
The Democrats essentially say that alcohol is alcohol whatever its source, yet the alcohol-pricing regime is selective between and within alcohol categories, not on rational grounds but on random grounds. The detrimental effect of alcohol comes from the amount consumed, not from its type, its packaging or its flavour. Accordingly, the Democrats put forward two recommendations. Our first was that the Henry tax review examining alcohol taxation have regard to these three general principles: all products in the same product category should be taxed at the same rate; all products with the same alcohol level should be taxed at the same rate; and the lower-alcohol and mid-strength beer excise should be matched with a lower-alcohol and mid-strength RTD excise rate.
Our second recommendation followed on from the Senate’s unanimous call, agreed on 13 March 2008, for a full review of alcohol policy—and by ‘full’ I mean very comprehensive. Our second recommendation was that the government comply with the Senate motion of 13 March 2008 calling for a comprehensive, holistic review of all aspects of alcohol. If there is anything that this inquiry has shown, it is that you cannot address this matter in isolation. You cannot just deal with the RTD issue. The government, I think, would be delinquent not to heed the Senate’s unanimous call for a comprehensive inquiry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,32,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-06-24,"—The Greens tabled additional comments to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs report entitled Ready-to-drink alcohol beverages. We have expressed for quite some time our concern about alcohol and alcohol abuse in our community. We consider that it is a waste of time arguing about whether or not some drinking rates have gone up. The fact is that we have a $15 billion plus problem in this country that we needs to start dealing with. As I have just said, it is a waste of time arguing about how much risky drinking has increased or decreased. However, very fortuitously during the inquiry, a report by Michael Livingston was published in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health. The report showed very clearly that instances of alcohol related harm had definitely gone up. It also pointed out that it is very difficult to measure risky drinking behaviour because many of the groups that display this behaviour are hard to survey. But the fact is that alcohol related harm has gone up in this country, and the statistics clearly show that.
While the inquiry focused on ready-to-drink alcohol for a specific reason, it is important to note that the Greens very strongly believe that a comprehensive strategy is needed to deal with this issue. While RTDs, or ready-to-drinks, are a particular issue, they need a comprehensive strategy to deal with them. One of the reasons that RTDs are a particular focus is that there has been a shift towards drinking those types of alcoholic beverages. Anecdotal evidence and, I think, increasingly research evidence shows that RTDs are a focus because they encourage young people to drink. The milk and sweetness in RTDs cover the flavour of the alcohol. I will just diverge here to point out that, during the inquiry, an industry person who was questioned about this said that they did not add sugar to RTDs because there is cola in them. If you look at the make-up of cola, you will see that it contains a great deal of sugar; hence, you do not need to add sugar because the cola adds the sugar. The fact is that these drinks are sweet and attractive to young people. The theory being put forward is that these beverages are encouraging young people to drink because, when you are young, your body rejects the taste of alcohol, whereas milk, sugar and cola mask the taste of the alcohol.
As the opposition pointed out, the government’s proposed changes to the alcohol excise regime will raise a substantive amount of income. If the government is genuine in saying that that measure is part of a strategy to address alcohol abuse and harm in this country, it needs to be hypothecating a great deal of that money to effective public education and social marketing programs.
The committee heard some very strong evidence on what is needed for a comprehensive strategy to address this issue, and people who work in this area have established a bit of a hierarchy on how to do that. It starts with regulating price. Experts consider that using price as a mechanism with RTDs should be part of the strategy. Other mechanisms include lowering speed limits for all drivers, enforcing liquor-licensing laws, limiting availability of alcohol, restricting hours of alcohol sales, limiting the density of alcohol outlets, community mobilisation, workplace interventions, curbing alcohol sponsorship in sport, and social marketing. These are the areas that experts say should be part of a comprehensive strategy.
The Greens have made our policy on advertising quite clear. We believe that there should be a ban on alcohol advertising. We believe that there should be a ban on the advertising of alcohol through sports sponsorships and promotional activities. We have had two inquiries into alcohol in the past month, and the issue of advertising to young people and what appeals to them was raised. When the free-to-air television people were asked about the percentage of young people watching sport, they said it was only 3.7 per cent. If you look at the percentage of young people in our population—guess what?—it is around 3.7 per cent. In other words, advertising is actually getting to a large percentage of the population’s young people.
In our additional comments to the report, the Greens have listed 10 recommendations. We begin with support for well-resourced and targeted, evidence based public education and social marketing campaigns that are focused particularly on at-risk groups. Then we look at inquiring into a volumetric tax. Very strong evidence was presented to the committee about the usefulness of a volumetric tax. However, I probably differ from some of my opposition colleagues on this issue. The nature of drinks like RTDs that appeal particularly to young people and to at-risk groups need to be looked at, because a volumetric price signal will not work with RTDs, although the evidence clearly shows that price does work as a limiting factor.
There was evidence from overseas presented to the committee about the usefulness of price signals. There was some evidence presented to the committee that clearly showed that in some countries in Europe substitution had not occurred, that in fact it was working as part of a comprehensive approach. So the Greens are urging the government, and we have put on record, that along with this initiative on RTDs they need to be presenting a comprehensive strategy but also need to be allocating significant resources to an evidence based—that is very important—public education and social marketing campaign.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,32,1
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2008-06-24,"—I would also like to make a contribution to the debate on this report and acknowledge those who have made submissions. I think the work that people and organisations put into their reports and their submissions to the committee was quite significant. They perhaps did have the benefit of having another inquiry a few weeks earlier, which did assist with the research, but, regardless of that, a lot of good work was put into submissions and evidence presented. To the secretariat I note that, as Senator Moore said, it was a very tight time frame. I will note that the government could have had some influence over that, but we did not know what their tactics were going to be at the time with respect to the presentation of the legislation, so there lies the basis of that.
I would also like to acknowledge my colleagues on the committee for the way the hearings were conducted and the interactions that were part of that. I think we all came out of this with pretty strong agreement that, if we are going to address the issue of alcohol misuse—and I stay away from terms like ‘binge drinking’, as Senator Moore has said—then we do need a comprehensive approach. I think that is where the government has failed with this particular measure, which is so narrowly focused that it is not going to, on its own, address any of the alcohol issues that we have. In fact, the evidence is that it will probably lead to some substitutions. There is some initial evidence from the industry that people are moving away from RTDs towards pure spirits and mixers. Although that is very early evidence, and the industry was very cautious in the way it presented that evidence, I think we need to acknowledge that.
There was also the anecdotal evidence. I spent Saturday night talking to a fairly large group of young people—I know that other members of the committee have similar interactions—and they know what is going on; they are not silly. If they want to go out and consume large quantities of alcohol, they know how to do it and they have the resources to do it. I think that is one of the issues that this measure, on its own, does not actually address. It is quite unfortunate that we are in a position to be debating what is one element, and a very narrowly based element, of this whole issue, an issue which every member of the committee acknowledges. I will take Senator Murray’s point: I do not think there is a senator in this place who does not acknowledge that there are problems that we need to address with respect to alcohol use. But the very narrow focus of this measure on its own really does not address the problem. The concerns that were raised during—

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2008-06-24,"—I present the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs Ready-to-drink alcohol beverages, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
In speaking to this report, I want to particularly put on record my thanks to the other members of the committee, to the people who provided evidence and witness statements to our committee and most particularly to the secretariat of our committee because of the ridiculous time frame that was presented to our committee to present this report. This is a particularly complex issue. On that, the whole committee was agreed—there was no doubt about the process. However, we were presented with a time frame which meant that we needed to present this document today. I think that caused a degree of stress on all those who were engaged in the process, because we think this is an important issue. I think we would require more time to fully consider the range of the terms of reference with which we were provided. However, the terms of reference came down, in part, to whether the government’s decision to impose a higher tax on ready-to-drink beverages was an appropriate thing to do at the time. Other terms of reference looked at much wider issues of alcohol in our society. I do not think in the time given to us we were able to fully contemplate those other terms of reference.
In terms of the importance of the increased taxation on ready-to-drinks, the majority report has come down in favour of the government’s decision, unsurprisingly. We say that the government’s decision, which has been clearly enunciated by Minister Roxon and the Prime Minister, who has taken a personal interest in these issues, has been an important step in the ongoing consideration of the issues of alcohol, particularly with young people in our community. No-one denies that there is a problem. In the process of the committee we were absolutely drowned with data, graphs and statistics. However, there was one key issue: regardless of what the data and the statistics said about trends or processes, there is a problem—there is no doubt about that. We heard evidence from a range of people who work in the public health area, we heard evidence from people who have been studying this issue for many years and there is a consensus that there is a problem with alcohol, particularly with young people in our community.
Pleasingly, this issue has been taken up in the media. For a long time, it seemed like it was a sleeping issue and only appeared from time to time. But over the last few months there has been increasing coverage of these issues in the media. Partly in response to what is going on, which includes the horrific programs and data that have come to the committee’s attention, the government has decided that amongst a range of other issues—and it is important to absolutely concentrate on this point—there is no single response. Certainly the taxation issue and cost issue are but one response. But they are an important response. That has been borne out by information that we have received from other countries and by talking with young people about what they are doing with alcohol in their communities. This alone will not solve the issue—that certainly came out consistently. We refer throughout the report to the COAG process because this has been an issue on the agenda of COAG, which is looking at this issue across the country.
I think the term ‘binge drinking’ has been overused and I know that in the last couple of weeks there has been a move away, particularly in the national health and medical research area, from the term ‘binge drinking’. What we are talking about is use of alcohol to a risky level. That is a very important concept to keep before all of us. We need to consider the way people in our community view alcohol. We are not saying that people should not drink. I want to put that clearly on the open agenda. This is not a prohibitionist response to the issue of alcohol. What we are talking about is people working together to come up with solutions to the levels of violence, harm and misuse that have been identified in the community. There has been a response from all levels of government, from people who are working in the medical profession and from people who are researching in the public health area, and one solution amidst all of those actions will be the increase in cost for ready-to-drink alcohol beverages.
We know—and, again, I do not think there is any particular question about this either—that some of the ready-to-drink beverages mask the taste of alcohol and, as such, are more attractive to young people. The committee heard evidence that people were not even aware of how many drinks they were consuming or whether in fact they were alcoholic. We have limited data on underage drinking, and an area that must be considered more fully into the future is the way we collect data. Certainly, one of the key issues for our committee was the introductory phase—when people begin their journey with alcohol. Doing that in a way that is responsible and safe sets people up for better and more responsible use of alcohol throughout their lives. But if young people are caught up in irresponsible drinking at a young age, that is a recipe for future health issues. It is also a recipe for getting people into situations which are clearly unsafe.
This discussion will go on; this is not the end of the debate. However, we on this side of the Senate strongly believe that an important step has been taken in this taxation response. It is only one part of a wider need, but it is a start and it should not be delayed or dismissed for political purposes or because of arguments about whether it in itself is enough. It is not; it is a step in the right direction.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,32,2
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2008-06-24,"—The Chair of Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs has quite rightly said that we have a problem. Australia clearly does have a write-off culture, where it is acceptable in many quarters to go out of an evening and get blind drunk. The reasons for that are hard to understand in full, but the nature of the problem it presents to Australians in terms of cost and health impacts is very clear. We need to act on the problem that that write-off culture presents to us as a community.
The committee agreed that we have a problem. What the committee did not agree on is whether this solution, the imposition of an excise increase of some 70 per cent on ready-to-drink alcoholic products, was the solution to that problem. The fact is that if there were measures in this debate which were clearly directed, on an empirical basis, towards the solution of the problem then they would have the strong and unquestioning support of the opposition. But it is not clear that this measure does that. This measure imposes a $3.1 billion tax burden on Australian consumers, most of whom drink alcohol responsibly—at least, under present definitions. A $3.1 billion tax imposition on those drinkers has downstream effects which are very serious and which needs to be brought into account in this debate. It has an impact on employment levels in the alcohol and hospitality industries and it has the potential to change people’s behaviour in ways which are not anticipated and which may actually be damaging to public health measures that try to prevent people from drinking dangerously. Of course, there are simply those pressures on the ordinary Australians who consume alcohol responsibly. The cost of that recreational pastime is greater as a result of this tax burden.
It is therefore the contention of the Liberal senators who took part in this inquiry that the onus that must fall on the federal government to demonstrate that this measure will be effective—that it will make a difference in reducing levels of risky drinking in Australia, particularly amongst the young—has not been discharged. They have not demonstrated that this measure will actually achieve its goal.
One of the key reasons for that view was that it was acknowledged widely in evidence given to the inquiry that there will be significant substitution going on between ready-to-drink alcoholic products and other forms of alcoholic beverage, and possibly substitution of other substances altogether. There was evidence that already we are seeing a significant drop in ready-to-drink product sales. We are also seeing significant increases in spirits sales. If a young person is going to go out and drink, one needs to ask oneself: is it better to have the same amount of alcohol consumed through standard drinks or bottles of a ready-to-drink product or is it better to have it being poured directly out of a spirit bottle into a glass, perhaps with mixers added, with the potential for an incapacity to count the standard drinks that are being consumed and with the potential for drink spiking and other problems that might flow from that? We are not convinced that this measure will not result in considerable substitution and, in fact, people consuming other things in other, more dangerous ways.
The report Ready-to-drink alcohol beverages makes clear that Australia has not experienced an explosion in alcohol consumption in recent years and, on the evidence, it is not clear whether the problem with Australians, particularly young Australians, abusing alcohol is actually getting worse or better. Figures presented by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare demonstrate that the drinking patterns of Australians have in some ways moderated in recent years. For example, when the institute surveyed drinking status in the years between 1991 and 2007 it found that the number of people aged over 14 drinking daily in Australia had dropped from 10.2 per cent of the population to 8.1 per cent of the population. The number of people drinking weekly had risen from 30.4 per cent to 33.5 per cent—perhaps an indication of some moderation. The number of those who had never had a full serve of alcohol rose from 6.5 per cent to 10.1 per cent of the population.
That figure, which is reproduced on page 59 of the report, shows very clearly that there have been some quite significant changes in alcohol consumption in Australia, but overall levels have come down quite dramatically since the early 1970s. The consumption of wine has increased since that time but has been fairly stable over the last 20 years. The consumption level for beer has dropped quite dramatically—by about two-thirds—over that period of time. Spirits have remained fairly static—in fact, they have dropped somewhat in that time—but what has happened within that market is that ready-to-drink products have become much more popular. Is that the basis for a knee-jerk reaction or for a rushed response that is not based on clear evidence as to its positive effect on people’s drinking habits? I simply do not think that it is.
The fact is that there is every hallmark that this measure is all about increasing government revenue and very little about reducing the harmful effects of drinking in our community. As I said, there is a $3.1 billion hit on Australian drinkers in this measure. You might expect that the government’s focus in this development was on reducing the harm caused by alcohol and that you would see a significant slice of that $3.1 billion over four years redirected into measures to reduce the harmful effects of alcohol. In fact, it apparently is the case that none of it—not one cent of that $3.1 billion—will be directed in that particular way. There is a national binge-drinking strategy which attracts the grand investment of $53 million over four years, but even that is to be funded not by this revenue from alcohol but by a cut to the other programs operated by the Department of Health and Ageing—that is, an internal saving made by that agency. We are told that there are other measures being contemplated and that other things will be developed as part of the preventative health strategy of the Australian government. I welcome that focus; I think that is extremely important. But my fear and the fear of the Liberal senators who took part in this inquiry is that we are seeing the cart put before the horse. We are seeing a grab for money, and the thinking about how it will be used to reduce alcohol consumption will occur at some point in the future. In the meantime, we see the potential for very dangerous behaviour taking place.
Many of the parties who supported this measure before the committee’s inquiry said that they wanted to see Australia move to a volumetric approach to the taxation of alcohol products. This means that, no matter how you consume alcohol, the amount of taxation you are paying on each standard drink you are consuming and each millilitre of alcohol is the same so that people are not tempted to migrate to other products to escape taxes or because their taxation levels are lower than others. That was a well-supported—though not universally supported—contention. It would certainly attract some support, I think, from many people. The problem with the approach the government has taken is that it does not form the basis of a first step towards a volumetric approach to alcohol taxation. In fact, the committee was told that, if there were a revenue-neutral volumetric approach to the taxation of alcoholic products, the tax on an RTD would be 47c for each standard drink. In fact, as a result of the decision made in March this year by the federal government, the level of taxation is $1.25—2½ times the level it ought to be if you were taking a volumetric approach. This is clearly not the first step towards a volumetric approach to taxation. I think that the government needs to explain exactly what broader strategy it sees this measure achieving.
I repeat: the opposition is not opposed to strong, directed, well-researched and empirical measures to reduce the toll that alcohol takes in this country each and every year, particularly amongst young Australians. But we are not convinced that this measure is such a step, and we are not convinced that it will be effective. (Time expired)

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-06-24,"—I will speak briefly. I must say with respect to this inquiry that I would urge all those interested in this topic to read not only the majority report—which is a very interesting report, I might say—but also the dissenting report from the Liberals and the additional comments from both myself, for the Democrats, and Senator Siewert. I think that, when you read all of those together, you get a very good picture of where we should go and how we should advance this cause. There is one thing in the remarks of both the chair and the deputy chair that I agree with: universally, all senators recognise that there is a problem and it needs to be addressed. There is no doubt about that.
Once you have accepted there is a problem, you have got to come, of course, to the solution. I say with respect to the measures that are in the policy which is the subject of this report that the Democrats have no issue with the price of alcohol being increased via excise if the social intent is to reduce the harmful consumption of alcohol. We support measures, including price measures, that will significantly reduce the harm caused by the excessive consumption of alcohol. We have no set level of excise or alcohol tax in mind that will achieve this goal. The level at which excise is set for those purposes is always going to be a matter of judgement—a behavioural guess—and the Treasury is as good at that sort of estimate or guess as any. What we do take issue with is excise actions in one alcohol category—in this case RTDs—in isolation from action in other alcohol categories which are capable of being easily substituted for the targeted category. The behavioural logic is easy: price affects consumption; raising the price should lower consumption. However, if there are easy substitutes, no significant fall in consumption will occur, so you have to raise the price of all substitutes too.
What was disturbing at both the June Senate budget estimates and at the committee inquiry was that the question of substitution seems to have been swept aside or diminished in importance. Yet it is central to the question of whether a premixed drink excise increase will work at all in reducing the harmful consumption of premixed drinks, particularly by young people.
At the time of the announcement of this excise increase for premixed drinks, the Democrats said that it must be matched by other action. That is exactly what the chair has said; it is exactly what the deputy chair has said. Despite helpful reform in the last decade, for which they should get credit, the federal government’s alcohol tax policy lacks integrity and consistency.
The Democrats essentially say that alcohol is alcohol whatever its source, yet the alcohol-pricing regime is selective between and within alcohol categories, not on rational grounds but on random grounds. The detrimental effect of alcohol comes from the amount consumed, not from its type, its packaging or its flavour. Accordingly, the Democrats put forward two recommendations. Our first was that the Henry tax review examining alcohol taxation have regard to these three general principles: all products in the same product category should be taxed at the same rate; all products with the same alcohol level should be taxed at the same rate; and the lower-alcohol and mid-strength beer excise should be matched with a lower-alcohol and mid-strength RTD excise rate.
Our second recommendation followed on from the Senate’s unanimous call, agreed on 13 March 2008, for a full review of alcohol policy—and by ‘full’ I mean very comprehensive. Our second recommendation was that the government comply with the Senate motion of 13 March 2008 calling for a comprehensive, holistic review of all aspects of alcohol. If there is anything that this inquiry has shown, it is that you cannot address this matter in isolation. You cannot just deal with the RTD issue. The government, I think, would be delinquent not to heed the Senate’s unanimous call for a comprehensive inquiry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,32,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-06-24,"—The Greens tabled additional comments to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs report entitled Ready-to-drink alcohol beverages. We have expressed for quite some time our concern about alcohol and alcohol abuse in our community. We consider that it is a waste of time arguing about whether or not some drinking rates have gone up. The fact is that we have a $15 billion plus problem in this country that we needs to start dealing with. As I have just said, it is a waste of time arguing about how much risky drinking has increased or decreased. However, very fortuitously during the inquiry, a report by Michael Livingston was published in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health. The report showed very clearly that instances of alcohol related harm had definitely gone up. It also pointed out that it is very difficult to measure risky drinking behaviour because many of the groups that display this behaviour are hard to survey. But the fact is that alcohol related harm has gone up in this country, and the statistics clearly show that.
While the inquiry focused on ready-to-drink alcohol for a specific reason, it is important to note that the Greens very strongly believe that a comprehensive strategy is needed to deal with this issue. While RTDs, or ready-to-drinks, are a particular issue, they need a comprehensive strategy to deal with them. One of the reasons that RTDs are a particular focus is that there has been a shift towards drinking those types of alcoholic beverages. Anecdotal evidence and, I think, increasingly research evidence shows that RTDs are a focus because they encourage young people to drink. The milk and sweetness in RTDs cover the flavour of the alcohol. I will just diverge here to point out that, during the inquiry, an industry person who was questioned about this said that they did not add sugar to RTDs because there is cola in them. If you look at the make-up of cola, you will see that it contains a great deal of sugar; hence, you do not need to add sugar because the cola adds the sugar. The fact is that these drinks are sweet and attractive to young people. The theory being put forward is that these beverages are encouraging young people to drink because, when you are young, your body rejects the taste of alcohol, whereas milk, sugar and cola mask the taste of the alcohol.
As the opposition pointed out, the government’s proposed changes to the alcohol excise regime will raise a substantive amount of income. If the government is genuine in saying that that measure is part of a strategy to address alcohol abuse and harm in this country, it needs to be hypothecating a great deal of that money to effective public education and social marketing programs.

"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2008-06-24,"—I rise to first of all say how distressed I am with the way this legislation has been handled by the government. Schedule 3 to the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008 relates to the establishment of carbon sink forests, and there was an expectation that that is how it would be dealt with. It is still in this bill as schedule 3 except that, in the House of Representatives, the legislation was amended and the schedule was inserted into another tax bill, which was passed in the Reps, came to the Senate and, because exactly the same schedule was in two tax bills at the same time, and the government whip did not notify the Senate that that was the case, that tax bill passed last week with an expectation from those of us who had been dealing with it that it would be in this bill this week. I think that is very bad because now it means that those of us who might have wished to oppose that schedule have been denied the opportunity to do so. The best we can do is amend this legislation. I want to make the point that, had the government not done that, I would have opposed the schedule—however, now it is law in Australia; it went through last week. So it is now my intention in the committee stage of this bill to introduce a new schedule 7 which amends the legislation that went through last week. I would particularly ask the government in future, if it is your intention to put schedules in two or more bills simultaneously, to at least let the whips alert the other people in the Senate to that; otherwise, it could be seen as pulling a swiftie on the Senate, particularly in relation to this, which is highly contentious.
It is contentious because managed investment schemes in Australia have already distorted the way that agricultural land is managed. Throughout the country, farmers are up in arms because the forest industry has been able to move in and displace crop land because of the incentives being offered by the government through tax-deductibility. For example, there was a recent article in the press about how cane farmers in the Tully area are complaining that, once again, the forest industry has moved in there and displaced many cane growers to the point where they are running out of the critical mass needed to provide the mill. In Tasmania, the managed investment schemes have displaced a number of dairy farms and have effectively destroyed whole districts by taking out the social infrastructure. Preolenna, in the north-west of Tasmania, for example, was a vibrant small rural community which had its own postal service, community hall and school bus run, but it now has none of those things. It is covered in plantations—plantations that have been established to distort the market in agricultural areas, in my view. All of those services have been lost and dairy farmers have essentially been driven out of the district.
What this legislation purports to do is establish carbon forest sinks. But this shows the wrongheadedness of the government. If you were serious about reducing emissions, the first thing you would do is protect the existing stores of carbon. The first thing you would do, therefore, is stop the logging of native forests and stop land clearance in Australia. You would be offering incentives for people to protect the sinks that are already there because, especially in the case of native forests, they are high-value carbon stores. But, instead of that, the government is giving massive subsidies to the logging industry to log native forests and to burn them—sending millions of tonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere—and now wants to pay people at exactly the same time to put in tree farms using managed investment schemes.
They say, ‘Oh, they are carbon sink forests.’ How are they carbon sink forests? A forest is a much more complex ecosystem than a monoculture plantation, and yet this bill provides for the establishment of plantations. Secondly, if it were a carbon sink forest, you would require the trees to be in the ground for a length of time so that you established a carbon store. But, instead of that, you will be able to get a tax deduction for the full amount in the first year. There is no requirement for these so-called carbon sinks to be in the ground for any length of time and you can cut them down. There is no prohibition on cutting them down. If you cut them down, you do not have to pay back the tax deduction you got in the first year. So once you have your tax deduction in the first year, you can choose to leave those trees in the ground, if indeed they grow. They may not grow because, as with many of the managed investment schemes, they were put in for the tax-deductibility for the management of those schemes. The poor old people who invested will lose out in the long run, but the companies that run the schemes will have made a fortune because they established managed investment schemes in areas without sufficient rainfall to maintain the plantation.
In this case we have exactly the same thing. We have this possibility because it says in the bill that the people establishing these plantations, or so-called sinks, do not have to have any relationship to the land or the industry on the land. That means the energy companies, the large coal sector generators, the cement companies and so on will go out there and buy or lease agricultural land. They are already cashed up and they will get the irrigation rights and take the water from the farmers as well. They will establish these plantations and get their tax-deductibility in the early years. If they choose to deduct it over 14 years, which is another option, they get the tax deduction over 14 years—coincidently, the maturation life of one cycle in a plantation. But, if they do that and the plantation burns down halfway through, let us say, they not only get to keep the tax-deductibility that they have already got; they also get a one-off bonus payment plus the insurance money. So it is a beautiful thing! It is all about cash incentives for people who want to offset their income, or offset their emissions in the case of the large emitters, but it is not about increasing the carbon store in the ground permanently.
The issue here has to be permanence. There is no permanence with this legislation. There is no requirement for mixed species. There is no requirement for hydrological assessment of the area in which these so-called carbon sink forests are going to be planted. There is no requirement to assess the socioeconomic impact in rural and regional Australia of cashed-up companies coming and displacing farmers from the land, and that is inevitably what is going to occur here. What is even more extraordinary is that the government is doing this in the lead-up to Professor Garnaut’s emissions-trading report. This immediately distorts the market because on the one hand you are saying we are putting a cap on emissions, and these large carbon-emitting companies—the coal companies, for example—will have to meet their cap and buy permits, but at the same time you are giving them a tax deduction for going off and planting offsets when there is no guarantee of the volumes of carbon that will be in the ground after any length of time. It will be a lot cheaper for them to go and push farmers off the land than it will be to reduce their emissions at the power station.
So this legislation should never have been brought in ahead of an emissions-trading scheme, because it distorts the market in terms of the actual costs associated with it. But, more particularly, as I said, if you were serious about reducing emissions from land use, land use change and forestry, you would create a tax-deductibility for people to protect existing carbon stores, whether they be in forests, complex native forest systems, savannas or other types of native vegetation. This legislation says that, whilst you will not get a deduction for draining a wetland, you will get a deduction if you have already drained the wetland and then put the trees on it. So you can work out the costs of that. There are no biodiversity considerations, no water considerations, no diverse species considerations and essentially no length of time that these trees have to be in the ground. That is an absolute requirement if you are going to consider a carbon sink.
—Order! Pursuant to the order of the Senate of 17 June 2008, debate is now interrupted and I call on Senator Murray to make a valedictory statement.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2008-06-24,"—Before the dinner break I stood to address the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008 and the issue of what was schedule 3 and which will now be the subject of my new amendment for proposed schedule 7. If rural Australia was already worried about managed investment schemes then it should also be worried about this legislation, which is about managed investment schemes on steroids. That is the only way I can describe it.
Let me explain again why this is such a bad idea. It is supposedly to establish forests that will be of long-term use in absorbing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The Bills Digest says in its conclusions:
... the proposed deduction encourages the rapid establishment of these forests during the next few years.
That means the rapid establishment of plantations—yet more plantations on the backs of taxpayers and, in forgone revenue, they are going to cost $25.3 million in the forthcoming three years. This is the National Association of Forest Industries getting yet another major boost for plantation establishment around the country and starting up yet another whole raft of managed investment scheme types of companies, which will be out there getting 100 per cent tax-deductibility in the first year for establishing plantations.
As I said before, there is no requirement for these plantations to be biodiverse. There is no requirement for a hydrological study to look at the impact of these plantations on catchments, yet we already know that plantations are drying up catchments and destroying the water supplies of many towns around Australia. There is no requirement to look at the impact on existing land uses. As I mentioned earlier, the cane growers in Tully are a classic case. Well, on the north-west coast of Tasmania we are taking good food-growing land out of food production and putting it towards plantations, not because it is justified but so Collins Street investors can get up-front tax deductions to minimise their own incomes and maximise their own wealth, at the cost of food production and at the cost of local farmers.
Why is this the case? What is so horribly wrong with this? First of all, the federal government is meant to be taking a whole-of-government approach to climate change. This is a taxation measure which in theory ought to be assisting, not undermining, the effort on climate change. Why isn’t it? The reason is this. The IPCC report shows that, on all the science analysis, climate change is getting worse by the minute. We have not even until 2015 to significantly reduce our emissions. Bali’s starting negotiation point was 25 to 40 per cent reductions below 1990 levels by 2020. So the aim of the exercise should be to maximise the carbon store we have now got in the ground and keep it there and protect it, because we have huge volumes of carbon in our standing native forests, and in our savannahs and in our native vegetation around the country. If we subsidise the knocking down of those forests, we are putting into the atmosphere millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide. On the other side of the ledger, if we then give tax-deductibility for these schemes to plant plantations, it will take up to a hundred years, if those plantations survive, for us to be able to store as much carbon as can be stored in the forests that we are currently knocking down. And we do not have 80 to 100 years—we have only until 2015 at the maximum—to reduce these carbon dioxide emissions.
The problem with this whole legislation is it is based on Kyoto accounting. By that I mean that what we get credit for is afforestation and reforestation—that is, planting so-called forests, being plantations, on land that was cleared before 1990—but we do not get penalised for the emissions that we put into the atmosphere from the logging of forests. So all of those forests in Tasmania that are being logged, those dense old-growth forests, are regarded as being neutral for the purposes of Kyoto accounting, because, as long as the land use does not change and as long as you put in a plantation on private land or you regenerate on public land, it is regarded as neutral, because over hundreds of years it would be. But we are not doing this over hundreds of years. We do not have hundreds of years. So it is complete madness to give out taxpayers’ money to knock down carbon stores and put hundreds of millions of tonnes into the atmosphere and then give tax deductions to try to take a small fraction of those out of the atmosphere in the next 10 years. But that is what the government is doing.
What the minister has to explain here tonight is why the government is giving a tax deduction for planting plantations that are not biodiverse and are not required to be in the ground for any length of time and is providing subsidies to knock down carbon stores. If there were a whole-of-government approach the first thing you would do to reduce your emissions would be to protect your carbon stores by protecting your native vegetation. If you were going to go for establishing carbon sinks you would look at restoration forestry in areas that have been degraded and, again, look at building up mixed species. You would look at protecting more standing forest rather than displacing people off farms. Furthermore, this is yet another example of the destruction of the integrity—if there ever will be any in the end—of a supposed emissions-trading scheme. Instead of making the coal industry, in particular the coal-fired electricity generators, compete on an even playing field, you are giving them a tax deduction to go out and plant plantations in order to offset their emissions, rather than forcing them to reduce their emissions at the power station. There is no attempt by the government to do that by forcing them to implement the easiest energy efficiency opportunities which they are forced to identify but not forced to implement.
Today’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory clearly makes this point: transport emissions are going up, energy generation emissions are on the way up, fugitive emissions from coalmining are on the way up and coal accounts for 70 per cent of the increase in our emissions. And what is this bill doing? It is saying to rush out and plant out rural Australia with plantations to try to mop it all up, rather than saying: deal with the issue at the source. But, even more ridiculously, it is about subsidising more emissions into the atmosphere from logging than will be absorbed from these plantations for which you are driving the farmers of Australia off their land to actually establish.
I would like to know from the minister what the justification is for there being no time frame in this legislation requiring the length of time for these so-called forests to be in the ground. What is the justification for them not being mixed species—local native mixed species? What is the justification for no hydrological assessment and no assessment of the impacts on existing industries in that area—whether it is dairies, cane or whatever else? Rural Australia is already up in arms. And it is no use Senator Boswell rushing around Queensland saying, ‘Oh dear, the MISs have been terrible for cane,’ because he is about to vote for something that will be worse. It will make the situation far worse.
I am really appalled by the fact that, if the plantation that you plant burns down in a bushfire, not only do you not have to make good—you do not have to pay back the tax deduction you got for establishing it—but you get the rest of your tax deduction paid out, plus a bonus, plus your insurance money. So there are no worries! You can get a 100 per cent tax deduction up front or you can take it over 14 years, which is coincidentally the life of a plantation. And, if it burns down after eight years, you get the tax deduction paid out up to the eight years, plus a bonus, plus your insurance. This is yet another mechanism for investors to make money out of the government—and it will be $24.3 million out of the government—minimise their incomes, invest in reducing their own mortgages or whatever, drive farmers off the land and do nothing for climate change.
There will be a net loss of carbon, as there is right now, and the only reason forestry pretends there is not is that there is not yet full carbon accounting. Native forest logging is regarded as neutral and, until we get proper accounting, we will have this distorted, ridiculous pretence about the level of emissions coming out of the forest sector in Australia. I foreshadow that I have amendments which will require mixed species, which will require the trees to be in the ground a hundred years and which will require information on hydrological and other ecological impacts as well as impacts on surrounding land uses. As I said before, I would have been voting against this schedule but, in what can only be seen as a sleight of hand, the government switched the schedules. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,38,1
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2008-06-24,"—I want to say a couple of words, albeit briefly, in relation to the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008. The opposition is concerned that at the eleventh hour we were given some quite considerable amendments. We will be supporting the government in relation to those and we will be opposing the bill, which will come as no surprise to anyone. But we are a little surprised, quite frankly, that it took them until the eleventh hour. This bill has been around for a long time. There are very detailed amendments to this bill, but I will address those when we get into committee.
I want to speak tonight about schedule 1. Schedules 2 to 6 were effectively dealt with last week, so the remaining matter that we have is schedule 1. I refer to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters advisory report on the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008, and I would draw the honourable senators’ attention to the minority report tabled on behalf of Mr Morrison and Mr Scott from the other place, Senator Birmingham and me. I will not go into great detail, but what the minority report effectively indicates is that there is no reason for this legislation to proceed in light of the quite detailed reference that is presently before the joint standing committee. We have asked on numerous occasions, and the minor parties have asked on numerous occasions, for the Senate to agree to deferring these bills until we can look at this whole political donation issue.
Honourable senators have heard me talk about my view of the rationale for this bill and also for the political disclosure bill, and we believe it is to address the political imperatives of the government and it is not addressing the real issue, which is political financing and donations. The committee tried, along with the Nationals, the Liberals and Senator Brown, to oppose it. I read from page 45 of the minority report:
Coalition Party members of the Committee, together with Senator Bob Brown of the Greens, have opposed this inquiry proceeding in isolation, preferring that the matters referred by the Senate in relation to the Bill, be taken up as part of the committee’s broader inquiry. This position was rejected by Government members of the committee on the casting vote of the Government Chairman.
For the honourable senators who were at this inquiry, it became very clear—as is articulated in the minority report—that there is no reason for this bill to proceed now. The evidence given by Treasury quite clearly shows that the Senate cannot rely on the figures that were given during that inquiry to substantiate the government’s claims in relation to revenue savings. They do not support the position of the government, and we believe that is the first reason.
I will read the first recommendation of the minority report:
That consideration by the Senate of the proposal by the Government for the removal of tax-deductibility for contributions and gifts made to political parties be deferred until such time that the committee has had the opportunity to conclude its broader inquiry into the 2007 federal election, including the extensive review of issues relating to campaign finance reform, furthermore no consideration should be given to the Bill until the Government makes its Green Paper public.
I refer the Senate back to the terms of reference lodged by me and supported by the Senate. This was lodged by me on 11 March and referred to the committee on 12 March. The inquiry, and, again, it was supported by the minor parties, was to be an exhaustive inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I will read the start of the motion I moved on 12 March:
That the following matter be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for inquiry and report:
All aspects of the 2007 Federal Election and matters related thereto, with particular reference to ...
The motion goes on to refer in part (a) to the level of donations. The second part, part (b), refers to political fundraising. The third part, part (c), says:
(c) the take up, by whom and by what groups, of current provisions for tax-deductibility for political donations as well as other groups with tax-deductibility that involve themselves in the political process without disclosing that tax-deductible funds are being used …
The Senate, quite rightly in my view, made that referral. Part of that referral was for JSCEM, as the committee is known by honourable senators, to look at all these matters in conjunction with its inquiry into the 2007 election. There was no grey area here; it is quite clear. Those terms of reference, and everything involved in those terms of reference, including tax-deductibility and disclosure, were to be covered in the context of the committee’s inquiry. I am a member of that committee. We have substantial inquiries coming up right throughout Australia. I saw from the committee’s schedule that Senator Brown will be coming to a large number of those inquiries. That 2007 federal election inquiry takes into account, because of the motion passed by this chamber, a large number of matters, including tax-deductibility.
As the minority report says, there are some real issues in relation to equity. It is interesting that equity has been used by some to defend this legislation. I will go to page 48 and quote the minority report. It says:
The arguments for inequity were not raised unprompted in the hearing undertaken by the committee, and were raised only by the Chair late in the hearing, quoting from the submission received after deadline by Mr Sempill and Dr Tham as follows:
the current provisions are inequitable on several counts. They discriminate against those who do not have to pay tax. Job seekers, retirees without income, full-time parents and students not engaged in paid work who make small contributions or take out party membership are denied the benefit of the current system ...
The report then goes on:
In response to questioning by the Chair—
that is, Mr Melham from the other place; he was the chair of the committee—
in relation to this statement, Professor Orr—
from the Democratic Audit of Australia—
put this issue in its proper perspective:
As I said, you might as well say that any form of tax-deductibility, including donations to charity, discriminate against such people ...
The report goes on to say:
The only real argument advanced for this initiative in the majority report is an argument for the abolition of tax deductions in general. Coalition Party members of the committee do not believe such an argument can be accepted to justify the isolated progression of the measure contained in this Bill.
In further response to the Chairman’s comments regarding inequity, the advantage to Members of Parliament over members of the community was highlighted in evidence given.
This is the second point I want to raise. I find it quite extraordinary that this chamber would allow members of parliament to have effectively unlimited tax-deductibility to guarantee their own preselection or to curry favour within their own political party, yet if a member of the public wants to make a contribution to the process they will be denied that. I find that an extraordinary notion, and I find it extraordinary that this chamber would actually allow that to occur. Why would we allow members of parliament to curry favour within their own parties to achieve preselection but not be prepared to allow a citizen of this country the opportunity to participate and receive a tax deduction for a contribution to a political party? It beggars belief. I honestly do not believe that you can allow such a system, where members of parliament are in a privileged position and members of the community are denied even the smallest tax-deductibility for the smallest donation, to remain. That is why this should be considered in the context of these exhaustive terms of reference.
I think it was bitterly disappointing that Mr Melham from the other place used his casting vote on that committee when he had a very clear indication—in fact, I would say a bipartisan indication—from the Nationals, the Liberals and the Greens in relation to what we believed should happen with this legislation. Given everything that has gone on in relation to this, to actually allow members of parliament a privileged position I think is unacceptable—and I hope it is unacceptable to others in this chamber, apart from the Australian Labor Party, which I understand will be insisting on this legislation being put to the vote.
As I said earlier, the Australian Taxation Office were actually not in a position to justify the government’s estimation of revenue gained and expenditure saved. They were simply not able to. In fact, if you read the transcript, it is quite clear that they were, at best, guesstimates. No doubt I will hear from Senator Conroy about the budget and other matters, but I say to Senator Conroy through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that it is incumbent upon any government to ensure that when they make political points about savings they can actually justify them. Anyone who cares to read the transcript of the evidence given by Treasury will understand very quickly that, despite their very best endeavours, they were unable to justify and substantiate the figures that the government has claimed in relation to savings.
In conclusion, I want to talk about the ALP’s past support for tax-deductibility for political donations. In its submission to the JSCEM report on the 1987 election and 1988 referendums, the ALP claimed: ‘The additional funds raised by political parties with tax-deductibility advantage would alleviate any pressure for increased levels of public funding, encourage political parties to continue to seek direct support from the public and help them more adequately fulfil their social functions.’
In December 1991, the Hawke government voted along party lines and introduced tax-deductibility for political donations of up to $100. The Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991, assented to on 19 December, gave effect to the introduction of tax-deductibility for political donations of up to $100. That bill was introduced by the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Kim Beazley. The ALP in government, making up the majority of JSCEM, had nothing to say about the issue of tax-deductibility of contributions to political parties in the reports on the 1990 and 1993 elections. The JSCEM report on the 1996 election included a recommendation to make donations of up to $1,500 annually to a political party, whether from an individual or a corporation tax-deductible. And, in the same report, the ALP nominated $1,500 as the maximum level for tax-deductibility. The JSCEM report on the 1996 election was unanimous in recommending:
... that donations to a political party of up to $1500 annually, whether from an individual or a corporation, are tax-deductible.
Membership of that committee, which unanimously recommended tax-deductibility for donations of up to $1,500 for both individuals and corporations, included Senator Stephen Conroy, who was the deputy chair, Mr Robert McClelland, from the other place, and Mr Laurie Ferguson, from the other place. And I do not need to remind honourable senators that Senator Conroy is now a cabinet minister, that Mr McClelland is now the Attorney-General and that Mr Ferguson is now a parliamentary secretary—or he is at the moment; we will see what transpires over the next couple of months.
You cannot talk about the benefits of tax-deductibility and then turn around, with no justification at all, and go ahead—not supported by Treasury, not supported by evidence given to the committee, where the majority of people who gave evidence, irrespective of their views about whether there should or should not be tax-deductibility, viewed it as inappropriate for the matter to be dealt with at that moment. Indeed, they viewed it as appropriate for it to be discussed in the context of potential further, substantial changes.
I refer to comments I made the other day about the disclosure bill. They were matters that are going to be part of the green paper. How can you put through legislation that is going to be part of a green paper? How can you put forward a bill in relation to tax-deductibility that is also going to be part of a green paper? Senator Brown is in the chamber tonight. I believe that Senator Brown genuinely wants to discuss appropriate reform. We are quite happy to sit down with the government and discuss appropriate reform, but was the opposition part of the green paper negotiations or discussions? No. Wouldn’t you think, if this was such an important issue for the Prime Minister, that he would have said to Dr Nelson, the Leader of the Opposition, ‘Why don’t you and I sit down and have some discussions about what we are going to put into this green paper so that we can get an appropriate outcome?’ Rather than speak to the opposition about this, the discussions were with the state premiers. We saw the impact of that recently. We saw the impact of the New South Wales committee, which actually put out a very significant and substantial report, but we did not see anything from Premier Iemma, who was part of the consultative process about what was going to be in the green paper.
I will end where I started. The only reason that you can possibly insist on this piecemeal cherry picking involving disclosure and tax-deductibility is that you want to be seen to be doing something, and the only reason the government wants to be seen to be doing something at the moment is Wollongong. We are absolutely convinced that Wollongong has driven this piecemeal approach. We are convinced that this cherry picking is driven by the Wollongong sex and bribery scandal, and again we say to the government: if you want to sit down and talk about this sensibly, we will participate. I believe the Australian Greens want to sit down and participate properly in moving forward. We most certainly do, and I would be surprised if the Independents did not as well. We have said it before; we will say it again: we want this done holistically. We are not prepared to sit back and watch the government cherry pick parts of reform for their own cheap political purposes and we will be opposing this bill tonight.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,38,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-06-24,"—I am obliged to Senator Ronaldson for that contribution, and I will come back to it in a moment. I firstly want to say that the Australian Greens will be supporting the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008. But let me explain that. There were six parts to this bill; there is essentially now one—that is, a measure to remove tax-deductibility for donations towards election campaigns. That is what Senator Ronaldson was largely talking about a moment ago. But another part of the bill, which was dealt with last week in the main, is to allow tax-deductibility for the establishment of plantations as carbon offsets, and Senator Milne has explained that. So we have two things: one about election spending, and the other about tax-deductibility for people who put in trees under specified conditions to offset greenhouse gas emissions.
Let me deal with the first first. As Senator Ronaldson indicated, the Greens are very keen to get public input on tax-deductibility for election campaign spending. I understand that the government is going to be working on this quite a bit over the coming months. We favour the abolition of tax-deductibility for donations for electoral purposes. We have to vote on that measure tonight, and we will vote for it. Senator Ronaldson pointed out an anomaly for people who make donations to political parties, if this bill passes—and it sounds like it may not because the opposition, the coalition, still has the numbers and therefore can block the passage of that bill up until Thursday of this week, and then we will see what happens when we come back at the end of August.
The anomaly Senator Ronaldson spoke about is that MPs will still be able to tax-deduct their contribution for their own re-election or for their party’s re-election. It raises the interesting possibility—doesn’t it?—of us doing what Senator Ronaldson wants but in reverse, which is to abolish the tax-deductibility for spending which comes from members themselves towards their election campaign or their party election campaign. Let’s be the same as the rest of the public and let’s ensure that money that we get as servants of the public, as elected members of parliament, goes to the purpose of servicing our electorate. But, where we cross over and put money into election campaigns, let’s—and I am indebted to Senator Ronaldson for this thought—explore the possibility of removing tax-deductibility for that as well. I will certainly speak with my colleagues about making a level playing field in that way.
I want to go to the tax concessions which the government had adopted with the support of the opposition for the planting of trees—and they are wonderful indeed. If you plant more than 0.2 hectares, a fifth of a hectare, of trees which are to grow in their maturity to cover more than 20 per cent of the land in which they stand, as far as their canopy is concerned—in other words 80 per cent of the land need not be covered by tree canopy—you get whacking big tax deductions for that, and you only have to maintain the plantation for 14 years. As Senator Milne pointed out, indeed there is a fairly handsome compensation program: if on the 15th year the whole plantation is burnt to the ground, you can get your insurance for that and then retain the tax-deductibility you got way back 14 years earlier when you put into this scheme.
How can it be that we have a government putting this forward and an opposition supporting it in an age where there is a need to be scrupulous in addressing the matter of climate change? We are dealing with a piece of legislation which says, ‘You’ll get a tax reward if you plant trees, and you’ll be able to hang on to that even if they’re burnt to the ground 15 years later and all that greenhouse gas goes into the atmosphere.’ There is no penalty clause; there is no need to ensure that you have fire procedures to prevent that from happening. In fact, one could see an incentive built into this legislation for there to be more bushfires than we have seen in a long, long time coming down the line. Then presumably you can plant the same area of ground again and, if the intent of this legislation is followed through, get all the tax-deductibility again and put in another plantation. Fifteen years later you have all that tax-deductibility and you do not have to maintain it any further—it can be burnt to the ground again.
—Or logged.
—Or logged, as Senator Milne said. It is irresponsible legislation. We are talking about taxpayers’ money, because this is tax forgone. It does not go into the exchequer; it is not available for tackling climate change or for assisting public schools or hospitals. It is going to, and it will obviously go to, big corporations, coal corporations, aluminium corporations—polluters—because they are the people with the money to buy up vast amounts of land, including food-producing land, and get a huge windfall through this scheme to put in plantations for which they have no responsibility 15 years down the line. Incredible!
Senator Milne proposes a new schedule, which says, ‘You will have to keep those trees for a hundred years; you will have to see them through to maturity,’ and the government says, ‘We’re not going to support that.’ And the opposition says, ‘We won’t support that either.’ I will tell you what has happened here. The very, very powerful coal and logging industries at the front of the queue, at the open doors of the ministry of this new government, have handed across this legislation. It has not been thought through. It is now being dumped on the Senate and will perhaps be passed, and later on we will have newspaper articles about what an absolute rort it was. It has taken Senator Milne to pick up on it, and it will take the Greens to question the government carefully in committee about the various components of the program through the new schedule that Senator Milne has brought forward.
One thing that I will be asking the government about is the definition of a forest. They have invented a new definition. The government can get up and tell me if I am wrong, but the logging industry had a big hand in this legislation; it is written all over it. As I said, the definition of a forest for this planet-saving plantation forest through which taxpayers are going to be able to avoid millions of dollars in tax, this ill thought out scheme, is one where it can be reasonably expected that when these trees grow to maturity—and remember trees do not grow in 15 years; in the main, they take a century or more and most of the trees in our eucalypt forests go on to live for centuries—the canopy of the planted trees will cover 20 per cent of the land on which they stand. Hey bingo, you have a forest!
Mr Acting Deputy President Barnett, we are from Tasmania. I sought out the accepted definition of a forest according to the Forestry Industries Association of Tasmania. Here it is:
The term forest is used to define areas of land where trees exceeding five meters in height (current or potential) dominate an area, and where the tree canopy shades more than thirty percent of the ground surface.
The forest industry itself defines a forest as having a canopy that covers 30 per cent of the ground, but we look into this legislation and suddenly find that the definition of a forest for the purposes of this legislation is one that covers 20 per cent. Marvellous, is it not, that millions of dollars in tax deductions are going to be taken out of public moneys by already wealthy organisations planting trees to make forests that do not qualify under the definition of forests? Even when they grow to maturity, they will cover two-thirds of the land that the industry itself says they would need to cover to qualify as forests.
Moreover, you will note from that definition that the trees, if they are in a forest, are destined to be at least five metres in height. Have a look at the definition in this tax avoidance legislation—they have to grow to only two metres. Suddenly the whole world’s definition of forests, worked out by the experts, is dropped by the industry itself and by the corporate sector, which have written this legislation to allow tax-deductibility for a plantation that is never going to be in the region of what has always been defined as a forest.
Under the legislation, you need to make sure that the land you are planting did not have a forest on it on 1 January 1990—that is the Kyoto protocol basic measuring date—which could have grown to be a forest two metres high or covering 20 per cent of the land. In other words, the land needs to have been cleared. You can put your forest on that land and you will get the tax-deductibility. But, if somebody planted a plantation on that land in 1991 and by now it has grown or would have grown into a forest much bigger than this definition, you can flatten it, you can burn it down, you can do what you like. You can release tonnes of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere and replace it with a much inferior forest that is going to meet only the two metres and 20 per cent canopy definition—a much inferior forest in terms of holding back carbon—and get tax-deductibility for it. You are going to be rewarded for destroying an established plantation which has a greater planet-saving capability than the one defined in this legislation. You will get no reward for the plantation that stood there.
Money runs these things, so flatten that, destroy the wildlife and destroy the biology of that piece of country and this government—and that includes the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Wong; the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Peter Garrett; and the Prime Minister, the Hon. Kevin Rudd—will reward you for doing the wrong thing, by any measure, to reduce the carbon load in the atmosphere. In fact, by increasing it you will be rewarded; you will get massive tax deductions under this scheme. How poorly thought out is this? What a rort it will be! Here is a reward system for doing the wrong thing by the environment.
I have circulated an amendment which will at least deal with that last matter, because it says that, if there was existing, in 1990 or at any time since, a forest which measured up to the 20 per cent canopy and two metres high rule, you cannot claim tax-deductibility for that land. That is plain common sense. I gave that amendment to Minister Wong this afternoon. I know that the experts in the government are looking at it. I would expect that the government, and indeed the opposition, will support that amendment.
This is very serious legislation, which requires very serious amendment. Senator Milne and I have put forward amendments. Senator Milne has a new schedule which, in one go, says that these forests are going to have to be dinkum and are going to have to be there for at least a hundred years. Why would you not say that if you expect to protect the welfare not just of the corporations now but of the planet into the future? In other words, these trees that are planted now to offset dangerous climate change will need to be there for our children and our grandchildren to see, and they will be the custodians.
I cannot believe that this legislation is as it is. I will be astonished if the government does not support these amendments and I will be astonished if the opposition does not support them either.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,38,1
"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2008-06-24,"—I have not brought any notes, but I can speak because I have a full understanding of the implications of what has been a serious oversight by this parliament with the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008. We need to fix it. I presume that the government will not support the Greens amendments, but I am hopeful that the government will come up with their own solution, because we need a solution. This legislation was switched from the No. 1 tax bill to the No. 2 tax bill and it was non-controversial. It is seriously, seriously flawed.
The fact is that this bill for carbon sinks will open up, for all those adventurous people and likeable lads in the community, a rort. With great respect to anyone who thinks that it is not the case—I am happy to have a private conversation with them—this bill is absolutely and fundamentally flawed. It allows a person for the first four years, till 2010 or 2011—I have not got notes before me—to cop a tax deduction up-front which is predominantly for the planting of trees for a carbon sink. There is a whole lot of technical advice around that. That would be fair enough if it had a covenant and some sort of easement security around it, but what will happen—and I am a farmer and I concede that we are all likeable rogues in the bush; as Kerry Packer said, why pay more tax than you need to?—is that this bill will become a fundamental tax rort.
I concede that the government, in its generosity to me and others, has looked at this and has got advice from the department. I am hopeful that, not necessarily tonight but in the future, the government will solve this issue. But what will happen in practice is that a farmer—take me, for instance—will lease a paddock, as long as it is 0.2 of a hectare or greater in size, to someone who will come along and say: ‘I’ll plant trees there for a carbon sink and I’ll cop the tax deduction up-front. I’ve got a big income this year. I’m not going to go for the write-off over 14 years.’ Then the next year I might have a heart attack and sell the farm. The next bloke that comes along might say: ‘Who was the silly bugger that planted all those bloody trees down on that beautiful food-producing flat? I could be growing corn or something there.’ He could then plough them in. And there is nothing in the legislation to prevent that. There is absolutely nothing in the legislation to prevent that, and I defy anyone to stand up in this chamber and say there is.
Also, as probably has been pointed out, if you are a likeable lad you can plant this carbon sink and, if you have some sort of natural disaster—it does not rain and the trees all die—you still get the tax deduction. You have got no trees. You could have a fire and cop the insurance money plus the tax deduction and have nothing to show for the environment. Surely to God this parliament in its wisdom will fix this very seriously flawed legislation.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,38,1
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2008-06-24,"—I wish to take part in this debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008 very briefly in relation to the difficulties of carbon sinks. Carbon sinks will cause competition problems for managed investment in forests because there will be another competitor forcing up the price of a scarce resource—that is, the land. Carbon sinks will put challenges before primary producers because a lot of pastoral land, in particular, will go under carbon sinks. In my state, we are becoming increasingly conscious that good, arable land suitable for prime crops is going under trees. Anybody who is a botanist must surely be worried about an increasing lack of diversity in our forests, which is a problem. In a few years time, nature being what it is, there will be a huge risk of fires and disease outbreak problems.
Tonight I was talking to an actuary in Parliament House. His focus is increasingly being directed towards risk assessment in terms of fires wiping out huge areas in not only Tasmania but also other parts of Australia, as a result of the perhaps inappropriate manner in which plantations have been put in in terms of their density, proximity to buildings, roads and so on. We all know, particularly in Tasmania, the climatic conditions are such that, in the months of February and March, a dry understorey and huge winds can cause the sorts of problems that we saw here in Canberra a few years ago, when plantations were just the other side of the road from residential allotments.
I am very concerned because the people who are going to seek the benefits from this legislation are those with very, very deep pockets—pockets far deeper than those we have had with MIS and pockets far deeper than the farmers’. This is a difficult issue for the farmers because older farmers, upon their retirement, naturally regard obtaining a high price for their land as their superannuation. On the other hand, young farmers who want to come into the industry are finding that the cost of competing with the MIS and the new carbon sinks is making it so much more difficult for them to have a place in agriculture.
In my state of Tasmania, agriculture is certainly facing some very severe challenges. We used to be called the horticultural food bowl of Australia, but I can see us losing that title over the years. This comes at a time when the world is getting short of food. We need as much agricultural land as we can get to put in sustainable crops et cetera. We have got the water and the land. Although we may not have the scale of operation, we have got the factories to produce and further add value to the crops. Organisations such as the CSIRO and other far-sighted scientists should be brought in to this whole issue to see what impact carbon sinks will have on food, food prices, sustainability, the problems with monoculture and the difficulties that we are likely to face with fire. There are certainly challenges.
I will not be voting against the legislation, but I think it is time we woke up and acknowledged that agriculture does have some challenges—challenges that very few people have foreseen. In my closing days of being here in the Senate I draw to the attention of the chamber that I think we have to look very carefully at the nature of the legislation and the entitlements in it because, as my colleague Senator Heffernan and others indicated, there are flaws to this legislation; it is not fail-safe. Look at the ecological issues, the food issues and the risk of what it could be doing to our state. I thank the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,38,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2008-06-24,"—I would like to thank those senators who have taken part in the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008. This bill honours the government’s election commitment to remove tax-deductibility for donations made to political parties, candidates and members. This commitment was made as part of Labor’s $3 billion savings plan, which was announced by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation on 2 March 2007. Currently, deductions are allowed for donations to political parties, members of parliament and candidates, including Independents, of up to a maximum of $1,500. Prior to 2006, donations and membership fees were deductible up to a lower $100 threshold, when the former government implemented an increase up to the current $1,500 and expanded the deduction of donations to independent candidates and members and to donations by business.
The proposal to remove deductibility of political donations has the support of the majority of members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. This measure will save Australian taxpayers about $10 million per annum. Amendments to this bill are to be moved by the government in the committee stage of the debate. The amendments will in part omit schedules 2 to 6 to this bill. These schedules have been incorporated into the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 2) Bill 2008, which passed the Senate on 17 June 2008.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2008-06-24,"—When introducing the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (2008 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2008 in the lower house, the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Ms Macklin, said that it involved $55 billion worth of support for families. We agree with that figure. But I would like to echo the sentiments of Mr Abbott, in the other place, who said that that $55 billion simply would not have been available without the strong financial and economic management of the former Howard government. In fact, this package would have been much bigger than $55 billion under a coalition government because the coalition would not have imposed a means test on payments like the baby bonus and family tax benefit part B. The Howard government knew how to take care of Australian families. It erased the burden of $96 billion worth of debt left by the Keating government. It provided hope, prosperity and optimism for the families of Australia. It built Australia’s economy and Australia had the lowest unemployment rate in over 30 years. It provided an environment of economic prosperity that allowed Australians to reap the benefits. The Labor Party are reinventing history, claiming credit for all that is right in the economy and denying any responsibility for that which is not right. Whereas the former government created an era of prosperity and optimism, Australian families are being let down by the government because they are facing bleak times.
This bill is very important because it does support families. In this age of increasing fragmentation and breakdown of social relationships, it is important that families do receive support and, in this particular instance, financial support. However, it is important to point out that the government did not inform the Australian people before the election that they intended to means test these payments. This is a critical issue. Thousands of families will be less well-off than they expected because of these means tests and because of a sneaky ploy by a desperate opposition to claim the government treasury bench.
This is not what Australians need, quite frankly, especially during this time of increased costs of living and soaring petrol and grocery prices, all of which the Rudd Labor government promised to bring down and all of which they have failed to do. But they have not stopped there. The government intend to continue to pursue means tests as a way of limiting support. How do we know that? The Sydney Morning Herald reported on 15 May that the Treasurer had said there were more plans in the pipeline to means-test other benefits. In fact, I stumbled upon this myself during Senate estimates hearings. I asked a departmental official what considerations had been taken with regard to the autism early intervention package. This departmental official said that they had considered means-testing autism programs but this had been scrapped because it would not have excluded enough families. What sort of heartless government would even consider means-testing a desperately needed early intervention autism package or program? The government are bent on means-testing as many programs as possible, taking money out of the pockets of Australian families and putting it into the Treasury coffers.
Let us turn to the substance of this bill. For the first time the income of primary income earners in partnered families will be tested and will need to be $150,000 or less for them to get access to family tax benefit part B. It maintains the current requirement that the income of the lowest income earner needs to be below $22,302 per annum for the person to qualify for some payment. The current accessibility is not altered in the bill. The income limit, though, of $150,000 will also be applied to sole parent families for the very first time. Minister Macklin has said that this means test will affect about 40,000 families—so 40,000 Australian families will be less well-off than they expected; so 40,000 families will lose some benefit that would have helped them to meet the high and rising costs of living, costs of living that Mr Rudd and the Labor Party had promised to address. Out of these 40,000 families, 12,700 are set to lose access to family tax benefit parts A and B. How do we know this? Not because the Rudd government have volunteered it, but because at the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration inquiry into this bill the government were forced to provide the information after the questioning of Senator Boswell.
If we go back a little bit, the Australian Labor Party, before it was in government, originally suggested that family tax benefit part B be subject to a means test set at $250,000, up to where it said ordinary Australians could be struggling. So how does this coincide with a means test at $150,000? Clearly, this government is changing its mind at every turn. Someone in the Prime Minister’s office wakes up and says, ‘Let’s just change the rules of the game.’ It is playing with people’s finances as if it is playing a game of Monopoly. Australians simply deserve better. It is the same story with the baby bonus. If you earn over $150,000 a year, you are no longer eligible for it. As my colleague Mr Abbott said:
Mothers do not get the baby bonus because they need it; mothers get the baby bonus because they deserve it.
Minister Macklin has said that 16,000 families will no longer receive the baby bonus due to this means test. Again, thousands of families will be less well-off than they expected, all because the Labor government was not honest with the Australian people before the election.
There are many problems with this particular measure. First among these is that the baby bonus means test lacks what has been described as a taper, which means that a single extra dollar of income can be the difference between receiving a needed baby bonus and receiving absolutely nothing. Evidence presented to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration shows that the government did not commission any modelling on tapering this particular means test. They did not look at the potential benefits for families. They just said, ‘No, let’s whack it in—$150,000—and be done with it.’ Mr Lachlan Harris probably woke up in a bad mood that day, and Australian families are much worse off.
—He might wake up tomorrow in a good mood.
—Perhaps tomorrow he may wake up in a good mood and Australian families may receive something more, but it is unlikely. What we have also learned is that people may get around this threshold by organising their benefits or their salary to be paid after the six-month deadline so that they can receive the baby bonus and still earn in excess of the cap.
Minister Macklin has stated that, if the income estimate is incorrect and the household actually earns over $75,000 in the six months subsequent to having a baby, then families do not have to worry that a debt will be raised against them because their income changes. However, if they provide false or misleading information then the usual welfare sanctions will apply. I think Minister Macklin is having a bob each way. It demonstrates that the new baby bonus measure will be very difficult to administer and almost impossible to police, yet the new criteria are going to cost a further $22.6 million to administer.
Importantly, this measure was not mentioned by the ALP prior to the election. In fact just before the election, the Labor Party stated in an email from the ALP campaign unit that they ‘have no plans to make any other changes to the way that the baby bonus is structured either in terms of eligibility or payment methods’. What has the government done? It has altered the terms of eligibility and payment methods. It is a case of Mr Garrett being proved right: ‘Don’t worry about what we say before the election; we’ll change it all when we get into government.’ It is simply not good enough. The families of Australia deserve better. They deserve a government that does not go back on its word, a government that tells the truth.
But it does not stop there. This bill also makes changes to voluntary family income management. This measure will allow individuals to volunteer to have their welfare payments placed under an income management regime payment arrangement. This is an important initiative, because it is one that was pioneered by the Howard government during the Northern Territory intervention last year. It has worked pretty well. This is another case of Labor saying ‘me too’—something that occurred many times in last year’s election—and so this measure is in principle a good thing. But I believe—and the coalition believes—that we need to be provided with more detail as to who this will affect and what the scope of the measure will be. In the other place, Mr Abbott suggested that this voluntary income management will only apply to the Kimberley region in northern Western Australia and the Cannington region of outer metropolitan Perth.
This bill will also make it a requirement for claimants of the Commonwealth seniors health card to provide a tax file number when they claim the Commonwealth seniors card. The main aim of this provision is to identify those with income from a superannuation income stream from a taxed source. The opposition is concerned that this measure may adversely affect many older Australians. We are told that about 27,000 people will lose the Commonwealth seniors health card between 1 July 2008 and 30 June 2010. It is also worth noting that the tax file number requirements could be seen as a de facto means test. But 27,000 older Australians are going to be disadvantaged by this requirement.
Whilst the changes to an adjustable taxable income test are not specifically dealt with in this bill, it is worth noting for the Senate that a further 22,000 people will no longer be eligible for the Commonwealth seniors health card under the provisions of a different bill. These people will miss out on much-needed benefits like pharmaceutical benefits, bulk-billing and other allowances because doctors quite often require a Commonwealth seniors health card before they will bulk-bill. It is also likely that more people will be affected by this legislation in the future, given that the department has not modelled—I repeat, it has not modelled—how many people will not be eligible beyond the forward estimates. This is another case of the ALP not showing its hand before the election. The question will always remain how many marginal seat members of the Labor Party and how many other candidates went out there and said, ‘We’re going to start means testing or implementing measures that will further restrict access to Commonwealth seniors health card’? My suggestion is none. The ALP failed to tell the Australian people, especially senior Australians, that this change would take place if they won government. I am happy to be proved wrong on that but I suspect I will not be.
There is another change in this legislation, and that is to the partner service pension. This measure seeks a reduction in access to the partner service pension for partners from the current age of 50, raising the access to the age service pension qualifying age, which is just over 58 years of age for men. The coalition is of the view that veterans and their wives should be treated under the veteran system and not under the social security system. We are concerned that about 930 partners of veterans will be affected by the proposed changes. Nine hundred and thirty people will have their planning and their financial future placed in peril by a heartless Labor government. The savings from this measure are minuscule, but the savings will affect enormously the lifestyle and viability of so many people—930 partners and their families. The government is targeting a very small section of the population. They are altering the benefits to save a few dollars and all the while they are pork-barrelling in their marginal seat electorates, which we have all heard about so much in this chamber. It is simply unreasonable to increase the age limit of this pension so dramatically.
When the Howard government, responsible economic managers, implemented changes to the age pension to lift the age from 60 to 65 it did so gradually. That way people could factor this into their forward planning themselves rather than having their payments, which they rely on, removed quickly and with very little warning. Evidence from the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration states that the government did not consult ex-service organisations about these changes. Once again, this was a measure that was not mentioned by the ALP before the election.
This bill also contains the government amendment to repeal the 2006 legislation that allowed for gross fringe benefits amounts to be counted as income for family payments. This legislation was to come into effect on 1 July 2008. When this was introduced into and passed by parliament in November the ALP supported the package of changes that included this measure. In 2006, FaCSIA, the department, was only aware of the general impact of the changes rather than the impact on particular groups. It must be noted that the government’s current proposed changes to family payments in this 2008 bill actually complement the 2006 changes, because this bill also seeks to increase income that is used to calculate payments and benefits. The coalition will support the government’s intention to introduce amendments to repeal elements of the 2006 legislation to ensure that workers in charitable organisations are not adversely affected by the changes to the treatment of fringe benefits for the purpose of calculating assistance payments.
This legislation will affect thousands of Australians and thousands of Australian families. The recent Senate committee on finance and public administration inquiry discovered that 22,000 Australian families will lose eligibility for the Commonwealth seniors health card, 2,100 will lose access to other pensions or allowances, 12,700 will lose access to family tax benefit A and B, and 18,800 will lose some childcare benefit. The Australian people deserve better than a government that claims to provide them with better benefits and then, once their vote has been cast, seeks to reduce these benefits. Whilst the coalition believe that support for Australian families is of paramount importance, we believe that this government has been dishonest and this will result in fewer benefits for the people who most need them. Accordingly, I move the second reading amendment standing in my name:
At the end of the motion, add:
“but the Senate:
condemns the Rudd Government for its failure to provide a taper rate with the introduction of the means test on the baby bonus; and

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2008-06-24,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

Mr President I rise to speak on the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (2008 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2008, and more specifically to the Amendments to this bill introduced by the Government.
I should firstly thank the various charitable organisations such as Catholic Social Services Australia, Uniting Care Australia, the Salvation Army as well as the Australian Services Union, the Charities Tax Advisory Service and the Australian Council of Social Services who came forward to speak to the Finance Committee last week at short notice, when matters in this bill were referred to the Committee.
Thanks must also go to the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and the Department of Veterans Affairs for being available also at short notice for the hearing on matters pertaining to this bill last Friday. I would like to think that the priority that all these organisations placed on appearing before us at the Committee perfectly illustrates how important this issue is to those working in the not for profit industry.
The purpose of the Amendments that I referred to earlier has been to rectify the situation created by the previous Howard Government which resulted in people in public benevolent institutions losing out as a result of changes to the assessment of adjusted taxable income for Fringe Benefits Tax.
It should be noted how quickly the Rudd Government acted once this problem had been discovered. The Treasurer, Wayne Swan and the relevant Minister Jenny Macklin were able to present a solution to the public within a very short period and that is something for which they should be commended.
The Treasurer and the Ministers acted swiftly and decisively to ensure that the old system, which used the net value of fringe benefits, would remain in operation if these amendments are passed. This is strong, decisive governance.
It is a measure of how serious the issue is considered that Minister Macklin and Minister Ludwig were also able to quickly develop a thorough communication and notification strategy through Centrelink for those who would have been affected.
As I understand it, Centrelink will be able to implement a change in their computer system as soon as these amendments are passed to help workers who are affected. As well, they will endeavour to contact those who had already received notification of the proposed changes to the fringe benefits system to assure them that they will not be worse off under the Governments amendments.
The Government has also realised that these are complex changes that is why I am pleased to see that the Henry review on taxation has been asked to examine the existing fringe benefits tax system and to recommend long term changes that will provide a more equitable system for all.
I call on the Opposition to support this bill and these amendments. It is now in their hands whether these workers are able to keep the status quo with regard to their entitlements.
I hope they are not as obstructionist as they were last week.
The solution that was announced by the Treasurer and the Families Minister last Thursday will change the system back to the 2006 implementation, and help protect those working in public benevolent institutions. It is these people who faced financially losing out under the changes to the law, and indeed the terms of reference of our inquiry reflected this.
Over the course of my work in my state of Tasmania, I come across a number of people who work in the non profit or charitable sector. For the most part these people are the kind of selfless individuals who are willing to put themselves forward in order to help the less fortunate members of the public.
They will often forego the higher salaries that they could receive in other jobs in order to make a difference for the destitute and the struggling. It would be unconscionable for us not to act to help these people, and ensure that they don’t lose what little monetary rewards they do receive.
During the course of the hearings we heard from Frank Quinlan from Catholic Social Services Australia who gave us a very informative account of how important these amendments are to those employed in the non profit sector. His comments painted a picture for the Committee of how difficult employees would find it if these amendments did not go through this sitting week. I quote them from the Hansard proof:
“The charitable and not-for-profit sector is currently reliant upon these special taxation arrangements to attract and retain staff and deliver services. In effect, these fringe benefits arrangements, which were originally designed for the top end of town, have been extended to the charitable and not-for-profit sector specifically for this purpose. To explode a particular myth in relation to the charities and not-for-profit sector, when we are talking about fringe benefits tax we are not talking about expensive cars, flash holidays or expense accounts. We are talking about fringe benefits acquired by salary packaging, which is usually contributed in terms of mortgages, rents, household expenses and so on. There is a paucity of data available about the actual impacts, but I can give you figures from at least one of our agencies, our largest metropolitan agency, where recent data suggest that 80 per cent of the staff currently utilising salary packaging arrangements are earning $50,000 or less.”
His comments were backed up by Mr Bicknell from UnitingCare, and again, I quote from proof Hansard:
“UnitingCare Wesley Port Adelaide has 872 staff and we employ staff in a wide range of areas—aged care, mental health, youth work, family work, homeless young people, and a number of other areas such as that throughout South Australia. Of the 872 staff we employ, 820 have a gross pay of less than $50,000, so we are really talking about people who are on the lower income levels. Of those, 390 salary sacrifice. Salary sacrifice is really important for a lot of people who work for us in making up their total package. For example, if we have a worker who has a spouse with no income and two children and earns $35,000 a year, salary sacrifice, as it has been operating now, would typically add $110 per fortnight to their salary package. If the proposed changes had gone ahead, that person would have lost $59 per fortnight, and $59 per fortnight on that sort of income is a very significant cost.
It is to help people who are in this situation that I call on the Opposition to support this bill, and the amendments that have been put forward by the Rudd Labor Government to fix the situation.
As the Treasurer said, it is a great injustice that the changes put forward by the previous Government treat these people in the same way as the executives who are the intended target of the changes.
The other measures present in this bill are all about providing fairer and more targeted family assistance. It is indeed pleasing to see that the Government has honoured all its election promises - the first Government to do so I believe. To look at just one such measure, by increasing the eligibility of the baby bonus to parents who adopt children under the age of 16, adoptive parents will be able to access the full amount of the baby bonus, even if the adopted child has previously received the bonus.
This change recognises that a significant percentage of children are over two years of age when adopted and that adoptive parents will have the same set of set up costs and will also incur additional expenses during the adoption process.
Of course they may also need to spend time out of the workforce to welcome and settle in their child. These changes will help an estimated additional 130 adoptive families each year including over 100 intercountry adoptions.
Our Government believes that the expected increased cost of $3.2 million over four years is a small price to pay to create a fairer system and treat all new parents the same. This is another election promise that the Rudd Labor Government has delivered on.
Before I end though I must point out the sterling work done by Stephen Palethorpe and all the members of the Finance and Public Administration Secretariat in not only setting up the hearings for the inquiry related to this bill at two days notice last week, but helping the Committee present this report with such a quick turnaround.
In addition to their usual workload, this has certainly been a hectic fortnight for them and I want them to know that their efforts are certainly appreciated.
I commend this bill, and the Governments amendments to the Senate.",SENATE,"<title>FAMILIES, HOUSING, COMMUNITY SERVICES AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2008 BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,39,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-06-24,"—I rise tonight to speak on the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (2008 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2008 and specifically on issues relating to fringe benefits and employment in the charitable and not-for-profit sector. The issue of fringe benefits tax arose in relation to this bill, due to concerns about the serious impacts on not-for-profit organisations of changes relating to how fringe benefits were to be calculated for the purposes of family tax benefits and childcare benefits. The Australian Greens note that our main concern originally—and, as I understand it, that of charitable organisations and other not-for-profit non-government organisations—related to changes made in 2006 by the previous government. These changes altered the income test for family tax benefits so that fringe benefits were grossed up, where they had previously been calculated on a net basis. The impacts of these proposed changes on the community sector were of such concern that I referred the matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration for inquiry. In the course of the inquiry a further issue in relation to fringe benefits tax in the not-for-profit sector was raised—namely, the cap on tax-free benefits. It is this specific issue that I would like to address tonight. The other main issue that came up is the viability of the not-for-profit sector.
The community sector—which is also called the not-for-profit sector or sometimes the third sector—is a vital part of our civil society. It plays a crucial role in that society. I was pleased to note that the Parliamentary Secretary for Social Inclusion and the Voluntary Sector, Senator Ursula Stephens, put out a media release on Friday. On her website she acknowledged:
As part of the Federal Government’s Social Inclusion agenda, we are dedicated to a new era of partnership with the not-for-profit sector.
The Government will continue to find new ways to support and promote the crucial work of the staff and volunteers within the sector in helping disadvantaged Australians.
She went on to explain that the government was in fact moving to reverse the changes that were going to come into effect on 1 July that were causing such concern to the not-for-profit sector. I will go into that in a moment.
The value of the community sector to the Australian economy is conservatively estimated to be in the order of $50 billion per year. I believe that is a highly conservative figure. This figure consists of $20 billion in expenditure, which the not-for-profit sector spends on these issues, and at least another estimated $30 billion in unpaid voluntary work. Again, I think that is a highly conservative estimate. Wages and conditions within the community sector are substantially below those offered in both the public and private sectors. If there was a decision by government to attempt to provide the services that are provided by the not-for-profit sector—which, for a start, I do not think the government could do—the cost of delivering the same level of services would be substantially more than $50 billion a year. And that is even thinking that they could provide the level of service that these organisations provide. However, the fact is the community sector cannot compete with public sector employment or private enterprise on wages and conditions, and this gap, alarmingly, continues to widen. As a result, the community sector relies on employees voluntarily forgoing the possibility of higher wages elsewhere for the opportunity to make a difference and to do some good within the community.
However, with the rising cost of living and other financial pressures, there are limitations on the degree of sacrifice employees are able to sustain and still be able to meet their living and family commitments. A survey of the community sector that the Australian Council of Social Services conduct every year, which was just released this month, found that 68 per cent of agencies which responded had experienced difficulty in attracting staff in the last year, and 43 per cent of them named staffing as one of the three most important issues facing their services. A significant proportion of respondents expressed concern about wage levels and indicated that they had considerable trouble attracting and retaining staff. Skilled occupations which obviously require appropriately qualified staff such as psychologists, social workers and accountants are becoming increasingly difficult to fill as skills shortages in these areas continue to bite and the salary gap with the public and private sectors continues to widen.
Employees within the community sector are in fact predominantly middle-aged women on low incomes. While many have strong personal commitments to their work and their organisations, we are now seeing increasing numbers approaching retiring age. On the whole, younger workers are less inclined to take on these lower paid and relatively stressful roles, and the sector potentially faces a looming crisis, particularly as younger people, even if they are inclined to take on these roles, find it quite difficult to sustain them and there is more churn through the sector. To this extent, both the use of adjusted fringe benefits totals and the capped exemption on fringe benefits taxes for public benevolent institutions, charities and other not-for-profit organisations have played an absolutely pivotal role in the capacity of these types of organisations to recruit and retain staff.
The unintended consequences of the change that would have come into effect on 1 July—that is, to use reportable rather than adjusted fringe benefits totals for family benefits—would act to effectively reduce the disposable income of many families of community sector employees, especially those in the $40,000 to $80,000 income range, where the primary income test for family tax benefit is applied. The reason that this change is such a concern to the Australian Greens is the likely impacts that it would have on the ability of a wide range of community service organisations to attract and retain suitably qualified and motivated staff, on their ability to deliver services efficiently to their disadvantaged clients and on the ongoing viability of the wider community sector. That is why we were particularly pleased when the government announced that they would introduce an amendment to deal with this issue. The Greens had already drafted an amendment, and I am pleased to see that the government are moving exactly the same amendment. However, the issues around the cap on the tax-free exemption and the viability of the community sector that came to light when this issue was raised in the public arena still apply to the community sector. There are many serious issues that the sector still has to deal with.
During the committee hearings, representatives of the community sector raised a number of other issues relating to the funding and ongoing viability of the sector. These include the need to raise the current tax-free ceiling on fringe benefits for public benevolent institutions, charities and not-for-profit hospitals and other relevant not-for-profit organisations. These tax-free fringe benefits allow those organisations I have just mentioned which qualify for this exemption to effectively offer higher salaries than they otherwise would be able to, while at the same time reduce the cost to the purchasers of these services, whether those purchasers are governments, fee-for-service clients or those of us who make donations to these charitable causes. The committee heard that the current tax-free ceiling for public benevolent institutions and other charities of $30,000 is not indexed and has not been increased since it was first introduced in 2000—in other words, for eight years. Our calculations indicate that if the current ceiling had in fact been indexed to the Consumer Price Index it would now be around $38,500 and if it were indexed to average weekly ordinary time earnings it would now be $43,000.
Given the importance of this benefit to the ability of charitable organisations to attract and retain staff and deliver services, the Australian Greens believe that the ceiling should be immediately lifted to $40,000 and indexation introduced into the legislation. A proposed new tax-free ceiling of $40,000 is, for those who are listening to the maths, between the two measures for indexing. We believe that this is a fair figure, given the current cap has not moved in eight years. The public or not-for-profit hospitals or ambulance services currently have a different fringe benefits tax-free ceiling of $17,000, which also is not indexed and has not changed in eight years. Our calculations indicate if the current ceiling had been indexed to CPI it would now be close to $22,000 and if indexed to AWOTE it would now be $24,000. Given the importance of this benefit to the ability of not-for-profit hospitals to attract and retain staff and deliver services, we believe the ceiling should be immediately lifted to $23,000 and indexation introduced into the legislation.
Once the issue of reducing the gap created by eight years without indexing the fringe benefits tax-free threshold has been addressed, it still leaves open the issue of indexation. The Australian Greens support indexation to average weekly ordinary time earnings, AWOTE. This is because the issue at hand is a benefit directly related to employment and wages; hence, AWOTE is, in our opinion, the appropriate indexation reference. Since the issue of the cap was raised in the committee last week, numerous people have contacted my office to indicate that increasing the tax-free threshold from $30,000 to $40,000 would be of huge benefit to their organisations. For example, one aged-care provider indicated the impact on their staff who are earning up to $45,000—and many of course are earning a lot less—would be an extra $883 in their hands per annum. This is a significant amount of money for those families that are not earning a lot of money.
The aged-care sector is having a particularly tough time at the moment. Aged-care service providers are struggling to survive due to a shortage of people to undertake work, rapidly rising cost structures across all essential items and services and an unprecedented demand for services. Any loss of staff due to a sudden decline in a worker’s take-home pay or access to government supports will further increase staff vacancies and reduce levels of service. In the current environment it is unlikely such organisations will be able to recover lost staff.
This situation is being experienced by all community and welfare service organisations and providers across the sector. I have been inundated with comments from people expressing concern around the current situation. Given the immense value of the not-for-profit sector, the Greens believe the impact on the government of increasing the tax-free limit is minimal compared to the benefits of ensuring continued quality service provided by qualified and appropriate personnel.
The capped exemption from fringe benefits tax for public benevolent institutions cost the government $250 million in forgone taxes in 2005-06. Even with the percentage increase in this figure that would occur—I will be positive—when the cap is lifted to $40,000, this is a small amount compared to the billions of dollars the community sector contributes to our economy and our society. Frank Quinlan from Catholic Social Services gave evidence to the inquiry last Friday on this issue. He stated:
... then we also have to do a further analysis about the merits of that cap on its own. I think there would be a strong argument to suggest that an upwards movement of the cap, even beyond indexing, would be welcomed and would provide a further tool available to us again to both deliver more services and deliver some compensation to low-paid workers. I emphasise that a shift in that cap actually has a multiplier effect, not just on the dollars that government gives us but also on the dollars that we raise from other sources. If we raise $100 from other sources, by packaging that in salary we can turn it into more than $100 worth of services. It is important that we are talking not just about government funding either from state or federal government. It is a way in which policy can actually deliver us a benefit that we draw from other sources of funding, whether it be philanthropy, fundraising or others.
Given the value of the sector to the government as discussed above, particularly in the provision of much needed services far cheaper than government could ever hope to provide or source them, we do not believe that the extra cost of this measure is a great impost on government or that that provides any reason for them to reject it. To this end, I will be moving amendments to increase the cap on the exempted level of fringe benefits tax for those two groups and to introduce annual indexation.
The Australian Greens agree with the wider principle put forward in the submission from the Australian Council of Social Services: our tax and social security systems need to be both fair and consistent in the way they confer benefits and attribute costs. We also note that relying on tax exemptions to remedy the poor remuneration offered by the community sector is a poor substitute for a properly costed and resourced welfare system. On that basis, we welcome the proposed Henry review of Australia’s tax system and hope that it will provide fair and consistent remedy to the existing inequities of our tax system and to the wider issue of sustainable funding for the community sector.
However, in the meantime we believe it is imperative to deal with the current viability crisis in the sector, brought on by these potential changes to the assessment of fringe benefits tax—the government is doing this—and also to deal with the ongoing reduction in real terms of the cap on allowable benefits, because that will deliver real outcomes to those working in the community sector now, not in a couple of years time when the Henry committee reports. We urge both the opposition and the government to support the Greens’ amendments that will bring real, meaningful changes to those working in the community sector now.",SENATE,"<title>FAMILIES, HOUSING, COMMUNITY SERVICES AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2008 BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,39,1
"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2008-06-24,"—I rise to speak on the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (2008 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2008. The bill introduces a means test for family tax benefit part B and the baby bonus. Additionally, the bill makes a number of changes to the administration of the baby bonus. Payment is changed from a lump sum to 13 fortnightly instalments and the baby bonus will be indexed once yearly rather than twice yearly. The age limit at which an adoption gives access to the baby bonus will be increased from the current two years to under 16 years of age. The bill introduces a requirement for claimants of the Commonwealth seniors health card to provide a tax file number and reduces access to the partner service pension for partners, raising the access age from the current age of 50 to the age service pension qualifying age. The bill also contains changes relevant to the issue that arose in the public domain last week in relation to changes to fringe benefits tax and charities.
I will come to the other matters later; first I would like to deal with the issue of the charities. Last Friday, the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration conducted a hearing into this bill as part of its inquiry. As deputy chair, I begin by thanking the representatives of the charitable organisations, who generously gave of their time at short notice to present evidence to the committee. It seems giving up their time is something that comes naturally to these individuals, and the committee was very grateful to them for it. At issue was the fact that from 1 July 2008 more fringe benefits would be included in the income that is used to calculate payments to families of family tax benefit A and B and the child care benefit. This would have a significant impact for employees of some charities.
The coalition implemented this change in response to a report in 2006 by experts on the Ministerial Taskforce on Child Support, chaired by Professor Patrick Parkinson. That report recommended that calculations of income for child support should include all fringe benefits to ensure that parents could not avoid their child support obligations by converting normal income into fringe benefits. The report also recommended that the method for calculating child support be extended to the method for calculating family tax benefits, to ensure consistency. It was argued that it would be complex to have different methods for calculating child support and family payments. The coalition accepted both of these recommendations and implemented them in legislation in 2006. At the time, the Labor Party supported the package of legislation that included this change. In its response to this issue, the government has sought to blame the former coalition government. That is dishonest.
The facts are that Labor supported this measure. On 12 October 2006, the relevant shadow minister, Senator Evans, issued a media release that indicated Labor’s support for the package of changes the coalition introduced. The piece of Labor legislation that we are now debating supports the 2006 change. The explanatory memorandum to the Labor bill discusses the change to the calculation of income for family payments, explicitly states that the change will result in higher calculated incomes for some people and gives a worked example of how the change produces a higher income for the calculation of family payments. The Labor legislation allows Centrelink to use this higher income to determine family payments. Without this change by Labor the payments to some families would have been higher. Labor cannot therefore claim that this change was all the former government’s doing. Whilst it is true that the coalition’s 2006 change broadens the income that is used to calculate family payments, Labor’s changes in the 2008 budget do the same thing.
The government is proposing to include salary sacrifice into superannuation and investment losses in the calculation of income for family payments. The government therefore cannot argue that its 2008 changes are completely separate from the coalition’s changes in 2006. In particular, any charity worker who salary sacrifices into superannuation or has losses on investments will be affected by Labor’s changes in the 2008 budget.
Labor’s measures will result in a much larger reduction in family payments than the coalition’s changes from 2006. It is very concerning that Labor is reducing support for families in the 2008 budget, in contrast with the dramatically increased support for families delivered by the coalition in office.
It was also interesting to hear the evidence at the inquiry into this bill that the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Ms Macklin, cleared the explanatory memorandum for this bill prior to its presentation to the House on 29 May 2008. Apparently the minister’s awareness of the impact of the 2006 legislation was not aroused by her clearance of the memorandum prior to 29 May, which mentions that notification letters to recipients of family tax benefit and childcare benefit were being issued in April.
The committee also heard evidence that no officers of the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs were aware, prior to May 2008, of the extent of the impact of the legislated, but not yet operative, provisions relating to the treatment of fringe benefits for the purpose of calculating family assistance payments. It was further acknowledged by the department that no analysis was ever conducted to determine whether any particular sectors, such as the charity sector, would be disproportionately affected. Mr Hazlehurst of the department acknowledged that:
… we did not at that time do an analysis sector by sector of how many people would be affected.
And later:
… we did not do any sector-specific analysis. We did not look at how employees in different sectors would be affected.
During the inquiry we also learned that Minister Macklin’s office was provided an oral briefing on the impacts on employees in charitable organisations on 29 May 2008; yet neither the minister nor the Treasurer made any attempt to raise the matter publicly until the publication of an article in the Australian newspaper on 18 June, prompting a joint press conference that day and an announcement on 19 June 2008.
It remains unclear whether, if the issue had not received considerable public interest following the media coverage on 18 June 2008, the minister or the Treasurer intended to act on this issue before 1 July, or at all. All we can conclude is that, through her attempts to deny having supported these changes, the minister does not understand her own legislation. To provide certainty to workers in the charity sector, the coalition will support the government’s announced amendments.
Let me turn now to the rest of the bill. This is a bill of cold hearts and broken promises. It is a bill that seeks to act upon the nasty surprises Australian families found were in Labor’s first budget delivered some six weeks ago. I note that Labor senators are saying that they hope the opposition will not be obstructionist in relation to this bill. What hypocrisy and what contempt for Senate processes! Labor senators well know that when the coalition came to government in 1996 we had been left a $10 billion budget deficit and a $96 billion debt. That was a real crisis, not a false and constructed crisis of the sort that Labor are inventing at the moment. What happened when the coalition set about repairing the damage caused by 13 years of inept Labor government? As we know, Labor opposed every single measure we introduced to balance the budget and pay off their debt.
At the same time, it is very interesting to see Labor now demanding respect for mandate. Unfortunately, this new Labor paradigm has arrived 12 years too late. When we were in government we took numerous policies to the Australian people and were successfully elected on our platforms only to have Labor vote against them time and time again. To come in here now and throw the word ‘obstructionist’ around and lecture this side of the chamber on mandate theory is the height of Labor hypocrisy. But the point about this bill is not that the coalition will not respect Labor’s mandate because they never respected ours. The point here is that there is nothing in this bill for which Labor sought a mandate. Labor never once put to the Australian people that they would set a means test of $150,000 for the baby bonus or the family tax benefit part B. Labor never once flagged their intention to slash entitlements to the Commonwealth seniors health card or the partner service pension. There is no mandate here, only broken promises.
The committee heard evidence that the government’s decision to introduce the requirement for tax file numbers to be provided by claimants of the Commonwealth seniors health card will result in loss of eligibility for at least 27,000 people in the next two years. This is not a compliance measure; this is a de facto means test that will strip older Australians struggling under cost-of-living pressures of their entitlements to assistance such as the seniors concession allowance and the telephone allowance. What is equally concerning is that the department has not modelled how many people will lose their entitlement to the card beyond the forward estimates. It seems that the true number of people to lose entitlement to this important assistance for seniors will be much, much higher.
All of this is against the backdrop of the complete neglect of pensioners in Labor’s first budget. Even more heartless is the government’s decision to strip away entitlement to the partner service pension from some 930 Australian partners of veterans. These are people who in many cases act as carers for their partners. And these are not just any partners. They are veterans who have served the nation in the defence forces. How insulting for veterans that the Prime Minister, when asked about this matter in the House on 19 June, confessed he had no idea about it. And the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs—what was his description of this proposal? How did he characterise the government’s decision to punish the partners of veterans? He said it was a ‘minor’ change. Labor rip away the entitlements of vulnerable people who are caring for veterans, and the minister says it is only ‘minor’. I wonder which Labor MP or candidate went to their local RSL in the lead-up to the last election and said, ‘By the way, we’re going to slash the partner service pension—just so you know.’ I do not think anyone would have.
I would like now to turn to the baby bonus. Add this to the list of Labor’s broken promises. As Senator Bernardi referred to earlier, when a constituent contacted the ALP via the Kevin07 website to ask whether Labor was going to make any changes to the baby bonus, they were told:
We have no plans to make any other changes to the way the Baby Bonus is structured, either in terms of eligibility or payment methods.
And this year the Australian of 14 March 2008 stated:
… Wayne Swan this week ruled out any change to the baby bonus and said Australia’s middle class did not receive too much welfare.
Well, his tune has sure changed. That was a complete and utter falsehood uttered by Mr Swan. Perhaps that constituent who contacted Kevin07 voted Labor as a result of the response they received. That constituent has now been completely short-changed by Kevin08.
Not only have Labor broken their promise not to fiddle with the baby bonus; they are seeking to apply the ultimate blunt instrument in a means test with no taper. So, if someone has a child on 1 January 2009 and earns $75,000 in the following six months, they will receive the full bonus. But if they earn $75,001 they will get nothing. One dollar extra means sudden death. Tapering was not even considered by Labor. Evidence to the committee revealed that no modelling had been conducted on tapering of the baby bonus means test.
Labor’s means test is an odd beast. Labor are asking people to estimate their income in the six months after the birth of a child and will pay the bonus based on the information provided to them. However, if someone provides information that they will earn income under the means test threshold but then actually earns income that exceeds the threshold, they will not be compelled to pay back the bonus. This means test is therefore completely vulnerable to fraud and dishonesty. Labor’s means test will be almost impossible to police, despite the fact that more than $22 million will be sunk into administrative costs.
Finally there is the family tax benefit part B. Labor promised prior to the election that they would means-test this payment at $250,000. Senator Chris Evans, then the opposition spokesman, announced this policy in a press release of 28 March 2006. Yet, just as Mr Garrett prophesised, once Labor got in, they just changed it all. So now families get hit with a $150,000 means test, again with no taper. The Treasurer has confirmed that around 40,000 families will lose their entitlement to family tax benefit part B as a result of this change.
We have heard much from Mr Rudd over the past 18 months about working families being under financial pressure. So what is Mr Rudd’s remedy in this bill for that? To strip those very same families of entitlements. And, while he is at it, he is hitting pensioners and partners of veterans too. We on this side of the chamber will not be bullied by Labor’s rhetoric on obstructionism and mandate theory. We have shone a spotlight on this bill and its litany of broken promises. This bill targets families, pensioners and veterans. For that, Labor stands condemned.",SENATE,"<title>FAMILIES, HOUSING, COMMUNITY SERVICES AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2008 BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,39,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2008-06-24,"—As much as I would like to get into a ‘my mandate is bigger than your mandate’ philosophical discussion with the senators in the chamber, my pleasant task tonight is to talk about one aspect of the legislation before us in the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (2008 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2008 which is something that the Democrats have been campaigning for for a long time, and that is the extension of the baby bonus to adoptive parents who happen to adopt a child over the age of two years.
I would like to commend the government on that change. I know that when the baby bonus was first introduced the Democrats made it clear that we were concerned at the then only 26-week period in which adoptive parents were eligible to claim the baby bonus. We campaigned and were successful, thanks to the efforts of the previous government and, I believe, particularly Minister Patterson at the time. We saw that extended in 2005, as I recall, to two years. But, if anyone here is familiar with some of the issues, expenses and rules involved in adoption, particularly intercountry adoption, they will know that the two-year period was not really satisfactory, given the number of adoptions that take place. So I am really glad to see that the government has adopted this particular measure—no pun intended.
I did in fact introduce a private member’s bill to this effect in March this year, and I was getting a little concerned that I had not received any feedback from the office of the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. I had urged them to support the legislation. That was met with stony silence. Now I know why. Again, I commend them.
I think it is worth reminding members of the community and members of this place of some of the issues involved in the adoption process. I was looking at some statistics from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare which illustrate that the number of children adopted from overseas countries has more than doubled over the last 25 years and, as an overall proportion, accounts for seven of every 10 adoptions. Yet, despite the increase in intercountry adoptions, the overall number of adoptions in Australia has plummeted from almost 10,000 children 35 years ago to 568 children in 2006-07. There were 568 adoptions last financial year—slightly less than the 576 children adopted the previous year. Nationally, three-quarters of the children taken into new homes last financial year were aged under five, with more than 55 per cent being female. These figures which I put on record tonight highlight the relatively small number of parents who adopt. Therefore, the inclusion of this group in the baby bonus legislation is quite inexpensive, relatively speaking, but will provide much-needed financial support.
Some senators may be aware of the fact that in some states—for example, Victoria—there are requirements for those parents who adopt a child to stay home for 12 months following the placement of that child in their new home to ensure that that child settles into family life. Many of us who are biological parents do not face those same policy requirements or that stipulation, and yet we are entitled to the baby bonus. Many of these adoptive parents and their families have been missing out, and, arguably, in many cases, have quite onerous additional financial and other issues with which to deal. So this is a very positive and relatively inexpensive measure.
In relation to the age range, I place on record that in the 2005-06 financial year, 118 children aged over two years were adopted from overseas. That gives you an idea of the statistics—just how many children are actually over that two-year age level and whose parents, therefore, have missed out on the baby bonus previously. As a consequence of their children’s age, these parents have been unable to access any form of financial assistance in that sense.
There is one ‘but’ I might add. As honourable members would be aware, the proposed change in relation to adoptive parents claiming the baby bonus does not come into effect until 1 January 2009, along with the means testing, of course. In that respect, I think it would have been nice to give this additional measure immediate effect—or at least effect from the date of assent. Wouldn’t it have been nice to give that measure and that assistance to these families that little bit earlier?
Tonight I received an email. Madam Acting Deputy President, you find when you are leaving this place that you get a lot of nice and kind emails. This was another one of those. It stated as a reminder:
… the delay in bringing in the change to the baby bonus until 1 January still means that families will miss out. We are in the … position now of almost not being concerned by our ongoing wait (21 months this week) for allocation as we know our child will be over 2 and to miss out twice—
this is from someone who missed out last time because their child was not eligible—
will be a hard pill to swallow. No doubt, as soon as—
it is quite moving—
we see a photo of our new child, not even the frustration of missing out on the payment again will be enough to stop us from wanting to get to—
name of country—
as quickly as possible to bring him/her home.
This has been an ongoing campaign. It has been one that the Democrat senators have been particularly committed to. We have been glad to have had a couple of wins along the way. Might I say it is really nice when leaving this place to be speaking to this bill—I hope this is my final bill; I think four bills today is possibly enough—and having a win for the party. I think this is indicative of the kind of work that we have successfully done over many years. It does not always happen immediately, but it can happen. If I may implore the government ministers and parliamentary secretaries on duty, wouldn’t it be nice to bring this measure up a little sooner?",SENATE,"<title>FAMILIES, HOUSING, COMMUNITY SERVICES AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2008 BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,39,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2008-06-24,"—The Senate is debating the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (2008 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2008. My interest in this bill relates to the government proposed amendments which repeal aspects of their treatment of fringe benefits. Following questions I raised in estimates and complaints from the community sector, the government was alerted to the severe impact the changes would have on the community sector. It is strange that no-one, from the department to the minister, even thought to be across the details of the impact on so many Australians who stood to lose some $50 a week in family payments because of the fringe benefits changes. I note for the record that these changes to reportability are actually made properly workable by the bill before us in its original state.
The need for new amendments reflects an unforgivable oversight in the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs’ ability to handle her portfolio. At best, it is an oversight of huge proportions. It reflects little interest from the current administration in monitoring and evaluating the system they are entrusted to deliver. Once the election bells ring, it is the new government who is responsible. That responsibility certainly extends to letters that have gone out in the Rudd government name advising working families that they are about to lose a heap of family benefits. I do not know whether anyone in the department was aware that thousands of letters were going out advising mums and dads that their family benefits were about to be gutted. I do not know why that did not ring a bell with anyone. Was anyone there looking after the interests of Australian working families, or was it just a posture? Consequently, the Treasurer and the families minister fronted up to a press conference last week to say they would fix the problem, and so we come to today’s bill and amendments.
The questions raised by this sequence of events are very disturbing and go to the heart of the style of operation of this government. Here we have a budget bill that originally included changes to the fringe benefits tax treatment. It is therefore the Rudd government’s bill and they are fully complicit with the impact of the grossing up salary sacrifice of contributions on not-for-profit-sector workers’ access to family benefits.
The government now bring in more amendments to fix up the mess they have voted for and presided over. Most importantly, they were the ones that sent out the letters. They were in charge when the letters were sent out. The Rudd government own this chaos. At 10 seconds to midnight, Labor are rushing in amendments to stop thousands of families from being deprived of their well-deserved family benefits. This chaotic way of running the country begs the question: what else has gone unnoticed or been overlooked?
I turn to the closely related issue of the government’s proposal to make other changes to the definition of ‘taxable income’ as announced in the budget. The Australian Services Union estimated that the bill we are now dealing with, with complications arising from the government’s misunderstanding of how a change of the definition of income would affect thousands of working families from July 2008, would hurt 200,000 charity workers. I am very worried about what has been overlooked in the expanded definition of income for 2009. I have been pursuing the minister and the department in estimates and in this chamber, and I am still waiting on a promised briefing from the minister representing the families minister in the Senate, Senator Evans.
We know from this work so far that there are a whole range of government support programs and assistance delivered through the tax system that are to be affected by the expanded definition of income. From July 2009, income will be grossed up with items that previously were not considered, such as salary sacrifice and net investment losses. This adds to the paper income of working Australians so they have reduced access to benefits. They lose money which they are currently entitled to under the existing system. That is why there are no little cameo moments in the budget papers telling families what they will get from July 2009—because the goodies are only for this year. Those are our tax cuts. Next year the rules are going to change, and the average Australian working family will not be able to claim the same rate of benefits as now. Their eligibility will be reduced because their income for the purpose of claiming the benefits will have gone up. I am sincerely worried that the government has another fringe benefits crisis on their hands, except magnified many times.
In the Treasurer’s press conference, where he confessed to the huge problems for community sector workers, he also said that the 2009 changes would be all right because there was still plenty of time to work them through. But that is what a Treasurer does. The Treasurer works all the sums through before he puts them in the budget; otherwise, what use is the budget? He could just make up anything and put it in there. If you have a budget in black and white and you deliver it to the parliament, you are accountable for everything in it. You cannot just wait around and hope that everything works out in the end.
We have seen over the last week a government that does not understand what it has done. Fancy putting 200,000 charity workers up for a pay cut! I believe I found out before the government because people started to ring me when they received the letters to ask what it was all about. That is when I started to inquire. That led to discovering the salary sacrificing which was going to affect about another 100,000 people—I do not know how many it will affect; I cannot find out. The Treasurer said that he was not aware of how many, but I think he was disingenuous because Treasury has done the modelling on these changes. Senator Bernardi and I were told this last Friday at the committee hearings. If the Treasury has done the modelling, why can’t the Treasurer and his ministers tell us what the impact of these expanded definitions of income are going to be? What is he holding back? Why is he holding back? If he is going to take income away from people in 2009, then surely they are entitled to know what they are going to lose. Why can’t I get an answer to questions I have asked half-a-dozen times at least? How many Australians will lose some or all of their benefits or assistance through the tax system as a result of the expanded definition of income? How much are they going to lose? How many of them are going to lose?
I will go through the programs that we have discovered, after much pulling of teeth, are going to be affected. They include—there could well be more but I cannot find out—family tax benefit part A plus family help income support payments; the childcare benefit; the baby bonus; the senior Australian tax offset, the Medicare levy surcharge; exceptional circumstance relief payments and exceptional circumstances interim income support; dependency tax offsets; income support payments under the Social Security Act; the parental income test on Youth Allowance; Abstudy; the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme; Veterans’ Affairs support; the Commonwealth seniors health card; and dental benefits. That is going to amount to a lot of people. I can see the parliamentary secretary sitting there with a very worried look on her face, saying, ‘What am I getting myself into?’ I can assure you, Senator Stephens, that you have been handed the biggest hospital pass of your life.
Of these 16 or so affected measures, we also know, after last Friday’s hearing into this bill, that 22,000 Australians will lose eligibility for the seniors health card. I think Senator Bernadi enunciated that. And 18,800 will lose some childcare benefits as a result of the expanded definition of income. These figures are only two of the 16 areas but should cause significant concern. There are 22,000 senior citizens of this country who are going to get a letter in the mail in the next 12 months telling them that they will no longer get the seniors health care card from July 09. That means no $500 concession allowance, no discounts on pharmaceuticals, no telephone allowance and reduced access to bulk-billed Medicare services. I do not believe the government has done its homework on this. It certainly has not come clean with the elders in our community about the fate that awaits them just around the budget corner. Has the Rudd government come clean about the 18,800 who are going to lose childcare benefits? That is on top of the higher petrol costs, food costs and housing costs. Families are going to be slugged in their childcare benefits—unless they are older Australians, and then they are going to be slugged in their health care cards. They get it either way.
Is there more? Yes, there is more. I was told in estimates that these changes to income definitions will cost 74,400 Australians some of their family tax benefits A and B and 12,700 Australians all of their family tax benefits A and B. So there are cuts to childcare benefits, health care cards and family tax benefits A and B. But could there be more? Yes, there is more. There are a dozen or so other categories—we are still waiting for information on how many and how much, but the government will not tell us. I hope the parliamentary secretary will tell us tonight. She has always been someone who is prepared to tell the truth. They cannot say they do not know, because we have heard evidence from the families department that the Treasury has done modelling.
I call on the government, the minister and the parliamentary secretary again to produce the figures. Tell us how many more tens of thousands—or could it be hundreds of thousands?—of working families are going to be slugged due to the expanded definition of income to apply from July 2009. Are the envelopes being printed in massive forward orders to tell all those affected that they are going to lose some or all of their family tax benefit A, family tax benefit B, childcare benefits, seniors health care card, baby bonus, exceptional circumstances funding for drought, isolated children funding, teen dental services and so on? When are you going to tell the people how many of them are going to be affected and what the effect will be on them? They are going to have to tighten their belts, make allowances in their budgets or do something to offset the loss of income. If they do not, we will be returning to this place again and again to try, like today, to fix up the chaotic mess presided over by the Rudd government.
The Rudd government are good at watching. They have a FuelWatch, a ‘grocery watch’, a ‘strike watch’, an ‘Iguana watch’ and a ‘state debt watch’, and now there is a ‘budget watch’—that is, watch the budget roll out and watch the casualties line up. The Rudd government like to watch. They like to watch working families lose their benefits, their assistance measures and their tax offsets. Even their Veterans’ Affairs entitlements will be affected by these expanded definitions of income. The Rudd government are making it harder to access all these programs. I say in closing: you have been a great friend to the hardworking families of Australia!",SENATE,"<title>FAMILIES, HOUSING, COMMUNITY SERVICES AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2008 BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,39,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2008-06-24,"—In summing up the second reading debate can I thank members for their contributions. I know that we are going to move into the committee stage in a moment and deal with some of the amendments that are before the Senate, but if I can reiterate what this legislation is about. The Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (2008 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2008 amends a series of Commonwealth acts to give effect to some of the government’s 2008 budget measures. This year’s budget, the first delivered by the Rudd government, gave more than $55 billion in support for working families, seniors, carers and people with disability.
This bill in particular delivers several critical measures in the government’s program of responsible economic management for Australia. In these challenging economic times it is vital that government payments are properly targeted so that assistance is directed to those who need it most. This bill is an important step towards this targeting, with new income levels for the baby bonus and family tax benefit part B and the complementary dependency tax offsets. The $150,000 limit will be indexed each year in line with movements in the consumer price index. Other changes will also be made to the baby bonus, including indexation annually on 1 July and payment by 13 instalments. And, as Senator Stott Despoja so rightly noted, adoptive parents will receive fairer treatment through this bill, with the age limit in relation to adoption being increased.
The bill also allows for the collection of tax file numbers for Commonwealth seniors health card holders to ensure that they remain eligible for the card after it is issued. Although Senator Fifield was feisty in his commentary about the Commonwealth seniors health card, there is currently no mechanism in place to determine ongoing eligibility for the card, unlike with other concessions and benefits in the social security system. I think it is important for us to note that in 2006 the previous government conducted a clean-up of the Commonwealth seniors health card, checking incomes against eligibility—the same effect as the tax file number collection in this bill. And in 2006, under the previous government, 28,000 cardholders had incomes over the limit and had their cards withdrawn. Under this measure we anticipate around 13,000 card holders will have their cards withdrawn because they are in ineligible. There is no link to the change to the Commonwealth seniors health card income test. This is a compliance measure only and it will impact on those people who are receiving the Commonwealth seniors health card inappropriately.
The bill also makes changes to the income management arrangements in the social security law so a person will be able to enter voluntarily into an agreement to be subject to income management. There are many circumstances where individuals would opt to be voluntarily part of the income management regime.
The bill will align the minimum eligible age for partner service pension paid under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act with the veterans service pension age. This measure will increase the eligible age for partner service pensions for men from 50 to 60 years of age and for women from 50 to 58½ years of age as currently set under the age equalisation rules. I know Senator Bernardi was keen that there should be a gradual introduction of this but, in fact, the age increase for the partner service pension has not been introduced on a gradual basis as with the age pension, age service pension and age equalisation measure because the age pension and the age service pension are retirement pensions and, frankly, we do not believe that 50 is a retirement age in this enlightened environment. As someone who has touched that threshold, I would certainly like to think that I would not be needing to retire at that age. However, the measure will as I say increase the eligible age for partner service pensions.
The bill also makes some minor policy and technical amendments to portfolio legislation. Most importantly, as announced last week, the government will be moving amendments to this bill relating to the treatment of reportable fringe benefits in determining the adjusted taxable income for the purposes of family assistance law. Senator Siewert was quite vocal in both her support for this amendment and also understanding just how complex this whole issue is. It comes about because there is an intersection of the social security legislation and taxation legislation introduced by the previous government which now comes into effect. I think it is a pretty poor show that opposition senators are now trying to distance themselves from the previous government’s decisions which are now coming into effect.
—You are the government.
—This is absolutely true, Senator Boswell. The previous government at the time that it introduced these measures did not understand the impacts because, as we heard at the Senate inquiry last week, there was no sectoral analysis of the previous measure either. So this is an unintended consequence of something that we have inherited and which we are now looking to address and we will address. I am very pleased to hear that the opposition is supporting those amendments.
The government’s amendments to the bill will now ensure employees in the charitable and not-for-profit sector are not affected by the previous government’s 2006 budget measure related to the third stage of the child support reforms that are due to come into effect on 1 July 2008. The government’s amendments will restore the use of the net value of reportable fringe benefits in the definition of adjusted taxable income of family assistance. This will ensure that staffing not-for-profit organisations will not suffer a loss of family tax or childcare benefits after 1 July 2008 if the circumstances have not otherwise changed.
We all acknowledge that these are very complex issues with flow on effects to employees far beyond the not-for-profit sector receiving family assistance. Therefore, we think that the most appropriate way of getting a very clear, precise, thorough and appropriate assessment of the impacts used to refer this issue to the Henry commission to examine the complexity of existing fringe benefits arrangements and to make recommendations to improve equity and simplicity in the longer term.
As a result of the government’s amendment concerning the treatment of fringe benefits in determining adjusted taxable income, the government will be opposing two minor technical amendments originally included with this bill. These technical amendments were designed to help families avoid debts by taking into account the previous government’s changes to the treatment of fringe benefits and obviously these amendments will no longer be needed.

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2008-06-24,"—I rise tonight to speak of the case of a constituent in my home state of Victoria, Mr Dally Messenger, who has had a most unfortunate experience with the ACCC. Mr Messenger is a funeral celebrant. As the Senate would know, funeral celebrants emerged in around the 1970s from the institution of marriage celebrants. Celebrants of both marriages and funerals try to negotiate a reasonable fee. While marriages are usually a very happy affair, funerals of course are in a different category, with most of the relatives being in a very bereaved state, and funeral directors need to deal very carefully with them.
Historically, funeral directors, who have charge of the mechanics of a funeral, and mainstream churches agreed on a fixed fee for officiating a funeral ceremony. In the past, this fee was traditionally low because of the high church-going population of the era. In many cases, funeral celebrants do a great deal of work leading up to a funeral by discussing the deceased with the family, preparing a eulogy and so on. Sometimes their work can take up to between 20 and 30 hours per funeral. Celebrants nowadays get a small fee for their service from the funeral directors, usually in the vicinity of $150 to $400. When a person dies, people usually go to a funeral director, not a funeral celebrant. The director will charge between $6,000 and $10,000 for the funeral and the celebrant’s fee comes from that figure.
In Victoria, the funeral directors agreed to pay a little more to celebrants on the strict condition that, like the clergy, it was a fixed fee. Over the years, the celebrants have always tried to have their fee increased in line with inflation and CPI. There was usually resistance, but the fixed fee did rise. In 1997, Mr Messenger was the President of the Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants, and he wrote the usual letter to funeral directors asking for a rise in fees. Mr Messenger at that stage received a letter from the ACCC saying his letter could be in violation of the Trade Practices Act. He responded to that by saying the funeral directors fix the fees and usually work it out quite openly with the churches, the celebrants and each other. Mr Messenger asked the ACCC to properly investigate the matter. He was then ordered by the ACCC to write the following sentences into the constitution of the Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants: ‘The celebrant should individually determine the fees to be charged for his or her services. In doing so, he or she may wish to consult the fee scale recommended by the college association.’ Mr Messenger did so in 1997 and the matter was dropped.
Because the fee was still very low, in 1997 Mr Messenger demanded and took the personal stance that the only way to fairly pay a celebrant was by an hourly rate. Unfortunately for him, this resulted in him not being given any funerals at which to officiate by any funeral company. At a Best Practice Funerals conference in 2005, he opposed the directors fixed fee in his keynote speech. The majority of the people at that meeting thought the directors were far too powerful to oppose. But on behalf of the conference Mr Messenger wrote a two-part letter. The first part asked for a raise in the fixed fee and the second part asked the directors to consider an hourly rate. Unbeknown to him, somebody sent this letter to the ACCC. The ACCC at that stage did not take into account any of the evidence they would have needed to see. They focused on the first part of the letter and, without interviewing Mr Messenger, issued legal proceedings in the Federal Court.

Senator Boswell interjecting—

—I beg your pardon! Mr Messenger’s senior counsel demanded mediation. At mediation they fined Mr Messenger $46,000; legal fees cost $18,600—a total fee of $64,600. Mr Messenger is a 70-year-old pensioner. He lives with his wife in Melbourne. Obviously he is in no position whatever to pay this money, and I find it extremely ironic that the ACCC, which is supposed to encourage competition, discourage monopoly and look after the small trader, the small businessman, and protect them from big monopolies, is forcing this gentleman to pay this money, which he can certainly not afford. I understand there are collections being taken up and so on. But I felt it only fair to raise this matter in the Senate because his efforts to raise it in other places have not met with much success. I sincerely hope that the ACCC finds reason to take up this case again, look at it again and consider what its true responsibilities are.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Mr Dally Messenger</title>,Adjournment,40,1
