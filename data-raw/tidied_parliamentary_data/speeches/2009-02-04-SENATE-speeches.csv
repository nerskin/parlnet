"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2009-02-04,"—Before this debate concluded last night, I had not had an opportunity to put on the record the coalition’s position with regard to this amendment. I agree with the comments Senator Milne made last night that the Prime Minister has talked a lot but he has not actually done very much. I do not agree with her comments that we should be modelling our legislation on American legislation. I am paraphrasing Senator Milne here. She referred to President Obama and his position on similar amendments. Simply because it is happening in America does not mean it should happen in Australia.
There has been a bit of comment from the coalition over a period of time and more recently by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Turnbull, about the payments of excessive benefits. However, Mr Turnbull’s comments were constrained, I believe, to CEOs. The amendment proposes much broader ranging reforms, and the coalition will not be supporting them because we believe that they would not be to the long-term benefit of the Australian corporate sector.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT (NO. 1) BILL 2008 [2009]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2009-02-04,"—It is unfortunate that Senator Bernardi makes those very brief comments in which he starts to suggest that this government is simply talking and not acting. I do not know where he has been since we won government. I do not know how he can possibly misunderstand the very many actions that this government has taken to stimulate the economy. It is simply not talk. The government has acted decisively and early in the best interests of this country. It is stimulating the economy at times when it needs to. It is putting Australia in a position where we can continue to face the challenges presented by the global economic crisis in an effective way that benefits Australian businesses, Australian workers and this economy in general.
On behalf of the government, I absolutely reject those very flippant and, I think, ill-considered comments by the spokesperson for the opposition. Senator Bernardi really should take a deep breath and actually look at what this government is doing. To suggest in any way that what the government is doing could simply be described as talk and not action I think simply defies belief.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT (NO. 1) BILL 2008 [2009]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2009-02-04,"—I do not want to get into an extended debate with Senator Marshall, but his comments are completely irrelevant to this debate.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-04,"—I want to address a couple of remarks to the amendment moved by the Greens. I had only just commenced my contribution last night when we had to adjourn, and I was making the point then that the circumstances in Australia are quite different from those in the United States. I think it is important to point that out. There is no doubt in the United States—and I am not going to go through the details of the US subprime crisis—that among the central elements of the collapse of the US financial system were the perverse incentives and the failure of many senior executives to identify the risk of the very creative financial instruments that they were employing and spreading through not just the US system but the entire world’s financial system and for which they were paid, frankly, obscene sums of money.
I agree with President Obama’s comments last week. I know that his comments were a response to the revelation that many people in the financial sector in the United States who, having had a catastrophic year—banks were falling over and a major insurance company would have collapsed if the government had not bailed it out—were paid, at the end of the financial year, approximately $22 billion or $23 billion in incentives and so-called rewards. I know that President Obama was rightly outraged, as were the vast majority of people in the US, that failure was rewarded. These perverse incentives and bonuses were being paid to varying degrees to individuals who had been involved in what is going to go down as the largest financial collapse in the US since the Great Depression. That is a fundamental difference from what has occurred in Australia.
Fortunately, we have not had the collapse of mainstream financial institutions in Australia. We have had at the edges—Babcock and Brown and Allco Finance Group are examples, and Senator Milne referred to a couple—a very small number of entities to whom, on reflection, given what happened, we can certainly question whether payments were appropriate. But I think we should distinguish between the collapse of large sections of the US financial system and the situation that has prevailed in Australia. Participants in this debate need to reflect on that background.
Nevertheless, the Prime Minister and indeed the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Turnbull, have identified a range of issues and argued that there does need to be improvement with respect to executive remuneration in Australia. This global financial crisis has revealed that there are many financial institutions that pay their employees in a way that encourages them to take large and inappropriate risks, particularly short-term risks. Taking short-term risks fuels a boom and a culture of greed and short-termism. As I have mentioned, we have seen these opaque investment instruments in a search for short-term and what have turned out to be paper results. Financial institutions need to have clear incentives to promote responsible behaviour.
The Rudd government is committed to responsible economic management and this includes acceptable remuneration practices for Australian companies, particularly in the financial sector. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer—and, indeed, I—on a number of occasions have advocated reform of financial sector executive salaries. It needs to be done not just in Australia but internationally. In financial services in particular we are dealing with an international market. Financial institutions need to have clear incentives to promote responsible behaviour rather than some of the unrestrained greed that we have seen. The government believes the Basel rules on capital adequacy should pick this up. Specifically, it thinks regulators should set higher capital requirements for financial firms with executive remuneration packages that reward short-term returns or excessive risk taking—that is, for institutions encouraging excessive risk by employees it should be prudent to keep a bigger buffer of capital to reflect the increased risk. That in turn will be reflected in executive remuneration.
This will be implemented domestically, in conjunction with discussions with our regulators—APRA and ASIC. In Washington on 15 November the G20 leaders agreed that their finance ministers will formulate recommendations on executive compensation. APRA is developing the template and the global financial crisis gives us all cause to reflect on the matters under debate.
Senator Milne has criticised the government for lack of action. I know public concern about executive salaries has been there for many years but it has certainly crystallised over the last calendar year. These issues need to be examined thoroughly and dealt with effectively. The point I would make about the Greens amendment is that there will be reform in this area. However, the Greens amendment—which is the same amendment they moved in October and November last year—is an extremely blunt approach. We do want thorough reform in this area. We want it to be considered. I am very confident that we will see reform in this area during this calendar year. But the proposed Greens amendment is an extremely blunt approach. It does not address anywhere near all the types of issues that need to be considered in an effective response to this issue of executive remuneration. Therefore, we will not be supporting the amendment.
I will give this commitment to the Greens. When we are reaching a point where it may require some regulatory parliamentary amendment, I will be very happy—and as Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law I do have some responsibilities in this area—to involve you in the discussions that occur about how we respond in a legislative and/or regulatory way to these issues.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Milne’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT (NO. 1) BILL 2008 [2009]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2009-02-04,"—I rise to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008 [2009] which amends the Migration Act to clarify and enhance provisions in the act that relate to merits and judicial review of migration decisions.
These amendments aim to rectify the shortcomings of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2008 by creating conditions conducive to the expeditious and efficient administration of justice for those seeking review. These principles were first introduced as part of the previous bill before they were withdrawn in August 2008 amid some concerns over their unintended consequences. The coalition supported the principle behind these changes when they were first introduced. Consequently, we are in support of these amendments in their revised and improved form.
As the then shadow minister for immigration and citizenship, Senator Ellison, indicated in his speech on the second reading on 27 August 2008, it is fair to say that the coalition, while in government, was looking at amendments of a similar nature to the ones we see currently in this bill. These amendments provide for a number of much-needed improvements in process—in particular, allowing oral communication of requests for further or initial information, the setting of time limits for appeals, and the commencement dates of the times within which appeals can be made. Most notably, this bill seeks to amend the current 28-day period for lodging an application to the High Court for judicial review of a migration decision, which will be changed to 35 days. In order to remove concerns, a new 35-day period will commence to run from the date of the migration decision rather than from the time of the actual notification of the decision.
The case of Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKKC highlighted concerns associated with the concept of notification for the purposes of lodging an application for judicial review in the Federal Magistrates Court. Section 477 of the Migration Act as it currently stands provides that the time period for initiating proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court commences from the date an applicant is actually notified of a decision. This provision creates a large degree of uncertainty as it is often difficult for a court to ascertain when an applicant is actually notified of a decision. The Senate recently moved to rectify many of the problems associated with notification of migration decisions when it passed the  Migration Amendment (Notification Review) Bill 2008 last year. I spoke on behalf of the coalition in support of that bill as I saw it as a practical measure to prevent unnecessary legal recourse based on minor technical deficiencies in the process of notification by the department.
The amendments prescribed in the notification review bill have removed opportunities for unnecessary legal challenges which intended to delay and overturn migration decisions. In a similar fashion, this bill calls for a range of measures aimed to prevent such action before the courts while also improving effective administration of justice. Indeed, as a former lawyer with the Australian Government Solicitor, I have seen in my own experience how, regrettably, unscrupulous immigration lawyers and migration agents can exploit such technicalities in a futile attempt to delay their clients’ cases.
Together with the notification review bill, these amendments solidify changes which improve the notification process between migration applicants, the department and the relevant tribunals. These pieces of legislation will, at the same time, ensure that the notification system remains fair and reasonable for all of the parties involved. The objective of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) is to amend the Migration Act to clarify and enhance communication provisions in the act that relate to merit and judicial review of migration decisions. In particular, this bill clarifies that the Migration Review Tribunal, the MRT, and the Refugee Review Tribunal, the RRT, may invite either orally or in writing review applicants or third parties to give them information. It establishes uniform time limits for applying for a judicial review of a migration decision in the Federal Magistrates Court, the Federal Court and the High Court and it limits appeals against judgments by the Federal Magistrates Court and the Federal Court when they make an order or refuse to make an order in relation to extending time to apply for judicial review of migration decisions.
Currently, the tribunals and the full Federal Court can only request or require information from a person in writing. Enabling the tribunals to obtain information from review applicants and third parties orally, including over the telephone, will help ensure that reviews of migration decisions can be conducted more efficiently and quickly. In many instances the only available method for contacting an applicant is by oral means. While acknowledging the issues surrounding procedural fairness which arise from the acquisition of information orally, it is often the case that the tribunal registry only has access to telephone numbers. These amendments, allowing the tribunal greater power in obtaining information orally, will ease delays in the judicial process without necessarily compromising procedural fairness.
The amendments relating to time limits address the problem where there is currently an incentive for unsuccessful visa applicants to take advantage of the delays litigation can cause by waiting until their removal from Australia is imminent before lodging an application for review. These amendments provide the courts with broad discretion to vary the time period for applying for a review of a migration decision where the courts consider such a time frame is necessary in the interests of the administration of justice. The limitation on appeals against extension of time decisions will help ensure the effectiveness of the new time limits for applying for judicial review of migration decisions as inserted by the bill.
The current wording in the act is, in places, ambiguous and has allowed appeals to migration decisions based on lack of clarity concerning dates of decisions and communication processes. These amendments seek to clarify the intention of the act and to streamline the appeal processes. Under these amendments, various changes will occur. Section 359(2) inserts the words ‘either orally including by telephone or in writing’ after ‘may invite’ in section 359(2) of the act. Section 359(1) of the act provides the Migration Review Tribunal with the power to get any information it considers relevant. Importantly, it provides that once the MRT has such information it may have regard to this information in making its decision on the review.
The amendments to section 359(2) outline that the MRT has the power to seek information orally by whichever method it chooses, including, but not limited to, by telephone. The MRT will still be able to invite, in writing, a person to provide information. These powers are a subset of the MRT’s broad powers under section 359(1). The power to seek information orally or in writing applies at any stage in the review. As previously mentioned, these amendments will also ensure that the MRT is able to obtain relevant information where the only way of contacting a person is by oral means—for example, where only the telephone number has been provided.
In all circumstances, including over the telephone, where information is collected that is adverse to the applicant and which the MRT considers would be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review, clear particulars of that information will be put to the applicant in writing. The applicant will then have an opportunity to comment on such adverse information within a prescribed period before a decision on the review is made. The removal of the word ‘additional’ from the heading in section 359 makes it clear that the MRT’s power to seek information orally, including over the telephone, or by written invitation applies to all information and seeks to deal with the uncertainty surrounding what information is covered by section 359.
Vesting the High Court with the broad discretion to extend time where it is necessary in the interests of the administration of justice aims to protect applicants from possible injustice while also ensuring extensions. A prime reason for an extension of time being necessary is evidenced in the 2007-08 annual report of the High Court of Australia, which illustrates that 93 per cent of the immigration applications filed in 2007 were filed by self-represented litigants. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission’s submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee in 2004 stated:
It must be remembered that persons making claims under the Migration Act may have little familiarity with Australian legal processes, and may face linguistic and cultural barriers to effectively managing their application and advocating on their own behalf.
Furthermore, where the services of a migration agent are employed not all problems are overcome, as it is often the case that the actions or rather inaction of an agent can adversely affect the prospects of an individual wishing to appeal their decision.
New section 486A(3) provides a definition of ‘date of the migration decision’, which will serve the purpose of setting the time limits for applying to the High Court for review of a migration decision. Section 486A(1) as amended by section 5 of the schedule provides that the 35-day period for applying for a review of a migration decision starts to run from the date of the migration decision. One of the effects of this section will be to ensure that where a written statement for the decision does not comply with all of the requirements set out in section 368(1) for the MRT and section 430(1) for the RRT the time limits starting to run will not be affected. These sections seek to ensure that the High Court is not required to examine whether there is a jurisdictional error in the migration decision before determining whether the application for review is within time.
In short, these amendments will ensure improvements to the Migration Act in order to build upon the shortcomings of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2008. These provisions aim to do so by creating conditions conducive to the expeditious and efficient administration of justice for those seeking review. The coalition supports such positive changes. In the past applicants have been afforded opportunities to abuse the tribunal and appeals process based on shortcomings of the process, particularly those originating from the notification process. These amendments, together with those outlined in previous amendments supported by the coalition such as the Migration Amendment (Notification Review) Bill, will help ensure more efficient and effective judicial review of migration cases in Australia.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2008 [2009]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2009-02-04,"—The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008 [2009] is a welcome move to clarify and enhance judicial provisions relating to the merits and judicial review of migration decisions. Judicial review has been an issue of great concern for the Greens. We are particularly pleased to see the government move to ensure effective time limits for judicial review of migration decisions reinstated, effectively allowing for the courts to extend the time frame where they consider it necessary in the interests of justice and of course administration. Despite our overall support for this bill, we have some ongoing concerns about the proposed increase in the length of time unsuccessful applicants have to lodge an application for judicial review and, more concerningly, the proposal to remove the right of unsuccessful applicants to appeal decisions regarding extension of time to a superior court.
Firstly, I will address the issue of the time frames. Currently, an application for judicial review must be lodged within 28 days of the actual notification of that decision. The relevant court may extend the initial 28-day period by up to 56 days if an application for such an extension is made within the 84 days of the actual notification of the decision and the court is satisfied that it is in the interests of the administration of justice to grant that extension. While in theory this amendment seems logical, on closer inspection there seems to be a danger that the new provisions may not sufficiently safeguard against unfairness to applicants who experience delays or mistakes in being notified of the migration decision. Under this proposed new provision, time would be running as soon as the decision was made and any error or delay in providing notification could diminish or completely use up the amount of time available to make an application.
Although these circumstances would most probably be sufficient grounds to apply for an extension of time, we are concerned that the onus of doing so would be on the applicant alone, requiring an application in writing setting out why the extension was in the interests of the administration of justice. This appears to impose an unreasonable burden upon applicants who may already suffer considerable disadvantage—including language barriers and limited financial means—in accessing the legal system and may diminish their practical ability to obtain a fair hearing. Accordingly, I would like the minister to outline how the proposed amendments to sections 477, 477A and 486A will safeguard against any potential disadvantages that could arise if these amendments were to proceed.
The second issue I would like to raise deals with schedule 3 of the bill. Essentially, schedule 3 removes the right to appeal in a superior court in respect of a decision of a lower court relating to the extension of time given to lodge an application for judicial review. The explanatory memorandum notes that the amendments are being made to ‘discourage unsuccessful visa applicants from taking advantage of the delays caused by litigation to prolong their stay in Australia’. Although I understand the contention of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship that appeals of such decisions may, in some circumstances, be used as a delaying tactic or as a burden on court resources, these factors should not justify unreasonable restrictions upon fundamental rights. The rights of applicants to obtain a fair trial and access to the legal system must be protected. While I see the minister’s point, it is a concern that we are suggesting taking away people’s rights just because some people do not play fairly.
Although the proposed amendments were not contained in the  Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2008, the government has not indicated what has changed between the drafting of the two bills to necessitate the imposition of the limitation nor has it provided detailed reasons as to why this measure is needed other than that it will strengthen and enhance the new time limits, it may help to prevent applicants from making weak or vexatious appeals to deliberately delay their removal and it may seek to encourage applicants to seek timely resolution of their cases.
Schedule 3 as it stands is unacceptable to the Greens and we will not be supporting it. Judicial discretion should instead be exercised to allow review of orders in respect of an extension of time in appropriate cases. I ask the minister to outline how this amendment will not diminish a person’s fundamental right to access the legal system. Putting aside the small handful of cases as shown in the statistics of people who do currently take advantage of the processes, we need to ensure that we are not undermining the rights of those who are more vulnerable and disadvantaged.
The Greens support the overall intent of this bill, and I stress that. There are some good parts in this bill and overall we do support the intent, but we believe that the Migration Act as a whole needs to be amended to immediately implement the many principles announced by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship on 29 July 2008, as well as to immediately implement judicial review for detention decisions. We want to give the courts the ability to review decisions and to make judgements in relation to immigration. We need a judicial process for looking at decisions made around detention.
While I understand that the bill before us today deals specifically with judicial review of migration decisions, it is important to note the findings in the Australian Human Rights Commission annual report into immigration detention which highlighted that asylum seekers, including children, continue to be held indefinitely, despite assurances by the government that detention is only being used as a last resort and for the shortest time possible.
Considering the bill aims to extend the judicial review time frames for applicants who have already received a tribunal decision on their visa applications—some of whom would still be in detention—stipulating reasonable time frames for people to contest their detention should also be an obvious inclusion in this overall package. As I outlined in my speech on the Joint Standing Committee on Migration report into immigration detention last year, we need to urgently ensure that the merit of detention decisions is subject to independent oversight without indicating a view as to whether that should be available as a right or should occur as a matter of course. Their intention did not suggest that they would have considered it reasonable to preclude merits and judicial review for 12 months—something I would like the minister to respond to today.
The Greens will therefore move a second reading amendment calling on the government to immediately put forward amendments to the Migration Act to implement the principles announced by the minister last year and to ensure that a person cannot be kept in immigration detention for more than 30 days unless a court makes an order deeming it necessary to detain a person on a specified ground and there are no effective alternatives to detain that person. I now move:
At the end of the motion, add:
                  ""but the Senate calls on the government to immediately put forward amendments to the Migration Act:
              (a)    to implement in legislation the principles relating to immigration detention announced by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship on 29 July 2008, in particular the following:
                    (i)    detention that is indefinite or otherwise arbitrary is not acceptable and the length and conditions of detention, including the appropriateness of both the accommodation and the services provided, would be subject to regular review,

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2009-02-04,"—I thank senators for their contributions to the second reading debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008 [2009]. I note that Senator Hanson-Young has asked a number of specific questions. Given that we will not conclude the debate before 1.45 pm, I assure Senator Hanson-Young that we will endeavour to get good answers to those legitimate questions.
The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008 [2009] amends the Migration Act 1958 to clarify and enhance provisions relating to merits and judicial review of migration decisions. The bill contains three sets of amendments. The first set of amendments clarifies that when the Migration Review Tribunal or the Refugee Review Tribunal seek information from review applicants or third parties they may do so either orally or by written invitation. The amendments seek to address a series of recent judicial decisions which held that the tribunals may seek additional information only by written invitation. By allowing the tribunals to also seek information orally, the amendments seek to overcome problems where the only available means to communicate with a person is orally—for example, where only a telephone number is provided to the tribunals—or where it is appropriate to seek information orally rather than in writing.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2009-02-04,"—I rise on a matter of public interest concerning the coalition’s agenda to retain those parts of Work Choices that depress the wages of low-paid workers and make their jobs less secure. This agenda would increase economic inequality and damage the economy by strangling demand at a time when there is a consensus amongst business and economists that the government must stimulate demand.
Consider the public record. In evidence to the Senate’s inquiry into the Fair Work Bill, the Treasurer and Minister for Commerce in the Western Australian government, Mr Troy Buswell, outlined the Liberal Party’s plan to retain as much as that government can of Work Choices under the state law in Western Australia. The Liberal Western Australian government opposes the extension of rights to workers that will protect them from being unfairly dismissed. The Liberal Western Australian government opposes a minimum employment standard that limits weekly ordinary hours of work to 38. The Liberal Western Australian government will reintroduce take-it-or-leave-it employment contracts as a condition of getting a job. The Liberal Western Australian government will make it easier for jobs to be contracted out and outsourced with no protection for employees’ wages and working conditions.
And it is not just the Western Australian Liberal Party. In a speech to the Young Liberals the other weekend, Senator Fifield made some quite curious remarks about Work Choices. He said:
... there is a reassessment by many in the Coalition as to the wisdom of having been so quick to abandon our core principles on workplace relations after the election.
Then he said—he must have thought about it:
Don’t get me wrong. Of course, the brand and policy iteration known as “Work Choices” is dead.
So, one minute Work Choices is a core principle of the Liberal Party; the next it is simply a policy iteration—a brand to be discarded like an empty can of Coke. Which is it?

Senator Bernardi interjecting—

—Order! Senator Bernardi!
—I know what it is: it is a core Liberal Party principle. Ripping conditions from ordinary working Australians is a core Liberal Party principle.
Who are the many in the coalition who Senator Fifield says are questioning Malcolm Turnbull’s position on the necessity for the Liberal Party to declare Work Choices dead? There are many in the coalition who will not let go of the policies that were doing so much harm to Australian workers: take-it-or-leave-it individual agreements, no protection from unfair dismissal, the barest-of-bare set of minimum employment standards, stripping away the no-disadvantage test for workplace agreements. All of these attacks on workers’ rights contribute to downward pressure on the income of working families and, if they were to persist, would stifle growth and demand in the economy.
According to a report in today’s Australian newspaper, Senator Fifield’s ‘many’ at least includes Senator Abetz, Senator McGauran, Senator Joyce, Mr Tuckey, Mr Abbott, Mrs Bronwyn Bishop and Mr Schultz. There are many more on the list, and no doubt all will be revealed before too much longer. The difference between Senator Fifield and Senator Abetz is that Senator Abetz wants to continue the debate behind closed doors. This is what happened when Work Choices was introduced. There was no consultation with the Australian public, no warning to the Australian public and no mandate from the Australian public.
As further evidence of the coalition’s continuing affection for political and economic extremes, take Senator Abetz’s outrage against suggestions from Mr Pyne that the Liberal Party should move to the political centre. From his remarks it is clear that Senator Abetz thinks that any move to the centre is a move too far to the left. Senator Abetz is going to tough it out on the right-wing fringe, and many of his colleagues want to be there with him. Senator Abetz and the coalition have no idea what the political centre is. Work Choices was the policy iteration of the coalition’s lack of a political compass.
So we have an accumulation of evidence that amongst all the other things the coalition are in denial about, including climate change, they are also in denial about the severity of the global recession. They are preparing to frustrate the decisive and economically responsible action that is needed to support economic activity, jobs and investment. They persist with their neoliberal economic policy based on the law of the jungle. It is the let-the-market-rip approach—the Gordon Gecko approach—to governance. That is where the Liberal Party are.
There is an overwhelming case for a comprehensive government package to deal with the economic downturn. In terms of the labour market, the last thing we need now is a debate about the discredited policies of the coalition. Mr Turnbull argues that he is now standing up for fiscal discipline. Well, let me tell you what the government are standing up for. We are standing for leadership and decisive action to protect jobs and support Australian households. For us the international meltdown is not simply about a failed economic theory; it is about looking after working families. And we are demonstrating leadership and we are acting decisively by delivering $14.7 billion to schools for major and minor infrastructure construction.
I will be happy to see all the Liberals scurrying back to their electorates and telling their local school communities that they are not supporting the government’s biggest approach ever in the history of this country to refurbish schools—something that they failed to do for 13 years in government. We are funding the installation of the country’s housing stock because we understand there is global warming; we are not deniers on this. We are increasing the solar hot water rebate. We are injecting $12.7 billion into households to support household demand and support economic growth. We are providing $6.4 billion for the construction of new social housing and a further $400 million for repairs and maintenance of existing public housing. We are providing $252 million for the construction of 800 houses for Defence Force personnel and an additional $150 million for repairing regional roads. We are providing $500 million to help local councils fund community infrastructure.
While we are at the cutting edge of the changes that are required to protect jobs in this country, the coalition remains stuck in a time warp. It just wants to return to Work Choices. That is its policy for this country. While the government does the right thing demanded by the very tough economic conditions facing the country by providing an urgent fiscal stimulus, the coalition clings to its deficit fetish. We have false fiscal discipline from Malcolm Turnbull and time warp politics from the coalition.
Nothing typifies the return to the past more than the return of Peter Costello to Lateline last night. After making little or no contribution to the political and economic debate since the election, he now detects an opportunity to fill the vacuum created by the flip-flopping, incompetent and ineffective Liberal leadership.  Unfortunately for the Liberal Party, his contribution was a negative, carping and angry exhibition that clearly demonstrated why he could never gain the support of his peers for the Liberal Party leadership. Working families deserve better from this ragtag opposition. Working families deserve an opposition that acts in the national interest and not in the interests of an individual’s political aspirations. Working families need better from an opposition that wants to defend discredited economic theory that has brought the international economic system to its knees.
The Labor Party will not be distracted by the internal machinations of the opposition. We will continue to develop global responses to the economic crisis that are in the interests of working families, our communities and the nation. We have to make up for the failures of the opposition when in government—a failure to provide fairness, balance and equity in industrial relations, a failure to invest in our schools and in the youth of this country, a failure to develop our industries, a failure to recognise the reality of global warming, a failure of leadership and a failure to build the nation. That is what this package is about. It is a nation-building package. It is about ensuring that we protect jobs, we protect our communities and we protect the families of Australians. You are failing to show any leadership or consensus in any national approach to the international crisis. You are climate change deniers and you are now deniers of the reality of the major and crucial issues that face the economy of Australia.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Workplace Relations</title>,Matters of Public Interest,4,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2009-02-04,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) to questions without notice asked today relating to the proposed economic stimulus package.
In particular, I want to mention Senator Conroy’s abject failure to come to grips with how long the budget will remain in deficit as a result of this enormous package of $42 billion, and, critically, how many years Australia’s children, our children and grandchildren—

Senator Conroy interjecting—

—and Senator Conroy’s children will be saddled with this new Labor debt, which will see every Australian slugged $9,500 as we have to live with the consequences of this reckless and poorly thought out package.
The coalition, of course, as disciplined and responsible economic managers, are not unmindful of the economic circumstances that do call for a careful, thoughtful and well-targeted stimulus. And we do accept that there is a good case for a stimulatory package. Our concern about the $42 billion spend is at least threefold. Firstly, it is simply too big, and the government has failed to establish why $42 billion is the appropriate figure. Why is it $42 billion as opposed to $41 billion, $30 billion or $24 billion for that matter? There is a whiff of panic, a whiff of the knee-jerk about the size of this package, with absolutely no guarantee that it will work. In fact, the Prime Minister very carefully said that he did not know whether it would work. He said that there was no silver bullet. It appears that the only silver bullet is pointed at the coalition’s head unless we suddenly agree to this hysterical need advocated by Labor to pass this enormous package within 24 hours.
We know that the downturn may be very long lasting and Australia simply cannot afford to spend larger and larger sums like this every quarter. Let me illustrate: one per cent of GDP was already spent in an ineffectual cash splash of $10.4 billion in the December quarter and there will be another one per cent of GDP in just cash handouts alone from this package in the March quarter. The Prime Minister has already admitted that he does not know if this will work. Committing to $42 billion when you simply do not know what the future holds is shooting in the dark.
The second concern is the very poor quality of this spend. This will obviously take us some time to work through, but we believe that our main focus should of course be jobs, jobs and jobs. We have been saying that since last year and we have been consistently saying it, and Labor has now caught up and started talking about the impact on jobs. Disappointingly, even with reckless cash handouts and massive debt fuelled spending, the Prime Minister’s package predicts unemployment will top seven per cent in just over one year. That is another 300,000 out of work when we are looking down the barrel of another $42 billion stimulatory spend. And where are the 70,000 jobs promised by the government as a result of the $10.4 billion cash splash? They did not eventuate. And we know that the most that they will now say is that this package will support jobs. We have heard the weasel words that have now morphed from one package with which we were supposed to be looking at the creation of jobs to another with which we are simply ‘supporting’ jobs with a vastly increased spend. It adds to the fear and to the perception that this is a government that does not know what it is doing.
Thirdly, we believe that there are far more targeted responses that will do more for jobs, for employment creation, for small business, for the economy and for Australian families than those that have been contemplated in this package. What we have seen from Labor over the past couple of days is nothing short of manufactured hysteria over the timing of this package. We believe very clearly that it is our duty to carefully scrutinise the package and to discuss more effective ways to achieve a stimulus.
We know that our decision to oppose the package will not be a popular decision; it is a hard decision. We know that the Prime Minister has never taken a tough decision, but we have and we know all about standing up for the rights of Australians and being careful fiscal managers. We understand what debt means, we understand that debt needs to be repaid and we understand the burden on Australian families.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Nation Building and Jobs Plan</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,6,1
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2009-02-04,"—As many people have been saying, including Senator Conroy in his contributions, we are in truly exceptional times. The evidence is out there. There is nothing that can be hidden because of media coverage putting out information on all parts of the issue of the economy across the world. This is not just an issue that Australia is facing. We are looking at a global financial crisis. The really important thing is that this is not just something that we are just discussing around the table in this place. People in the community have now got information that clarifies just how deeply in debt and how deeply in crisis the world economy is. Amongst the people across this country there is deep concern.
So when we hear people from the opposition talking in terms of ‘manufactured hysteria’, that actually devalues the knowledge and the concerns that the people of Australia have, and it is real concern. What this government is planning to do—and it is a tough decision—is to put forward a package to respond to the needs of our community and to protect jobs. Indeed, I take Senator Coonan’s point about jobs, jobs, jobs and the need to protect those jobs and to boost the economy, because what we are talking about is our economy within the midst of the global economy. And, most importantly, there is a need to support Australian families and Australian citizens who are working through their own concerns about what is happening to their lives and to their economy. That is the fear and that is the challenge. Those are the issues that the government is putting forward a package to respond to.
It is not a matter of hiding the issues or pretending that any single way is going to provide the full answer, and nor is it a matter of finding some mystical silver bullet. It is actually a matter of carefully and with full intent putting forward a package that looks particularly at individual needs. We see in this process a number of packages that are looking at tax relief for individual taxpayers. It is a matter of looking at some immediate relief for those people, some of whom will be facing the loss of their jobs. We have seen over the last few months the beginning of job losses in our country as a result of international companies pulling back, our trading situation being affected by the international crisis and our resources markets not being able to be boosted because our trading partners are not taking what they used to. These are real situations.
So we are looking at immediate support to families. We are looking at support for families who are working now at getting their kids back to school. We are giving people an immediate payment for that. More importantly, the input of funding into infrastructure in our schools is something that is necessary. We will respond immediately to the jobs, jobs, jobs issue with effective construction planning and administrative work to do the large range of infrastructure projects in schools presented in this package. I know that schools right across my state—independent and government schools—are all looking at these packages and saying how they can best be used for them and their communities. For families with school-age children there is something real in this package that can be held on to and, most importantly, it will give people hope.
Time is much too short to look at the whole package because as we all know this is a large response to a large issue, but I want to make a note of my particular favour of the infrastructure program that deals with homelessness. We are bringing forward the kinds of plans that we talked about in this place quite recently concerning the real need for immediate infrastructure to address the homelessness issue across the country. The package looks at that and how we can once again use construction and our infrastructure needs and use a real stimulus to respond to a real issue. Again, this is not manufactured hysteria. These are real problems in our community and the package put before this place by the government needs support. It needs people to look at how we can work together rather than put up barriers and try to play games.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Nation Building and Jobs Plan</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,6,1
"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2009-02-04,"—We are in difficult economic times. That Australia would face an economic challenge in the wake of the US subprime crisis was inevitable. It was also inevitable that Australia would be better placed than any other nation to handle this economic challenge. Why? Because in November 2007, thanks to the coalition, we had a budget in surplus. We had no government debt. We had world-class financial institutions and world-class prudential regulation. We had a booming economy, and strong business and consumer confidence. But what was not inevitable was the undermining of these very strengths by this government.
There is no doubt that the economic downturn will be deeper and longer than it needed to be as a direct result of decisions by this government. Consumer and business confidence were slammed into the wall by a government talking up inflationary expectations. Interest rates rose in response to government jawboning. These two points were part of a deliberate political strategy which was motivated by an attempt to undermine the record of the previous government. The resulting slowing of growth? Well, for this government, that was just collateral damage. Non-bank institutions were undermined by the bank deposit guarantee, which was bungled, and we have a situation where a budget has been completely undermined.
It is here, in the Commonwealth budget position, where we see the con in the stimulus sham. I think we all remember Mr Swan’s budget speech, where he gleefully declared, ‘We are budgeting for a surplus of $21.7 billion in 2008-09, 1.8 per cent of GDP, the largest budget surplus as a share of GDP in nearly a decade.’ Fast-forward to last Sunday when Mr Swan declared to Mr Oakes that ‘one consequence of the global recession, the unwinding of the mining boom, will be a temporary budget deficit’. That is just not true. The Commonwealth budget is not going into deficit this year as a result of falling revenues; the budget is going into deficit because of policy decisions by this government.
I put this to Senator Arbib on Sky on Monday, before the UEFO came out, and Senator Arbib scoffed—but just look at the second paragraph on page 42 of the UEFO. It is there in black and white. For 2008-09, there will be a decrease of revenue of $9.3 billion. Now, my maths might not be that good, but that does not equate to a $22 billion surplus. This government is fibbing about the genesis of the budget hole. This fiscal stimulus is predicated on inverting the political and fiscal debate. The measure of economic virtue is now the size of your deficit—bigger is now better. Labor has the view that there is such a thing as cost-free borrowing, but every dollar that is borrowed must be repaid, and it must be repaid with interest and it must be repaid by the taxpayer. Every dollar that is paid in interest becomes a dollar that cannot be spent on schools, hospitals or pensioners. I found it quite amusing when Senator Conroy said before that they were going to return the budget to surplus. You cannot return a budget to a place you have never had it. This government has never delivered a surplus and is unlikely to.
On this side, we are really careful because we know this is taxpayer money we are talking about. There is, of course, a need for some measure of government action in the current environment. Indeed, there is more of a need because of this government’s handling of the economy in 2007 and 2008. But there is no justification other than the political for a spend of such poor quality. A lot of this package is, it must be said, junk spending. As an opposition, how can we be complicit in taking the budget further into deficit for spending of such dubious economic benefit? On this side of the chamber, we quibble with the motive, the magnitude and the make-up of this package. The easy path, the opportunistic path, for the opposition would have been for us to wave through the $42 billion package. But, on this side of the chamber, we choose to do what is right. We know it will not necessarily be popular, but we know it is the right thing for Australian taxpayers and it is the right thing for the Australian economy. We will propose our own alternative.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Nation Building and Jobs Plan</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,6,1
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-02-04,"—I am pleased to rise to speak in this debate to take note of answers. For a number of weeks now, the Prime Minister has been asking the Leader of the Opposition to stand up and tell us what he believes in, to stand up and tell us his policies for the country. It has taken a while, but I am happy to say that today the member for Wentworth stood up. Now we know where he stands. Now we know whose side he is really on. His decision today to block the $42 billion stimulus package shows he is completely out of touch with the state of Australia’s economy, with the state of the global economy and, most importantly, with the suffering that Australian families, workers and small businesses are experiencing because of the global recession. They will continue to suffer in the future because of his decision.
The only plan that the Leader of the Opposition has for the global recession is to leave it to the market. The solution for Malcolm Turnbull and merchant bankers is: ‘Don’t intervene; let the market decide. Let’s wait and see how far the stock market will crash, what bargains will be available for the scavenger funds and what portfolios merchant bankers might pick up on the cheap.’ This is what Malcolm Turnbull, the Leader of the Opposition, stands for. He has never stood for working families. He has never stood for small businesses. He stands for greed and his own ego.
It has been very interesting to hear today senators on the opposite side of the chamber talk about the October stimulus package. The Leader of the Opposition today mentioned the first stimulus package and called it a ‘cash splash’. It is now a cash splash. I thought I remembered the Leader of the Opposition and senators on the other side of the chamber supporting the stimulus package. I took a bit of time and went to the Liberal Party website. I do not spend too much time there, but I enjoyed it today. I found that on Tuesday, 14 October, at a Turnbull press conference, he talked about the so-called ‘cash splash’. He said:
… we welcome the Government’s announcement today, especially for Australia’s age pensioners.
…            …            …
But nonetheless we are not going to argue about the composition of the package or quibble about it. It has our support. It will provide a stimulus to the economy, that’s for certain.
That is not the Prime Minister saying that; it is the Leader of the Opposition. And today it is a cash splash. That just proves who and what Malcolm Turnbull really is. I am very happy that when he got up today the real Malcolm Turnbull stood up. Finally, Australians will see what kind of a leader he is.
—Senator Arbib, you must refer to the Leader of the Opposition by his proper title.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy President. The government has taken action to protect families and workers during this unprecedented global recession. This $42 billion package will provide a direct stimulus to employment and activity. The challenge for the Leader of the Opposition and for the Liberal senators on the other side of the chamber is that, if they are going to oppose the stimulus, they have to go out and explain to workers why they may lose their jobs. They have to go out and explain to small businesses why they may have to close their doors—because the economy continues to slow. The proof is there that the first so-called cash splash worked. Look at the sales figures today—a huge jump. (Time expired)

—During your speech, Senator Arbib, you made reference to the Leader of the Opposition standing for greed. That is an allegation of improper motives, and I must ask you to withdraw that statement.

"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2009-02-04,"—Who would have thought before the election just 16 months ago that we would be standing in this place today taking note of answers to questions about a proposal to deficit finance a package of $42 billion to jumpstart an ailing economy? Back then, the future looked rosy: 11.5 years of hard work by the coalition government had eliminated the $96 billion of debt accumulated through a series of ‘temporary deficits’ under the Hawke and Keating governments. We were consistently running surpluses, with an economy and tax revenues growing to such an extent that we were able both to put away billions of dollars for future needs and to provide billions of dollars in tax cuts to Australians. Employment was at a record low, and the only economic issues that we faced were those occasioned by growing pains as demand for goods, services and skilled labour outstripped supply.
But here we are in February 2009 facing a vastly different scenario. Sure, the international economic crisis has put an end to the good times, with many consequences for Australians. Even government revenues have been affected. According to the most recent Treasury outlook, a drop of $9 billion is predicted, and here we are looking at going back into debt—and not just in a small way but massively going into debt. We have a request to permit the government to expand the limit on its credit card from $75 billion to an enormous $200 billion. As any Australian knows, once you get into the debt interest trap of a large credit card limit, it is very hard to pay it off.
I do not have time to look at the causes of the crisis, but what we must look at is the government’s approach to this issue as set out by ministers in this place today. Where is the money to decrease the cost of employing people? Where in this package do you go to small business and say, ‘We want you to employ more people, so we’re going to make it easier and cheaper for you’? There is nothing. Where is the money for new hospitals or for improving the health system? What have we heard around this country for the last three or four years? The biggest government funding problem facing Australians is the lack of finance in the health industry. There is nothing in this package—not a cent. There are no new hospitals, nothing to improve the health system, no new doctors and no new nurses. Where is the money to help those who have been most affected by the crisis. Self-funded retirees, people who have been carefully putting aside money in superannuation and share portfolios for the whole of their working lives and never asked anything of government, are finding that all their careful planning and the sacrifices they have made throughout their working lives have been completely undermined by this crisis through no fault of their own. Where is the assistance for them, the people who really need it?
I have heard a lot of government senators in this place today talk about how this package will help Australians deal with the impact of the global financial crisis. If Australians are suffering negative impacts, it is a good thing to look after them. There is no doubt that all Australians who receive some money from this package, if it goes through, will appreciate it. Who would not appreciate getting a cheque for $950 in the mail? They are all going to take it, and they will enjoy it.
—Except it’s going to cost you 10,000 down the road.
—Thank you, Senator Cormann; I am getting to that. Not all Australians have been negatively impacted by the crisis at this point. If you have a stable income and your job and income are not threatened, in recent months you have enjoyed lower interest rates and lower petrol prices. You probably have more disposable cash in your pocket than you had before. Giving you an extra $950, as welcome as it is—and I do not begrudge people getting it—is not really necessary to offset the negative impacts of the global financial crisis.
There is a well-accepted economic proposition that deficit finance should only be used to fund long-term infrastructure that will provide direct benefits to those who will be paying for it, through taxes to cover interest and principal repayments. Despite the rhetoric and spin of the government, there is nothing in this package that provides such long-term benefits. What benefits will my children and their children receive for the taxes that they will be paying for many, many years to come to cover this massive exercise in political pork-barrelling? I contend that they will receive absolutely no benefits but they will be paying taxes for years if not decades to come to cover the costs. It is simply inequitable to place the burden of interest and principal payments on people who will not receive the direct benefits. This package will only increase economic activity in the period in which it is spent. (Time expired)

"DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2009-02-04,"—It is with deep regret that I inform the Senate of the death on 1 February 2009 of the Hon. Peter Howson CMG, a former minister and member of the House of Representatives for the divisions of Fawkner and Casey, Victoria, from 1955 to 1969 and 1969 to 1972 respectively.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Hon.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2009-02-04,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 1 February 2009, of the Honourable Peter Howson, CMC, former federal minister and member for Fawkner and Casey, and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
Mr Peter Howson was born in London on 22 May 1919. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and graduated with a masters degree in arts. In 1940 Peter enlisted in the Royal Navy as a pilot in the Fleet Air Arm and progressed to the rank of lieutenant. In 1946 Peter was discharged from the Navy and moved to Australia. Before entering politics, Peter worked as a company director in Melbourne for several years before being elected to the House of Representatives in 1955 as the Liberal Party member for Fawkner. Peter served in five successive Liberal governments from the mid-1950s until the 1970s. He was the Government Whip from 1963 to 1964 before being appointed to his first ministerial position during the final Menzies ministry as the Minister for Air. He held this position from 1964 to 1966. With the transition to the Holt Liberal government in 1966, Peter retained his position as Minister for Air and also became the Minister Assisting the Treasurer. These ministerial appointments were also retained during the McEwen and Gorton governments. In 1969, the seat of Fawkner was abolished and Peter was elected as the first member for Casey.
As part of the McMahon government, Peter was appointed as minister in charge of tourism activities in 1971. He also became the first Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts. During his parliamentary career, he served on a number of committees, including the Privileges Committee and the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs. In particular, he was elected to the House of Representatives Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines in 1960. The committee travelled around Australia over the following year, gathering much of the evidence that informed the 1967 referendum on the constitutional status of Indigenous people. Peter was also an active participant in the work of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, both internationally and nationally at the Commonwealth of Australia branch level. He was instrumental in the creation of the executive committee of the General Council of the CPA and became the first chairman of the executive committee. Serving in that role from 1968 to 1971, Peter led a number of delegations to CPA conferences, including to Jamaica in 1964, Canada in 1966 and Trinidad in 1969.
After he left parliament in 1972, Peter retained a strong interest in CPA matters. He continued as an associate CPA member and was made a life member of the branch in 1983. Through his ministerial and committee work with Indigenous people, Peter developed a lifelong passion for Indigenous affairs and remained active in the area long after retiring from politics. He regularly wrote newspaper and journal articles on Indigenous issues and was a founding member of the Bennelong Society, a think tank that focuses on Indigenous policy. Until his death, Peter was an office holder with the society. The society president, Dr Gary Johns, is quoted as saying that Peter was tireless in trying to help Australian Indigenous people. He said, ‘I think his greatest achievement was to persist in the knowledge that Aboriginal people were to become part of Australian society.’
On behalf of the government, I offer my condolences to his family, particularly his son George, daughter-in-law Marie and grandchildren Natasha, Theresa, Rebeckah and Hannah. I thank the Senate.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Hon. Peter Howson CMG</title>,Condolences,7,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2009-02-04,"—I rise on behalf of the coalition to support the motion moved by Senator Ludwig and to extend our very sincere sympathies to the family of Peter Howson upon his sad passing on 1 February. Peter was indeed a wonderful servant of the Liberal Party and indeed of Australia. He had a very distinguished record of service to this parliament. He was, as Senator Ludwig noted, born in the United Kingdom—indeed only six days before my own father, who I am pleased to report is still in very robust health. He then of course served in the Royal Navy in wartime from 1940 to 1946, so he was one of the Liberals in the Menzies era who directly served for his country.
He came to Australia in 1946 after the war, like many others. Remarkably—and this is a great credit to him and to the Liberal Party—he became a member of this parliament just nine years after coming to this country. Senator Ludwig has highlighted Peter Howson’s significant achievements as both a minister and a member of the House of Representatives for two seats in the 1950s and the 1960s. Regretfully, he was defeated, like some other Liberals, in the 1972 campaign, when the ‘it’s time’ momentum defeated that very long-serving government. Peter was in five successive Liberal governments—the Menzies, Holt, McEwen, Gorton and McMahon governments. He was, as Senator Ludwig said, Minister for Air, Minister Assisting the Treasurer and our first Minister for Environment, Aborigines and the Arts until the time of his defeat. Prior to that ministerial service, he was an active committee participant. He was a member of the Select Committee on Voting Rights for Aborigines in 1961, so his lifelong interest in Aboriginal affairs was evident early.
He was a leader of Australian delegations to a number of Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conferences throughout the sixties. He became notorious, of course, as a participant in the infamous VIP plane affair as the then air minister and subsequently recorded his view that his role, as inadvertent as it might have been, was the reason for John Gorton not including him in his ministry in 1968. A long-standing enmity existed thereafter between Peter Howson and John Gorton, most regrettably because both were colourful characters and great additions to our party.
After Peter left politics he published his own diary, which I think provides an interesting level of detail about both his time in the ministry and the internecine Liberal Party machinations over the leadership in the late sixties, which were of course fascinating to us all. In 1984, the redoubtable Alan Ramsey described Peter Howson’s diary as ‘a small but significant window on the day-to-day detail of a turbulent period of our political history and its principal figures. In this it excels for its insights, its information and its political uniqueness, at least in this country.’ I am not sure that it is good idea for us all to publish our diaries but certainly Alan Ramsey thought it was a worthwhile addition to public knowledge.
Peter to his great credit, unlike some others, did remain very loyal and active in his chosen party, and particularly in the Victorian division. Peter Costello, I think in a great tribute yesterday in the House of Representatives, referred to that and anecdotally to the way Peter would always turn up at Liberal Party state council meetings in Victoria and sit right in the front row, and do so on a regular basis.
As I mentioned, Peter was our first Australian minister for the environment. It was the Liberal Party that created the first environment portfolio. It is a great tribute to Peter that he was our first servant in that role. He was the first Australian minister with a portfolio specifically responsible for Indigenous Australians. As I mentioned, this was an enormous passion for Peter both in parliament and afterwards, and it was a passion that he retained right to his death. He had a very strong view about the importance of the nation recognising the plight of Aboriginal people. He did maintain and articulate a very strong and active opposition to the separatist policies, which I think we now all agree were so naively and, regrettably, destructively pursued in an earlier period. I think much of what Peter has written would echo and mirror what people like Noel Pearson now say about the more productive approach to Indigenous welfare.
Peter was a founder and Vice-President of the Bennelong Society, which I am pleased to note has bipartisan participation—Garry Johns, a former Labor minister, is very active in that, I think, very good society. It was in the period from 1996 to 1998 that I came to know Peter quite well, which was when I had ministerial responsibility for native title in the Howard government. Peter was a regular visitor to my office. He was a very valuable source of advice with his common sense and very wise approach to managing not only Aboriginal affairs generally but specifically the complexity of native title. I found his real passion for Indigenous welfare quite compelling. He remained an active participant in public debate, producing articles and commentary, particularly about Indigenous policy, right up until most recently. He frequently wrote opinion pieces and was, I think, greatly respected by many for that continued involvement in policy discussions. He has made an enormous contribution to public life in Australia.
We are deeply saddened that he has passed away but he had a wonderful life, nearly 90 years of life, and he made an extraordinary contribution. As I said, he was someone who came to this country from his home in England and managed to contribute to this country very successfully. To his son George, daughter-in-law Marie and grandchildren Natasha, Theresa, Rebeckah and Hannah, the coalition places on record our great appreciation of Peter’s tremendous public service, and we tender our profound sympathy to the family in their bereavement.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2009-02-04,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the following bills, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings:
Appropriation (Nation Building and Jobs) Bill (No. 1) 2008-2009,
Appropriation (Nation Building and Jobs) Bill (No. 2) 2008-2009,
Household Stimulus Package Bill 2009,
Tax Bonus for Working Australians Bill 2009,
Tax Bonus for Working Australians (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009, and the
Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Amendment Bill 2009.
I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for these bills to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—

Purpose of the bills

The two Appropriation Bills are supplementary additional estimate appropriation Bills which request legislative authority for further expenses to be incurred in 2008-2009 in relation to the Government’s Nation Building and Jobs Plan. Passage of the bills by 5 February 2009 will allow funds to be made available to departments, thereby ensuring implementation of the programs relating to the package.
Further annual appropriation bills are required to fund a number of measures announced on 3 February 2009. They include funds for the Building the Education Revolution, Energy Efficient Homes, regional and local community infrastructure, the Black Spot Program, repairing regional links on the national highway network and social housing. The additional funding required exceeds what is currently available to the departments and from the Advance to the Finance Minister. The 2008-2009 Additional Estimates Bills are not expected to be agreed to by Parliament until the end of the 2009 Autumn Sittings. Consequently, a set of supplementary bills is required to ensure implementation of the Plan.
The Household Stimulus Package Bill 2009 provides for necessary amendments to deliver on the announcement to provide $950 one-off cash payments to eligible families, those in education and training, and drought affected farmers as part of the Plan.
The Tax Bonus for Working Australians Bill 2009 provides for a tax bonus payment that is to be paid to eligible Australian resident individual taxpayers from April 2009. The Commissioner of Taxation will administer the bonus payments. The bonus will be paid to eligible individual taxpayers based on whether they paid net income tax in the 2007-08 financial year and had a taxable income of $100,000 or less.
The (Consequential Bill) also makes amendments consequential on the enactment of the Tax Bonus for Working Australians Act 2009 to ensure that the bonus payments will not be taken into account for taxation purposes and also for the purposes of income testing for social security and family assistance payments.
The Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Amendment Bill 2009 provides for an increase in the cap on borrowings where special circumstances exist.

Reasons for Urgency

These measures give effect to the announcement by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer in a joint statement on 3 February 2009 outlining the Government’s Nation Building and Jobs Plan. This Plan has the objective of providing immediate stimulus to the Australian economy in the face of the global downturn.
A range of important nation building and jobs measures are contained in the Appropriation Bills. Prompt passage of the legislation is needed so the approval and administrative processes, which involve other levels of government, can be established and the measures begin as soon as possible in 2008-09.
Introduction and passage of the Household Stimulus Bill is needed urgently to enable Centrelink system changes to be made which would provide for payments to begin in the fortnight from 11 March 2009.
Introduction and passage of the Tax Bills are needed quickly to ensure the Australian Taxation Office can have systems in place and settle system design to ensure tax bonus payments can be made to eligible taxpayers from April 2009.
As a result of the deteriorating global economy and the consequent falling tax revenues, the budget is now expected to move into deficit.
The Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911 provides for a cap on the total face value of Commonwealth Government Securities on issue at any point in time, currently $75 billion.
This amendment inserts a new power for the Treasurer to declare that special circumstances exist, justifying an increase in the cap. Once the declaration that special circumstances exist has been published in the Gazette, the cap on Commonwealth Government Securities on issue will be increased by $125 billion.
The amendment must be passed as quickly as possible in the Autumn Sittings to allow for the most efficient and effective management of the Commonwealth Government Securities issuance program.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2009-02-04,"—I seek leave to amend general business notice of motion No. 334 standing in my name for today relating to an order for the production of documents, information and Treasury modelling contained in Australia’s Low Pollution Future: The economics of climate change mitigation. I also seek leave to make a brief statement before asking that it be taken as a formal motion.
Leave granted.
—Since this motion was lodged yesterday, the Senate Select Committee on Fuel and Energy received a response from the Treasurer to its request for access to this information. In his response, the Treasurer refused the committee’s request, stating contractual obligations to external consultants used by the government in conducting its Treasury modelling. The fuel and energy committee met earlier today to consider the Treasurer’s refusal to provide access to the requested information. The committee takes the view that access to this information is in the public interest. It requires it to ensure proper scrutiny of the government’s carbon pollution reduction scheme as proposed in its white paper and, in particular, as it relates to the likely impact of the government’s proposed scheme on the economy and jobs, especially in these difficult economic times. Our advice from the Clerk of the Senate is that, if the Senate insists on the production of these documents, parliamentary privilege will override any relevant contractual obligations of the government. As such, it remains the strong recommendation of the fuel and energy committee to proceed with this motion. I move the motion as amended:
That the Senate—
notes that:
the Select Committee on Fuel and Energy contracted Dr Brian Fisher from Concept Economics to conduct an independent peer review of the Department of the Treasury modelling of the impact of the Government’s proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme,
the committee wrote to the Treasurer (Mr Swan) on 9 December 2008 requesting that Dr Fisher, be given ‘full access to the government’s complete documentation of the government’s models together with the model codes and databases and any other model simulations undertaken relevant to the policy scenarios, but not publicly released’ by 17 December 2008,
the Treasurer has refused the committee’s request, and
Dr Fisher has reported that he was impeded in carrying out the work requested by the committee because the information requested from the Treasurer was not made available to him; and
orders that there be laid on the table by the Minister representing the Treasurer, no later than noon on 5 February 2009, the following information relating to the Department of the Treasury modelling, Australia’s low pollution future: The economics of climate change mitigation:
the model documentation and codes together with all databases for both the global trade and environment model and the Monash multi-regional forecasting model that were employed in the department’s modelling of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme scenarios in a form that would allow the reproduction of the department’s results, and
any other model simulations undertaken relevant to the abovementioned policy scenarios but not publicly released.

We have sought the release of that modelling because we too would like to scrutinise it. That is why we supported this motion. However, I want it also on the record that we have no confidence whatsoever in Dr Brian Fisher from Concept Economics to conduct any kind of fair analysis of the Treasury modelling. Dr Fisher is a climate change sceptic, has been a climate change sceptic, remains a climate change sceptic and was a climate change sceptic as head of ABARE. In my view, he is one significant reason no progress was made on addressing climate change in the years that the Howard government was in power.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2009-02-04,"—I present the first report of 2009 of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I also lay on the table Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No. 1 of 2009, dated 4 February 2009.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to have the tabling statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
In tabling the committee’s Alert Digest No. 1 of 2009, I would like to draw the Senate’s attention to provisions in both the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Medical Devices and Other Measures) Bill 2008 and the Trade Practices Amendment (Cartel Conduct and Other Measures) Bill 2008.
The committee is particularly disappointed with several provisions in the Therapeutic Goods Bill, along with parts of the bill's explanatory memorandum, which it considers have been poorly drafted and will be drawing these to the attention of the Minister.
Two of the provisions causing concern for the committee relate to exemptions from the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. First, proposed new subsection 41GS(6) of the Therapeutic Goods Act, to be inserted by item 2 of Schedule 1, provides that a Ministerial exemption of specified kinds of medical devices under subsection (1) of that section ‘is not a legislative instrument’.
As outlined in Drafting Direction No. 3.8, where a provision specifies that an instrument is not a legislative instrument, the committee would expect the explanatory memorandum to explain whether the provision is merely declaratory (and included for the avoidance of doubt) or expresses a policy intention to exempt an instrument (which is legislative in character) from the usual tabling and disallowance regime set out in the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. Where the provision is a substantive exemption, the committee would expect to see a full explanation justifying the need for the provision.
In this case, the explanatory memorandum states that the exemption referred to ‘is not a legislative instrument within the meaning of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003’ and that subsection (6) ‘explains rather than creates the exemption’ from registration on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments or from parliamentary scrutiny.
The committee considers that this statement is inaccurate, because, for one thing, a Ministerial exemption under new subsection 41GS(1) appears to change the law with respect to the types of medical devices to which it refers; and, in addition, existing Ministerial emergency exemptions for therapeutic goods, which may be made under section 18A, are stated in current subsection 18A(9A) of the Therapeutic Goods Act to be ‘disallowable instruments for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901’ (and therefore subject to parliamentary scrutiny and possible disallowance).
Confusingly, the explanatory memorandum also notes that the amendments in the bill relating to exemptions for specified kinds of medical devices ‘largely mirror the exemption provisions that currently apply to therapeutic goods, other than medical devices’. The committee has therefore sought the Minister’s advice about whether this apparent inconsistency can be resolved.
Similarly, proposed new subsection 18A(9A), to be inserted by item 1 of Schedule 2, provides that an emergency Ministerial exemption of specified kinds of therapeutic goods under subsection (1) of that section ‘is not a legislative instrument’. The explanatory memorandum states that the purpose of new subsection 18A(9A) is ‘to explain, for the benefit of readers, that an exemption made under subsection (1) is not a legislative instrument. As the exemption is not a legislative instrument within the meaning of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, it is not subject to requirements of that Act such as registration or parliamentary scrutiny. This subsection explains rather than creates the exemption’.
The committee considers that this statement is open to question, because subsection 18A(9A), as currently in force, provides that an exemption under subsection (1), and a revocation or variation of such an exemption under subsection (8), ‘are disallowable instruments for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901’. Since the bill seeks to amend only subsection 18A(9A) of the Therapeutic Goods Act, it is difficult to understand how an exemption under subsection 18A(1) can change from being a legislative instrument to a non-legislative instrument. Again, the committee has sought the Minister’s advice about whether this apparent inconsistency can be resolved.
The committee also considers proposed new subsection 13(6) of the Therapeutic Goods Act, inserted by item 15 of Schedule 4, to be problematic. This subsection provides that a Ministerial order determining that a particular standard is not applicable to certain goods under proposed new subsection 13(5) ‘is not a legislative instrument’. The explanatory memorandum states that ‘(a)s the exemption is not a legislative instrument within the meaning of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, it is not subject to requirements of that Act such as registration or Parliamentary scrutiny. This subsection explains rather than creates the exemption’.
Since the Ministerial order is not legislative in character, it may be assumed that the Minister’s decision to make the order is an administrative decision. If that is correct, it is not clear to the committee why that decision is not then subject to merits review under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, when so many other decisions of the Secretary to the Department, and of the Minister, are reviewable under section 60 of the Therapeutic Goods Act. The committee has also sought the Minister’s advice about this issue.
In relation to the Trade Practices Cartel Conduct Bill, the committee has commented on a number of provisions which abrogate the privilege against exposure to a penalty in certain circumstances. For example, new section 86F of the Trade Practices Act, to be inserted by item 5 of Schedule 2, abrogates the privilege against being exposed to the penalty of being disqualified from managing a corporation for a person required to answer a question, produce a document or do any other act in civil or criminal proceedings under, or arising out of, the Trade Practices Act. The explanatory memorandum does not offer any explanation of this particular amendment so the committee has sought the Treasurer’s advice as to the reasons for the abrogation of the privilege against exposure to a penalty in these circumstances.
Similarly, subsection 155(7) of the Trade Practices Act is to be amended by items 43 to 47 of Schedule 2, with the effect that the abrogation of the privilege against self-incrimination is extended to also abrogate the privilege against being exposed to a penalty. The subsection is further amended so as to no longer provide any immunity for any document produced in pursuance of section 155, although it continues to provide ‘use immunity’ to the information so provided.
The committee notes that the explanatory memorandum explains the effect of the relevant items in Schedule 2, however it does not provide a reason for either the abrogation of the privilege against being exposed to a penalty, nor for the removal of the immunity which currently attaches to the production of a document under section 155. Accordingly, the committee has considered it necessary to seek the Treasurer’s advice as to these reasons.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2009-02-04,"—Firstly, I table a correction to the explanatory memorandum to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008 [2009]. It is a minor amendment. I seek leave to continue the remarks that Senator McLucas started to make in summing up the debate.
Leave granted.
—I am sure Senator McLucas was doing a better job, but first of all I would like to acknowledge the contributions of Senator Fierravanti-Wells and Senator Hanson Young for their continuing interest in these issues. Senator McLucas had responded to the first tranche of amendments. The second set seeks to reinstate effective and uniform time limits applying to judicial review of migration decisions in the Federal Magistrates Court, Federal Court and the High Court. The new time limit is 35 days from the date of the migration decision. Importantly, though, the courts will have broad discretion to extend the time for applying for judicial review for a migration decision when it is necessary and in the interests of the administration of justice to do so. That seeks to balance the interests of the applicant with the interests of proper process.
The final set of amendments limits appeals from judgments to make an order or refuse to make an order to extend time to apply for judicial review of migration decisions. This set of amendments will assist in strengthening the time limit for applying for judicial review, which I mentioned earlier, by encouraging applicants to resolve their cases in a timely fashion and by helping to deter applicants from making strategic appeals simply to delay their removal from Australia. The amendments do not limit appeals to the High Court in its original jurisdiction because such a limitation would be unconstitutional. That is a very important step forward. We all support the right of people to seek appropriate decision making and pursue full and fair appeal rights, but there has to be an end to it and there has to be the capacity for a decision that is not in their favour to be enacted. The integrity of our immigration system relies not only on people receiving fair treatment but also on the capacity of the state to remove those who failed to meet our laws. I think that is an important step forward in making sure that we maintain that integrity.
Turning now to the points raised during the debate on the bill, I thank Senator Fierravanti-Wells for her contribution. After years of dealing with this stuff, she is way in front of me on the intricacies of it not only because of her legal background but also from having to wade through it in a professional capacity. I must admit some of this stuff is mind-numbingly difficult, but there are a number of people who live off it as its complexity encourages a profusion of lawyers.
I turn now to Senator Hanson-Young’s concerns regarding a number of issues. I note her concern that the new provision based on time running from the day of the decision rather than from the day of notification may adversely impact on clients. She also raised the concern that the onus that has been placed on applicants to seek an extension of time may be an unreasonable burden, particularly where there are language and financial difficulties. I acknowledge that they are legitimate concerns to raise, but the package put forward in the bill is actually more beneficial than the existing position. The bill introduces a new broad discretion, which is unlimited, to extend time. This means that, if someone wants to apply for an extension of time, they can do so outside the 35-day period—for example, two years later—provided the court decides that it is in the interests of the administration of justice.
Currently, an application for judicial review is required to be lodged within 28 days. Currently, if a person were to seek judicial review in the FMC or in the Federal Court after the extendable period of 84 days, the courts would not have jurisdiction to consider the application or any request to extend time even if there were compelling reasons. So I think the overall package is more beneficial. Those people who are out of time under the current provisions and therefore cannot access the courts will now have an opportunity to put their request for an extension of time to be considered by the courts—not by the department—and the courts’ ability to extend time will be unlimited under the bill.
Senator Hanson-Young also sought clarification of how the amendments to sections 477, 477A and 486A will safeguard applicants against being disadvantaged. The requirement that applicants give reasons is not a legal onus on the applicant. There is no concept of the applicant having to prove that on the balance of probabilities their reasons for an extension are in the interests of the administration of justice; it is merely a requirement that the applicant state reasons for the request for an extension of time. This will assist the court in early identification of meritorious cases so they can be resolved quickly. This is something I have been very keen to pursue since I have been in this portfolio.
Linking the commencement of time to date of decision rather than to date of notification will provide greater certainty for applicants and the courts. It will be clear on the face of the decision when time starts to run. The existing notification laws for notifying an applicant of the decision will continue to apply, but the time limits for applying for judicial review will no longer be linked to actual notification.
Senator Hanson-Young also asked why the time limits start to run even if there is a failure to comply with the requirements of certain provisions. This is to ensure that the time limits operate effectively to minimise the risk of an applicant claiming there was no date of decision for the purpose of time limits because the decision did not comply with legislative requirements, otherwise the effectiveness of the proposed time limits would be undermined. The court can address possible injustice caused by this provision by using its new broad discretion to extend time.
Senator Hanson-Young also asked if there were an unreasonable burden on applicants with financial, language or knowledge of the legal system issues. The amendments are intended to allow the courts to conduct extension of time applications as informally and flexibly as possible with minimal burden. Providing access to an extendable appeal period allows applicants with financial, language or knowledge issues to seek assistance from available resources.
Senator Hanson-Young also asked what had changed since the first iteration of these amendments in the omnibus bill last year and why we are adding schedule 3 at this time. That is a good question. Since drafting Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2008 it became apparent that in order for the time limits to operate effectively those amendments should be accompanied by a limitation on appeals. The limitation on appeals amendments have been included in a separate schedule in the bill for ease of reference but they should not be viewed in isolation from the rest of the bill. They are an integral part of the time limit amendments. Introducing the new broad discretion to extend time without having schedule 3 would open up an additional avenue for judicial review, with consequential implications for cost, time and extra workload for the courts. It may also exacerbate the strategic litigation that we have seen some applicants use to prolong their stay in Australia.
Senator Hanson-Young’s second reading amendment is not supported. As the Senate is aware, last year I announced the government’s New Directions in Detention policy. That included the announcement of our key immigration values, which I think are widely understood. They are values designed to drive the development of a very different detention model. Acknowledging Senator Hanson-Young’s call to immediately put forward amendments to the Migration Act to implement these principles in legislation, I just note that the government is well aware of the desire of stakeholders and others that those policies have legislative backing. That action was strongly advocated by stakeholders in the extensive consultation process we undertook and was also part of recommendation 12 in the first report into immigration detention of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. That part of the report was across party lines—I think it was unanimous, but I will double-check that. It was certainly supported on all sides of the parliament.
I am working to implement these changes as quickly as possible to get them working in practice as quickly as possible on the ground. We will legislate to support those new practices once we have got that experience. I thought that was a better way of going than having a sort of theoretical debate in the parliament and then looking to implement that. I think we will benefit from the experience—knowing what works and what does not work—and then we will have legislation that reflects that. I am keen to progress amendments to the Migration Act. I hope to bring forward more legislation this year. There are obviously drafting and policy issues to be considered, but this certainly should not be seen as the end of it. I am keen to make significant changes to the Migration Act.
I also note the reference again to the introduction of judicial review of the decision to detain. I know this is very important to advocates and that a lot of people are arguing this case out in the community. It was also a recommendation in the first report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. It is our intention—and this is reflected in the values statement—that detention will be for the shortest period possible and subject to increased transparency and accountability. Clearly, detention that is indefinite or otherwise arbitrary is not acceptable. We need regular review of the decision to detain. We have introduced a system that will provide more regular and earlier review. There are three-monthly reviews by a senior departmental officer, and an Ombudsman review at the six-month mark will provide an outside check. The whole philosophy of the department is turned around to justify why you detain—not to detain as your first response. The department is well advanced in implementing those changes, and we should have some evidence of how that is working very shortly.
The main point to make is that I do not have a closed mind on the introduction of judicial review of the decision to detain, but I am mindful that the effectiveness of new three- and six-month detention review arrangements are yet to be determined. There has been no policy decision taken by government regarding judicial review, but it is very much on the table and I am having conversations and interaction with interested parties about those aspects. The joint migration committee’s work is informing that debate and I thank them for that work. I think it is proving useful for the parliament. It is good to see the House of Reps members following the lead of the Senate and learning to conduct inquiries that actually assist the development of public policy and lead the debate. We have good cooperation on that committee and it has done some good work.
Thirdly, Senator Hanson-Young reflects some of her dissenting report into the joint standing committee’s current inquiry into immigration detention, calling for a person to be detained beyond 30 days only if there is a court order that it is necessary to detain that person on a specified ground. I reiterate our policy position that the government’s intention is that detention will be the shortest period possible and that there will be transparency and accountability around those decisions.
I think that responds to the points made in Senator Hanson-Young’s second reading amendment. I understand the motives behind it. The government is not inclined to support it but it has been useful for taking forward the debate. As I say, I think we will have more debate around immigration throughout the year. There is a lot of interest in a range of measures that the government is considering. I think we can as a parliament do some good work in improving the migration legislation and making it more reflective of a modern, tolerant, democratic society.
I thank senators for their contributions and particularly the opposition for their support and I look forward to working with the parliament on further amendments to the migration legislation over the coming year.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2009-02-04,"—I rise to speak on the Horse Disease Response Levy Bill 2008, the Horse Disease Response Levy Collection Bill 2008 and the Horse Disease Response Levy (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008. Broadly, the intention of these bills is to create a mechanism for the imposition of a levy on Australia's horse industry. The funds collected would ensure the industry is able to reimburse the Commonwealth for any expense associated with future outbreaks of horse diseases.
The horse industry will become a signatory to the Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement, EADRA, which began in 2002 and has since gone on to devise other levy arrangements with other sectors of primary industries. The progression of the EADRA to include the horse industry is certainly welcomed by the coalition, but we are very much aware of some differences between the method of operation of the other primary industries, such as cattle, sheep or pigs, and that of the horse industry, which could also very easily be described as a community as well as an industry.
Through the bills before us today, the proposed levy would be imposed at the first registration of a horse with a horse registration body only. It would not be imposed on any subsequent registrations during a horse’s lifespan. It would not be imposed retrospectively on horses that had been registered prior to the commencement of the act.
I would like to speak briefly on our recent experience with equine influenza, the event which was the precursor to these bills. There is no doubt that the outbreak of equine influenza in Australia in August 2007 was a devastating, costly and crippling event for horse businesses, horse clubs and horse owners. More than 8,000 properties in Queensland and New South Wales were infected and the rest of the country was forced to take fast and extreme action in order to halt the geographic spread. According to the report of the Hon. Ian Callinan, ABARE estimated that the costs of the EI outbreak during the initial containment and eradication response reached $560,000 a day for disease control and $3.35 million a day in forgone income in equine business, including racing, farming and recreational enterprises. The Callinan report noted also the Commonwealth’s allocation of $227.9 million through various assistance packages for those whose primary source of income was affected by the EI outbreak and the subsequent horse movement restrictions.
As I have said, the coalition is no stranger to the nightmare that became reality when EI hit our shores. We fully appreciate the costs involved and the need to set up a mechanism for cost recovery in the event of future outbreaks. But, in their current form, these bills will not ensure that equal contributions are made from all sectors of Australia’s horse industry. While the experience and expense of responding to and mopping up after an exotic horse disease is still very much fresh in the coalition’s mind, it will be no surprise for you to hear today that the coalition will not be supporting these bills. We did not support the legislation when it was debated in the other place in September 2008. We did not support the recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport, following a Senate inquiry, that the legislation pass without amendment. And, as I have just said, we will not vote in favour of this legislation in its current form now.
The reason for this is that these three bills represent some of the poorest legislation I have ever been required to assess. This legislation, if passed, will do the exact opposite of what it says it intends to do. Quite simply, the legislation professes to levy equally when in reality it most unfairly levies a small minority of Australia’s horse industry, being those who complete the initial registration of a horse. If this legislation were to become law, in some instances horse owners who are exposing Australia to the greatest risk of exotic horse disease will make no levy payment at all. That, quite frankly, is simply outrageous. I am referring, of course, to the owners of the highly valuable commodities, thoroughbred shuttle stallions. These are the horses who move back and forth between Australia and the United States, Europe, Asia and the United Kingdom to take the financial advantage of dual-hemisphere breeding programs. The shuttled stallions currently engaged in this practice are the very horses that brought EI to our shores, yet the owners of these horses will never pay an EI levy despite the high disease risk these practices create.
Should this legislation be passed, future shuttle stallions will make a contribution to the levy when they are first registered, which is usually completed by the breeders. If ownership changes—a very common occurrence in the thoroughbred racing industry—the new owners will not make a levy contribution, even if they decide later to shuttle their horse in and out of Australia. How is it fair that one person is paying while another is creating the potential for infection?
Despite being the sector which felt most severely in 2007 the effects of EI, a significant majority of the thoroughbred racing industry will make no contribution to the levy. It should also be noted that this sector also received the greater share of income assistance, due to the number of associated businesses and individuals dependent on income from horse racing. It is obvious to many who oppose this bill that this sector would again require a great deal of assistance in the event of a future outbreak, yet the legislation before us facilitates a very minimal input from this sector. The burden of this levy will be borne by the horse breeders—professional and amateur alike. In the case of the amateur, the narrow collection base will be a strong disincentive to continue registering foals. Why should they pay when the great majority of the horse industry will not?
Under this legislation, the backyard hobby breeder will be chipping in more than their fair share while the great proportion of people who own horses, either for pleasure or business, will make no contribution at all. Under this legislation, those engaged in the horse industry through business or employment would not pay the levy, even though these groups would no doubt be calling for assistance in the event of a disease outbreak, as we saw with EI in 2007. It is little wonder that the majority of submissions to the Senate inquiry into these bills came from the hobby and pleasure horse community. It is these groups who are the obvious losers here, to the gain of the commercial sector, and as a result they are vehemently opposed to the levy’s introduction.
The government claims that all of the three peak national horse representative bodies support these bills. This is not totally correct. The President of the Thoroughbred Breeders Association, in a letter to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Minister Burke, on 13 August 2008, said:
The TBA supports passage of the Bills through the Parliament in the spring session on the understanding that the Government will consult with industry to establish a fair and equitable registration scheme to ensure the burden of the levy does not fall on too few horse sectors.
This is a conditional support and relies on the government to review the collection method for fairness and equity. The Australian Horse Industry Council has written in support of these bills, even though many of their member organisations strongly oppose the bills. An AHIC survey of their member organisations reported in July 2008 that, while the majority of respondents support the industry becoming a signatory to the EADRA, the proposed collection method based on horse registrations was not supported.
Individual Australian Horse Industry Council member groups have also expressed staunch opposition to these bills. At its general meeting on 15 July 2008, the Queensland Horse Council passed the following motion:
That the members of the Qld Horse Council Inc are not in favour of signing the Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement or committing to any associated levy at this time.
The National Campdraft Council of Australia also opposed the signing of the EADRA due to the financial impost that would be placed upon its members.
In her submission to the inquiry, Ms Kelly Gannon—a representative of CBG Consultants and author of an online petition that gathered the opinions of 6,743 people opposed to the implementation of the bills before us—very adequately and very succinctly summed up the predominant concerns of recreational horse owners when she wrote:
The current legislation continues to place the majority of the financial burden of any future disease response on the non commercial and recreational sectors of the equine community when they are likely to not be the recipients of any financial assistance in the light of past outbreaks.
Ms Gannon and the 6,743 people she spoke for see the weakness of what is before us, but the government does not. The coalition cannot support these bills.",SENATE,<title>HORSE DISEASE RESPONSE LEVY BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2009-02-04,"—I rise to speak in favour of the Horse Disease Response Levy Bill 2008 and the cognate bills. This legislation is intended to protect the horse industry from future disease outbreaks by bringing the industry into the Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement, which is otherwise known as the EADRA. It is intended to ensure that the horse industry funds its obligations under the agreement.
From the outset I have to say that I am disappointed that the opposition has decided to oppose this legislation on the grounds that it fails to completely satisfy every single stakeholder in the horse industry. This legislation is long overdue. The coalition has known for years that the horse industry should be covered by the Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement, but it has procrastinated on this issue for far too long.
The catalyst for the changes in this legislation was of course the equine influenza epidemic that devastated the horse industry in 2007. The equine influenza outbreak exposed serious deficiencies with Australia’s quarantine system and a lack of preparation and foresight as to how the Australian government would fund its disease response in the event that it would one day have to deal with an emergency animal response.
This highly contagious horse virus was first detected in August 2007 and it spread rapidly throughout New South Wales and Queensland. Fortunately, it did not affect my home state of South Australia. Nevertheless, South Australia did feel the ramifications from the disease. I consider South Australia to have been very fortunate to have escaped being directly affected by the outbreak. We were lucky that the quarantine procedures that were introduced once the virus was detected did in fact work very well. However, South Australian horse owners still had to abide by the quarantine restrictions that were introduced in the eastern states, which meant that many horses were stranded at whatever location they happened to be in when the restrictions came into effect.
Many horse owners were extremely inconvenienced by having to care for their horses that were stranded great distances away from their home stables. Racing horses especially have very particular routines and special requirements, which were disrupted by these restrictions. South Australia has, of course, a great reputation in the horse racing industry, with many great champions having been trained in the state.
The inconvenience caused by the quarantine placed incredible stress on horse owners. I believe that the final estimate of the cost to the horse industry will not adequately describe the enormous indirect costs of the outbreak. We do know, however, that the cost to the Australian government—to the taxpayers—was more than $350 million. This is a very significant expenditure and a costly reminder of the importance of quarantine in Australia. The independent report into the causes of the equine influenza outbreak, authored by the Hon. Ian Callinan AC, was presented in June of last year. It found:
Fundamental biosecurity measures were not being implemented in the largest government-operated animal quarantine station in Australia. This constituted a serious failure by those within the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and AQIS who were and had been responsible for the management of quarantine risks and, in particular, the management of post-entry quarantine arrangements. Among the people who ultimately must take responsibility for that failure were the Secretary of the department as the Director of Animal and Plant Quarantine and the person who, under the Minister, is charged with execution of the Quarantine Act 1908, the Executive Director of AQIS and the Executive Manager of Quarantine within AQIS. Various people have held those positions in recent years.
However, the disaster that was the equine influenza outbreak was further compounded by the absence of any cost-sharing structure to deal with such a crisis. The Australian taxpayer was ultimately left with the clean-up bill, whereas for many other livestock industries the costs are shared between government and industry. In the event of a future emergency disease outbreak, the legislation seeks to establish a mechanism to put a one-off levy on new horse registrations to recover upfront costs after agreement has been reached on appropriate cost-sharing arrangements.
In the event of any future emergency animal diseases within the horse industry, the government will initially underwrite the cost of the response. This is essentially because the horse industry may not have the cash reserves to deal with the crisis when it strikes. Initially, as there is presently no emergency outbreak, the levy will be set at zero. It is important to note that the legislation is not retrospective. There will be no recovery of past moneys spent by the government to eradicate equine influenza or any of the other assistance measures paid out. Surely the opposition would agree that, after spending millions of dollars to deal with eradicating equine influenza, the government does have a responsibility to ensure that a proper system is put in place to deal with the crisis should it happen again—but apparently not. The opposition is prepared to oppose these bills because they are not 100 per cent to their liking. I think that is a very poor reason to oppose the legislation, as this legislation is so essential.
As I mentioned earlier, this legislation is effective because it will finally bring the horse industry into the Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement. Livestock industries that are already party to the EADRA include the cattle, sheep, pig, dairy, poultry, goat and honeybee industries.
—Honey bees?
—Honey bees, yes, and pigs—you would know something about them. In his closing remarks to the House of Representatives, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry made the excellent observation that, if the horse industry were allowed to avoid paying their share in an emergency quarantine response, then other livestock industries would have little incentive to remain in the EADRA. There is the risk that other livestock industries would conclude that there is no need to pay a levy, because the government will bail them out in the event of a crisis. The alternative would be for the Australian government to let the entire industry collapse—obviously a completely unacceptable alternative.
I remind senators opposite that the government consulted extensively before drafting this policy. It has the support of the three peak horse industry bodies, including the Australian Horse Industry Council, the Australian Harness Racing Council and the Australian Racing Board. It also has the support of many other  smaller horse industry bodies such as Riding for the Disabled, Australian Horse Riding Centres and the Equestrian Federation of Australia. After much consultation it was agreed that the fairest way to impose a levy was at the point of registration of a new horse. The coalition has expressed a view that the sporting and hobby clubs will bear too much of the cost of the levy while the racing industry will get off lightly. Any future levy established is going to be negotiated between the government and the horse industry. I am confident that any future increase in the levy will be fairly negotiated. The current government has already acted fairly and reasonably by not pursuing the costs of the equine influenza outbreak and has wisely chosen to set the current rate at zero.
If the coalition votes down this legislation, it is in effect condemning the horse industry to future uncertainty and the whim of future governments who may not be inclined or in a position to act so reasonably. These bills at the very least put down a framework which will move the horse industry forward and provide certainty to the industry, in the event of a future emergency disease outbreak, that their horses will be protected. In the absence of any real alternatives being offered by the alternative government, the most sensible and responsible course of action is to support this legislation. As I have said before, all the other major livestock industries are party to the EADRA agreement. If this legislation fails to pass the Senate, I fear that the horse industry will be left in a state of limbo for a significant period of time, so the time to pass this legislation is now. There is consensus among the peak horse industry bodies that this needs to happen. They are willing to sign up to the EADRA and to be a party to this agreement. They were asking to be party to the EADRA even before the horse flu outbreak because they understood that they were in a vulnerable position, being, as they are, outside of this agreement. This was a request that the previous government failed to action.
I seek to summarise the current situation. I think it is important that we cover all of the circumstances. The first point that is worth noting is that both sides of politics have known for some time that the horse industry should be a party to the EADRA. The second point to note is that the horse industry as a whole wants to be a party to the EADRA. The third point to note is that in 2007 the quarantine system broke down and emergency control measures were rapidly implemented, but at a huge cost and distress to the racing community. In the aftermath, the Australian government was left with the clean-up bill—as I indicated earlier, at a very significant cost of $350 million to the Australian taxpayers. After the disaster of the equine influenza outbreak, we have the opportunity to pass legislation that will fix this problem. The legislation will provide certainty for the future, yet the opposition has decided to oppose the legislation because it is not entirely to its liking. I believe this to be an irresponsible position for it to take, and I sincerely hope the legislation passes the Senate. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>HORSE DISEASE RESPONSE LEVY BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2009-02-04,"—Many Australian families own a horse which brings great joy and fulfilment to their lives. Family First believes that those who own a horse for their private enjoyment, leisure or sporting activities should not be financially burdened in the event of any outbreak of equine influenza as they will be under the proposed Horse Disease Response Levy Bill 2008 and cognate bills.
Equine influenza, or EI as it is known, is an exotic disease imported by those who own horses for commercial or business reasons. Those mums, dads and kids who belong to the local pony club and who privately own a horse as a valued and loved family pet are not responsible for the importation and subsequent outbreak of EI. Therefore they should not have to pay the levy proposed by the Horse Disease Response Levy Bill 2008 to fund the recovery effort in the event of a future outbreak. Also, those who own a horse as a pet are not making any profit as a result of that ownership and are less financially able to pay a levy, unlike those with commercial interests in the horse industry. The bill as proposed seeks to introduce a levy paid by the horse owner when registering a horse for the first time. Those already signed up to the Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement, the EADRA, such as the poultry, beef and dairy industries, have agreed to help pay for any emergency response to an outbreak of animal diseases. Currently, the horse industry has not signed the agreement.
The aim of the bills before us is to bring the horse industry into the agreement and to impose the levy on all horses registered with a horse industry body. This raises the issue of what exactly is meant by the term ‘horse industry body’. Does this include the local pony club? Pony Club Australia, in its submission to the recent Senate inquiry on this bill and the cognate bills, was greatly concerned about the effect the levy will have on private horse owners, horse associations and clubs. The pony club, a not-for-profit amateur youth organisation established in Australia in 1934 and consisting of over 55,000 members nationwide, depends upon the goodwill of those thousands of volunteers to run the club’s events each weekend. The club’s submission states:
The associations are not equipped and do not have the capacity financially, administratively or in human resources to manage the collection of levies.
Their submission also points out the differences between the horse industry and the produce industries such as those for beef, dairy and poultry. It states:
In the Performance, Recreation and Hobby sector there is no end product other than the companionship and pleasure, or performance, enjoyed by the rider.
As the submission points out about participants in the sector:
Some are single parents, some are minors, others from some of the rural industries which are suffering adverse conditions and all are struggling to meet the increased cost of fuel, feed and general living expenses. For many it involves substantial personal sacrifice so their children can continue their involvement.
In her submission to the committee, Ms Kelly Gannon from Victoria wrote extensively about the inequality of a flat fee levy imposed across the horse industry affecting individual horse owners who are not involved in the commercial or business aspects of the industry. Ms Gannon stated:
It is my belief that the majority of intended ‘potential levy payers’ do not create the need for these regulations, do not create the risk of disease and do not run commercial profitable businesses, and are, in actual fact, the unfortunate recipients of other peoples commercial risk taking behavior.
So it begs the question: why should these horse lovers, who have not created this risk, be required to pay for it? Ms Gannon created an online petition against the proposed levy and over 6,000 people have signed up in opposition to it. Angela Yeend, the Executive Officer of the Equestrian Federation of Australia, in her submission to the committee argues that applying the same levy fee to all horse owners across the industry is grossly unfair as most horse owners are:
… not responsible and have no control over, or accountability from, those who import horses.
She also expressed concern that the levy would prevent many people from being able to ‘start at grassroots level’ in equestrian sports. Family First believes that, while it is important to have strategies in place to deal effectively with a future outbreak of EI, it should be recognised that there are significant differences between other livestock industries and the horse industry. Not all horses can be defined as ‘cattle’ as they are often privately owned and loved family pets and are used for leisure and sporting activities.
Private horse owners are usually not involved in commercial activities which are associated with the risk of importing an exotic disease. For many families owning a horse is already an expensive hobby, giving great enjoyment, physical exercise and learning experiences to children and adults alike. Adding a levy to the costs of looking after a horse may cause some families to give up their pets. It may also stop many from registering their horses, thus preventing them from participating in sporting competitions. Individuals or families who own a horse for their own pleasure or for sporting activities are not making a profit from their horse and therefore are less able financially to fund the emergency response to an outbreak of EI.
Those who are involved in importing horses and those responsible for implementing secure quarantine practices to protect Australia from exotic diseases are the ones primarily responsible for any future outbreak of EI, not families and kids participating in equestrian or pony club activities each weekend. Families should not have to foot the bill when those who import horses fail to prevent the disease from coming into Australia. Family First will be looking to the committee stage to see whether this issue is addressed adequately and we will reserve our vote on the third reading.
 (Senator Marshall)—Senator Fielding, are you indicating to me that you would like to have a committee stage, which, as I understand it, is not intended at the moment?
—That is correct.",SENATE,<title>HORSE DISEASE RESPONSE LEVY BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2009-02-04,"—I too rise to speak on the Horse Disease Response Levy Bill 2008 and associated bills before the chamber today. It is a pleasure to speak following the contribution of Senator Fielding, who has accurately canvassed many of the issues and concerns that I also have with this legislation. These bills, as previous speakers have outlined, relate to the government’s response to the equine influenza outbreak that crippled Australia’s horse industry and horse sector over a long period of time. It is of grave concern to us that the government’s response, as they are attempting to implement it through this legislation, has so clearly been botched. Responding to the risk of disease in the equine sector is quite important. Getting it right is quite important. It is a big industry. There are big dollars at stake. There are many jobs at stake. There are many factors at stake in this sector.
The horse industry is more than just an industry. I try to avoid calling it ‘just the horse industry’ because, for so many people, it is not just an industry. It is a hobby; it is a lifestyle; it is a part of the family. That is what owning a horse is about for so many Australians. This is a very different sector to some of those that Senator Farrell mentioned in his contribution and that others have focused on. It is not like all of the other commercial animal sectors, because so much of it is in the hobbyist area. This is a fundamentally different area. It is not like cattle, sheep, goats or honey bees, as we heard before from Senator Farrell. This is a sector which is in fact overwhelmingly dominated by people who have horses as pets, who have them for their children and who have them as part of their day-to-day lifestyle. It is these people who will be most affected and most impacted by this legislation proposed by the government.
I have received, as have other senators, strong community opposition to this proposal. I have been in touch with many of the equine associations in my home state. I have been in touch with many of the grassroots organisations, like the Pony Club, scattered throughout South Australia, with many of the other bodies representing various breed groups and with others involved in the not-for-profit horse sector. They have continuously expressed to me concerns that this is unfair on their members, on the people who own the horses and, indeed, on those associations and bodies who will potentially be caught up in the whole levy collection process.
At the end of last year, I had the pleasure of attending the National Mounted Games held in Adelaide’s parklands and hosted by the Pony Club Association of Australia. It is an annual gathering of Pony Club riders from around the country where, it is noteworthy, they ride borrowed horses. We are not talking about the transportation of horses across the country. These are people who cannot necessarily afford to transport their horses across the country, because it is such a small volunteer sector. These are people who turn up to compete on their own time at their own expense in a not-for-profit environment. Of course, they are also young people. They are young people and families who are involved in a healthy outdoor pastime, one that is so integral to Australia’s history and culture. We can all reflect with pride on the opening of the Sydney Olympics when we saw the horses storm into the Olympic stadium. It shows just how integral the horse industry has been to Australia’s culture and should continue to be, not just as an industry but also as a sector that all Australians can and should be able to afford to embrace.
As I indicated, there is strong opposition to this piece of legislation and to the proposed introduction of these levies on the equine sector. I have met with and spoken to the Pony Club Association on numerous occasions. They provided to the inquiry that was undertaken by the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs a very detailed submission, which I have referred to and which I am sure other senators will also refer to in their contributions to this debate. There is opposition not just from the Pony Club Association but also from other organisations, including HorseSA, the peak horse industry body in South Australia, which made it quite clear that they believed that the bill could not be supported. I have also heard opposition from the Equestrian Federation of South Australia, which also made a submission to the Senate inquiry into these bills. Their submission made it equally clear that they believe that the levy as currently proposed would be unfair to the majority of horse owners who are not responsible for, have no control over and have no accountability for those who import horses. In doing so, it is these people who pose in many ways the greatest risk to the security and safety of the equine sector in Australia.
There are an estimated 1.2 million horses around Australia. Many of these are retired in paddocks, not actually used by anybody but still loved and cared for by their owners. There are many more that are used on a recreational basis. There are some that are still used on a pastoral basis. A very small number out of that 1.2 million are actually used as part of the horse industry, particularly the racing sector and the profitable horse sector, where we see the money and the jobs generated in the main. The government’s proposal, it is understood, will capture some 50-odd thousand registered horses. It captures just a very small proportion of the total number of horses in Australia. But, still, that small number of registered horses in Australia that is captured will overwhelmingly be dominated by those of the not-for-profit sector. In its submission, Pony Club Australia says that it represents in excess of 55,000 horse owners. It states that this legislation is ‘fundamentally flawed and grossly unfair to horse owners in the Performance, Recreation and Hobby sector’ and goes on to say that, if passed into law, it would:
... inflict great hardship on our Association and our members resulting in a huge reduction of the numbers of young people participating and have an equally dramatic impact on the number of clubs, facilities available and opportunities to take part in horse sport and recreation.
That is a very clear statement of belief from Pony Club Australia—that, if passed, this legislation would mean fewer families, fewer young people and fewer children would be able to afford to participate in a great recreational activity which is so iconic in Australia’s pastime. Why the government would want to proceed with something that would hurt so many families who are simply trying to do the right thing by their kids is beyond me. That is what the outcome will be. It will hurt everyday, hardworking Australians, the so-called ‘working families’ that the government liked to talk about so much before the election, about whom we do not hear terribly much now. I have not heard the phrase ‘working families’ for some time from the other side of the chamber.
—Because they are probably not working.
—As Senator Johnston rightly points out, that is probably because they are not working as we see greater and greater unemployment forecast by this government. But I stray from the importance of this issue to everyday Australians and families right around Australia, important because to them this is about social activities and pastimes, healthy, outdoor activities which government should be encouraging more of, not putting greater burdens in the way of. That is the fundamental issue that really needs to be looked at here: why a government would want to make it harder for young people to engage in a healthy, outdoor recreation activity that is so iconic to Australia’s history.
As well as the inequalities in the spread and collection of the levy, Pony Club Australia and others making submissions to the Senate inquiry, and representations to me and to other senators, have indicated concerns about their capacity to collect these levies and the capacity of organisations to be the filtering point to collect the levies for registered horses. Why? Because most of them are volunteer organisations. Most of the pony clubs around Australia are so small that, indeed, they would not be registered for GST purposes. All of their office bearers would be volunteers. Their state organisations might employ a part-time staff member. These are not organisations that are funded or equipped to collect government taxes or levies—far from it. These are organisations run by either mums and dads who are giving up their time to make sure that they can help run the organisation for the benefit of their children or indeed people like my mother, who works as an instructor on a voluntary basis on weekends.
There are so many examples and instances of Australians volunteering in these organisations. In effect, we are going to ask volunteers working in pony clubs to become tax collectors if this legislation is passed. That is utter madness and shows the selfishness of the government in wanting to pursue this type of proposal. Pony clubs are not in a position to be able to collect it.
With such a high proportion of horses in this recreation sector to be captured by the levy, the government needs to reconsider this. It is unfair, as Senator Colbeck made clear in his earlier comments, to burden the not-for-profit sector with the same type of levy system as will be applied to the for-profit sector, to the horse industry where breeders, racing owners and others seek to derive an income and make money out of the industry. That is where a comparison can be made with other types of animals that are covered by similar levies. That is where you can make a valuable example and comparison—not with the overwhelming majority of people who are in the recreation sector.
On behalf of all of those who have made such an effort to lobby me and my fellow Liberal and National senators, who have acknowledged from the very introduction of this proposal that it would hurt too many Australians and would cause pain and angst, I urge the Senate to defeat these bills, not to take the government at trust that somehow or other the regulations will tighten things up and make it fairer, because that is not the way we should deal with legislation here. We should know the outcome of legislation passed in this place before we allow it to be passed. We should not pass it based on the trust that the government will get the regulations right because, given the lack of consideration for those in the recreational horse sector shown in these bills to date, I struggle to trust that the government would get the regulations right.
These bills should be defeated today. I note that the Australian Greens issued a minority report opposing the passage of these bills. I welcome that and trust that they will stick to their guns. I welcome the comments that Senator Fielding, who preceded me, made outlining his concerns in this area. I encourage Senator Xenophon, on behalf of the fellow South Australian constituents we share, to think long and hard before he gives a vote in favour of these bills, because these bills will hurt ordinary South Australians, whom I know regard Senator Xenophon very highly. They would hope that he would regard their concerns about a new levy and a new fee as something he should be listening to and I am sure and hope that he will be.
As I read through the submissions made by the various contributors to the Senate inquiry, I was taken, in the Pony Club Australia submission, by an extract of a poem by Banjo Paterson called In the Droving Days. It is a poem that I think highlights the iconic nature of the Australian equine sector. I think it highlights just why we need to recognise that this is a sector that holds a special place in Australians’ hearts. It holds a special place in the hearts of thousands upon thousands of Australians who voluntarily give their time to love their animals, to help their children love their animals and to participate in these healthy recreations in so many different equine sectors. The poem finishes with the words:
And now he’s wandering, fat and sleek,
On the lucerne flats by the Homestead Creek;
I dare not ride him for fear he’d fall,
But he does a journey to beat them all,
For though he scarcely a trot can raise,
He can take me back to the droving days.
Let us not forget the history of those droving days in this country. Let us not forget the mums, dads and children who get so much pleasure out of the equine sector and let us toss these unreasonable bills out.",SENATE,<title>HORSE DISEASE RESPONSE LEVY BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2009-02-04,"—I rise to speak on the Horse Disease Response Levy Bill 2008 and associated bills. The purpose of the bills is to impose a levy on the initial registration of horses and to allow for its collection by persons or bodies that, in their administration, register horses, so that the horse industry can repay any amount paid by the Commonwealth on behalf of the horse industry in the event of a disease outbreak. To allow the repayment arrangements via a levy to come into law, it is also necessary to provide for legislation to collect and administer the levy. This is provided for through the Horse Disease Response Levy Collection Bill 2008 and through the Horse Disease Response Levy (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008. The Rudd Labor government is protecting Australia’s horse industry and looking ahead to the future.
The Australian Horse Industry Council, the Australian Harness Racing Council and the Australian Racing Board support the imposition of a horse disease response levy, and the levy rate will be set by regulations under the new Horse Disease Response Levy Bill 2008. The arrangements provide for Animal Health Australia, known as AHA, to manage the levy received on behalf of the industry, where the main priority is to repay any amount paid by the Commonwealth on behalf of the horse industry in the event of an outbreak of an emergency horse disease. There are no direct financial implications for the Commonwealth as the intention of the new bill is to facilitate the imposition of a horse disease response levy on the registration of horses, payable by owners.
I would like now to spend some time discussing the Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement, commonly known as the EADRA, which is at the core of this issue. The EADRA was launched in March 2002, following a number of concerns about the scope and effectiveness of the then Commonwealth-state cost-sharing agreement in place since 1955, which covered only 12 diseases. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, when there is an outbreak of an exotic disease in any of the animal industries there needs to be an emergency response to minimise damage to the affected animals and the industry involved. The preferable outcome is the eradication of the disease and the return of the affected industry to its state prior to the outbreak.
The EADRA is a contractual agreement between animal industries and governments and is the only way that industries at risk of disease outbreaks can be certain of a timely and appropriate response from government to their needs. As with all contractual arrangements, there are financial implications and obligations for all parties. The EADRA provides a mechanism for an affected animal industry to call for assistance from governments to provide vital skills and resources to identify, contain, control and eradicate an exotic disease incursion. Under the EADRA governments are obliged to provide and maintain sufficient resources to assist animal industries in their times of need. Without the EADRA no legally-binding obligation exists.
The outbreak of equine influenza, EI, in August 2007 was absolutely devastating and, despite the coordinated efforts of government and industry bodies and horse and animal health specialists, the Australian horse industry was completely tipped on its ear. The epidemic made its way to Australia via Japan and lasted some 130 days from August 2007 until the last case was reported in December 2008.
We all remember that. What a catastrophe that could have been! It was bad enough. If we cast our minds back, we would remember that for the first time in our history we were faced with the possibility of not having a Melbourne Cup campaign—not to mention, more importantly, the fiscal damage that was done to those employed in the industry. When we talk about the effects of EI, everyone seems to think, for some strange reason, that horse racing is the sport of kings and that it is therefore only the rich and the privileged that suffered through the EI period. I do not pretend to know a great heap of people employed in the horse industry but I am sure there are strappers, trainers, owners, suppliers of veterinary products, and the like—those who are employed on Saturdays or mid-week, whether they be from your great state of Victoria, Mr Acting Deputy President, or my even greater state of Western Australia—who are certainly not in the league of kings. So it was absolutely disgraceful that we ever got to that stage, and I just cannot believe that someone has not been chucked in jail and had the key thrown away, over that episode.
I will get back to the bills. The passage of these bills will enable the horse industry to become a party to the Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement, something the industry has wanted for many years. By establishing a levy arrangement through these bills, the horse industry would become a signatory to the EADRA and would have certainty of resources in responding to emergency horse disease outbreaks. As mentioned earlier, the bills establish a mechanism to apply a levy on the initial registration of horses and provide arrangements for the collection and administration of that levy so that the horse industry could repay the Commonwealth of Australia for underwriting the horse industry’s share of costs. Such a levy would be payable once on the initial registration of a horse with a recognised breed society or performance organisation. For horses already registered prior to any emergency response people would not be liable to pay a levy. I want to reiterate that: they would not have to pay the levy. It will only apply to new horse registrations.
As the horse industry does not need to repay its share of the costs of the 2007 equine influenza emergency response, these bills establish a zero rate levy. No rate can be set unless the industry is consulted; however, regulations would prescribe a future levy rate. Regulations will be developed in consultation with industry to help ensure that they are fair and equitable. Regulations cannot go beyond the scope of the bills and will be disallowable in parliament. I think it is very important that we get that message out, that they will be disallowable. Nevertheless, drafting instructions and principles underlying the intended operation of the proposed regulations have been provided to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport.
As you know, the bills were sent off to the committee and the committee did have a number of hearings here in Canberra. There were quite a few groups that presented to the committee. While I am on that, there were difficulties that we experienced through the committee stage. When we were first talking about this, and this goes back to the previous government, the Howard government started the conversation with the horse industry through those three major groups—thoroughbreds and racing and harness racing—and at all stages I believe that the previous government had only the best interests of Australia and the horse industry foremost in its mind. I acknowledge that. But it was absolutely frustrating to have conversations going on between the representative body—I think this went on for eight to 12 months, but I will stand corrected if I have those figures wrong—and the government, which believed the body was speaking for the majority of the industry, only to discover in the committee hearings that there were a number of other associations, such as camp drafting and pony clubs, that came out diametrically opposed to what was being said and saying the horseracing industry did not represent them. The frustration I had as the chair of the committee was: why did it take that long for someone to come out and say that they were not being represented? In all fairness to the previous government—I take my hat off to them—I honestly believe they thought, as did we, that they were dealing with the industry. It was very frustrating when a couple of groups turned up to tip a bucket of bile on the representatives of that industry and to tell us at the committee stage that their voice was not being heard and that the horseracing industry did not speak for them.
As I was saying, at present we are at the stage where the peak bodies involved in the horse industry have a levy system that is at least acceptable and agreeable to all involved to help protect against any of the potentially devastating effects of a future exotic disease incursion. We must create these protections now so that the sector is protected into the future. The worst option for Australia and for the horse industry would be for there to be no levy put in place. It would be devastating and neglectful if this parliament were to end up leaving the horse industry in the same position it was in at the beginning of EI. I want to stress that to senators opposite: it would be devastating and neglectful.
This package of bills will give the horse sector the certainty that other livestock sectors have when responding, with government, to emergency animal disease incursions. The levy is currently set at zero dollars, as I said, and will only be raised upon an incident or break-out of an epidemic. In 2006 the horse industry had proposed to the Howard government a levy arrangement to protect the horse industry against the impacts of emergency disease outbreaks. Of course, under the previous government arrangements were not put in place to sign up the horse industry to the EADRA and establish the industry’s emergency disease preparedness. As a result, at the time of the outbreak of the equine influenza in August 2007, the horse industry was not a signatory to the agreement and was left dangerously exposed. The horse sector remains the only major livestock group not included in the EADRA.
Without cost-sharing arrangements in place in the event of another disease outbreak, the sector could be liable for considerable cost to contain and eradicate any disease which would normally be shared with governments under the EADRA framework. I ask senators opposite: is that what you really want to see? Let us keep our fingers crossed that we are not ever faced with such a situation, but what a shocking situation it would be if this package of bills were knocked back with the assistance of senators opposite and others. It is worth noting that the former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Hon. Peter McGauran, is now the CEO of Thoroughbred Breeders Australia, which supports the passage of the bills. I find that absolutely incredible, that a former senior minister is on side.

Senator McGauran interjecting—

—If we are talking about the good old days, Senator McGauran, you should have taken your brother out the back and sorted it out, but unfortunately it has not worked. The opposition opposed these bills in the House and incorporated dissenting reports within the Senate committee report. However, the Independent member for New England, Tony Windsor MP, supported the passage of the bills in the House. There needs to be some system to cope with the consequences of an outbreak, and these bills provide for this. It seems reasonable that the Australian taxpayer will expect to be reimbursed for at least part of the cost of an emergency response—not all, but at least part. The financial security of many thousands of Australians relies on a strong and secure horse industry, as I said earlier on.
In my home state of Western Australia the industry employs an estimated 12,000 people and the Rudd government will not sit back and wait for the outbreak of disease in the horse population. The government will implement the recommendations of the Callinan report and will act to strengthen our quarantine and biosecurity services. The government will give those people working in the horse industry a solid footing so that they know that if there is another outbreak they will have governmental protection and not an industry catastrophe. The measures in the main bill are appropriate and they are necessary. There is ample capacity within the legislation for the levy schedule to take into account different sectors of the industry and, as I have mentioned, the bill sets the proposed rate of horse disease response levy at zero. I cannot stress that enough.
As senators are aware, the bill did go to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport for further examination. It was evident to the committee that the general principle on which this legislation is based is soundly consistent with measures applying to all livestock. This legislation represents an insurance measure to ensure that horse owners will have funds to deal with any future outbreak of equine diseases. The committee resolved to support compulsory registration for all horses and believes that this, together with the establishment of a national register, would greatly enhance the ability of animal health agencies to respond in the case of emergency. The establishment of such a register would of course require further consultation and agreement between the states and territories. We have not backed away from that through this whole process.
A number of submissions and testimonies were made by interested and affected parties over the course of the hearings, and the committee heard a number of concerns of community recreational owners and riders. It is important for all senators to remember that the policy detail of the horse disease response levy are not yet available and should not be condemned or discarded at this time. The bills before us are enabling legislation. That detail will be provided and, as I said before, we will be open for comment and consultation.
It is also important that all senators be aware that these bills have the support—I must stress this again—of a number of industry groups, such as the Australian Racing Board Ltd, Harness Racing Australia and the Australian Horse Industry Council, as well as Thoroughbred Breeders Australia, Riding for the Disabled and the WA Horse Council, to name a few.
I am confident, as is the committee, that the regulations can be framed so as to take account of a wide diversity of horse ownership and riding activity in the community and that they will also be equitable. Equity issues are important to consider when discussing these bills. Whilst all parties agree with the principle of a broadly based levy, it may be appropriate to exempt some classes of owners, riders and community groups.
In summing up and without sounding like a broken record, I do wish to stress once more that, in regard to performance organisations, the intent is to cover organisations that hold regular events or competitions, such as polo matches, endurance events, campdrafting, equestrian rodeos and dressage. However, small community organisations and groups, such as some pony clubs and Riding for the Disabled, will likely be excluded from the levy arrangements where these organisations do not conduct regular competitions. As I have said previously, and I reiterate this, the regulations have not been prepared, as detailed consultation with industry has to take place, needs to take place and will take place. This will be done following the passage of the bills. The regulations cannot, as I said before, go beyond the scope of the bills and will be disallowable in the parliament.
So, for fellow senators and senators opposite, this bill has been debated in both houses and has been reviewed by the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee—a wonderfully hardworking committee, if I can say so myself, and that is all members of that committee. Upon review of the submissions made, comments and testimony received, and extensive consultation, it was the committee’s recommendation to the Senate that these bills be passed without amendment. I commend these bills to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>HORSE DISEASE RESPONSE LEVY BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-02-04,"—I indicate my support for the second reading of the Horse Disease Response Levy Bill 2008 and associated bills. I also express my gratitude for the information that has been provided by the minister’s office, as recently as this afternoon, which I will refer to shortly. I will not outline what the purposes of these bills are. I think fellow senators have adequately done that and I will not waste the Senate’s time by reiterating that other than to say that, to me, the nub of this issue is not that something ought to be done to protect Australians and to protect the industry from equine influenza. We know, from the report of the inquiry conducted by a former High Court Justice, the Hon. Mr Callinan QC, that there were some serious flaws that needed to be addressed as a result of what happened in the EI outbreak that was the subject of his inquiry. But it seems to me that the key issue here is whether it is appropriate to give the executive arm of government what some may see as a blank cheque in being able to raise this levy without sufficient guidelines or safeguards. That is why I would like to formally request that there be a committee stage in relation to these bills so that further questions can be asked in addition to any response the minister makes with respect to the second reading contributions.
I am mindful of the comments made by Senator Birmingham that recreational horseriding is a very significant activity in my home state of South Australia. Indeed, I think that would apply to all states.
If I may I will refer to an email I received from the minister’s office this afternoon. I am grateful for that information. A number of matters were raised and I think it would be appropriate for me to put on the record my concerns—or rather, questions—arising out of those communications. I note that the drafting instructions and principles underlying the intended operation of the proposed regulations have been provided to the Senate committee that inquired into this legislation and, further, that these drafting instructions for the regulations specify that those horse groups which do not hold regular competitions and do not meet the description of a performance organisation or breeding society will be exempt from paying any future levy. My question to the minister is: what does the government consider to be ‘a regular competition’? What is the definition of that? What are the guidelines to provide some comfort for those who do have horse clubs for recreational horse users as to what the parameters of that will be both in terms of what ‘regular’ means and the definition of ‘competition’? Does a few people getting together around a paddock occasionally, where there is a barbecue after the event and a couple of bottles of wine, constitute a ‘competition’? I think it is important that we define, in the context of this debate, in the context of the committee stage, what a ‘competition’ is and what is meant by ‘regular’.
I note that the minister’s office says that if horse owners do not hold competitions then they will not have to pay a levy. I also note that the government’s position, however, is that, in accordance with the legislation and the government’s principles for levies, they must consult with industry on these finer details and that this is the government’s intention. The whole concept around the regulations is that it is intended that there will be consultation—I accept that. If the minister can provide details as to the time frame for the consultation, the extent of the consultation, the nature of that consultation and, in broad terms, the organisations that will be consulted, that would be quite useful.
There is also the issue, in the context of this consultation, of the regulations that will arise. Is it intended that the regulations will be provided to the Senate and that the Senate will have the opportunity to disallow those regulations before they come into force? I refer to the debate late last year on Minister Albanese’s Road Charges Legislation Repeal and Amendment Bill 2008, which dealt with levies and road user charges. I may be wrong on this, but my recollection is that there was an opportunity to disallow the regulations associated with the legislation before they came into force—so there was that additional safeguard.
The information provided by the minister’s office indicates that it is also intended to exclude small groups from paying a levy where it would not be efficient to do so. If the minister could provide details as to what defines a small group and what is meant by efficiency, that would be appreciated. The information goes on to say: ‘In other words, if they are so small then it is not worth the administrative cost to actually collect this levy. We are intending these to be organisations with less than 10 registrations in a period of three months.’ That means that an organisation that has fewer than 40 new members in the year will be most likely not to pay a levy, but the advice says further: ‘We are obliged to consult with industry about this before making a final decision.’ To what extent will the government stray from that consultation in the context of formulating the regulations?
I note that the minister has committed himself to detailed consultation with industry on the regulations, and I accept that. Can I take it from that that industry includes the various recreational horse groups? There is a well-articulated argument in the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport inquiry report, particularly the dissenting reports—there were three dissenting reports—in relation to equity issues and the fairest collection mechanism and whether some groups of horse owners are in a better position to pay, as I believe there would be in the case of racehorse owners as compared to recreational users.
They are my concerns. It is my intention to support the bill in its second reading. I do have concerns about the lack of precision around how the legislation will actually operate. It has been left to the regulations, but, in the absence of it being spelt out explicitly, if the government undertakes to outline how the matters raised by the minister’s office will be specifically dealt with, that degree of particularity would assist me in determining my position at the end of the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>HORSE DISEASE RESPONSE LEVY BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2009-02-04,"—At the outset, consistent with my return of interests to the Senate, I declare that I own horses. They are thoroughbred mares and, potentially at least, I would be impacted by the outcome of this legislation through the operation of any levy mechanism.
It is important to put this debate into context. The Horse Disease Response Levy Bill 2008 and related legislation follow upon the worst disease outbreak that the Australian horse industry has ever seen. That outbreak occurred, as has been established by a commission of inquiry, by totally inadequate quarantine arrangements administered by the previous government and by a quarantine facility that took what can only be described as totally inadequate—indeed, laughable—precautions to prevent the spread of disease in what was supposedly a high-security quarantine facility. It is remarkable that we did not experience an outbreak prior to the one that occurred in 2007. It was a matter of coincidence and coincidence only that it occurred because of a thoroughbred introduction of the disease. What needs to be understood is that at that time there were instances drawn to the attention of some people of questionable procedures operating in relation to horses of other breeds, particularly Arab breeds, introduced into Australia for show and display purposes in earlier years. So it is not accurate to say that the only risk that Australia faced, or continues to face, from the introduction of disease comes from the shuttle stallion arrangements, which was the argument put by opposition senators in a dissenting report of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport inquiry as a part justification for the position that they take.
The reality of course is that the shuttling of thoroughbred stallions is a significant part of the risk factor but only part of it in relation to the introduction of disease. With any import procedure that involves live animals there is a risk, and therefore it is incumbent upon a country like Australia, which has a very good record of controlling and excluding animal diseases, to operate a set of quarantine arrangements which are rigorously observed and which take into account risk factors which can make the introduction of those diseases extremely unlikely.
In relation to horse flu, the evidence is well and truly in that the risk was known—that the previous government had been alerted to the prospect of a great impact on the Australian racing, breeding and other horse industries in this country by the introduction of the disease, but in fact it presided over a system which saw us move away from a rigorous quarantine system to one which was haphazard and indeed doomed to failure. The evidence of the royal commission, as contained in the royal commissioner’s report, is a damning indictment of the way that our quarantine system, in relation to those particular animals and indeed others, was run. The Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport saw consistent criticism of the quarantine arrangements that existed under the previous government. We saw criticisms which related to the introduction of plant disease as well as animal disease. It is certainly timely that our quarantine system is under review and it is certainly timely that the government has received a report, as indicated, and it will give effect to the recommendations of that report to strengthen the quarantine system so Australia can be best served by the arrangements that the government put in place to protect Australian industries from the predations of disease from other countries.
In relation to the measures in this piece of legislation, the position taken by the opposition and the Greens is, frankly, not one which is consistent with positions taken in relation to legislation that came before this chamber under the previous government, and certainly not from the opposition when in government, because on a regular basis—and certainly during the last three years of that government—this chamber was faced with legislation without seeing the content of regulations which would have a substantial effect on the industry that was the subject of the legislation. So here we have the opposition’s hypocrisy being revealed: in government they said, ‘You should trust the government, you should accept the undertakings of a minister as to consultation and you should accept that there is the ability to disallow legislation’—even when they had the numbers in the chamber—but in this case, where this government will not have the numbers in this chamber and will have to put regulations before the chamber, they are saying, ‘We shouldn’t pass this legislation until we see the regulations.’ What kind of hypocrisy is that? The fact of the matter is that if this government cannot justify the regulations then clearly, with the position taken by opposition senators and the Greens in relation to adequate regulatory mechanisms underpinning the legislation, any regulation put before this chamber would be in grave danger if the minister had not conducted himself in a way that complied with the undertakings that were given to all parties and the industry in relation to how his role in the regulatory process would be carried out—indeed, even if the process were carried out, if the form of the regulation had some flaw in it that was identifiable and which both the Greens and the opposition were unhappy with.
So all of those fail-safes now exist in relation to this legislation and all the government is saying is, ‘Let’s put in place a piece of legislation which will allow the matter to go forward, will allow the industry to have the benefit of the protections that the Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement will have and will allow for the industry in a broad sense to make provision to pay for the cost of these incursions in the future’—because it is unfair to taxpayers if we do not do that. The fact that the previous government did that is not an exoneration for this government to not take on the responsibility of taxpayers and say, ‘Let the other animal industry that wants the benefit of the government be prepared to contribute to the Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement, but in this case we’re going to let the horse industry off.’ I do not think that is equitable to taxpayers and I do not think it is equitable to the industries that make the contribution.
As I said, there is an adequate fail-safe for both the opposition and the Greens in relation to the regulatory process which would follow this legislation. So what is the problem? Are there groups out there who think they will be done over, or is it the case that there is a secret agenda that somehow all of the costs should be shifted to the thoroughbred industry because there is a perception that only the thoroughbred industry brings a risk? That proposition is demonstrably false. An examination of the records of importation of horses into this country will show it and an examination of horses that have been through quarantine facilities will show it.
Let’s look at the proposition that all newly registered animals should be the subject of levy raising and let’s look at some numbers. It was suggested in the report of opposition senators that the racing sector would be exempt from the levy. The racing sector is not the breeding sector, but they buy from the breeding sector—in some cases they pay a lot of money to the breeding sector for the animals that they race—and the breeding sector is the sector that registers thoroughbreds. Recently I had a look at the numbers of animals registered with the Australian Stud Book. That is where all thoroughbreds are registered. On their registration figures, somewhere between 17,700 and 18,700 thoroughbreds have been registered for each of the last five years. On the statistics, which are imprecise, in the opposition’s dissenting report a very significant proportion—I suggest well over a third in all likelihood—of the animals which would be registered would be thoroughbreds, and so well over a third of the cost would be borne by the thoroughbred industry.
It is a distraction from reality to talk about whether the racing industry pays or not, because the industry is actually divided into a breeding sector. It is in the breeding sector and through the Australian Stud Book that registration takes place. I am not sure what the basis of the opposition’s concern is, given the very significant number of animals that are registered there. I am not familiar with other sectors such as the standard breed sector as to how many foals are registered, but I believe they have similar registration arrangements. There are also other breeds that have registration arrangements which would equally benefit from these arrangements and, in terms of equity, ought to make a contribution.
There are many owners of animals of a variety of breeds who use animals for pleasure—possibly members of the Equestrian Federation of Australia and various pony clubs. With an equitable sharing of cost, I suggest that they would have an equal right to be considered in any future cases of disease outbreak as to disease mitigation, cost-sharing and the like. If a disease were to break out, for example, in pony clubs rather than in the thoroughbred sector, they would be beneficiaries of these sorts of arrangements, as it might be said that parts of the thoroughbred sector were recently.
But some of the benefits which were given to the thoroughbred sector by the then government, now opposition, and which were supported by the now government, then opposition, were based upon economic impact. I am not sure that anyone is suggesting that those arrangements should not have been put in place. It may be that there are suggestions that others should have received benefits who were not eligible for benefits under those arrangements, but this legislation cannot correct that and nor should it. This is a piece of legislation which is about creating a mechanism for the horse industry to sign up to the Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement and for the matter to be progressed to the point where there is a levy collection mechanism in circumstances where the minister, I believe, has given very proper and adequate undertakings to this chamber and to the industry as to how the development of the regulations would proceed. Indeed, as I outlined earlier, in circumstances where there was significant dissatisfaction with those regulations the regulations would be subject to disallowance. Given the position of the Greens and the opposition, the minister would probably have reason to fear, if he did not get strong agreement, that there might be a move to disallow. In all of those circumstances, why oppose the legislation? What is the barrier? As I said, from the opposition’s point of view, this is a matter of hypocrisy, given the position that they in government took in relation to various pieces of legislation and the regulatory arrangements that followed upon them.
Having read the one-page dissenting report by the Greens, it seems like a toss of the coin decision. You could read it either way. On the one hand, they say that it is too early to condemn the legislation without consideration of the regulations that would follow; but then, on the other hand, they say that maybe it is too early to support the legislation without considering the regulations. I suggest in the circumstances that that is not a justification to defeat this legislation. That is not a reason to send this back to the drawing board. That is not a reason to delay the implementation of a mechanism which, as I said earlier, potentially will deal equitably with taxpayers; it will deal equitably with other industries that are already contributors under the Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement and who have made their commitment to make such contribution; and it will deal equitably with the horse industry and its future viability. Certainly, arrangements such as this ultimately will be in the interests of the horse industry.
Perhaps numbers will make sure that this legislation does not proceed and that this matter is further delayed. I hope that is not the case. As I said, I do have an interest in the horse industry. I do think that it would be better that this legislation passes and the minister is allowed to get on with the job that he is committed to doing, which is to get proper regulations and to get a levy system in place that has significant support in the industry and that is equitable to all.",SENATE,<title>HORSE DISEASE RESPONSE LEVY BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-02-04,"—In summing up the Horse Disease Response Levy Bill 2008 and the Horse Disease Response Levy (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008 on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Burke, from the other place, I want to thank all those who have spoken. I did listen to part of the debate. I want to commend certainly Senator O’Brien and Senator Sterle, whose contributions I did listen to, and the work, as outlined by Senator Sterle, of the Senate committee and his observation that all members of the committee on both sides of the parliament—Liberal, National Party, Labor and Greens—who participated in those hearings did a very thorough job. I know that Senator O’Brien—and he has obviously mentioned this—has a very long-term and deep knowledge and participation in this sector. I suspect that knowledge is unsurpassed in this parliament.
The purpose of the bills is to give the horse industry the certainty that other livestock industries have when responding with government to emergency horse disease outbreaks. The proposed levy arrangements for the horse industry are similar to those applying to the chicken meat, honey, cattle, dairy, laying chickens, sheep meat, lamb, goat and pig industries. We are not dealing with a new principle here. The principle of a levy applying to a wide range of primary industries in this country has been long established. In fact, I know from when we were in government previously, and I was a parliamentary secretary from 1993 to 1996, that it was not infrequently that the Senate dealt with levies of this nature. I point that out because the principle of levies and their application in particular sectors has been of very long standing—at least 20 years to my knowledge—and, I think importantly, supported by both sides of politics.
Regrettably, we have a situation where the now Liberal-National Party opposition have abandoned that approach in principle. I point out in passing that the Labor Party, when in opposition from 1996 to 2007, maintained the consistent principle to support levies and their necessary increase from time to time. I find it somewhat odd that the now Liberal-National Party are opposing a long-held principle that both sides of politics have consistently supported for so long. I do find this somewhat odd. When he was primary industries minister in the Liberal-National Party, Mr Peter McGauran—who is no longer in the parliament—supported that principle. As I understand it—and he has left politics and is now involved in the horse industry—he supports this levy. He supports these arrangements. I find it somewhat strange that the Liberal-National Party, as soon as they moved into opposition, abandoned the long-held principles and approaches of both sides of politics, whether in government or opposition.
I do know and I do acknowledge that the application and development of levies is not an easy job because there are diverse arrangements in particular sectors. It is not an easy job. Briefly, on reflection, I can recall attempts to introduce a levy into the vegetable industry in that period between 1993 and 1996. I have to say, having been involved in a meeting with an incredible range of diverse organisations and trying to find a cost-effective way of applying the levy, it was no easy task. I acknowledge that. It is not an easy job to bring together a sometimes diverse group within a particular industry to apply a levy.
It was in 2006 that the horse industry requested the former Liberal-National Party government to introduce a statutory levy on the registration of horses as the best means of protecting the industry against the impacts of emergency horse disease outbreaks. A large number of alternative levies were evaluated by the industry but considered less equitable than the mechanisms selected. So it is not as though this is a rush job. This goes back to 2006. Unfortunately, at the time of the equine influenza outbreak in August 2007 the industry was still not a signatory to the Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement, which would have assisted with the industry’s emergency disease preparedness. The intention at the time was that the horse industry and the government would share the costs. I do want to say that I think all the levies that I am aware of involve cost sharing. It is reasonable to expect individuals and participants in a particular industry to share part of the cost with government, with the broader taxpayer. But it is unreasonable to expect the taxpayer to pay all the costs. So there is cost sharing. Again, this is a long-held principle—of the last couple of decades—in the approach to levies in this country.
Since their introduction to parliament these bills have been the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport. The committee recommended the passage of these bills. Whilst the Liberal-National opposition and the Australian Greens submitted dissenting reports, the government is confident the regulations under the bills will provide an equitable, effective and efficient levy mechanism to substantially address these concerns. The process of framing these regulations will involve close consultation. They will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, an important safeguard for all stakeholders. Nevertheless, drafting instructions for the regulations have been provided to the Senate committee and they provide clarity on many of the questions raised during debate. I intend to add in response to a request by Senator Xenophon—and his contribution was, as always, very incisive and informed—some additional information at the conclusion of my remarks on the second reading debate, in an attempt to ensure that the committee stage of the discussions is kept within reason.
I point out that the Commonwealth does not have the constitutional authority to make national horse registration compulsory. However, the chief veterinary officers of the states and territories are examining options to collect data on horse ownership. The preferred method—similar to other systems in use for disease control purposes—is to identify properties that own horses and work with existing horse registration bodies. It has been suggested that the commercial horse sector presents a greater risk and should shoulder a heavier levy burden. The reality is that non-commercial horses pose similar risks of bringing exotic diseases into Australia. Of the 515 horses imported to Australia from countries other than New Zealand in 2007, some 47 per cent were not from the thoroughbred or standard bred sectors. Further, a number of diseases—which threaten all horse sectors—are either already present in Australia, such as hendra virus, or could be introduced by the movement of insects or birds. Having to manage these diseases once they became endemic would be a cost to all horse owners and the wider community.
All horses, whether they belong to the commercial or non-commercial sectors of the industry, benefit equally from the containment and eradication of diseases. As the President of the Australian Horse Industry Council representing many non-commercial horse owners, Mr Barry Smith, argues:
Every horse is susceptible and everyone benefits from and eradication program.
These bills provide for a mechanism to impose, collect and appropriate a new levy on the initial registration of horses and provide certainty for resourcing emergency responses to future horse disease outbreaks. I have indicated some two years of development and discussion—if we can do it for the pig industry or the sheep industry or the cattle industry and other examples I have given them, surely, we can do it for horses.
If it is passed the levy will be set at zero. If activated in response to a disease incursion the levy will be payable only once and appropriated through Animal Health Australia. The horse industry does not need to repay its share of the costs of the 2007 emergency response. The legislation is supported by three peak national representative industries: the Australian Horse Industry Council, Harness Racing Australia and the Australian Racing Board. In addition, the bills have the support of Thoroughbred Breeders Australia, Riding for the Disabled, the Equestrian Federation of Australia, and Australian horse riding centres and many other groups. The majority of the horse industry has argued that the legislation should be passed in the interests of the broader horse industry’s national interest. I urge all senators to support the bills to provide certainty and protection to all Australians who own horses.
Specifically in response to some questions Senator Xenophon raised around the definition of what is considered a ‘regular competition’, obviously there is consultation going on about this. Regular competition is a regular scheduled event which is advertised by an organisation. The example that Senator Xenophon raised concerned a couple of people getting together, going off horse riding, maybe having a race between themselves and having a barbie afterwards and a glass of wine. That would not be covered by the levy. It is not a regular scheduled event advertised and conducted by an organisation.
To the issue of regulations that he touched on concerning intention to consult: yes, I think that everyone would accept that Minister Burke has indicated that consultation on the details of the regs will occur. It will be thorough and it will be as widespread as possible. In fact anyone and everyone, I am told, that has a view will be consulted and listened to. The timetable, Senator Xenophon, is likely to be about six months, and I think that is a very reasonable period. As for the extent of the organisations, anyone and everyone that has got a view on this matter will be consulted. Thoroughbred Breeders Australia; Riding for the Disabled; Australian horse centres, representing some 80 horseriding schools and 40,000 riders across Australia; the Equestrian Federation of Australia; the Welsh Pony and Cob Society of Australia; the Western Australian Horse Council; the Southern Horse Council, representing a range of groups in WA; pony clubs; the Queensland Horse Council; and camp drafting. Anyone else on the face of Australia that wants to be involved in the consultation will be consulted and listened to over the coming months.
I have also sought clarification on another issue that Senator Xenophon raised concerning the regulations. The regulations are finalised after this consultation and the Senate and the House have the opportunity to disallow the regulations. Regarding the operative date for regulations, which could obviously be the date they are approved by the Executive Council, I was asked whether the Senate would have the opportunity to debate and disallow those before they come into effect. I can give you that assurance, Senator Xenophon. The minister will ensure that the operative date will provide for a period when the Reps or the Senate is sitting so they can disallow the regulations before they take effect to avoid that circumstance, and I know that difficulty can occur.
So that is where we are. We believe that it is important. It is in the national interest to provide certainty and protection if we have the sorts of disastrous events that occurred—and they could have been far worse of course—in respect of the equine disease outbreak of some 18 months or two years ago. I would urge the Senate to support the legislation. There is still a great deal more work to do obviously, but as I have indicated on behalf of my Minister Burke, and knowing him as I do, the intent to consult the timetable, the thoroughness, the extent of the organisations, the issues, the opportunity for the Senate to disallow prior to the regulations coming into effect––all of those assurances I have given on behalf of the government and on behalf of the minister. It will happen and I know that the minister is very serious indeed to ensure that all of this will happen, and I would urge the Senate to pass this legislation.
In conclusion, the principles and the approach that is being taken are no different from what has occurred over the last couple of decades. These sorts of circumstances and the need for this levy are very significant and very serious. Let us hope we do not face outbreaks of disease that we saw 18 months ago. I would urge the Senate to support the legislation and we will no doubt have an opportunity, if senators want it, to debate the regulations before they come into effect.

"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2009-02-04,"—I rise today to speak on the importance of wetlands to our nation. Hailing as I do from our nation’s thirstiest state, South Australia, drought, heat and the closing peril that is climate change are never far from my mind. Even over the past week or so my home state has endured record temperatures and yet another unrelenting heatwave. Such heatwaves seem commonplace in South Australia these days. Each year they are more extreme and more unforgiving, scorching an already arid land, wiping out crops and gardens, threatening wildlife and even putting human lives at risk.
As I left South Australia during this most recent hot spell to come to Canberra for this parliamentary sitting I was struck by the fact that I was flying over such a parched land on World Wetlands Day. This day is celebrated each year on 2 February to mark the anniversary of the signing of the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance in Ramsar, Iran, in 1971. World Wetlands Day was first celebrated in 1997. Since then, government agencies, non-government organisations and community groups have recognised it by working to raise awareness of the benefits of wetlands and to promote the conservation of wetlands. We know that sustainable river basin management is extremely important to maintain the functions and ecosystem services of wetlands. World Wetlands Day aims to raise awareness about ways in which communities can support river health and how the action of those upstream affects those downstream.
Australia was one of the first nations to sign the Ramsar convention and we designated the world’s first wetland of international importance, the Cobourg Peninsula Aboriginal Land and Wildlife Sanctuary in the Northern Territory, in 1974. Today, Australia has 65 wetlands classified as being of international importance and covering an area of approximately 7.5 million hectares.
We have come to understand that wetlands are vital to the health of our environment. They provide a habitat for plants and animals and they may have cultural significance and provide recreational environments. They help control flooding by absorbing water during heavy rainfall and slowly releasing it back into the ecosystem, and through the plants they host they can help to stop erosion. They also help to purify water by processing nutrients, any suspended materials and pollutants.
Not surprisingly, therefore, the Rudd Labor government is committed to the protection of these precious resources. Among our pledges to this cause is a $400,000 rolling review program under development for Australia’s Ramsar estate. Also, more than $10 million has been committed for 2008-09 towards wetland projects through the Caring for Our Country initiative. Around Australia 16 open grant projects worth more than $3.6 million and 76 community coast projects valued at more than $6.5 million have benefited from this money.
Unfortunately, our predecessors were not so committed to the survival and expansion of our nation’s wetlands. In fact, a report that reviewed the management of Australia’s Ramsar wetlands, the Ramsar Snapshot Study report for the previous government, is a tale of woe, of inaction and of poor administration. The Ramsar Snapshot Study looks at the management and status of 65 Australian Ramsar sites up to the end of 2007. The results make for disheartening reading. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Peter Garrett, has rightly called this document a damning indictment of the former government. He said:
This study shows just how much the Howard Government and Malcolm Turnbull as environment minister took their eye off the ball when it came to the management and protection of our internationally recognized wetlands, including the Coorong.
Page after page highlights the serious ecological and management issues and challenges regarding Australia’s Ramsar convention administration and the failures of the past. It suggests a number of areas where implementation of the Ramsar convention in Australia can be improved. Deficiency after deficiency is noted and many of the reports recommendations are listed as absolute priorities.
Since receiving the report last year, the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts has been working with states and territories through a wetlands task force to address the report’s important recommendations. This show of leadership from the Commonwealth is crucial, as its principal role regarding wetlands is in coordination and management funding, while also liaising with the Ramsar secretariat. Under the Ramsar Management Planning Program, the Australian government is providing more than $4.5 million over four years to develop and update documentation, including management plans, ecological descriptions and information sheets. Of course, water management and use is a key threat to a number of wetland sites. So, as part of the government’s $12.9 billion Water for the Future plan, we are buying water allocations from willing sellers to put back into the environment. Funding has also been allotted to the Living Murray initiative to boost environmental flows and improvements at Murray River locations, including six Ramsar sites.
While the former government denied, delayed and deferred, the Rudd government have embraced this report as a cornerstone on which we can build protection for our precious wetlands and meet our obligations as a party to the Ramsar convention. Many challenges remain as we aim to better manage our wetlands in the face of dangerous and debilitating climate change and drought. But we have already taken important steps down that path through our investment in the restoration of the health of our rivers and waterways. We are committed to working for a more effective, efficient and targeted approach to the conservation of our wetlands. We are not afraid of the hard work needed, because we know this is too important to our environment and to our future.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Wetlands</title>,Adjournment,24,1
