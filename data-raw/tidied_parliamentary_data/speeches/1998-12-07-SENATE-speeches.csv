"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-07,"—by leave—I move:
(13)	 Clause 33, page 40 (line 6), omit ""reviewable"".
(14)	 Clause 33, page 40 (lines 11 to 21), omit subclause (2).
These are the last of the opposition amendments. What we intend to do here is, once again, take this bill back to the previous government's legislation in respect of the grounds of reviewability. The 1996 bill ensured that the scope of decision subject to review by the AAT is not unnecessarily narrowed. Amendments 13 and 14 both take the grounds of reviewability back to what they were under previous legislation. We say that the government has not presented a sufficiently strong case to omit reviewability.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-07,"—We are opposed to the change. It is a philosophical question really. We would prefer that it be limited to reviewable decisions, as are defined within the bill. That is the way we drafted the legislation.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-07,"—The minister says that he wants to limit it to decisions that are reviewable within the bill. What range of decisions therefore do you deem that you would not want to have reviewed which otherwise, under the operation of normal administrative law, would be reviewed?",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-07,—That is a very good question but it is hypothetical.,SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-07,"—I would like to say that is a good answer, but it is not. You obviously have concerns about areas of reviewability. Basically, you are saying in relation to reviewability that you, as a minister, and the government can make decisions by regulation as to what provision is reviewable and what is not. I think that sort of open-ended situation is something this parliament has not tolerated in the past. I would be surprised if we were to tolerate it now. Once again, you are asking for a mechanism whereby you have discretion as to what is reviewable. Obviously, that would be subject to some of the principles of law that have applied so far. You are asking for a pretty broad sweep here.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-07,"—I think the point is that, if the Senate is unhappy with the regulation being put in a reviewable form, it can take action at that time.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-07,—I did come in here with somewhat of an open mind to see whether we could get anything out of the minister in respect of limitations on reviewability. I have not been satisfied by the answers. So I think we will be pressing our amendment.,SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-07,"—I indicate that the Democrats will be supporting the ALP's amendments.
—Before I announce this division, I would warn that the bells have not been ringing in some of the offices. That may cause a problem, whips, later on.
	 Question put:
	 That the amendments (Senator Bolkus's ) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-07,"—by leave—I move Democrat amendments Nos 26 and 27:
(26)	 Page 46 (after line 27), after clause 38, insert:
38A  Performance targets
	 (1)	 If, in a year ending on 30 June, a Department or Commonwealth authority is responsible for the carrying on of an activity to which a NEPM applies, the Secretary of the Department or the Chief Executive Officer of the authority, as the case may be, must devise annual performance targets for the implementation of the NEPM and provide a copy of them to the relevant Minister by the 30 September preceding the 30 June on which the year ends.
	 (2)	 Within 7 sitting days after receiving a copy of performance targets under subsection (1), the relevant Minister must cause a copy of the performance targets to be tabled in each House of the Parliament.
	 (3)	 If, by 30 September in any year, the Secretary of a Department or the Chief Executive Officer of a Commonwealth authority responsible for the carrying on of an activity to which a NEPM applies has not provided a copy of the annual performance targets to the relevant Minister, the relevant Minister must prescribe the performance targets for the Department or authority for that year, by no later than 1 November of that year.
(27)	 Clause 39, page 47 (after line 14), after subclause (1), insert:
	 (1A)	 A report under subsection (1) must include a report on the achievement of performance targets set under section 38A.
These amendments require performance targets to be developed and implemented when a national environment protection measure is put in place. They are straightforward. We would argue that the list ought to be included in this bill to make sure it is workable. It should be a standard measure in most bills of this kind.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-07,"—I do not think it is a matter of the greatest consequence, but my view is that this is unreasonably requiring matters of internal administration to be treated in a public way. The point is that if an NEPM exists and it 
 obliges the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth will meet the requirements under it and secretaries will administer it in the same way as they administer every other obligation that they have upon them in terms of their public responsibilities. I do not see why we would want to give them an additional burden of having to table the way in which they internally carry on business. The obligation is upon government. Government accepts the responsibility. It will be under Commonwealth laws, Commonwealth regulations or application of state laws. If you argue for this here, you could argue it for practically every area of public administration, and I have not heard any case that has been made out that would suggest that that was really necessary.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-07,"—The opposition supports these amendments. I think the minister is being unnecessarily difficult this afternoon with respect to them. What we are basically saying to government is: we want you to take this seriously. We want you set up performance targets—and, let us face it, they do it with respect to a lot of areas of activity—because we want to be sure in advance that departments are going to set targets that are worth while and will meet the objectives of this legislation and the accompanying legislation.
We do not want to get in a situation where the government says to us, `Trust us, we'll do all this,' when we know full well that current administration is so complex and diverse that obligations sometimes get flicked aside and given lower priority. We have had examples of ministers in this place—quite some time ago, I must say—putting files aside for six, seven or eight years. We do not want a situation to develop where obligations on secretaries can be flicked aside for a period of time. We want them to take this seriously. As I said, I think the minister is being unnecessarily difficult with respect to this particular proposal.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-07,"—I would just ask a question of the minister. If I am hearing him correctly, is he suggesting that performance measures would be there in place but that he does not want this process to be made a public one, where 
 there is a public obligation and set times when there must be public reporting? Would he expect the department to put in place performance targets in any case?",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-07,"—What I would expect is that the administration would meet the obligations of the law. How they do that is a matter of administration. No doubt, different administrators will have different ways to ensure that they meet their obligations. That is the point—that it is to me one of internal administration. What is of interest to the parliament is that the requirement to comply with the measure is met, and obviously the Commonwealth would meet its obligation and it will report in its annual report that it has done so.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-07,"—I ask again: is it not the sort of thing that the private sector does now as a matter of course? It seems to me to be a sensible management process that ought to be applied at government level. You say that this does not apply in other areas, but maybe it ought to. What is the government's thinking in that respect? Just saying that it is up to the department seems to me to be again failing to take a lead on these kinds of management measures.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-07,"—It is not that it is failing to provide a lead; it is allowing administrators to administer. The NEPM will set out the standard and the standard will be applied to the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth will be legally obliged to meet it and administrators will have to devise ways within their areas of responsibility to ensure that the Commonwealth does meet it. It is really a question of how prescriptive you want to be. It seems to me that this requirement is over the top, principally because it does not lead to any better outcome. The outcome is what is contained in the NEPM that must be adhered to.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-07,"—Minister, is there any aspect of this amendment which the government would accept? Are there some time frames in there 
 that the government would sooner not see, or is the whole amendment not acceptable to the government?",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-07,"—It is unacceptable to the government because it does not lead to any better outcome. The Senate has the opportunity to question the officials in estimates committees on the way in which they are implementing the measure—what internal practices they have adopted; what documents are required to demonstrate the `paper war'. There are so many ways in which senators can satisfy themselves that administration is occurring correctly. The bottom line of all this is that the NEPM must be complied with by government. Officials will be instructed to meet that obligation and then, basically, we let the officials get on with the job of doing their job.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-07,"—The Democrats stand by this amendment. We think it is an important measuring stick for us to have in the act. It seems to be something the private sector does as a matter of course. We believe the Commonwealth ought to apply those kinds of management measures, and this is a good bill in which to do so.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-12-07,"—Those of us who have been around for a few years will understand what works and what does not and what is necessary and what is not in so far as our duty of audit and control of executive government decisions are concerned. I do not think at this stage that there has been a case made out for these amendments. If at some future stage that case is made out then quite clearly we would have to re-examine not only this matter in this bill but also other authorities.
I am not criticising the initiative of Senator Allison. At some stage this might have to be done with various authorities and departments. But we wonder whether we are setting a precedent here which may relieve from certain officers of the government their responsibility in the first place to oversee what is taking place. As the minister has said, we in the Senate have a number of opportunities to 
 examine those measures, not least of which are the estimates committees and the ability of this chamber to call for reports and papers. So at this stage I am not prepared to support this measure.
Amendments not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-07,"—I move Democrats amendment No. 28:
(28)	 Page 47 (after line 29), at the end of the Bill, add:
42  Review of operation of Act
	 (1)	 The Environment Minister must cause an independent review of:
		 (a)	 the operation of this Act; and
		 (b)	 the extent to which the policy objectives of this Act remain valid; and
		 (c)	 whether the provisions of this Act remain appropriate for the achievement of those policy objectives;
		 to be undertaken as soon as possible after the fifth anniversary of the commencement of this Act.
	 (2)	 A person who undertakes such a review must give the Minister a written report of the review.
	 (3)	 The Minister must cause a copy of the report of the review to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 12 months after the fifth anniversary of the commencement of this Act.
	 (4)	 In this section:
 independent review  means a review undertaken by persons who:
		 (a)	 in the Environment Minister's opinion possess appropriate qualifications to undertake the review; and
		 (b)	 include one or more persons who are not employed by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority and have not, since the commencement of the Act, provided services to the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority under or in connection with a contract.
This amendment calls for a review of the operation of the act by an independent person and for that review to be tabled in the parliament within 12 months of the fifth anniversary of the commencement of the act. Many acts now have review provisions—the Endangered Species Act, to name just one. We think it is important that the parliament examines 
 how this is going, and this would be an appropriate vehicle do so.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-07,"—In the light of the previous contribution by Senator Harradine and the comments by Senator Allison, the opposition will support this amendment. Institutionalising a review within a five-year period is a fair ask by the Democrats. We are talking about legislation which impacts not just on the environment but also on the way that states and territories and the Commonwealth interact to protect the environment. A five-year period after which an independent review will take place would, I am sure, encourage those who have a responsibility to implement this structure to more assiduously do so.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-07,"—I was going to argue that the review provision that is in the primary act, the 1994 act, is adequate in itself and does require a review, not only of the operations of that act but also of each of the participating jurisdictions after a period of five years from the commencement of this act. But the trouble is that the five years is only next year, which is not going to give a particularly helpful review of the operations of an act that we hope will come into effect after this debate. The concept, therefore, of looking at the implementation of the Commonwealth's response to its NEPC obligations—and that is the bill that we are debating—after a period of five years strikes me on balance as not unreasonable. Whereas governments, I know, sometimes are a little nervous about this concept of independent review, in the circumstances that does not strike me as unreasonable either. So I will accept the amendment.
Amendment agreed to.
—Is Democrat amendment No. 21, which was to oppose clause 28, supposed to have been dealt with?
—It wasn't proceeded with, Minister.
—I believe we have dealt with that. But there are other amendments, Madam Temporary Chairman—Democrat 
 amendments 19 and 25, together with one which was circulated this morning.
—Can I just clarify that? When you say it was dealt with, was it dealt with because the Democrats decided not to press their amendment—because they had changed their minds? We got some advice that it wasn't such a bad idea.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-07,"—If we can have a few more minutes we will come back to that. I move Democrats amendment No. 19:
(19)	 Clause 26, page 33 (after line 22), at the end of the clause (but before the note), add:
	 (4)	 A person who provides information to an environmental auditor in connection with an environmental audit, knowing the information to be false or misleading in a material respect, is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by imprisonment for not more than 6 months.
	 (5)	 A person who refuses or fails to provide information or to produce a document to an environmental auditor in connection with an environmental audit without reasonable excuse is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by imprisonment for not more than 6 months.
Self-incrimination
	 (6)	 For the purposes of subsection (5), it is not a reasonable excuse for a person to refuse or fail:
		 (a)	 to give information; or
		 (b)	 to produce a document;
		 in accordance with a requirement made of the person by the environmental auditor, on the ground that the information or production of the document, as the case may be, might tend to incriminate the person or make the person liable to a penalty. However:
		 (c)	 giving the information or producing the document; or
		 (d)	 any information, document or thing obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of the giving of the information or producing the document;
		 is not admissible in evidence against the person in any criminal proceedings, other than proceedings for an offence against, or arising out of, subsection (4) or (5).
Democrat amendment No. 19 goes to the question of the auditor. Penalties apply to the 
 auditor if he or she conceals any information. Our amendment makes it an offence for a person providing the information to the auditor to supply false information or to refuse to provide information or a document to the environment auditor. So it broadens the requirement on persons involved to include not just the auditor but also those supplying the information.
It seems to us that without this amendment the auditor would not be able to compel officers of Commonwealth departments to provide information necessary for audits. Their job really would be made a lot easier by this amendment. The responsibility for providing accurate material would then have the force of law. We do build into this amendment measures for self-recrimination so that self-recrimination could not be used as an excuse for concealing information and that that information could not be used against the informant in court proceedings. We think this strengthens the bill considerably. As I say, it includes all those parties providing information for the audit to be embraced by the penalties applying to the auditor.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-07,"—I am a bit puzzled now. I thought the Labor Party last week, when we last debated this, said that it was opposed to this. As I recall it, we then went on to the next item. I interpreted that to mean that they were not being pressed. Is this a second bite of the cherry?",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-07,"—For the record, the minister is right. Last Thursday, I indicated that we felt the extra provisions proposed by the Democrats were not going to be supported by us. We thought that other provisions in Commonwealth law would be appropriate. I suspect the reason Senator Allison is putting this up is that since that time the government has accepted the provisions relating to the environmental audits and auditors. She may have considered that, in view of the fact the government had accepted those provisions, these powers may be a necessarily important accompaniment to the establishment of an audit process. I think we did leave it on that 
 basis last week, Senator Hill. Since you support the environmental auditor process, we believed that you were considering whether the provisions in respect of false information, self-recrimination and so on should also be supported. So we are waiting for you, actually.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-07,—I obviously support the concept of environmental audit because it is in our bill. I find somewhat puzzling our support for what is in our bill being a reason for wanting to reconsider this matter. I am still not clear whether Senator Bolkus is saying that reflecting over the weekend has caused him to change his mind.,SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-07,"—What I was saying is that we felt last week, as we do now, that these powers are extraneous to the scheme we are supporting. But we had a feeling that, given you and the Democrats have got together in respect of the audits, you may have carried it one step further with the accompanying powers.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-07,"—No. We are certainly in a cooperative mood, but we do not think this provision is necessary.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-07,—I ask the minister to expand on his reasons for not supporting this. It seems to us to be very sensible to include others in this requirement to supply information. Can the minister justify his position?,SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-07,"—As I recall it, this is to apply new penalties. It provides provisions—in particular, penalties—in relation to the process that Senator Allison feels would give greater credibility to it. We do not think that is necessary. We think the audit provision we have provided is sufficient in itself to provide what we are seeking from this part. Whilst we appreciate the fact that Senator Allison wants to help us in our drafting by expanding the provision further and providing penalties, we do not think it is necessary to go that far.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-07,"—What happens if an auditor finds that there is an unwillingness to give up a document or that they do not get the kind of cooperation that is expected of them in government departments? What measures are in place to compel cooperation, if you like? As I understand it, the state governments have this requirement in their legislation. Why is it inappropriate at the federal level?",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-07,—I guess it depends where you are coming from. I naturally assume that there will be cooperation within public administration. I think it is extraordinary to think otherwise. I do not see that in the circumstances and purpose of these audits these extra penalty provisions that the Democrats are seeking to include are necessary.,SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-07,"—But we have penalty conditions for the auditor. Why the auditor and not others in Commonwealth departments? If we have penalties for the auditor, why should we not have penalties more broadly? What is the reason for these being put in place for the auditor? I can see how, but I fail to see why we need to draw a distinction between Commonwealth officers and auditors.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-07,"—This provision is really one for public confidence. It allows an examination to ensure that confidence. It is a big step to go from there to the need to include a provision for criminal penalties in relation to non-compliance. It does not strike me as the type of circumstance that provides a need for provisions of that type. I am surprised that you say it has been included within state legislation, because I would have thought the same argument that I am making now would equally apply within state jurisdictions. But that is really their business. I have not heard anything to suggest to me that this act will be any more effective by the inclusion of these criminal penalties.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-07,"—I gather it is New South Wales and Victoria that have it included. If I can draw your 
 attention to the amendment, a person supplying information to the auditor, knowing the information to be false or misleading in a material respect, is guilty of an offence, and a person who refuses or fails to provide information or to produce a document to the auditor without reasonable excuse is guilty of an offence. We are talking here about fairly serious noncooperation and not simply about someone being slow or uncooperative in the simpler sense of the word, so I think it is worth while.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-07,"—We are talking about investigation within the public sector for the purpose of giving public confidence. It would be very hard to imagine a lack of cooperation, but if there is then obviously the necessary disciplinary action can be taken within the Public Service Act and its regulations. I would have thought that, well before you got to that stage, if there were some element of lack of cooperation the head of the department would speak to the relevant person and the matter would be quickly sorted out. I certainly do not think a case has been made that you need to go that huge step forward and provide a new system of criminal sanctions upon public servants who may be providing the information. There are plenty of ways far short of that and, as I said, you have the disciplinary powers—if you really need them—under the Commonwealth legislation. It is using a very big stick, I would respectfully suggest, when it is not necessary.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-07,"—I will not pursue this much longer, but the clause in the New South Wales act says that a person who provides information to an environmental auditor in connection with an environmental audit, knowing the information to be false or misleading in a material sense, is guilty of an offence.

(25)	 Page 39 (after line 4), after Part 6, insert: 

Part 6A—Offences
32A  Offence of aggravated pollution
		 A person to whom this Act applies who intentionally, recklessly or negligently pollutes the environment or intentionally, recklessly or negligently causes or permits an environmental hazard which results in:
		 (a)	 serious damage to the environment; or
		 (b)	 a serious threat to public health; or
		 (c)	 a substantial risk of serious damage to the environment; or
		 (d)	 a substantial risk of a serious threat to public health;
		 is guilty of an indictable offence
	 Maximum penalty:	 2000 penalty units
	 Note:	 Subsection 4B(3) of the Crimes act 1914  provides that where a body corporate is convicted of an offence, the court may impose a pecuniary penalty not exceeding an amount equal to 5 times the amount of maximum pecuniary penalty that could be imposed on a natural person convicted of the same offence.
This amendment makes it a criminal offence to intentionally, recklessly or negligently cause or permit serious damage or substantial risk to the environment or public health. This would apply to only the most serious instances of pollution, and it is the section which gives the bill real teeth.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-07,"—It certainly introduces a new offence, but that has nothing to do with the purpose of the bill, which is to provide the implementation mechanism for obligations that the Commonwealth accepts under the NEPC process. Extra criminal offences in relation to bad behaviour should be dealt with other than in this legislation, which is not for that purpose. In other words, if you want to introduce new offences at the Commonwealth level for those who intentionally pollute, you are certainly entitled to do so, provided you have a sufficient basis of power for it. But you should do it, I would suggest, either through your own legislation or through an attempt to amend the Crimes Act or some other piece of Commonwealth legislation which deals with offences.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-07,"—I move:
(1)	 Page 12 (after line 32), after clause 10, insert:
10A  NEPM to be made within 6 months of signing international instrument
	 (1)	 Within 6 months after Australia signs any international instrument relating to environmental pollutants, the National Environment Protection Council must make a NEPM about the treatment of the pollutant or pollutants in accordance with the instrument.
	 (2)	 In this section,  international instrument  means:
		 (a)	 any treaty, convention, protocol, agreement or other instrument type that is binding in international law; and
		 (b)	 a part of such a treaty, convention, protocol, agreement or other instrument.
I think we are up to the last amendment, which was circulated this morning, and that requires that there be a national environment protection measurement made within six months of signing international agreements that relate to environmental pollutants, and the National Environment Protection Council would be required to make a NEPM about the treatment of pollution or pollutants in accordance with that instrument. This would mean that Australia has a real time line in complying with international instruments. Presumably if we sign those documents we have a commitment to do something about them, and this simply puts that intention into the National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill. ",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-07,"—The amendment has been put as an amendment to this bill, but I would suggest to Senator Allison that really what she is wanting to do is to amend the primary act—the 1994 act—which sets up the circum 
 stances in which a NEPM can be made. In particular, section 14 of that act sets out the various matters that might be subject to a NEPM which then gets negotiated by the Commonwealth and the states. If she is wanting to introduce another subject area, it seems to me that it is section 14 of the other act that really needs to be amended. All this act is doing is providing a process for implementing NEPMs that are determined under the pre-existing legislation.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-07,"—We recognise that, but that is not the bill that is before us and, since this legislation does deal with pollution and since there is likely to be an international agreement in this area, it seemed to us appropriate. I would be happy to withdraw the bill if we could get some assurances from the minister that he would introduce such a measure into the other legislation. It would be useful to know if the minister would be agreeable to moving down that path.
—I think Senator Allison meant `withdraw the amendment'.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-07,"—Senator Allison wants some assurance from me that the government will act to amend its existing legislation. I think I understand where she is coming from, but I can think of many international instruments relating to environmental pollutants: the London Convention on sea dumping, for example. How would one make a NEPM or a national environment standard pursuant to that convention? In other words, I do not think that this is the way to implement Australia's obligations under the convention. If the convention sets out certain obligations that we accept as a nation, then we look to the domestic ways to put them into effect.
What the NEPM process is designed to do is to provide national environmental standards across a range of different areas. The two subject matters do not necessarily interrelate. I think to seek an amendment in this form, certainly as it has been drafted today, really would not be workable. But what I could do, if it is of any value to Senator Allison, is to 
 take her sentiments back to those who administer the NEPC act and see whether they wish to comment on it. Whether or not they do so, I could ensure that the Democrats' wish in relation to this particular question—that is, whether there ought to be a new category under section 14 of the NEPC Act dealing with the implementation of international conventions—be examined in the review that is to take place at the end of next year.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-07,"—I also support that course of action. That is the legislation that needs amendment—and I know the circumstances in which this amendment was put up in the last 24 hours or so—but I would rather get an undertaking from the minister that this amendment be put to the council for them to consider in that review. I give notice that, were the Democrats to move such an amendment when legislation comes forward consequent to that review, we would look at it quite positively.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1998-12-07,"—The Wool International Amendment Bill 1998 has two main purposes. The first is it seeks to give effect to a decision of the government to impose a freeze upon sales of wool from the wool stockpile. It is pro 
 posed that the freeze which is effectively in place at this point in time, following a cabinet decision in August this year, would continue in place till the middle of next year when the second purpose of the bill would come into operation—that is, the privatisation of Wool International.
The opposition will in the committee stage be moving a series of amendments to the bill which, whilst not rejecting the freeze completely, will permit limited sales from the stockpile for the purpose of covering the ongoing costs of Wool International and servicing of the debt leading up to the finalisation of the privatisation process. Whilst we do not oppose at this stage the main purpose of the legislation, we do say that it is ill-founded, ill-conceived and indicative of the scandalous approach that this government has adopted towards the wool industry over the last 12 months or longer.
To expand upon that statement it is necessary to have regard to the history of the wool stockpile and that is set out in brief in the report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. The committee met on 27 November and tabled its report last week. The introductory chapters of that report set out in brief a history of the wool stockpile. I am sure honourable senators in this place and many members of the public and certainly the industry recall that the wool stockpile came about essentially because of the overexpectation of growers and the industry in the 1980s with respect to wool prices.
The price of wool hit record levels in the 1980s and the industry at the time thought that it could continue forever. Under the Wool Reserve Price Scheme, the government of the day—the public, therefore—was required to underwrite the floor price of wool. I recall at one stage the floor price of wool was at the extraordinary level of 870c. As the price of wool internationally plummeted below the floor price, the stockpile grew. It grew to such an extent that, within a short period of two years, from 1989 to 1991, the stockpile had grown from virtually nil to five million bales. As a result, the then Labor government took steps to, firstly, abandon the floor price 
 scheme and, secondly, endeavour to set the industry on a process whereby it took a more rational approach to the sale of wool and in particular to make arrangements for the disposal of the wool stockpile.
The Wool International Amendment Act passed through this parliament in 1996. The intent of that legislation at that time was to dispose of the wool stockpile by the end of the year 2000. Further, in July of 1997, when the current government came to office, it amended the act further to enable Wool International, the body charged with disposing of the stockpile, to work towards that target by being required to dispose of a minimum of 90,000 bales per quarter up to a maximum of 350,000 bales per quarter.
Everyone in the industry knows that the wool industry, over the course of the last 12 months to two years, has been particularly affected by depressed prices internationally by the withdrawal from the market of major purchasers of Australian wool such as Japan, China and Korea. As a result, notwithstanding the requirements under the act, the wool stockpile has, once again, continued to grow. Consequently, so has the stockpile debt.
The report notes that, over the period 1996-97, it was becoming more and more difficult to dispose of substantial quantities of the wool stockpile at any reasonable price and that, by November 1998, the stockpile debt stood at $200 million. That, of course, was a substantial reduction from the original debt, which was somewhere in the vicinity of $2.8 billion. Nevertheless, this has been a problem for the industry. Current signs are that, despite some small improvement in prices in recent times, the outlook is not all that positive.
In this context, the government was apparently looking at the options, taking advice and endeavouring to determine what approach it should adopt to the stockpile. Evidence presented to the Senate committee on 27 November and evidence, if I can call it that, from newspaper reports over the last five or six months indicated that the overwhelming bulk of the industry did not support a freeze on sales of the stockpile. There were interests within the wool industry calling for the imposition of a freeze. They argued that, by 
 withdrawing stockpile wool from the market, it would have a positive impact on prices, hopefully, over time.
Whilst that was certainly a view that was being pursued by some groups, they were in the minority, and a very small minority at that. Indeed, the evidence given to the Senate committee hearing was that there were really only two key groups within the industry that supported a freeze. They were the Western Australian Farmers Federation and the Australian Wool Growers Association. The latter body, the Australian Wool Growers Association, is an organisation of some recent origin.
I have never been one to always agree with the views expressed by the wool industry organisations or the rural industry organisations of this country, as honourable senators know, particularly in areas such as their approach to industrial relations. But I have to say that, over quite a number of years of having some contact with the rural industries, particularly watching and listening to their spokespersons, when you get organisations such as the New South Wales Farmers Association, the Victorian Farmers Federation, Wool International itself, the Wool Council and the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia giving advice to government that it should not impose a freeze and strongly opposing a freeze on stockpile sales, you wonder why it is that the government turned around and made a decision to introduce a freeze.
There can be only one explanation for that decision. That is, as we recall, Minister Anderson, the previous minister, went into the cabinet armed with the advice and the views of the industry, which were overwhelmingly against a freeze, but he got rolled. He got rolled by enough of his colleagues, no doubt, to lead to the decision that was made because of political expediency.
I particularly express concern about the minister's remarks, as reported in the second reading speech, where he said that the freeze was imposed as a response to requests from the industry. That is what the minister's second reading speech says. In the Senate committee, I asked Dr Richardson, the Chief Executive Officer of Wool International:
In the minister's second reading speech he stated that the decision to impose the freeze was a response to requests from the industry. Do you agree with that statement?
And he replied:
. . . If there were requests from the wool growing industry, they were not requests that I was strongly aware of.
I continued:
It seems that there was a lot of criticism of the decision from various sections of the industry. No doubt we will hear from some of those groups today. Wool International certainly did not request the freeze, did it?
Dr Richardson replied:
No. The board of Wool International believed that the appropriate move was to what was called the chill option.
Dr Richardson's views were backed up by representatives of the other organisations that appeared before us. The details of their views are set out in the dissenting report by me, Senator O'Brien and Senator McKiernan on behalf of the opposition.
It is a matter of concern that the minister in his second reading speech and the government said that the basis upon which they introduced the freeze was that of a request from the industry. Overwhelmingly, the evidence from the industry was not only that they did not request it but also that they opposed it. They made their views very firmly known to the government, because it was clearly in the public arena that a freeze may well be imposed.
The opposition will, through its amendment, be seeking to give support to the chill option. Whilst the freeze effectively remains in place, we will be seeking to amend the act to enable Wool International to sell around 15,000 bales per quarter of wool from the stockpile to enable them to cover costs and to service the stockpile debt. That has been requested by Wool International and supported by other organisations. We do not believe it will cause any great difficulty with respect to the ongoing process of privatisation.
Obviously there is a need for certainty and stability. The industry itself said to the committee, `Now that the freeze is effectively in place, we should live with it even though we 
 do not agree with it, if for no other reason than that we do not continue as a country and as an industry to send mixed messages to the international community.' So we are responding to the views of the industry in that regard, particularly the views of Wool International and others who support the limited option of what is called the chill option.
The final issue is that of the privatisation. We support that objective. We are very concerned, however, that if the situation that occurred with the Australian Wheat Board is any indication—and we hope it is not—it may not proceed as smoothly as people would wish. It is a very tight time frame to achieve this privatisation by the middle of next year. Further, there are some issues that are still on the table which have to be resolved—not the least of which is, firstly, the question of achieving the sell-off of the stockpile; secondly, ensuring that growers equity is maintained; and, thirdly, dealing with the issue of the costs of the privatisation.
There were various estimates put before the committee as to what the costs would be. Certainly we have indicated in our report that the costs should be able to be kept to a minimum and that it is appropriate that the costs of the privatisation in the main be borne by the proceeds from the sale or the privatisation of Wool International. In due course, we will be proposing amendments to the legislation. We otherwise support the provisions of the bill.",SENATE,<title>WOOL INTERNATIONAL AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-12-07,"—I have listened with great interest to Senator Forshaw's contribution to this debate. Unfortunately, on this one the Labor Party is playing catch-up. It has been behind the game most of the time in terms of its understanding of wool. I know that they are harsh words coming from me, but unfortunately on this occasion they are true. One of the problems was that right from the very beginning in 1993, as I said in my speech at the time, I believed the Labor Party got it wrong in terms of the legislation which was proposed in 1993.
—I wasn't here.
—I know you are not to blame, because I probably would have been 
 able to convince you then in terms of the Garnaut report. There is no doubt that the legislation which arose out of the Garnaut report and the option chosen by the Labor Party as one of the options proposed by that report was the wrong one. However, having tried on a couple of occasions since then to correct the problems that I and others saw at that time, I believe we now have an opportunity to start again. I think it is very important that we do that in terms of not only the freeze but also the privatisation or demutualisation of Wool International.
I do agree with Senator Forshaw that we could debate the freeze forever. I realise that he has quoted from a number of sources who disagreed with the freeze. Some of those have, very much, a vested interest in making sure that the freeze does not occur. Yet in the end, unless we were to have a ballot of every woolgrower, we really would find it difficult to be able to prove one way or the other just who in the industry supports the freeze and who does not.
Certainly at the grassroots level—and I have gained this understanding through my contact with hundreds of woolgrowers who represent, I believe, some thousands of woolgrowers around this country—there was a lot of support for the freeze, and I do not agree with the proposition that the government simply made a political decision. I think the government was in a very difficult situation because it was getting conflicting information from different sections of the industry. But I do believe that the government, certainly on the economics and not just the politics of the situation, came to a very courageous decision and one which I believe will be vindicated as we move on.
One other matter we all agree on is that this primary industry, which is absolutely fundamental to Australia, is in trouble and certainly needs to be given a new start. The freeze will not solve all the problems, but no-one is suggesting it will; nor will privatisation solve all the problems—and, again, no-one is suggesting it will. All we are saying is that, somehow, we have to break part of the bind in which the industry finds itself, and this is just one factor that parliament can get at 
 because it is dealing with legislation for which we are responsible.
But we know that, beyond that, this industry will need a lot of work. What is happening is that people, themselves, in the industry are saying, `We want to do that work.' That is what all last week's debate over AWRAP was about; that is what the debate has been about in terms of Wool International. The people, themselves, in the industry want to take control of their own industry and to come up with their own solutions. And we must help them do that. We in this parliament have an obligation to help this great industry get back on its feet and re-establish itself as a truly great primary industry in this country.
Just to indicate how long this debate has been going on, I thought I would read from some of the previous debates in which I have been engaged, going back to 1993. Perhaps, first of all, I will read from evidence given in 1993 by Mrs Margaret Watt—and I think the parliamentary secretary may know the Watt family. Her words at that time were very prophetic. This evidence was given before an inquiry which was held in 1993, just before the legislation was passed. Mrs Watt said:
The Garnaut report suggests a price improvement in the long term. Our real concerns are that as rural communities we are fighting to survive in the short term. There is a very real despair, a despair born of weariness and disillusionment, which is eating away at communities. Even reading the Garnaut report, far less trying to understand it, is beyond many. I am sure that I do not speak just for our woolgrowing community in that regard.
The constant pressure that is building up for farming people to meet their interest payments and their budgets is really eating in. Costs, therefore, are being cut back. The result of that is that ordinary working farming families are taking on heavier workloads. There is further physical exhaustion and mental exhaustion resulting. Government cutbacks are further eroding what were once very viable communities.
That was in 1993. The tragedy is that that situation has not improved; we are still seeing those kinds of pressures on farming communities and families like the Watt family.
In 1993 the Democrats did move a couple of amendments which were not supported by the then government or the then opposition. Those amendments proposed that there be two 
 mechanisms which would have enabled the market to be much more flexible. Our concern was in having a fixed release schedule which would determine the amount of wool to be sold each quarter with a little bit of flexibility—but not enough. What we really did was to say to the market, `You don't really need to buy from the fresh wool stocks coming onto the market; each quarter there will be a quantity of wool which will be sold at a discounted price, and you will be able to buy that.'
In 1993 we said that this would cause a problem; and over the last five years, as we have watched the market, we have seen that, although not the only factor—and we certainly have had evidence of that in many Senate hearings not only that which was held last week—it certainly was a factor in the problem that we have experienced in the wool industry over these five years. In 1993 I said that we supported the general thrust of the legislation. But the question we asked then was:
. . . whether it is good commercial practice to determine months and even years ahead how much of the stockpile we are prepared to sell. Professor Garnaut and others believe that it is necessary to regulate the market in order to give it certainty. Others raise the problem of applying mathematical formulas to markets which do not respond to fixed mathematical regulation in this way.
And this has been the problem, as far as I am concerned: that the fixed release schedule was far too rigid and did not enable Wool International to have sufficient flexibility to operate in a sufficiently commercial way to allow it to respond to the fluctuations in the market price.
In his evidence to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee Mr Richardson admitted that the legislation did not allow for sufficient commercial flexibility. The Democrats wanted to move amendments in 1993 to have an upper and a lower market indicator which would have enabled Wool International to sell more wool from the stockpile if the market price was high but cease selling if the price in the fresh wool market fell below a certain price. We believe that would have given much more commercial flexibility to Wool International. I could read from a lot of other speeches over 
 the years since 1993, where on a number of occasions I raised the same problems.
—Spare us.
—Certainly, Senator McGauran, because you were probably in the chamber on most occasions because of your interest in the wool industry, which is well known. But in a speech on 20 June 1996 I put on record a number of examples where within just a few days there was a change in the fresh wool market following sales from the stockpile at a discounted price. Because of the time constraint, I will not repeat those but will just say that they are there on the record.
—You haven't got a tip for Saturday have you?
—That is a bit out of my field. But let me say this: some of the things that wool growers said in the hearings we held in 1993 were very prophetic. They warned that the very rigid fixed release schedule would operate as a factor in forcing the price of wool down while the stockpile remained high and while the 187,000 bales on average per quarter were being pushed onto the market. They warned about that in 1993, and of course we have discovered that what they said was true. So, in terms of tips, Senator Forshaw, it may be that you will have to ask some of the wool growers rather than me, because they could see what was going to happen.
I will not continue to read from those previous speeches but will now go to a couple of the submissions which support the idea of a freeze and the idea of moving to demutualisation. In his submission, Stuart Coppock of the Australian Wool Growers Association wrote:
1	 It is submitted that the fixed disposal schedule outlined in section 20 of the Wool International Act 1993 and the amended version of 1996 were flawed in concept.
That is what I have been saying. He continued:
The intention of the Parliament was clearly on all occasions to ensure a level of commerciality in the sell down of the wool stockpile to achieve the twin objectives of the reduction of debt and the enhancement of the value of the wool stockpile.  

The fixed disposal schedule was considered in the WIRC Report and rejected.
The outline of the legislative reforms of the Wool International Act with a four year period indicate the volatility of the issues in attempting to obtain a commercially satisfactory outcome. It is suggested that part of this difficulty is due to the operation of the fixed schedule. This view is grounded in the statistics provided in section 6 of the submission.
I would urge all senators who want to be better informed to read the submission by the Australian Wool Growers Association which includes a whole series of statistics as evidence to support the point of view that they put. I want to read from the evidence that Mr Peter Laird gave to the committee, just to support again the contention I am making that this problem has been with us ever since the Labor government's legislation of 1993. He said:
The stockpile legislation was a double-edged sword that was very damaging in many respects. The legislation forced wool onto the market because it had to be sold to a fixed selling schedule. Dr Richardson said he would have preferred to approach it in a commercial manner. That is logical. It is just crazy, it is suicide, to run a business by forcing wool onto a market that is saturated. That is why we are seeing the market responding to the change of legislation. It is about the selling method, not necessarily the amount of wool. As I said, it is a double-edged sword—there is a wool factor quantity in there also.
But confidence is coming back. The market did make a correction last week, but my information tells me that there have been about 75,000 bales of wool gone from the secondary stockpile in the last fortnight while this improvement has been in the market. So not only the fresh wool has been sold but we have had the secondary stockpile moving, which is great.
The Democrats also believe that it is a great improvement. Let me finish by picking up the submission by the Pastoral Group of the Victorian Farmers Federation and disagreeing strongly with a comment in that submission. They said:
The decision to freeze the WI stockpile sales has unfortunately been driven more by individual political agendas, both within industry and at a Federal Government level, rather than commercial logic.
Those supporters of the freeze have paid no regard to—  

.	 economic analysis of this option vs other available options. . . 
Let me say that, as far as the Democrats are concerned, we consulted extremely widely and that included a very good economic analysis of the options which were available. And, for that reason, we will support the legislation apart from one small amendment which I will move as we move into further stages of this debate.

I ask whether the minister is aware of the latest outburst from the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, Mr Tuckey, as it was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald  of 4 December:

I also remind him that if I was to ask him a question in the first week of resumption of sittings I would have had to have been in Buenos Aires with him. It is good to see you back, Minister. I note you have not rejected the views of Mr Tuckey in respect of world heritage. Therefore, in his words are your listings of Heard and MacDonald islands and Macquarie Island in 1996 just a cop-out? In light of the stark differences of approach to world heritage matters between you and your ministerial colleague, Mr Tuckey, can you definitively tell the Senate just who in this government is responsible for world heritage matters?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>World Heritage Areas: Listing</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-07,"—First, I should congratulate Senator Bolkus on breaking his duck. It has taken four sitting weeks but at last he has got to his feet. He of course was willing to sneak behind the government's back and lobby other international bodies in Kyoto when he thought he might win a political point. But finally he is prepared to get up and ask a question in this place. I congratulate Senator Bolkus on being appointed shadow minister for the environment. I read in the press that his 
 predecessor wanted to maintain the job, but on his record I understand why he was replaced.
I did see a newspaper report of some comments by my colleague Mr Tuckey, the Minister for Forestry and Conservation. I know Mr Tuckey is disappointed by the unilateral breach of the regional forest agreements by Premier Carr, the Labor Premier in New South Wales, who broke the agreement that had been reached by Labor governments before we came to office to establish regional forest agreements that preserved conservation and provided for harvesting on a sustainable basis. It might have been to that background that Mr Carr was choosing to undermine the bipartisan position that had developed in this country to protect forests that caused him to raise the issue of world heritage, which are values that are examined within the regional forest agreement process.
This government has been pleased to facilitate new world heritage listings in relation to Heard and Macquarie islands in particular. I am pleased that we have presently before the world heritage authorities an application for listing of the Blue Mountains. We think it is an excellent application and have been pleased to facilitate it in partnership with the New South Wales government in that instance. Senator Bolkus may be aware that we are exploring other possible listings, including one in relation to Purnululu.
World heritage is of important value to this government. We are pleased to be part of an international community that recognises the importance of world heritage. What is of great regret to us is that in recent times the integrity of the world heritage system has been brought into question by authorities within the system that have proven to be less than fair and objective. Whilst we say that the issue of integrity needs to be revisited, nevertheless a world heritage administration that fairly and objectively implements a convention to which Australia is a party obviously would then have our support.
I hope that adequately argues Senator Bolkus's question. Yes, this government does support world heritage, and we are pleased to be a party to the convention. But within the

 know that the government has got itself into such a horrendous position on this tax simply because it was caught out when it promised no new taxes. What was its solution? It stood up and said, `It is not a tax; it is a surcharge.'
The government promised the Australian electorate before the 1996 election there would be no new taxes. Yet in its first budget, nearly 2½ years ago, it broke that promise with a new $500 million tax. It found that the only way it could try to pretend to the broader community that it had not broken that promise was to call it a surcharge. Senator Sherry humiliated Senator Kemp over many months on this issue, the pretence that this was not a tax. Today we are seeing, yet again, more evidence that the surcharge, or tax as it is officially known on the books of this parliament, is in actual fact unconstitutional. You have got yourself into such a mess on it that you have allowed it to become fundamentally flawed. You come before this chamber and ask, `What is the Labor Party's position?'
—I'm going to listen to this.
—The Labor Party's position is absolutely clear, Senator Kemp. It is absolutely clear.
—Address the chair please, Senator Conroy.
—The Labor Party's position is that it supports this measure on an equity basis.
—Oh, you support it.
—But this government has made such a mess of this measure—such a total and utter debacle—that we were in a position where we opposed the mechanism used to collect. It is that simple, Senator Kemp. You have made such a mess of the collection mechanism simply to avoid having to admit that it is a tax.
—Would you address the chair, Senator Conroy.
—What you have done is you have forced every single—
—Senator Conroy, please address the chair.
—Every single superannuant in this country has to pay for the collection of this tax. It is paying through the nose not just in lower returns but also in higher admin fees. This government stands condemned by the industry, by ordinary Australians and by their superannuation funds because you have made such a mess of it.
It has been calculated that, to raise $100 of surcharge tax revenue, it is costing each super fund $54. That is a fact. The super funds have been forced to put such a ridiculous amount of administration into this bill that it is costing $54 to collect $100. This is the most inefficient collection method. It is almost as if the government sat down and said, `How can we so completely stuff this up that it is going to cost almost half of what we are going to raise for this tax?' And it designed this mechanism, Senator Kemp, through you, Madam Deputy President. The reason the Labor Party voted against this mechanism is that it is such an inefficient and inequitable measure. We have seen it questioned during the committee hearings as unconstitutional. There was more evidence over the weekend that it is unconstitutional. The government got caught pulling a fast one, pulling the wool over the eyes of ordinary Australians.
We have seen in this measure lower returns. Each and every Australian with a super fund is getting a lower return when they retire because of this government. We have seen funds having to take money and put it into the cash side of their investment account. Cash is very reliable, but it has a very low return. That is what is happening. We have seen massive increases in costs. We have seen delayed assessments. Many of the people whom this measure was designed to hit still have not received an assessment from this government. Perhaps Senator Kemp can tell us why. That was the very question that was asked.
—Two and a half years later.
—Two and a half years later, and we still have not seen assessments for the very people this tax is designed to collect money from. They have been unable to collect the tax file numbers for hundreds 
 and thousands of ordinary Australians. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Judiciary: Superannuation Surcharge</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-12-07,"—I was somewhat provoked to stay behind in taking note of answers to listen to Senator Conroy. I have made the mistake before in tuning into Senator Conroy: I learnt nothing. I regret to say that my initial impression has been confirmed again by Senator Conroy's effort, except for a very important statement that Senator Conroy made. I must say that I raised the question at question time whether the Labor Party supported the surcharge or not. We know that Senator Sherry was the most vigorous opponent of the surcharge. No self-interest there, Senator Sherry.
—None at all.
—Some will ask whether this is to Senator Sherry's credit or whether, to take another view of Senator Sherry, this decision is one of extreme self-interest. The Labor Party supported the surcharge in the lower house. But when it came up here, under the guidance of Senator Sherry, the Labor Party attempted in every possible way to defeat the surcharge. Not one senator declared self-interest in this. Not one senator indicated that, if the surcharge was defeated, this would mean massive savings to virtually all senators in this chamber. Not one of them declared an interest. I was interested to hear Senator Conroy's comments as to whether the Labor Party had backflipped again. You will notice that I went through a sequence of the backflip.
—Did you declare interest on the savings rebate?
—Senator Sherry, you have had your time.
—Senator Kemp, would you please address the chair.
—You have had your chance. You are on the record, Senator Sherry. Senator Conroy said that the Labor Party supports this measure as an equity measure. That is a very important statement. Apparently we are seeing the Labor Party's continuing support for the surcharge.
—But not a measure that's going to make the poor people pay.
—Well, you are not poor, Senator Conroy, and presumably you are liable for the surcharge. Then he said, `However, we are unhappy with the way the collection mechanism works.' We waited during the debate in the Senate, because this was the argument that Senator Sherry ran. He was unhappy with the collection mechanism.
—So is everyone else.
—We put up an alternative.
—You didn't. You actually withdrew all your proposed amendments.
—Order! Senator Conroy and Senator Sherry will come to order and cease interjecting. Senator Kemp, you will address the chair and ignore the interjections.
—Thank you, Madam Deputy President. I hope that you will show some kind of control over your colleagues. The fact of the matter is that while I was debating the measure I was subjected to constant harassment from that side.
Senator Carr interjecting—
—Order! Senator Carr!
—Madam Deputy President, are you planning to take any control over your colleagues or not?
—Senator Kemp, I do not require that sort of comment and assistance.
—I shall be tuning in, Madam Deputy President, very carefully to the remainder of this debate.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-07,"—Senator Kemp, in an attempt to distract himself and the government from the inadequacies of the particular problems of the so-called superannuation surcharge, challenged senators to declare an interest. We certainly did not see Senator Kemp, for example, declare an interest when—
—The savings rebate.
—the so-called savings rebate was introduced—$450 to every senator 
 automatically. We did not see Senator Kemp following that line. And I will be interested to see Senator Kemp declare an interest when this government's so-called tax reform GST legislation comes into this Senate which reduces income tax for everyone in this place by far more than the fair share that we should receive. But that is not the issue.
The issue relates to the so-called superannuation surcharge—in effect, a tax. This was the government's major tax reform announced in 1996: an additional tax of $½ billion. But Treasurer Costello did not call it a tax. He said to himself, I am sure, `Well, we went to the election in 1996 saying ""No increases in existing taxes, no new taxes"". So we've got to call the new $½ billion tax on superannuation something new; we'll call it a surcharge.' That was the fundamental beginning of this government's problem in collecting this $½ billion new tax.
This new tax on superannuation does not just apply to higher income earners who earn more than $72,000; it also applies to many people who in certain circumstances earn less than $72,000. If they fail to provide a tax file number, persons who earn less than $72,000 are required to pay the full 15 per cent of the tax—the full 15 per cent. So it is not equitable in that sense.
But there are a number of other fundamental flaws with this new tax. This new tax was budgeted to collect almost $½ billion in 1997-98. What did the government end up collecting? It collected $347 million. That means there was a $133 million shortfall. We have asked Senator Kemp why they had a shortfall of $133 million. No answer; waffle, but no answer. What happened to that $133 million that was budgeted to be collected in the first year? It is not an insignificant amount of money. It is about a third of the estimated amount of revenue that this new tax was going to raise—and it has not materialised.
What did it cost to collect this new tax, the $347 million in revenue? In the first year, industry estimates—not Labor Party estimates but those of the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia—are that, to collect $347 million, it cost $160 million; $160 million to collect $347 million. So, for every 
 dollar raised in revenue in the first year, it cost almost 50c; almost 50c to raise a dollar in revenue from the new super tax. I might say that cost does not include the $20 million to $30 million it has cost the tax office. So we have $347 million in revenue, $133 million dollars short, and it cost $160 million. It is Australia's most expensive tax.
—In the world.
—In the world, my Senate colleague interjects. It is one of the most expensive taxes in the world to collect; certainly in Australian history we have never seen anything like this. And this was this government's, Mr Costello's, major tax reform of its first term in office. This was announced in the budget of 1996. Two and a half years later, the assessment notices are still going out—2½ years later. So on any efficiency arguments, equity arguments, this tax is a monumental failure—and highlighted today, of course, by the approach of the judges. It is not just Labor—it is judges, fund managers, trustees, lawyers, accountants, economists. You are hard pressed to find anyone who supports the collection mechanism of this new tax. It is grossly inefficient. If this is a prelude to the GST, God help the Australian population when you have a tax that costs almost 50 cents in the dollar to raise.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,1998-12-07,"—I also rise to join this debate and pick up a couple of points made by Senator Sherry. Senator Sherry is somewhat specialised in this area of tax surcharge, unlike his colleague frontbencher Senator Conroy. Senator Sherry is the expert. Whenever Senator Conroy concludes a speech during a debate that he has started on such financial matters, he walks out of the chamber, leaving the debate to Senator Sherry. I do not know why Senator Conroy does not leave it entirely to Senator Sherry.
Senator Sherry, I want to pick up a couple of points that you made about the administration costs of collecting this surcharge. I think you said that $347 million was raised in the first year and some $160 million was needed to raise that. That was the administration cost. As you know and must concede, the first year 
 is always more. It gets less as the years go on. There is an establishment cost to raise these sorts of surcharges and taxes—there is no doubt about that, Senator Sherry. Of course it is a somewhat more complex system compared to other taxes, so you must concede that means testing is not always the best way to go when it comes to raising special surcharges and taxes. So you would then perhaps agree that the 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance should not be means tested.
The second point you made was that there is a shortfall in the government's estimate in raising a certain amount of the surcharge—we may have estimated for some $500 million and we got $347 million. Do not worry about our shortfall. We balanced our budget. Overall, this was part of the grand plan of our first budget. As tough as it was, there was a method behind the government's policies, such as this surcharge. Some of them were tough to do, but we carried them out and we are now reaping the benefits, Senator Sherry. So do not start telling us we have not raised enough revenue. What we have done is to balance our budget. We have brought our budget into surplus, and every sector of the economy—every department—has contributed to that. We do not need gratuitous economic advice, least of all from you.
There is an inherent contradiction in the debate today. For example, the opposition is saying that the people who are going to have to pay the surcharge after the $70,000 point where the means test starts to cut in are poor people. Yet, with the 30 per cent health rebate system, they say the $70,000 income earners are rich people. So, Senator Sherry, there is an inherent contradiction in your argument.
The second contradiction is that the House of Representatives Labor supported it but the Senate Labor did not support it. What went wrong in between the two houses? Who did the heavy lobbying on this? In actual fact, it was an ideological debate. By the time it got to the Senate, it was an ideological debate for the Labor Party and the ideology is pretty easy to understand: they have to pay the surcharge on their parliamentary pensions. That is the ideology behind this.
Senator Conroy said that if government had to sit down and work out how to stuff up a tax system, this is the way to do it. Well, if the government had to stuff up the tax system, they would keep the existing tax system. That is the best way to stuff up the tax system we have, and that is exactly what you want to do: keep the existing tax system. You want to keep the existing wholesale sales tax with all its inequities and absurdities where, for example, frozen yoghurt does not get wholesale sales tax but soft yoghurt, which looks like ice-cream, does get wholesale sales tax. That is how you stuff up the tax system: keep the existing tax system. If you want to untangle the mess we have before us, support the government's tax reform system. If you want to untangle the budgetary mess we have, then support the surcharge tax on superannuation.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1998-12-07,"—I asked a very simple question of the minister today, and he was not able to respond. We know, of course, that the minister is responsible for waffle answers, but for the first time today, consistent with his indisposition of last week, we got a jelly belly answer.
—Jelly belly?
—Order! Please, let's not deteriorate the language any further.
—I thought that was a fairly apt description of the answer I got, because it did not address the question that was asked of the minister. The question was about the problem with the judges—where the judges have now said that the super tax is illegal. That was the question to the minister. The minister did not answer it. The fact is that the judges are saying, quite loudly and clearly—reported—that the super tax is illegal. The government cannot face up to it.
It is not a matter of my self-interest or anyone else's self-interest, Senator McGauran. It is purely and simply a fact that the government are yet to address the whole issue of the constitutionality of the change that they brought in. They were repeatedly told that it was unconstitutional, that it was unworkable and that it was an unfair tax for some people—but they ignored that completely. The 
 minister ignored that at his own peril. There was a meeting of judges, who said that the tax is illegal. In today's Age it was reported:
If the litigation goes ahead, the Government will be in the extraordinary position of being possibly the first in Australian history to have its laws challenged by its judiciary.
That is what the government have set up: a challenge by its own judiciary. The statement, through Professor Stephen Parker, further said:
Unless the legislation is repealed, we think that the matter must be decided by the High Court immediately and not become drawn out.
As my colleagues said, from the outset this particular surcharge—this particular tax—has been a complete debacle. It has been ill-conceived and it has done nothing to assist the superannuation industry and those people who rightfully receive superannuation as part of their retirement package. Forget about the issue of what happens in this place, because there is no doubt on our side that the people in this place are liable to pay the taxes that are owed by them. That is not the issue. At issue here is the constitutionality of the law as seen by judges.
The second issue that I raised in my question was the fact that the collection of this tax by the government has turned into a complete debacle. As one of my colleagues alluded to earlier, it has the highest compliance cost in the world for the collection of a tax and it has placed a great impost on funds and fund members. It will ultimately reduce the benefit that is returned to fund members. I have even heard cited that one fund paid some $40,000 to have the reporting charges—
—Must be a union fund, John.
—No, it was not. But, in spite of that, no members of the fund were actually subject to the surcharge. A fund paid some $40,000 to have the surchargeable amount reported when, in effect, there was nothing to be paid at all. Who bore the cost of that? The fund and the fund members. What we have here is not an issue of equity; we have an issue of inequity for those people who, not subject to the charge at all, had to 
 pay it and get a reduced benefit for themselves.
This issue shows nothing more than the fact that the government lobbed on to something that was no good. They stuck with it. It is not a matter of if you are on a good thing stick to it. They should have got rid of it. The minister has done nothing to convince the public or anyone in this place that it is a fair charge. The superannuation funds have repeatedly opposed this charge from its instigation and, as I understand it, will continue to do so. The judges do nothing more than support that contention.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,1998-12-07,"—What a spectacle we have here today—the Labor Party talking about economic management! Fancy economic management being the subject of taking note of answers that were given by the government in question time today. We are talking about the most incompetent economic managers that this country has seen for a long time. I am quite sure that Senator Hogg, who was the most recent speaker, is one of those who has suffered and will suffer for a long time because of the legacy of the Labor Party's economic management of this country. He can raise small issues as often as he likes—he can raise issues of constitutionality of law and all the other issues he might wish to—but nothing will ever deflect from the incompetent management of the Labor Party over 13 years they were in government.
I am sorry that Senator Sherry has gone because he said in his little contribution that this not only applies to people on incomes over $72,000 a year but also applies to people who are earning less. He failed to say that this does not need to apply to anybody who earns under $72,000. If people cannot keep their affairs in order and will not give a tax file number, it is no different from the legislation you people introduced when it came to savings accounts in banks. If you do not give your tax file number to a bank, then the tax on any interest earned on your savings account will be paid at a rate of 48c in the dollar.
What is the difference between the attitude we have taken to superannuation and the 
 attitude your government took to the savings of Australians, whether they have savings accounts in banks or in other areas which pay interest? They have to give their tax file number in order that the tax will not be taken out at the top rate. It is exactly the same with the superannuation surcharge. Senator Sherry ought to be very careful that he does not mislead the chamber because there is no need for anybody earning under $72,000 a year to pay the top rate, in exactly the same manner that there is no need for anybody who deposits money in a bank account and earns interest to pay the top rate.
He calls it an iniquitous tax. Let me tell you that there is nothing more iniquitous than a high income earner being able to claim 48 cents in the dollar from their contribution to superannuation and someone who pays 20 cents in the dollar being able to claim only 20 cents in the dollar. That is iniquitous and that is why the superannuation surcharge was introduced. It was introduced so that high income earners do not get a distinct advantage over low income earners. Did we hear that from Senator Conroy or Senator Sherry? Not on your life. The last thing they wanted to do was highlight the fact that, as high income earners, they could, if they wanted to, get a far greater rebate on contributions than someone who is on 20 cents in the dollar.
Between 1983 and 1993, in the period of the Labor government, there were 83 major changes to superannuation legislation. So don't let them over there talk about confusing the public about the continual changes to superannuation, which makes it more unattractive to those people in the community who might wish to take it out. Let them look at their own record. Their own record was one of confusing the public year after year and changing the rules as they went along.
Who will ever forget the then Labor government's attitude to their own workers who used to be able to contribute $3,000 a year to their own private funds in order to enhance the savings of Australia, in order to enhance their own retirement income. What did the then Labor government do? It took away the right of workers to claim a tax deduction for up to $3,000 of their own 
 contributions. Don't you talk about looking after the workers, because in this one stroke you caused more trouble and more harm to workers in Australia, especially those older workers who had not been in superannuation schemes for that long, who were trying to build up, over a very short period, their retirement benefit.
You, the Labor Party, took away the right of workers earning low incomes or middle incomes to contribute to their own retirement and claim a tax deduction for it. You ought to think carefully about your own record over those 13 years of government. The issues you have raised today are minimal compared with the blunders you made during that time in making changes to superannuation on a regular basis. (Time expired)

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-12-07,"—What we learnt was that the Labor Party then attempted to propose an alternative collection mechanism. Then they went and did some research and found that it did not work; they found that it was highly complex and led to major problems, not the least for small business. So Senator Sherry dropped it. Senator Sherry, if my memory 
 serves me correctly, never moved those amendments.
I shall be listening very carefully to hear what is the alternative collection mechanism that the Labor Party proposes for the superannuation surcharge because, as I have noted, it does have a huge self-interest in this area.

—No, you may not.
—So here we have the Labor Party with no alternative collection mechanism—that is the truth—none whatsoever.
Senator Conroy interjecting—
—You had a couple of years to work out an alternative collection mechanism, and you could never do it. Either the Labor Party is as incompetent in this area as it is in every other area, or it was just utterly bone lazy. Take your pick: it is one of those two.

"McKiernan, Sen James",ALP,1998-12-07,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Korea and Malaysia which took place in July of this year, and I want to make a few short 
 comments in regard to the report. On reading the report again this morning, I recalled the difficulties we had with the two new airports in the region. I suffered more than the rest of my colleagues on that delegation, my luggage going missing for some four days on the way through Kuala Lumpur into Seoul.
—Is that where you got that shirt?
—As a matter of fact, Senator Campbell, that is exactly right. The tie was bought in a different place, and I also got the blazer in Seoul. I was unfortunately travelling in casual gear and on the first few days of the delegation I did stand out somewhat until I was able to get some different clothes. We made mention in the report of the fact that in the one day we actually went through both of the new airports that had been opened in the region. We suffered greatly because of that with huge delays. Nonetheless, the airports now seem to be working and they are a credit to those people who conceived them and built them.
I want to pay special attention at the very beginning to the leadership of the delegation leader, Harry Jenkins, the member for Scullin in the other place. Mr Jenkins did a wonderful job in holding the delegation together. We were quite a diverse group with diverse interests. He held the delegation together exceptionally well and, indeed, impressed the people we met in both countries. He was ably assisted by the deputy leader of the delegation, Mr Bruce Reid, who retired at the last election. Bruce was also a real asset to have on the delegation, assisting at every stage when there were any difficulties. Gillian Gould has to be commended for her efforts in keeping the delegation on stream and up to date with developments and meeting our commitments.
It was a difficult time for the delegation to visit both countries. As the Senate would know, both countries have been very severely impacted by the economic crisis that has hit the region and have suffered very badly. Unfortunately, the people who are suffering most are those at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder. That is something that had an impact on the delegation when we visited. 
 Of course, much has happened since the period in which the delegation visit took place. Some five months have elapsed, and a general election in Australia has occurred as well. In the report, the delegation has sought to stick to what was happening at the time that we visited.
It was a difficult time for us to visit, and that was apparent in the visits that were organised for us. The visit to Korea was better organised than was the visit to Malaysia. Whilst the visit to Malaysia was productive, it could have been much better for us. We only got to meet with one minister in Malaysia, and that was only after the delegation expressed concerns at the briefing with the High Commissioner on the first morning of the visit. We were grateful for that meeting with the minister, but the visit could have been much better. The Malaysians themselves appeared more preoccupied with their own internal difficulties than they were with the visiting parliamentary delegation, and I think our program, to a certain extent, reflected that. But I think we were looking with biased eyes and comparing it with what occurred in Korea, a very close and, indeed, very important trading partner with Australia. The people in Korea were very pleased to see us and were very grateful for Australia's interventions in their economic difficulties. Our support for the IMF package was also appreciated, and that was expressed in comments to us.
In Malaysia, there seemed to be a preoccupation with the happenings of the One Nation party in Australia. We were reminded that a previous delegation which visited Kuala Lumpur some 18 months ago had told the Malaysians that One Nation was an aberration and would not be around very long. We were reminded that since that time the Queensland state elections had been held and, indeed, the One Nation party was actually stronger than it had been previously. So that was a difficulty that we had to come to grips with in Malaysia. In many respects it would have been nicer to have gone to Malaysia this week than to visit at that particular point in time. 
Honourable senators would know that the area where I was born, only 10 miles from the border that divides Northern Ireland from Ireland, has experienced conflict for the last 300 to 400 years. I have not personally experienced it, but it has been going on for quite a considerable period of time. Even all of that did not prepare me for the visit that the delegation made to Panmunjom, the border area that divides North Korea and South Korea. I was not prepared for the tension that was very evident in that particular part of the world. There are some welcome signs on the horizon in North Korea and South Korea that there might possibly be hope for some form of peace in the near future.
In Korea I was most impressed by our two meetings with the trade union bodies in Seoul: the Federation of Korean Trade Unions and the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions. They are two separate organisations that, it would appear, spent quite a considerable period of time opposing each other over the years. At this present moment in time, they are combining to protect the workers of Korea who are suffering particularly badly because of the economic crisis.
Korean unemployment has increased from 452,000, that is 2.1 per cent, in October 1997 to over 1.5 million, seven per cent of the work force, in June of this year. It is predicted to reach two million, over 10 per cent, by the end of 1998. There are some particular difficulties for working people in Korea. These include the fact that it is mainly small business enterprises that are going bankrupt and they are the ones that are laying off the most workers. There is a very low level of trade unionism, only 1.6 million out of a labour force of some 22 million, and for those who do lose their jobs, redundancy provisions are very poor. One can perhaps understand why there is such a low level of trade unionism. We were told that between 1988 and 1997 more than 2,500 unionists were imprisoned for more than six months, and 10,000 for less than six months. So it is not easy being a trade unionist in Korea. The visit to the Samsung factory outside Seoul was very impressive and shows what has been achieved by that company in that area of the world.
One very disturbing statistic for me as a Western Australian visiting Korea was the decline in Korean imports of iron ore from Western Australia. Iron ore imports to Korea suffered, in the first quarter of this year, a decline of 44.5 percentage points, which will obviously have an impact not only on my constituents back in the Pilbara region in Western Australia but also on the overall Australian economy.
I commend this report to the parliament. It is perhaps somewhat dated, but that is not necessarily the fault of the delegation. Upon our return to Australia we were preoccupied with the federal election and getting that out of way and then had to meet again to agree on the content of the report. There will be some useful references in the report for others to build upon the relations that we have both with South Korea and with Malaysia.
Perhaps the greatest effort has to be put into our relationship with Malaysia. There are very great strains on the relationship between Australia and Malaysia. They were expressed to us in regard to One Nation, but also expressed to us was the disappointment that had continued to be felt because the Australian Prime Minister had not personally visited. The effluxion of time has meant that particular difficulty does not remain. The Prime Minister has been up there for the ASEAN conference. Nonetheless, I think there is great suspicion about what Australia is about in the region.
The country obviously is in some degree of turmoil. When we were there Mr Anwar was the Deputy Prime Minister. As we speak now, some five months later, Mr Anwar is on trial and is being held in prison. That causes some constraints. Australia, as a country that defends human rights, ought to be making stronger comments. The delegation refrained from making comments on the human rights situation. We felt that it would not have been appropriate at that point in time to have included those criticisms, one could say, in this report. With those final words, I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Korea and Malaysia, July 1998</title>",Delegation Reports,14,1,speech
The CHAIRMAN,N/A,1998-12-07,"—Before we proceed, I have a statement that I want to draw to the chamber's attention and wish to make. When this bill was first considered in the Senate, I made the following statement:
Some of the government amendments to this bill have been drafted as requests. There is no reason for their being framed as requests. The amendments would not lead to any increase in expenditure under the bill. On the contrary, the explanatory memorandum accompanying the amendments indicates that their financial impact is a total saving of $39.148 billion to the year ending 30 June 2004. The amendments will therefore be treated as amendments.
The Senate will be aware that I have changed purported government requests to amendments on several occasions when it was clear that they should not be requests. This, however, is one of the clearest examples I have encountered. These amendments would not be requests on any serious interpretation of section 53 ever advanced in either house.
Section 53 of the constitution provides that amendments moved in the Senate should take the form of requests in three circumstances: where the bill imposes taxation; where the bill appropriates money for the ordinary annual services of the government; and where a Senate amendment would increase any proposed charge or burden on the people.
Only the third circumstance is relevant here. An increase in a proposed charge or burden on the people has always been taken to mean an increase in expenditure under an appropriation. It is clear that the amendments in question do not have that effect. The problem seems to arise from a lack of understanding on the part of government drafters of the relevant provisions. They appear to operate on a theory of notional or bookkeeping effects of amendments rather than actual effects.
A statement made in the House of Representatives indicates that one of the amendments is thought to require a request because it indirectly leads to expenditure out of an appropriation. Apart from the fact that the appropriation is in another act, it is stated that 
 the expenditure is equal to the amount raised under that amendment. The effect of that amendment as such is therefore nil. The statement in the explanatory memorandum that the amendments together result in large savings to the revenue is not contested.
The advice has therefore been changed to the extent that only one amendment is now thought to require a request. The course has been adopted in the House of Representatives of rejecting that amendment but making an amendment in identical terms. In past cases where this has been done, the Senate has simply agreed to the amendment made in the House, as it is identical to the Senate's amendment. The Senate may think this is the appropriate course on this occasion, but I consider that I should not let the occasion pass without some indication of the contradictory nature of the advice on which the House's action is based.
Motion (by Senator Ian Campbell) proposed:
That the committee agrees to the amendment made by the House of Representatives.
—Could we have a copy of the statement you have just read?
—Yes, certainly.",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-12-07,"—I want to comment on the statement that has been read, but I am not sure of the appropriate procedure.
—You can do that, Senator.
—It disturbs me that, once again, we are debating the respective powers of the houses and their responsibilities. I sense from this government—if the government wants to assure me otherwise, I am happy to listen to it—a determination to downgrade the place of the Senate in this parliament. If the government wants to change the powers of the Senate or abolish the Senate, it would be appropriate for it to go to the people on the basis of a change to the constitution. But we really are dealing with the constitution of this country. The constitution makes it quite clear that both the Senate and the House of Representatives have powers given to them by the people. I sense an ideological drive by this government, at every 
 point and whenever it is possible, to deliver a message to the Senate that somehow or other it has exceeded its power or that in some way or other the Senate is to be regarded as simply a rubber stamp for the government.
I am appalled by that attitude. The government ought to understand that certainly it was elected through a majority in the House of Representatives but that the people also spoke very clearly about the kind of make-up of the Senate which the people themselves required. Again, I think it is important that the Senate not accept from the House of Representatives any suggestion that its powers should be abrogated or watered down in any way. I sense that that is what is going on here. If it is simply a matter of trying to get a definition between the two houses, that is obviously something that can be decided through debate or through whatever process is available. I am appalled by the continuing attack on this house—both verbally, in the way in which the government continually talks about the Senate blocking its legislation et cetera, and by devices which send back to us amendments which have quite legitimately been moved by this house, yet the government in the other place decides that it is simply going to change them to a request.",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,1998-12-07,"—I have a point of explanation. Senator Woodley, I refer you to the statement made by the Deputy President before this matter came into the chamber today. My understanding is that there is a different interpretation of this particular matter by the Clerks in each house. It is no reflection on the government; it happens to an interpretation put on the matter in the other place by parliamentary counsel and, indeed, by the Clerks there. I have it on good authority from our Clerk that our position is correct. In fact, there is some doubt about the position in the advice given by parliamentary counsel. Nevertheless, the better way out of it is to take the advice of the Clerks and get on with it. The government is not involved in this. It is not the government down in the other place telling us what to do; it is an interpretation by the Clerks in both houses.
—Thank you; that explanation does help.
—I draw your attention to the paragraph which says that the problem appears to arise from a lack of understanding on the part of the government drafters. It does not mention anything about the government or ministers.",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-07,"—I rise briefly to say that obviously we accept advice from a number of different sources here in parliament and in the Senate but that this is, in the end, a decision that has come up from the House of Representatives. It is not a decision that has come up from the Clerks; it is not one that has come up from the drafters. In the end, a decision that comes from the House of Representatives is supposed to come from the elected representatives in the House of Representatives. I would hate to think that we were in a situation where, somehow or other, the people making the actual decisions had lost their parliamentary responsibility.
We are getting a message from the House of Representatives. In that sense it is reasonable, as we all know, that a message from House of Representatives in effect means a message from the government. As we know, the House of Representatives has a winner takes all, party-political system of voting. When we get a message from the House of Representatives, it is all very well hiding behind legal advice but we also know that governments may or may not choose to accept the advice they are given.
In this particular case, I remind honourable senators that a number of statements have begun to be salted into the media of late—into editorials, a number of press outlets and opinion pieces. Recently people have been threatening to reduce the number of senators. I believe that that was said by Senator Minchin. There have been a number of statements about Senate recalcitrance and the need for reform, and you can read that as the desire of the government to get rid of the ability of the Senate to scrutinise what it is doing.
I feel less comforted than some, I guess, that what we are getting is simply legal 
 advice. I understand that people are dependent on legal advice but I also understand that, when we get a message from the House of Representatives, it is not said that it is a message from the Clerks and it is not mentioned that it is a message from some legal adviser; it is a message from the democratically elected representatives of the people of Australia. In the end, because of the way the House of Representatives operates, that means the government.
The people of Australia ought to be aware that various excuses are being used at the moment in what I believe is an integrated campaign which will, in effect, mean that the government will eventually go to the opposition—if they have not done so already—to talk about changes to get rid of minor parties and independents and to use whatever happens to be their excuse of the moment to move in that direction. I feel that is something that ought to be talked about. The role of the Senate is cherished by many people. They may not like parliamentarians in general but they believe that the ability of the community to have input and influence via the Senate is absolutely essential.",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-12-07,"—Madam Chair, the Senate has before it a message from the House of Representatives and we are considering that message. I am going to speak for a very brief time indeed. The message from the House of Representatives was clear. It was a formal message. The statement by you is very clear as well, and it sets out the situation as it should be—as it is, in fact, in law. I was pleased to hear the intervention of Senator Calvert, because the case is as he said.
The government knows that things come and go and that the numbers in this particular place or the method of consideration of matters in this place may change. For any major political party to do other than subscribe to this message of yours would be very short-sighted indeed. I am sure that neither of the major parties will be doing that in this particular case. They may be doing other things, as Senator Margetts said. They may be considering the way senators are elected in 
 particular circumstances, that may be true; but on this particular matter, no.
We are considering a formal message from the House of Representatives. By inferentially accepting the value of your statement, Madam Chair, we are really sending a message to the House of Representatives and I hope they heed it.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-12-07,"—I just have a minute or two left, and in that time I simply want to indicate that the Democrats have an amendment. During the hearings of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, every witness, I think, indicated that they were concerned about the cost of privatisation and about the legislation which indicated that Wool International would bear all of the cost. The Democrats concern is that this is, in the end, I suppose, a government decision imposed upon Wool International. We agree with those witnesses who said that the cost really should be borne either in part or in whole by the government, so our amendment seeks to have that cost shifted back to the government rather than it being imposed on Wool International. We are concerned that any further cost to Wool International will reduce the equity for the unit holders in Wool International.
I want to point out that the committee will be having a hearing on 17 December at which all of the people who want to can put on the table the proposals they are making for the future of the stockpile. I also indicate that the New South Wales Country Hour on the ABC acted in a pretty irresponsible way by canvassing one of those proposals in a fair amount of detail, probably prejudicing it to a certain extent. I want to put on the record that I do not think the committee or the Senate should view that with any kind of approval, because we in the committee wanted to have all of the 
 proposals on the table together so they could be considered, in a sense, although none of us believe in it, on a level playing field—perhaps I should talk about a level table rather than a level playing field. So I was disturbed that the New South Wales Country Hour, against the request of the people involved with this particular offer, actually went ahead and discussed that offer.
—Freedom of the press.
—Yes, it is freedom of the press. There is no doubt they were able to do it, it is just whether it was a very wise thing to do. With that, I conclude my remarks.",SENATE,<title>WOOL INTERNATIONAL AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,1998-12-07,"—The purpose of the Wool International Amendment Bill 1998 , as it has been summarised, is, firstly, to prohibit Wool International from entering into contracts for the sale of wool from the stockpile between the commencement of the bill and 30 June 1999 and, secondly, to require Wool International to assist in the privatisation of the organisation. The bill is yet another reaction to the long running industry crisis, which has been dominated by the debate over the disposal of the wool stockpile and how to arrest the slump in wool prices. The debate has its origins as far back as 1990, when instability in the wool industry took hold following a decade of good returns. The industry was facing a severe downturn in wool prices and a mounting stockpile and debt burden.
As a member of the Senate at the time, I recall only too well the handling of the issue by the then minister for primary industries, Mr Kerin. He added to the instability by undermining the reliable floor price scheme and sending the marketplace into speculative frenzy, forcing the then Australian Wool Corporation to buy some 90 per cent of the sales on offer. Mr Kerin achieved this in stages. Firstly, he declared the floor price of 870c would be changed, but he let an inordinate amount of time elapse before he set the 700c level. He declared he would stick by that and the scheme, and then he completely abandoned the whole scheme.
The point is that there was a problem at that time, around 1990-91, which feasibly 
 could have been managed but it was allowed to get out of control by the then Labor government, so what was a problem became a crisis because of that early poor management. By 1991 the stockpile had reached 4.72 million bales and the industry had collapsed under the weight of it, with prices well below 400c per kilo and a debt of some $8.2 billion being created by maintaining that stockpile.
The industry lurched under this burden until it came to its next crossroad in the handing down of the Garnaut report, which dealt with the options for the sell-down of the stockpile. The debate settled on a fixed sell-down of the stockpile of some 350,000 bales per quarter. Just as Senator Woodley raked over history and mentioned what he was doing in 1993 when the Garnaut report was handed down, I will do that also and say that at the time I was no great enthusiast for the Garnaut option of a fixed sell-down. In a speech I made in the parliament at the time, I had this to say:
It is my opinion that the Garnaut solution to the massive wool stockpile will work provided one important variable holds up—that is, the current demand—
which was quite strong at the time. It was some 820 million kilograms per year. I went on to say:
Should this variable fail, Garnaut fails, and we will be back in this parliament rewriting the legislation again. The point is that we cannot afford such an error. We cannot afford to be wrong again.
On any analysis, the fixed sell-down started to drive prices down again. Even though changes were made to the fixed schedule in 1996 by this government to make it a more flexible sell-down, the damage had already been done. So the industry struggled under repressive prices for five years. A certain inertia set into the industry over that time. It was from those wrong judgments on the Garnaut report that the seeds of dissent towards Wool International and the other leadership bodies were sown which have now come to a head.
I give this brief history to show that the government does not make this decision in isolation. Each stage has been interlinked right back to the 1990 problems. The casualties of a near decade of turmoil have been the 
 50,000-plus farmers, some of whom have been forced to exit the industry or take on crippling debt just to survive, not to mention the effect of the falling exports on the wealth of the nation. The bill's explanatory memorandum states why the government has chosen the freeze option to the stockpile. It says:
Suspending stockpile sales will take pressure off the fresh wool market and allow growers to release some of their wool stocks. This will allow improved income in the short term, and encourage maintenance of production levels.
It goes on to say:
It would also provide wool growers with the opportunity to improve their financial position by allowing them to sell wool from their privately held stocks and the current season's wool clip.
The Senate legislative committee report on this bill received submissions strongly opposed to the freeze—just to present the other side of the argument—raising concerns such as the freeze will erode the grower equity in the stockpile due to holding costs, it will have an adverse effect on the growers equity in the stockpile and it will affect the confidence of the buyers to see yet another change in the government's policies towards a stockpile.
However, to balance these adverse effects has been the increase in the wool prices since the freeze, therefore, increasing the value of the stockpile. To take advantage of this jump in the stockpile value it is imperative that the parliament establishes as soon as possible the private company to handle future sales. The privatisation of Wool International really does bring to close the decade-long saga of the wool stockpile. I wonder if it is a decision that the parliament should have made back in 1990, given the number of legislative changes that have been made to the selling of the stockpile over the years.
The Senate report outlines the government's justification for privatisation, to which I referred. In announcing the privatisation, Mr Anderson, the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, said:
Equity in the stockpile is now significantly higher than the wool debt, even at today's depressed prices, so there is no justification for ongoing Government involvement . . . 
Mr Anderson also commented that the privatisation of Wool International would 
 `satisfy calls for the stockpile to be managed on a purely commercial basis by a private sector board responsible solely to its shareholders'. All the ills of the wool industry do not come from the stockpile. To that end Dr Bob Richardson had this to say to the committee during its hearings:
The key issue facing the wool industry is that it has been experiencing continued structural decline in demand. This has been going on for much of the 1990s. It is this, not the stockpile, which is the major factor in the poor state of the wool industry in Australia.
Therefore, the future of AWRAP also needs to be finalised expeditiously to allow the industry to get on with its future plans.
Speakers before me have outlined the importance of the wool industry, its export value, its value to local towns and districts, and its value to rural families, let alone its cultural significance to Australian art, literature and identity. Yet, like no other industry in this country, it has suffered a decade-long downturn in commodity prices perpetuated by a string of poor decisions from the top. Now it seems that the house is being put in order.
In finalising, I refer to the 3 December edition of Stock and Land. There are two excellent articles worth reading that really point out that the way ahead is not so difficult and complex as it is made out by some and that really you can give this industry a bit of hope and a bit of cash in the pocket. I refer to a letter to the editor from Giovanni Nesti from Prato, Italy, about his views on the wool industry. I have not got the time to go through that, but I recommend that be read. I also refer to an article on page 13 about the French retail fashion house of Kookai and how successful it has been in selling the wool products at its outlets. So there is a great deal to be hopeful for, but, as I said before, we have had to get the house in order. It looks like that is coming about. Therefore, I urge the Senate to support this legislation.",SENATE,<title>WOOL INTERNATIONAL AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1998-12-07,"—In speaking to the Wool International Amendment Bill 1998  proposed by the government, I would like to say that, having spent some 14 years of my working life as a shearer, I do have some affinity with the 
 industry. It has been a great industry and I would like to see it continue as a great industry. It has made a marvellous contribution to this country in economic terms. I think it is something we ought to take very seriously.
The government, in considering its position or arriving at its position, provided a very interesting scenario. It would seem that it was probably driven more by political outcomes than by what is really in the best interests of the wool industry of this country. As we all know, including Senator McGauran, from time to time the wool industry has had its difficulties. It has had its ups and downs, as is the case generally with commodities like wool.
—As was the case with John Kerin.
—How interesting! Senator McGauran is saying that John Kerin, the former minister for primary industries, is at fault. We in government put in place something—it was not necessarily the right thing—that gave a lot of support to and underpinned a lot of people in the wool industry at that time. If you talk about Australia riding on the sheep's back, I have to say that a lot of cockies rode on the floor price for wool, and did so on the basis of being poor managers, in the case of some.
We have before us this legislation that proposes to put a freeze on the wool stockpile. So, if we put in place a freeze on the stockpile—we propose to put it in place for six months or thereabouts from the date of enactment of this legislation—what is that really going to achieve? I have listened to honourable senators—Senator McGauran and others—saying that this will help the farmers stabilise wool prices, et cetera. What if it does not? If you look at the circumstances currently confronting the wool industry over and above the problem with prices, where are the pressures coming from? The pressures are coming not just from the problem of prices associated with an oversupply but from competition from a whole range of areas such as synthetics and cotton. All of those things are having an impact on this industry.
Our shadow minister, Mr Gavan O'Connor, pointed out in the House of Representatives 
 an ABARE analysis of the circumstances confronting the industry. He said:
The ABARE analysis indicates that poor prices were the main factor driving the growth of the private stockpile and that farmers with mixed cropping and wool producing businesses were the ones storing most of the wool. High relative grain prices have increased the financial capacity of those growers to store their wool and to pursue more flexible marketing strategies in response to price movements. The ABARE analysis also showed that the composition of the on-farm stockpile is quite different from Wool International's stockpile profile. This is an important point to consider in assessing the efficacy of the freeze decision. The majority of wool in the Wool International stockpile is 21 to 23 microns, while over 50 per cent of the standard group and wool held on-farm is 21.5 microns or finer. Given all these factors, there are many people in the industry questioning whether the focus on the stockpile is indeed the main event or is merely the sideshow.
That is a very good point. If we take account of all the factors that have the capacity to impact on this industry, it is difficult to see how a freeze of the nature proposed by the government will have any real beneficial effect.
At the end of the day, I think we will see a situation develop where we will have had a freeze for six months, wool prices will still be very low, the on-farm stockpile will have increased and we will have to make another decision. I will be interested to see the government's decision at that point in time; how it will deal with a stockpile that it has basically frozen, which was unlike what the majority of the industry wanted—not the few from Western Australia and maybe the few Queenslanders who ran scared in terms of the Nationals and what was happening with regard to One Nation. The reaction from the government was more in line with political circumstances than what was really required by the industry.
In my own state, the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association condemned the decision, and continue to condemn it, because they see all of its shortcomings. I find Senator Crane's position very interesting. He initially championed the cause of a freeze and is now rethinking his position.
—Where do you get that from?
—We will watch with interest exactly how Senator Crane's position develops over time. In terms of Wool International, we now know the result of a meeting of farmers that was held and the decision they have taken. Nevertheless, if you look at the selling down of the stockpile, they probably did not do such a bad job given the constraints that they had.
There are other options, and I know that Senator Forshaw will be moving some amendments on behalf of the opposition, that provide a more sensible approach in allowing Wool International to sell at least some wool. When Dr Richardson was responding to questions at the Senate committee hearing, he said:
The role of the stockpile sales in this has been greatly exaggerated. Once we were faced with the narrow band fixed release schedule of 187,000 bales per quarter of deliveries, we could no longer just sit back and wait and sell in the spot market. That forced us into a situation where, to avoid any speculative squeeze at the end of a quarter, it was necessary for us to make some forward sales to try to add a limited amount of additional commercial flexibility when we were under such tight constraints.
That is quite a good approach to have. It also provides some stability in terms of wool pricing rather than, as he very accurately and quite correctly points out, having to dump a big quantity of wool at the end of a quarter and those people who are selling their wool in the last quarter getting caught out and wool prices hitting the deck. Those are the sorts of issues that Wool International, with the constraints it was operating under, was thinking about.
The government, on the other hand, says, `No—shock, horror—One Nation is going to win a few seats around the place. We need to do something. Let's put a freeze on the sale of wool.' In the second reading speech, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry said:
The Government fully appreciates the reasons for the wool industry's call for assistance to alleviate whatever pressures there are on the wool market that are in its scope to control. 

The Government's decision to freeze stockpile sales through to 30 June 1999 was a response to this request from the industry, and followed a long period of intense consultation on the future directions of the industry.
—Correct.
—Correct, Senator McGauran says. Well, it appears that he did not consult too many people on the eastern seaboard. He does not appear to have consulted even 50 per cent of the industry.
—I will tell you about that in a minute.
—I hope the parliamentary secretary will get up and tell us about that. I hope you will explain how you consulted with all and sundry. You obviously did not consult with the farmers in my state. They certainly did not think that you did. I think in a number of other states you did not do too well either. I do not know how you did in Victoria, which is the state which you come from, but I suggest that you are a long way short of majority industry support—a long way short. I suppose reality will hit home to some of these people now. They have been forced into a position that they never wanted to be in in the first place.
As I said earlier, what happens at the end of the day when the term of this freeze has expired and we find ourselves in a situation where private wool stocks have grown, the onfarm stockpile has grown, prices have not increased and farmers are faced with having to contribute more because of the withholding debt that will grow? They will have to meet those commitments without any money being derived from the sale of wool from the stockpile. What are we going to do then? Decide to freeze the stockpile further? Is that what we are going to do? Or are we going to have sales on a limited basis? I would be very interested in hearing from the parliamentary secretary about what we will do in those circumstances.
I think the circumstances confronting the industry are difficult, but it is not the first time that we have had difficult circumstances. I do not think the government's  decision to put forward this legislation in terms of freezing the stockpile is the best option. I think the 
 option that we have proposed by way of amendment is a better option, and I would urge senators to support that.
With regard to the second part of the legislation, we support the privatisation of Wool International. I think that was something we were moving towards anyway. I hope that the government will take up the amendments that we have proposed, because I think they will provide greater flexibility. I do not think it is the answer in itself, but I do believe that we ought to continue to sell down some of the stockpile wool. Otherwise I think we will find ourselves at the expiration of the term of the freeze in a worse situation than we are currently in.",SENATE,<title>WOOL INTERNATIONAL AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-07,"—The Wool International Amendment Bill 1998  gives effect to two recent announcements by the government. The first announcement was the pre-election announcement to freeze the sale of the wool stockpile by Wool International until 30 June 1999. Wool International are currently required to sell the wool stockpile at a rate of at least 90,000 bales per quarter, and this bill would suspend that requirement until midway through the next year. As the explanatory memorandum acknowledges, this bill also seeks to commence steps towards privatisation or demutualisation of Wool International, the managers of the wool stockpile.
While the Greens (WA) have concerns with the bill, we will be supporting the passage of the bill at the second reading stage. One concern that I would like to raise is the underlying political expediency of this bill from the government's point of view. Despite supporting the stockpile freeze, I have doubts about whether the government had honourable intentions behind the decision to freeze the stockpile. As the Victorian Farmers Federation Pastoral Group noted during committee hearings:
The decision to freeze the Wool International stockpile sales has unfortunately been driven more by political agendas . . . rather than commercial logic.
As many in this chamber would be well aware, the Greens believe there are many more legitimate reasons for policy decisions 
 than just short-term commercial factors. But I suspect this decision has been motivated much more by election timing than altruistic reasons of wanting to help out the industry through their hard time.
The Greens endorse this move by the government to assist the wool growers and the wool industry. The Greens endorse this move to attempt to ameliorate some of the long-term problems in the industry and some of the long-term problems caused by the previous government's decision to sell fixed amounts of the wool stockpile, as Senator Woodley discussed. However, I would like to highlight that this kind of move is the very antithesis of the general economic agenda of the government.
Conveniently, the announcement of the freeze of the stockpile was timed just before the election—perhaps to remind the wool industry that the coalition does have a heart; that they should forget the last three years of some of the driest economic policies that Australia has ever seen; that they should not remember Minister Anderson's and the coalition's perpetual drive for free trade; that they should not remember their blind faith that free trade will deliver the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow; that they should not remember the fact that the coalition has forced Australia to lead the world in exposing our markets to the ebbs and flows of the globalised trade scene.
They should not remember the fact that the coalition has resisted cries from many struggling primary industries to have some assistance, not to move so fast, to look at the reality before them. No, it is not these kinds of things the coalition wanted in the forefront of wool growers' minds as they headed for the polling booths on 3 October. No, the coalition wanted wool growers to walk into the polling booth with a fresh memory of a government who cares about the future of the wool growers and the wool industry—not a government leading the industry to the precipice and saying, `Jump.'
I turn to the specific merits of the bill. The explanatory memorandum of this bill states that the object of the bill is:
. . . to help address the slide in wool prices and improve the financial position of wool growers and to encourage processors not to switch off the fresh wool market . . . 
These objects are certainly worthy, and the Greens (WA) certainly hope that this mechanism goes some way to achieving these goals. The Greens note that many in the industry have had concerns for a significant time about fixed amounts of wool being fed into the fickle market. Over a significant period many have been calling for flexibility in the sale of the stockpile.
It is clear that the reduced price of wool has meant that there is an increased pressure on wool growers. There are a significant number of wool growers out there too: there are around 11,000 farms in Australia whose main income is gained from wool production. Of course, there are a lot more people who rely on wool production than those 11,000 farms. So, when there is a reduction in the demand for wool products and the market for wool deteriorates and the prices go down, it is the wool growers who feel the crunch—and feel the crunch they have, with prices plummeting to a low of 465c. Evidence to the committee highlighted the fact that many Australian wool growers have found themselves in a grave situation.
The industry has certainly given equivocal support to the freeze. The government, however, has been reticent to acknowledge the variety of opinion on this issue. As Senator Forshaw recognised, the minister, in his second reading speech on this bill, made the apparently unequivocal claim that:
The government's decision to freeze stockpile sales through to 30 June 1999 was a response to this request from the industry, and followed a long period of intense consultation on the future direction of the industry.
Of course, during the passage of the wheat marketing bill, we heard statements on what `the wheat industry' said, and we realised that `the wheat industry' was not the entire industry; so we knew that there were other opinions that were not being listened to by the government at that stage. So here we have the government claiming that it is listening and responding, yet again, to the whole industry. 
 Regardless of the merits of the freeze, this claim is not true.
There has been a significant amount of dissent to this move, and it has been mentioned that some of the country hour radio programs also have been running a campaign against it. This is apparent from just looking at the newspapers, and it became apparent in the committee hearings on this bill. The reality is that industry is significantly divided on the merits of this issue.
The dissenters have claimed that freeze of the stockpile would have little impact, and all that would happen would be the replacement of Wool International's stockpile with the stocks from growers' and brokers' stores. Consequently, it would not have had any positive effects on the prices of wool either in the short or medium term. There was also concern expressed by the Wool Council that this move does not address the fundamental issues of demand for the industry and may damage the industry's international reputation. Of course, those are the kinds of issues I referred to before in terms of trade and commodity prices globally.
However, the proponents of this freeze argue that the sale of the stockpile wool was significantly contributing to the fall of wool prices. It has been argued that, in the dire situation that faced the wool industry, further sales of the stockpile would only exacerbate the problem and put the future of the industry in jeopardy. They have outlined the possible flow on effects if the wool industry contracted as a result of the fall in the price of wool—or, should we say, a further fall in the price of wool.
Some of these possible flow on effects include: a decrease in the number of wool growers in the industry; a decline in the economic viability and threshold level of survival for rural towns and communities; a dramatic cut in wool production resulting in problems for the wool processing sector; and a shortage in the supply of wool, possibly leading to the further substitution of other fibres for wool, resulting in a permanent loss of markets for the Australian wool industry.
The proponents argue that suspension of sale from the stockpile would give the wool 
 growers the breathing space they need. It would give wool growers the ability to increase the flow of wool from stockpiles on farms as well as from the current season's wool clip.
The Greens (WA) recognise these concerns, but we do agree that the freeze of the stockpile is not the panacea for all of the problems of wool growers. However, we are glad that the government seems to be paying attention to long-term effects of short-term measures on rural and regional communities. For a long time the Greens (WA) have pointed out how policy decisions often have impacts far beyond those that are immediately obvious.
These are the kinds of decisions that I alluded to before: the immense impacts of globalised free trade; the push for free trade and related micro-economic reform associated with competition policy; the impacts on employment, job security and the viability of regional communities; the impacts on world markets based on the fact that a number of countries have been pushed to the same precipice, without anybody having had the courage to say, `The emperor has no clothes,' or `The emperor's clothes are somewhat shoddy and need changing.' We are beginning to see some changes or some complaint on the regional areas in terms of global free trade and free trade models. But as yet this has not sunk into the general conversation or the media debate in Australia.
The Greens (WA) agree with the government's assessment that, regardless of whether the stockpile freeze pushes prices up, the potential increase in growers' income by being able to sell their own stockpiles will have positive resonations in rural and regional communities; it will take the pressure off growers financially at a crucial time. Dr Stephen Beare, Deputy Director of ABARE, acknowledged this in his evidence to the committee: essentially it is a transfer of revenue potentially from Wool International to private stock sales.
I now move to the second aspect of this bill—that is, the proposal to privatise Wool International. The proposal announced by Minister Anderson at the time was to replace Wool International by a private shareholding 
 company, with shares allocated on the basis of individual equity entitlements in the wool stockpile. Most of the industry seems to be in favour of the privatisation of Wool International, although there have been concerns expressed during the committee inquiry by the Hamilton Victorian Farmers' Federation District Council that the government is abandoning equity holders on the basis of commercial expedience.
A contentious issue in this announcement to privatise is that the government has seen fit to legislate that Wool International bear all the costs of privatisation. Senator Woodley, in his presentation in the second reading stage, has indicated that he will be attempting to amend this during the committee stage of the bill so that the costs will be borne by government. The Greens (WA) will be supporting this amendment.
The Greens (WA) are in agreement with this amendment, as are most in the industry. The industry support is not surprising—for obvious reasons. They would rather not pay, but the reality is—as the industry rightly points out—that this is a government decision. The government has chosen a certain direction and it is reasonable to expect that they pay for the processes. The Wool Council makes the point that the legal and financial advice that the Commonwealth is receiving relates to matters of specific interest to the government. The Wool Council also makes the point that it is usual practice for the government to pay for its own asset sales—one would think so. The process is estimated to cost around $4.5 million, and this kind of burden should not be shifted onto the industry.
The Greens (WA) note that the government intends to establish an interim advisory board to guide the move to demutualisation. As the government has recognised, there are a range of alternative business plans being developed by different sections of the industry, with different options for the end result. The main call from the industry seems to be for consultation—that is, effective consultation. The industry wants to have a say in the planning and the implementation of the moves to privatise Wool International. I would say that is a reasonable call.
In relation to this consultation issue, the Greens (WA) are supportive of the recommendation of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. This recommendation gives the committee a watching brief over the privatisation of Wool International and enables the committee to gather more information and gather up the many loose ends associated with privatisation. This seems like a very sensible idea, considering how much is still left up in the air. It is still unclear whether equity holders will be able to choose whether to be involved or what the nature or composition of the board will be. In addition, as the committee report notes, the private offers on the stockpile require more examination.
Overall, despite the scepticism of the Greens (WA) as to the motives behind this bill, we are supportive of the bill in taking the pressure off the woolgrowers and the wool industry. We are supportive of Senator Crane's reference of these further demutualisation issues to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee.",SENATE,<title>WOOL INTERNATIONAL AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1998-12-07,"—I do not intend to speak long on this debate today, but I have participated in every wool debate in this place since I first came here in 1990. We see that the industry is again in crisis. Prices are dropping and the growers are not a very happy bunch, as was evidenced by the anger at the AWRAP board meeting last week. They are very angry.
In relation to the  Wool International Amendment Bill 1998 , I urge people to read the report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. I especially urge them to read the dissenting report by Senators Forshaw, O'Brien and McKiernan. I would also draw the attention of senators to the fact that there is quite a lot written in the bulk of the main report about the opposition to the freeze. It is very interesting to look at the groups that are opposed to the freeze. One wonders why the government is so hell-bent on having the freeze, because the majority of groups representing the growers are opposed to a freeze.
The Pastoral Group of the Victorian Farmers Federation said that there was a strong and clear majority opposed to the freeze. They also stated that a rural press survey had found that 60 per cent of Victorian and Tasmanian producers opposed the freeze. They are not an insignificant group. There is quite a considerable amount of wool that is produced in Tasmania and Victoria, and I am sure the parliamentary secretary at the table will recognise that. The Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett, has also been critical of the decision. He stated that:
. . . we are on an orderly process to get rid of that wool pile stockpile [sic], in about 12 months, 18 months. So we have actually buckled to a policy position that I think is fundamentally wrong.
Mr Bob Quirk, a spokesperson for the Australian Council of Australian Wool Exporters, indicated that they had problems with the freeze. Mr Rod Thirkell-Johnston, on behalf of the Wool Council of Australia, expressed the view—and it is in the report:
. . . I think a lot of people see a very simplistic solution in the present difficult situation that if you just reduce the supply by the legislated amount in the stockpile that this will increase the price of wool. But from all the research that we have had done, that doesn't stack up . . .
Mr Quirk again is quoted as saying:
From a personal point of view I think what is particularly disappointing about today's announcement is the decisions were taken without any consultation with anyone on the customer side of the industry.
The producer side is very important, but the customer side is also vitally important.
A lot of the anger about AWRAP has resulted from the way the customer has been treated. The woollen suit that I am wearing probably weighs three or four kilos. It is a reasonable quality wool, but the value of raw wool in this suit is less than $10. Why did it cost me a couple of hundred dollars to buy? These are the sorts of questions that have to be asked when we are looking at the wool stockpile and any industry relating to wool. Who is making the money? It is not the producers, and it sure is not the consumers, whose hip-pocket nerve is bleeding badly.
Although there has been a significant drop in the price of wool, I have not seen a reduc 
 tion in the price of woollen commodities in shops. Why does my woollen suit still cost me $400 and why did the grower probably get $10 if he or she was lucky? The wool might have made a few trips around the world after it left this country to be processed, but the cost to the consumer has certainly not been returned to the grower. That is a question that a lot of growers are beginning to ask themselves these days.
I return to the issue of opposition to the freeze. The Western Wool Growers, Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia said:
The principle of a freeze to us was an economically bad decision.
The New South Wales Farmers Association stated in its submission to the inquiry:
From recent history, there is no evidence that reducing stockpile sales results in any sustainable increase in wool prices. The Government cut the legislated selling schedule from 180 000—190 000 bales per quarter in 1996, to a minimum of 90 000 bales per quarter in 1997. Although some short term price recovery was experienced, this quickly subsided with prices falling to their lowest levels since 1993.
When you have all these groups opposed to a freeze one has to ask: why is the government continuing to go ahead with the legislation? I also notice that the majority report of the committee stated:
The Committee also recommends that the following matter be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee for inquiry and report
The administration, management and performance of Wool International Limited, including all aspects of the proposed sale and disposal of Wool International Limited by the Commonwealth Government.
I understand that that was moved and then withdrawn. One has to wonder what the government is doing. The government obviously did not like what government senators had come up with, so they were told to do otherwise.
Bills for the stockpile freeze will not stop coming in. Wool International will still have to maintain the debt schedules. Storage costs will still have to be paid. Someone will have to pay that bill. That is why the opposition 
 favours the chill option—that there will be enough sold to meet Wool International's costs so that the farmers will not be buying themselves another big debt at the end of all this. It is very, very concerning. This industry wants stability. This industry has not had stability.
Ms Lynne Johnston, the Chairman of the Western Wool Growers, Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia, said that the PGA, as they are known, opposed the freeze on the basis of economic principles. She said that the PGA:
sought an independent analysis from the economic division of the Agriculture WA—
the agricultural department of Western Australia—
which backed up our objections. This analysis showed that there would be a small short-term gains of some 13c.
She went on to say:
However, the long-term result would be negative as the buyers making their purchasing decisions would be making those decisions based on the knowledge the wool must come back onto the market.
They will sit it out until the wool comes back on to the market.
I have also heard many rumours from the industry over the last couple of years that cheaper prices are being offered to people if they buy wool from the stockpile overseas, that there are two prices to the wool in the stockpile. This is denied quite frequently. But I was interested to see the Four Corners report which also indicated that this was in fact the truth, that there are two prices and that you can buy it overseas at a cheaper rate. This does not help the Australian farmers and Australian producers.
New South Wales farmers oppose the decision to freeze the stockpile. Mr David Wolfenden, who is Chairman of the Wool Industry Committee of the New South Wales Farmers Association, stated that the option to freeze sales of the stockpile was debated at the association's annual general meeting and was `comprehensively defeated by 70 per cent to 80 per cent of the vote'. As I say, I keep wondering why it is being pushed by the government. 
Mr Robert Tehan, a member of the Wool Committee of the Victorian Farmers Federation, said that the `government's decision to freeze the stockpile will cost wool growers at least $10 million a quarter'. He was amazed, I think, that the explanatory memorandum of the bill states that to improve the financial position of wool growers is one of the objectives of this government action. Obviously, from a Victorian point of view, he did not agree.
I think the government need to be asked: why are they rushing in with this freeze? Who are they satisfying? In this case, it is the tail wagging the dog because the majority of the industry and the producers do not want a freeze. They can see that a freeze means that the manufacturing side of the industry will be aware that all they have to do is wait—wait until the freeze is over and then they will have a considerable amount of wool back on the auction floor, back into circulation, for them to purchase and maybe at a cheaper rate by buying from the stores overseas, if they are able to purchase from overseas at a cheaper rate.
One would have to wonder why they are able to purchase the wool more cheaply overseas when Wool International would have had to have borne the cost of transporting the wool to the overseas site. One would have thought the cost would have been higher to cover transport costs. That is obviously not the way this government works.
I think this government needs to be asked a whole series of questions. It needs to look very carefully at this. This is a very delicate issue. There are people having difficulty surviving. There are communities having difficulty surviving. There are a number of fundamental questions that also need to be asked like: why is it when a suit that would have no more than $10 worth of wool in it would cost me $400 or $500 to buy? What are the wool organisations doing?
—What about the GST?
—Yes. This is before the GST, Senator Forshaw. One wonders why wool is not able to be sold and marketed in the same way that cotton is sold and marketed. 
I am critical that a number of wool organisations have not marketed or made processed wool accessible to the average person in the street. Why does it require somebody on my sort of income to be able to afford to buy wool clothing, but the average person cannot afford it and is forced to purchase garments made from non-renewable resources and from non-natural resources? I think the government need to think very carefully about how they proceed with this, because the industry has grave concerns about what the future of wool is. We want to make sure that the wool industry does not have grave concerns. This is a good industry. Wool is a wonderful fibre to work with, but the average person has to have confidence in it, and the growers certainly have to have confidence in it.",SENATE,<title>WOOL INTERNATIONAL AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,1998-12-07,"—The Wool International Amendment Bill 1998  is a critical piece of legislation for rural and regional Australia because it provides for the freeze of the stockpile announced before the election. One of the earlier speakers, Senator Forshaw—who is the main spokesman for the opposition—made quite an uninformed speech, which is unusual for him. It seems that the Labor Party are confused by the proposals contained in the bill. The Labor Party want a chill to the stockpile but Senator Forshaw then says that they basically support the proposal. I say to Senator Forshaw that the game has moved on and, as I understand it, the proposed Labor amendments will not attract the support of the Democrats anyway.
 The reason why the freeze—as opposed to the chill—proposal has been decided as appropriate by the government is that it is the best option. It is time to have that circuit-breaker and to make a decision about the future of the privatised stockpile, quite apart from being a sort of halfway house. The freeze will be in place for a short time, only six months, until 30 June next year. Senator Forshaw made a number of points that were entirely wrong. He said that the debt of Wool International was exploding. It is certainly not an inconsiderable debt—it is about $180 million and it will be $200 million by 30 June next year—but it pales into insignificance 
 compared with 1991 when the debt was $2.8 billion.
Australia's 60,000 wool growers, mostly family farmers, deserve better than the divided and depressed conditions in which they find themselves today. After all, we are talking about what is still our greatest rural enterprise: a means of making a living that substantially opened up large tracts of regional Australia, and for very large tracts of regional Australia wool remains the only agricultural activity that remains suitable.
Today, even for the most urbanised Australians, the wool industry has an influence on how we see ourselves as Australians. This may have been much stronger 20 or 30 years ago, but it is still true today. The wool story is not just about the producers who produce what remains of about $4 billion worth of export income, it is about the station hands, the stockmen, the shearers, the rouseabouts and the truckers—a whole range of rural communities, small and large, that all depend on wool for their prosperity and wellbeing, to a greater or lesser extent, as befits the sort of rural mix that they have.
I want to say something about the type of people who grow wool. Our political opponents may have a rather jaundiced view of wool growers because of the historical stereotypes that prevail—the view of an all-powerful squatter exploiting the land and the worker, which in fact gave birth to the ALP in the Queensland shearing sheds in the 1890s. This is certainly not the case now with struggling families relying on incomes much smaller than almost anybody else in the community and, I suspect, very often a smaller income than the shearers who shear the wool.
 In my experience, there is hardly a group of primary producers more decent and prepared to give people a fair go than wool growers. After all, for years they have grown a product that the world wanted and they could get on with life without cutting their neighbour's throat. It might sound old-fashioned but wool remains—even today at these very reduced prices—a very decent way to make a living. To produce a wonderful natural product that, properly blended, is unsurpassed and to produce the best of this 
 product in the world is quite something. It takes the present crisis to make the wool industry motivated for change in the way that previous speakers have described last week.
 As a result of the no-confidence motion passed in the board of AWRAP, the government will appoint a high level task force to map out the best marketing, research and development and general future for wool. The task force will also assess wool against its competitor fibres. We acknowledge that the threats to wool are partly because of relatively low prices for synthetics and also, as senators will be aware, because the price of oil is at a 12-year low.
Simply, the task force will be the forerunner to privatise, to democratise and to commercialise a company that will be controlled by wool growers. This is a unique opportunity to stand back and take a look at how the industry's marketing should be done. The role of a future statutory body will also have to be addressed by the task force if the government is to support the necessary legislation for a compulsory industry levy, which is currently at four per cent. This levy comes from the gross returns of all wool growers.
 As I see it, the task force will be charged with delivering a representative structure that controls promotion—and the international arm of that, the Woolmark company—and research and development. At the same time the delivery of a strategic plan for wool will be delivered. The task force will have the power to use any outside expertise it requires to point to the future needs of the industry.
This legislation, as I have pointed out, is to implement the government's decision to freeze the stockpile and allow the privatisation of the company, which will occur next year. Wool International became the sell-down mechanism after the Australian Wool Realisation Commission fell over in 1993 and—as Senator McGauran mentioned earlier—after the Garnaut committee recommendations. The initial requirement, that of the repayment of the stockpile debt, was altered when Wool International was able to attempt to enhance the value of the stockpile for the benefit of growers.
Wool International have done a difficult job in difficult circumstances, and I am not overly critical of the role they played in terms of the legislative guidelines that they had to work under. The world market conditions for wool and the strict legislative conditions under which Wool International operated made it difficult for them to function in a method that was sympathetic to growers. I am not generous of their performance either. I can say, though, that I have always found the managing director of Wool International, Bob Richardson, and the chairman, Dick Warburton, to be highly capable, approachable and decent people. I wish them well during the freeze and after the privatisation. In the meantime, I welcome the caretaker role that Wool International will pursue.
It is prudent and in the long-term interests of wool growers that all the core functions of Wool International are continued for the next six months until the privatisation takes place. These include: the retention of the information services; the retention of the inventory management, as there are over one million bales still in the stockpile; the retention of the Treasury function because, as I said, a debt of about $200 million has to be serviced; and retention of the unit-holding register. Wool growers have about 340 million units in Wool International with a net value of around $1.42 at the September valuation. Wool International also needs to retain a minimum appraisal of sales role so that its corporate knowledge remains and knowledge of its buyers and the way it operates is not lost completely and can be used after privatisation. These functions are critical for the privatisation in June 1999 to be successful.
As for the actual privatisation, that is not for this legislation; it is a debate for another time. Clearly, however, a further industry task force or interim board must be appointed shortly to advise of the form of the future liquidation process and the appraisal of current and future offers for the stockpile. The government is addressing these matters with urgency and in cooperation with industry.
The Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee has recommended that all aspects of the proposed sale 
 of Wool International be subject to an inquiry. I think that recommendation has merit.
I desperately hope that the wool market will improve. As I said earlier, a lot of very decent families and communities depend on it. It seems inevitable that eventually things can be got right. Apart from anything else, the world fibre market is increasing in size exponentially and wool is clearly a wonderful natural product. It certainly can service a very important niche market—not as pure wool perhaps but as a blended quality item. In recent times products such as wool plus lycra garments and wool blended jeans have come onto the market. They are wonderful products and, if we can get our advertising right, I am sure that the market will improve.
There are two ways for a market to improve. One is to take a very low price for your product and the other is to promote it well. We have certainly taken a very low price for our product for a very long time. Clearly we need to promote it better, and the processes are being put in place for that to occur.",SENATE,<title>WOOL INTERNATIONAL AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-12-07,"—In terms of the Wool International Amendment Bill 1998 , I would like to say that I do not have any personal interest in the matter. I am not a holder of Wool International equity units, I do not have a private bale stockpile and I do not run sheep. So I am approaching this bill—as is the opposition—on the basis of looking at the evidence ascertained by the committee and the material that has been put before us by responsible representatives of the industry from a number of states, including my own, as well as the Wool Council and ABARE, in terms of their economic analysis.
Senator Sandy Macdonald, in his comments, put a view of Wool International which I would have thought was a responsible one which ought to have been shared by all members of the coalition in their approach to this matter. But I must say that certainly comments in the Australian on 8 September attributed to Senator Crane—the chairman of the legislation committee that has reported to the parliament on this bill—and comments by David Hawker, the chairman of the coalition's 
 wool subcommittee, do not indicate that Wool International is held in high regard by at least part of the coalition. Frankly, Senator Crane's comments astound me. He is reported—and I hope that the report is incorrect—as saying:
. . . WI's actions were an `absolute disgrace', undermining wool prices and hurting embattled wool growers.
`The sooner we can get back into government and sack those bastards, the better,' Senator Crane said.
I would hope that this is not reflective of the government's approach to this matter. If Senator Crane is correctly reported, this appears to be a rather intemperate comment—not a measured approach to what is a very difficult issue on which there is hardly unanimity in the rural sector. It is shooting from the hip, one might say, in terms of the politics of this matter. Indeed, politics seems to be running this matter so far as the coalition policy is concerned and not the welfare of the whole of the industry.
There is a story on page 46 of today's Australian Financial Review which is entitled `Wool Victim of Politics' by Stephen Wyatt. Basically the report says that the prices have gone down again. It finishes with the paragraph:
Many analysts expect wool to re-test its recent five-year lows of 465 because of an absence of demand from key Asian markets. A new AWRAP board can do nothing about this.
The article talks at some length about the sacking of the AWRAP board. But it is interesting that here the independent analysis indicates that the price of wool is likely to fall, irrespective of the legislation that is before this parliament. The headline says a lot about how this government implements policies for the bush. The bill we have before us today is based not on policy but on politics, as I said earlier—the politics of the bush and, as some earlier speakers have said, the politics of One Nation. The background to this bill also says a lot about how the Howard government has treated rural industries since March 1996. It explains why the government has lost the bush and why it has been forced to make short-sighted, ill-considered policy responses to complex problems like the collapse in wool prices.
One of the first actions, if I can go to the history of how this government has approached rural policy, of incoming minister Mr Anderson was to approve the importation of cooked chicken meat from Thailand, Denmark and the United States. That approval would have been signed off if a journalist had not made a call to the minister's office and asked about the extent of consultation with the National Party back bench. The minister then didn't sign off the approval. The Senate investigated the matter and found that the science on which the approval was granted was flawed. The whole process was then redone and the effective regime that now exists was put into place, no thanks to the government but thanks to the Senate and thanks to the industry.
The Australian pork industry was initially ignored. It then had some money thrown at it, designed not so much to address the problems facing the industry as to shut the industry up. There was nothing there to provide short-term assistance to growers. There was nothing there to properly investigate the impact of imports on the domestic market. The government provided some money to identify and grow export markets and it then reluctantly and belatedly added some more money to assist with the processing sector. Finally, it was dragged kicking and screaming by members of its own back bench, the opposition and, I guess, One Nation into an investigation of the impact of imports.
That report has now been released. The Productivity Commission, a body not known for its protectionist views, found that imports had caused serious damage to the domestic industry. It has offered the government a range of policy options, including World Trade Organisation legal options, to deal with the problem. We all await the government's response to that report. Again, we now have before us some appropriate policy options to assist the pork industry, but again no thanks to the government. Thanks again go to the opposition, to the Senate and to the tenacity of the industry.
Our meat export effort into the United States was put in doubt because the then minister pushed too far on privatising meat 
 inspection services, the project 2 package, and the European Union responded in a similar manner. The industry had to run around and tidy up a mess not of its own making. There was a decision, again forced on the then minister, to remove a government subsidy designed to keep meat inspection charges at a reasonable level while AQIS was restructured. The effect was to dramatically increase AQIS charges, some by as much as 300 per cent. Mr Anderson's colleagues had left him with no choice. Again, the government was forced to back down and the minister wore all the flack.
But the manner in which the government, or more specifically the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has handled the issue of the future management arrangements for the wool stockpile beats all of the above hands down. This government came into office with a plan for the Australian wool industry. One of the key elements in the plan—I will quote from the Reviving the Heartland document—was to:
. . . maintain the wool stockpile fixed schedule, ensuring that its management minimises its impact on the market and ensures certainty and market stability by making an early determination of a transparent and credible stockpile management strategy for the post-July 1997 period.
The minister came close to honouring that commitment. After a series of discussions, `roundtables' as they were called, the minister set a course for the industry based on maintaining a managed sell-down of the stockpile. He made that point very clear in a statement released in December last year. Let me quote the first paragraph of the statement:
Federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Anderson, today reasserted the government's commitment to dispose of the stockpile strictly in accordance with existing wool stockpile selling policy.
He said:
""The stockpile policy was developed through the exhaustive Wool Roundtable consultative process carried out last year.""
So the government's policy was right on track at the end of last year. It was also right on track in the form of a submission to cabinet in August this year. The minister had gone through an exhaustive process of industry 
 consultation. The advice he received was the advice the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee received last Friday week, which was that the freeze option was the worst option. The industry view, I must say, was not unanimous. But frankly, those who opposed the freeze option dominated, that is, they were the overwhelming majority.
The President of the Wool Council, Mr Rod Thirkell-Johnston, said that the council had been consulted on the question of the future management of the stockpile by the then minister, Mr Anderson. He said that there were a number of industry meetings in the lead-up to the cabinet meeting. I asked him at the hearing if this was his view and Mr Anderson's view, which is that the sale of the wool from the stockpile should continue. He responded:
Yes. The minister was trying to keep faith with the international community as a result of the round table.
So Mr Thirkell-Johnston said that at a round table in 1996 the government told the international industry there would be no further changes to the sale of wool from the stockpile until it was disposed of completely. I asked him at the hearing if it were his view and the minister's view, prior to the cabinet making the decision to freeze the sale of the stockpile, that such an action would be a breach of faith with the international community. Mr Thirkell-Johnston replied:
We were very concerned that it would be a breach of faith with the international customers and would require very careful handling, if it was enacted, to regain their confidence.
I asked him whether that was the minister's view, and he said that it was.
Ms Lynne Johnston, the Chairman of the Western Wool Growers, Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia, said that that association maintained its opposition to the concept of freezing the stockpile. She said that the PGA opposed it on the basis of economic principles. Ms Johnston told the committee that the PGA had in fact sought an independent analysis from the economic division of Agriculture Western 
 Australia. She said that that analysis had backed their objections. She said:
This analysis showed that there would be a small short-term gain of some 13c . . . . However, the long-term result would be negative as the buyers making their purchasing decisions would be making those decisions based on the knowledge that the wool must come back onto the market.
Secondly, there was no comprehensive plan in place . . . that encompassed the whole industry from growers through to processors as to how it would be unfrozen . . .
So the former minister sought advice from his own department and the government's key economic policy adviser on rural industry, ABARE. I am sure that he received the same advice that the Senate committee received last Friday, which was that the freeze would not generate a recovery in the price of wool. Mr Anderson also received advice from Wool International, the authority actually charged with the responsibility of disposing of the stockpile. Again, the advice would match the evidence given to the committee. The freeze is the worst option from the point of view of returns to unit holders. Dr Richardson, the Chief Executive Officer of Wool International, told the inquiry that the board of Wool International believed the so-called chill option—that is, the sale of sufficient wool to meet Wool International's costs—was the best option. Dr Richardson said that there were discussions with the former minister about alternative options to manage the stockpile and their implications for unit holders in the context of the value maximisation objectives of Wool International. He said that options including a freeze, a chill or maintenance of the status quo had been considered. He said that the analysis undertaken by Wool International found that there were lower net returns to unit holders from a freeze than from the other alternatives.
So what of the impact of the freeze to date, because there is a freeze being undertaken, although the legislation has not yet passed? There was a slight recovery in the price in recent weeks, which freeze supporters are claiming to have been a product of the freeze. But that is not the view of the experts.
Dr Beare told the committee that ABARE was reviewing its forecasts for all commodi 
 ties, the results of which would be released on 15 December. He said that the September forecasts for the eastern market indicator was 560c on a clean basis. He said that that forecast would be reduced somewhat in December. Dr Terence Sheales, ABARE's chief commodity analyst, said:
Economic conditions are having a very major effect on demand for fibres generally and hence on prices.
In response to a question about the recent recovery in wool prices, Dr Sheales said that, while there was not yet any data available, it appears there has been a move to fill orders before the Christmas close-down. He said:
The other thing of note is that prices have slipped a bit in recent days.
Dr Sheales also said:
. . . the only other thing I would say is that we have gone through a period in perhaps the last month of a feeling generally in the world macro-economic environment that there has been some settling of the Asian situation. That may have brought a little more confidence back into the market but, again, that is quite anecdotal information in terms of the effect it may have.
There was no mention from the government's key agricultural economic advisory body of the stockpile freeze as a contributor to better wool prices; that is, ABARE did not say that.
The problem with this decision is more than just a failure to generate a recovery in the price of wool. The freeze means that Wool International no longer has any income but must continue to meet its costs. The costs of storing the stockpile and servicing its debt and its administrative costs all have to be paid. That means that the value of grower equity in the stockpile must decline. Further, a number of growers have borrowed against the value of their equity through a number of private financing facilities. Those funds were lent on the basis of one set of rules, and now those rules are to be changed.
The government's decision to ignore the best available advice and freeze all sales must also create legal difficulties in relation to options available to unit holders to access the value of their holdings. Again, in evidence, Mr Tehan from the VFF told last Friday week's hearing that the impact of the freeze on private sector initiatives appeared to have 
 been disregarded completely by the government. He said:
In September, 1997, Wool International issued certificates of equity to those who paid wool tax on wool sold in the period 1 July 1993 to 30 June 1996.
That allowed a number of private sector initiatives that gave unit holders the ability to access equity locked up in the future distributions of Wool International.
Producers accessed these services on the basis that there was a clear, legislated disposal policy for Wool International leading to a legislated final date for the stockpile disposal at the end of 2000. Mr Tehan said:
In correspondence to a unit holder who has used the Elders Wool Stockpile Equity Advance, Elders stated:
`Should the stockpile not be finally sold and settled by 31 December 2000, Elders reserves the right of clearance from you at the expiration of a three-month notice period.'
Mr Tehan estimated that there was $40 million so far led by financing facilities offered by Elders Rural Finance securitisation facility, Wesfarmers Dalgety loan facility and Macquarie Bank Wool International equity trading facility. Dr Richardson from Wool International told the committee that the unit holders' units entitled them to participate in a surplus once the debt has been removed and the stockpile sold. He said:
If the Commonwealth is to withdraw that right and replace it with something else without just compensation, then . . . there are legal problems.
He also said that, if the government were to withdraw a unit which entitled unit holders to a share in a surplus and replace it with a share which entitled them to participate in a dividend, there would be a question as to whether these two things were equivalent.
This bill also contains amendments to the Wool International Act to allow Wool International to support the process of the privatisation of the stockpile and to meet costs associated with that process. There was general support from the industry for that. We heard some interesting evidence from Mr Mike Hutchinson, the Chief Executive of the Office of Asset Sales. What was clear from Mr Hutchinson was that the timetable for the 
 presentation of legislation to the Senate for the privatisation was very tight. He said that it needed to be passed by May to allow the process to be completed by the end of the financial year. However, he also indicated that we might not have that legislation until as late as March.
If that is the case—or even if we get it in February—extreme pressure is going to be placed on the Senate, and the industry, to assess the legislation and deal with it in the timetable which would allow the processing of this bill in time for the privatisation or demutualisation to take effect by 30 June. I point out that there is no provision for the freeze proposed in this legislation to continue past 30 June. So there are some fundamental problems to be addressed in relation to this matter.
I was quite interested in Senator Woodley's comments—bearing in mind that it was Senator Woodley who first referred the clauses of this bill to a committee for inquiry—indicating that he would support the government's position. I understand Senator Woodley to have said at the hearing that he had some economic analysis which supports that position, but we have not seen it as yet. The only analysis that he has relied upon today is the analysis of the Australian Wool Growers Association. I point out that that analysis flies in the face of the view of ABARE, the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia, the Wool Council, the New South Wales Farmers Association, the Victorian Farmers Federation, the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association and, in his own state, the United Graziers Association of Queensland.
In the last two weeks, the evidence is that 75,000 bales from the private stockpile have gone into the market to replace the 90,000 bales from the Wool International stockpile. We will be dealing with amendments which propose the chill option. I know I have no time left now but I will develop that argument further at another time.",SENATE,<title>WOOL INTERNATIONAL AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,1998-12-07,"—I too would like to make some brief comments about this legislation. One cannot help but make a quick comment on the 
 statements made by the previous speaker, Senator O'Brien. In terms of the current situation facing the wool industry, and the necessity for quick and decisive action, it was a very sad, distorted contribution.
To see what we are dealing with in this phase, one has to look at a bit of history—that is, the 4.8 million bales and the $2.8 billion debt. The wool industry has done a remarkable job to get that down to just over one million bales and a debt to $180 million. One would think, listening to the previous contribution, that we have been locked in concrete for the last eight years. In fact, one of the problems with this—the one which brought the crisis on in the first place—was the activities of the former minister, John Kerin, when he made certain statements overseas that things were immutable, that they were locked in stone and would not change. But, of course, they did change. That did a lot of damage to the wool industry in terms of those commitments that were given.
In 1990, the wool industry was in real trouble—in fact, it was virtually bankrupt. There had to be a debt reduction schedule. That went well for about 18 months and then it failed. We then had a situation where for 18 months the industry and the Labor government argued. They appointed Garnaut to make a report but took 18 months to act. In 1993, following the Garnaut report, we went into the fixed schedule release. Once again, history shows that that worked reasonably well for 18 months and then it failed. What did we have? We had no activity from that side until we got into government, and then we brought in the flexible schedule. Once again, that worked very well until December last year and then it failed. Why did it fail? It failed because of the Asian meltdown; it collapsed. We saw wool go into an absolute free fall. In seven months we saw $200 million wiped off the value of the Wool International stockpile. We saw well in excess of $180 million wiped off the grower stockpile. We saw a huge reduction in the prices being paid to growers.
This charge that we should let that continue—that we should let the free fall continue, that we should let the wool industry and the people around it collapse—is one of 
 the most irresponsible comments that I have heard perpetuated about an industry situation. The stockpile is an artificial component of the market. It is wool that was grown in the 1980s when the reserve price failed. In fact, we would have driven the industry into the ground if we had allowed that to continue.
It is a very simple equation: the reason that it worked well from 1996, when the flexible schedule came in and we came into government, until December last year is that supply and demand were somewhere in balance. All of a sudden, 100 million kilos of demand went. We had, in round figures, 95 million kilos of excess production coming onto the market. That is virtually wool that was coming out of the Wool International stockpile. Anyone who can add up can work out very quickly under the current arrangements that, by the end of 2000 or somewhere in that vicinity—I cannot be precise about it—supply and demand are going to come back roughly into balance.	We have seen growers reduce their production in this period from somewhere close to one thousand million kilos—in fact, production went from over one thousand million kilos in one year—back to about 620 million kilos. The wool coming off the grower stockpile makes up the difference with what demand is currently. It is a fairly simple equation.
I do not know how you convince people, but it just cannot be a coincidence, as was claimed at our hearings, that on the very day that the first freeze was put in place economic circumstances changed and the price of wool started to go up and on the very day that the freeze was taken off economic circumstances went back to exactly the same as they were pre-freeze and the price of wool started to fall again. We lost another 150c from the price of wool and, of course, that wiped more value off the stockpile.
There are many angles or things you can talk about in terms of this and I just briefly mention the importance of the privatisation process. It is interesting to see that a number of additional offers are now starting to come onto the table from people who are interested in this privatisation process. Of course there is the option under Corporations Law for the 
 industry itself, if  they so desire, to operate and sell on a commercial basis. In terms of this current position, I am confident that we are going to see the gradual improvement and consolidation of the wool industry.
When people say it is only going to rise this much or it is going to rise that much, we see confidence coming back into the industry. We see back in the marketplace those buyers who have not bought other than stockpile wool for quite a number of years. I believe, as I mentioned earlier, we will see supply and demand come back into balance somewhere in 14 to 18 months' time. In the last three weeks of sales, we saw 75,000 additional bales come out of the growers' stockpile which already is starting to be utilised and will be utilised until that balance comes back into place. And when the stockpile wool is utilised—whether it is processed or not—that will give the industry itself time to start rebuilding its flocks and to build up its position to meet world demand.
Once again, I am confident from the work that I have seen done in the medium and longer term—and I can quote ABARE, I can quote the WA agriculture department or I can quote some of the other work that has been shown to me by exporters—that Australia will return to a place where it is supplying in the order of 750 to 820 million kilos per annum to the world market.
There are many things that can be said about this. I certainly believe that it is the correct decision. The government had to act in the interests of wool growers because the market was being pulled down at a very rapid rate because world economic circumstances changed very dramatically—as they did back in 1993 and as they did, once again, between 1993 and 1996. Had the government then had the courage to take some decisive action, we would not have seen the industry collapse to the point that it has.
With those comments, I look forward to the passage of this legislation very much. In my closing remarks, I must declare an interest in this particular subject before us because I am a member of a family farming partnership that produces and sells wool.",SENATE,<title>WOOL INTERNATIONAL AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,1998-12-07,"—I do not have to declare an interest, other than the fact that I wear woollen clothes from time to time. I think a few comments need to be made in respect of this legislation. Firstly, I think it is a bit rich that members of the government come in here and tell us that they were not spooked by One Nation. I had government members telling me that the Senate would definitely come back this year. I even had government members telling me as late as the last week in August, `No, the election cannot be for a while yet because we have to get the freeze through.'
I think the first point that needs to be made is that it is not necessarily the best public policy to proceed to bring in the freeze when Pauline Hanson is on the rampage out there with a head of steam up and there is panic in the government ranks. As I understand it, this is a controversial issue; it is certainly controversial amongst a lot of the growers. If I am wrong about that, I am sure the parliamentary secretary will tell me so later.
—I will.
—She is nodding her head, but the evidence that I have heard here today in this debate is that there is considerable discussion about whether or not the freeze is a good idea. I will say a couple of other things. Firstly, we heard from Senator McGauran here today how all of this was our fault. I am used to that around here. It seems that we get blamed for everything from the weather all the way down. I asked Senator McGauran if he was wearing woollen knickers, and I did not get much response to that. But that is not actually as flippant a question as it seems because in fact today a large number of people have chosen from the smorgasbord of fabrics out there to wear things other than wool. Indeed, one of the problems the wool industry has had over a number of years has been that this smorgasbord of alternative fabrics has found its way into all the sorts of traditional areas that wool took for granted even only a few years ago.
I think that the schemes that have been in place to try to somehow or other rebalance the supply and demand equation that Senator Crane talked about have been interesting 
 schemes that—according to his analyses, and I have no reason to dispute them—have generally had about 18 months of life in each one. I remember in particular the desire to try to keep the floor price going. In fact, it failed because it was too high. It failed not because a floor price scheme will never work; it failed because the market was not going to pay that price for the product. Then a new floor price was debated by the agrarian socialists who said, `The problem is that the floor price is too high.' You do not need much of an IQ to realise that. In the meantime, a whole series of bales of wool were being stockpiled around the country, and that is posing a major problem.
What then happened of course was that various schemes were put in place. I do not want to take the time of the Senate today—or, for that matter, that of other senators—to go over Senator Crane's history of how this problem was dealt with. But, at the end of the day—and, again, the parliamentary secretary can allay my fears—I cannot help but think that when you have got over one million bales in an official stockpile that is frozen and I am told by Senator O'Brien, who is more knowledgeable on these things than I am, that there is—
Senator Troeth interjecting—
—He probably is—you can take me on if you want to, Parliamentary Secretary. I am more than able to look after myself on these things. But, at the end of the day, Senator O'Brien tells me there are 1.1 million bales out there in private hands. All in all that adds up to two million bales at least of product that is hanging over the market. Price recovery, I hope, is going to be a feature of the late 1990s. I am hoping that, in the next couple of years, wool growers will be able to get a decent price and a decent return for their product, but I do not know that this legislation is really going to help that because it puts a large question mark over where things are going to go.
There is no doubt that anyone buying serious amounts of wool will have to take on board what is going to happen with the stockpile. It is now frozen. There is no longer the regulated sale of this commodity over a 
 lengthy period of time. It is going to hang there with the question: what will exactly happen with this? That is probably as far as government can go on this issue. The wool industry itself will have to seriously look at marketing and will have to seriously look at alternative uses for its product, as indeed other fabrics and other products that have come in and taken wool's share of the market have done. Over the last 10 and 15 years in particular other fabrics are being more widely worn in all parts of the world and wool's actual market share has shrunk considerably over this time in a whole range of different ways. The wool industry is going to have to look at some of the more interesting alternatives for the sale of its product.
I leave my remarks here tonight with a question mark over what a total freeze will tell the wool buying community out there. What is going to be their reaction to this? I do not know whether or not we will see a hardening of wool prices as a result of this legislation going through. We may. But I would think that, at the end of the day, this one will probably have less than an 18-month expected Senator Crane life. I suspect this one may last for a short while, but ultimately wool is a commodity. It is bought and sold and, if there is massive oversupply or potential oversupply because of a large amount of wool that could go on the market from private growers irrespective of this legislation, then the price, I suspect, will remain soft.
I am not sure which way the Asian crisis is going. I hope the economic reports that are coming in telling us that things have bottomed out there are correct, because this is very important not only for wool but for all of our commodities, for our trade in general. Indeed, we had a positive trade balance with many societies until the Asian crisis came along. Now we no longer have that positive trade balance. There are many societies now—and Malaysia is one—from which we are importing much more than we are exporting to them. One would hope that balance in the trade will come back. That is essential.
I am not so sure that this legislation is going to do much for that. I am not so sure it is really going to steady that price up over the 
 next so many years. I suspect that is probably why a number of growers have taken the same view. It may well be that all the growers are unanimous on this and that the Senate has been told a bunch of—
—Porkies.
—Not porkies, Senator Forshaw. It has been told some misconceptions. It may well be the case that there are some confused growers out there giving different signals. But, at the end of the day, it would appear that this is more a measure in panic. This measure may achieve the goal, but I doubt it. My suspicion is that it will soon fail, even if it succeeds in the short run.",SENATE,<title>WOOL INTERNATIONAL AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1998-12-07,"—in reply—I thank honourable senators for their contribution to the debate on the Wool International Amendment Bill 1998 . I will leave aside Senator Quirke's remarks for the moment. They were a fascinating excursion into history and fashion, but I suspect they did not tell us a lot that we did not already know. The purpose of this bill, as has been remarked, will free sales from the Wool International stockpile and allow Wool International to support and commit funds to a process of privatisation.
Before I go on with the government's comments on the reasons for us doing this, I would like to make a few comments on what opposition senators have said. I agree with them that wool industry support for the freeze is mixed, but it is certainly not the almost total blanket opposition to the wool freeze that they have suggested. Some of the major organisations were initially opposed, such as the Wool Council of Australia, some of the state farmer organisations, the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia, and a number of brokers and processors. But there were also some very strong sources of support—the Australian Stud Merino Breeders Association, the Western Australian Farmers Federation, the South Australian Farmers Federation, the Australian Wool Growers Association, and again some processors and brokers.  
The Senate may be interested to know that, in the month following the announcement of the freeze, the ministerial office received, from mainly growers: 383 letters in favour of the freeze, including 144 also in favour of privatisation; 54 against the freeze; and 45 undecided. I point out to those opposite that many wool growers in my experience are not members of grower organisations. They make up their own minds on these issues. We at least are listening to the grassroots on this decision, unlike the Labor Party.
It may also have escaped the attention of Senator Murphy and Senator West that, at the Senate hearing, the Wool Council and the PGA withdrew their opposition to the freeze, urging the government to move on with privatisation and not to revisit the freeze decision. Certainly my electorate office in Melbourne received phone calls on this issue, and I would have to say that they were split fifty-fifty as far as being for and against the freeze decision. I believe there has been strong grassroots support for this decision. The government needed to take decisive action, and decisive action has been taken.
With regard to Senator Murphy's points about the constraints of government legislation, Wool International has, I believe, managed the sale of the stockpile as best it could. I agree with Senator Murphy that the constraints of legislation, as Wool International and its executive director, Dr Bob Richardson, have consistently stated, have made the job more difficult. That is exactly what this bill is removing. It is allowing the privatisation of the stockpile, eventually free of statutory constraints. It is laying the groundwork for that. Senator Murphy asked, `What will be the position in six to 12 months time?' If this bill gets through the Senate, as I sincerely hope it does, the position in six to 12 months time will be that growers will be able to make their own decision as to what they would like to do with the stockpile and the way in which they would like to organise their own industry.
Senator O'Brien commented on the coalition government's reaction to primary industry and agriculture since we won office in 1996. Our actions consistently have shown that we take a long view of primary industry. 
 We have moved to give control of the wheat industry back to wheat growers. We have moved to give control of the meat industry back to processors and producers. We make the industry responsible for its own affairs. That is exactly what we will eventually do with the wool industry, and this bill before us today is the first stage in that.
The freeze, as is proposed by the government, prevents Wool International from entering into contracts for the sale of stockpile wool in the period to 30 June 1999. It is also prevented from entering into forward contracts for the period beyond the freeze. This bill does not prevent Wool International from honouring existing contracts. Wool International can and will deliver any wool contracted for sale before the suspension of sales on 15 October 1999.
The freeze of the stockpile has many benefits. It assists wool growers by shifting all the demand to the fresh wool market and growers have an opportunity to increase their income by releasing wool from privately held stocks as well as this year's clip. I know, as well as the opposition knows, that there is a great deal of wool stored in wool sheds and stored in a private holding capacity. This bill will allow those growers who have taken that commercial decision to release that wool onto the commercial market. This bill holds real benefits for growers, and they are not just based on political outcomes. It allows growers a breathing space before privatisation and, with regard to the reduction of the supply that this bill will bring about, there will be less impact on the marketplace. I would advise the Senate to disregard Senator O'Brien's wild statements on prices that have been up or down since the announcement of the freeze.
This bill, it is important to point out, does not privatise Wool International, nor does it specify any particular form of privatisation. It simply allows Wool International to support and commit funds to the privatisation process, and in the new year the government will be introducing legislation to implement that privatisation. The new private entity, whatever it is, will commence operations from 1 July 1999. In the meantime, the government is developing details of that privatisation.
The concept of it is to convert wool growers' equity in Wool International into equity, perhaps in the form of shares, in a new entity established under the Corporations Law—that is, a demutualisation. It will put ownership and control of the wool stockpile in the hands of the wool growers. It will remove government involvement from management of the stockpile, just as we have already done through bills that we have passed with regard to the meat and wheat industries.
The process of demutualisation will be led by the Office of Asset Sales and IT Outsourcing within the Finance and Administration portfolio. That office will work jointly with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. There will obviously be high quality business and legal advisers to develop that proposal, which will be the most efficient and cost effective of those available. But it will also be one that protects the interests of equity holders, staff and other stakeholders as much as possible.
We are considering mechanisms for industry to prepare for the privatisation, including through the proposed NFF Wool Industry Advisory Committee. We propose to do this by establishing an interim advisory board which will, I would like to assure Senator Margetts, consult with wool industry representatives and the aforementioned advisers. It will also allow industry to consider any proposals for the future of the new Wool International entity by groups such as the Australian Wool Growers Group and, more recently, by other industry proponents, and it will develop a draft business plan for the proposed privatised entity. Any decision on the business plan will be for the board of the newly privatised entity and its shareholders after 1 July 1999, not the interim advisory board and not the government. All of these decisions will be made by the newly privatised entity.
As I said, we intend to introduce legislation in the new year to implement the preferred privatisation option, and that will, of course, be subject to normal parliamentary scrutiny. This decision will, I believe, end the damaging debate within the industry over stockpile 
 issues, and I would agree with all senators who have said that the past 10 years have probably been quite damaging for the wool industry. But decisive intervention or decisive action is needed now, and it will be the last intervention by the government.
The future roles of the stockpile of the industry will be based on commercial decisions in the interests of the equity holders—that is, the shareholders—with no Commonwealth involvement. As I said, we take a long-term view of industry rather than a short-term view, and we have taken the decision to hand primary industry over to its stakeholders.
Many comments were made during the debate about the reason for the low wool prices during the last 10 years. There are many reasons for this, as senators have commented. There has been low demand in world markets. There has been low productivity in wool production. There has been a lack of strong industry leadership, and I think some of the fragmented views coming from the industry as a whole during this debate would lead senators to agree with this. But there is also the overall need to provide a high quality fibre that meets the needs of its customers. That is the only way in which we are going to sell more wool, which would achieve a rise in prices which would no doubt make every wool grower in Australia very happy.
Let us get on with this. I am gratified to see that Senator Margetts acknowledged that, in spite of the disparate views of industry, in spite of some of the issues that have been put forward in the debate, we basically need to get on with it. The views on the release of wool from the stockpile range from zero release to 15,000 bales per quarter. I think it is fair to say that everyone who has contributed to this debate, bar some opposition senators, are looking to the future of the wool industry. This bill is a move in the right direction. I thank honourable senators for their contribution.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>WOOL INTERNATIONAL AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-12-07,"—The Payment Processing Legislation Amendment (Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements) Bill 1998  is a complex bill which, in essence, is designed to introduce three significant changes to the social security system. The bill proposes to, firstly, shift the payment system for pensions and allowances away from the payday based payment of the `pension Thursday' system to fortnightly payment in arrears; secondly, allow for individually chosen paydays for pensions; and, thirdly, reduce from 14 days to seven days the notification period for changes in circumstances which affect entitlements.
The opposition supports the first two measures but has very serious concerns with the third proposition. It will oppose the reduced notification period and seek to move amendments to maintain the 14-day notification period.	The first measure, the change to the administrative procedure for payment of pensions and family allowances by moving away from the single `pension Thursday' system to fortnightly payments in arrears, is, we think, a constructive proposal. It will bring pensions and family allowances into line with other allowances so that they will generally be paid fortnightly and in arrears. We understand, from the government's explanatory memorandum, that this will produce some savings, and it will mean that pension paydays might be spread throughout the week rather than all being on the same `pension Thursday'. Obviously this will increase flexibility and, hopefully, reduce the administrative problems associated with the more rigid structure that is currently in place.
The second measure provides that pensioners and family allowance recipients can choose their paydays, although new and existing customers will be encouraged to choose days other than the traditional Thursdays. Obviously, this will spread payments throughout the week which, we understand, will reduce processing times and allow for greater flexibility. Because all pensions are now paid on the same day, the lead-up time to process these 2½ million payments is some six days. When a person notifies Centrelink of a change in circumstances resulting in a 
 decrease in entitlement, and does so within the time allowed, it may nevertheless be too late to alter their entitlement for that fortnight if the processing of their payment is already under way.
If pension payments are spread across the fortnight, the lead-up time to process each day's payment will be much shorter and advice of changes in circumstances is more likely to be taken into account in determining entitlement for the fortnight in question. We understand that this also provides savings to the government, but we are also supporting that aspect of the measure as being an improvement in the system generally.
Where the opposition differs from the government in terms of this bill is on the government's proposal to reduce the notification period for changes in circumstances by pensioner recipients from the current general 14-day provision to a provision of seven days. We are yet to be convinced of a rationale to support such a change to a shorter period. I know that during the committee inquiry into this bill the Department of Social Security argued that the old 14-day notification period had been based on the use of mail, and that the 14 days had been deemed originally to be reasonable to allow a transfer and processing of mail notification. I think now it is argued that, because of improved technology and the very much phone based system that is often used by Centrelink clients, a shorter period could be implemented.
We think, though, that there are real problems with a shorter notification period. I know that it does apply with a number of other pension payments. But we are most concerned that the shorter period may have a very deleterious effect on a number of recipients because, as senators would be aware, failure by a recipient to notify can result in them being in breach and, ultimately, they could be fined or have a loss of entitlement in serious cases. We do not see any justification at this stage in supporting a move to the shorter period. People on pensions do not have large financial reserves, and we think it is important that the system does not penalise them unfairly, does not cause them undue hardship because of what we think would be 
 too short a period in which they have the right to notify of a change in circumstance.
We are particularly concerned at this time because of the context in which we are having this debate—the context of the ongoing problems with Centrelink. I think the government's case would be far more convincing if the Senate were assured that all pension recipients would have no difficulty in contacting Centrelink, that notifications were processed quickly and that the Centrelink organisation was responsive to their needs and their notification.
But, of course, the history of Centrelink in recent times is very different from that. The problems with Centrelink have been documented and very graphically characterised for us in the Ombudsman's report. We had the situation earlier this year where enormous phone delays were occurring, where people basically could not get through on the telephone to Centrelink to notify it of a change of circumstance. Centrelink encourages people to use the phone, to contact the organisation by that means rather than just fronting up to its office. In the July-August period this year, Centrelink had 900,000 calls of which it could only answer 90,000.
With Centrelink, you have an organisation struggling to cope with the demand of inquiries from recipients. The Ombudsman's report detailed the fact that, at various stages, Centrelink is only answering a third of the calls made to it. So we have an organisation that is struggling to answer two-thirds of the calls being made to it; and we have a government saying that we can have a shorter notification period. People are being required to notify Centrelink of changes to their circumstances within seven days rather than 14. The developments are clearly at odds.
If Centrelink were proving to be an organisation that was adequately resourced, that was coping well with the demands placed on it, then perhaps one could look at this measure differently. But, from the Labor opposition's point of view—with the history of Centrelink, the history of the underresourcing of that organisation, the very real issues people have in contacting Centrelink and getting service, in working through their problems of notifica 
 tion and other queries—to reduce the notification period at this stage could be a very harsh measure and could unduly deprive people of entitlements through no fault of their own.
The Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation put their concerns to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry earlier this year. We know also that Centrelink has been struggling again more recently with the requirement to have `blockout days' where officers have not been taking appointments because they have been using those days to deal with the backlog of work.
We have had the recent announcement by the government that the efficiency dividend that they have applied to Centrelink will result in 5,000 more jobs going from Centrelink. Five thousand of the 24,000 jobs currently at Centrelink will be cut, therefore their potential to service their client base is reducing all the time.
The pressures on Centrelink are increasing as the government provides more and more work for that organisation to deal with. We just do not think they currently are coping adequately. This is not a criticism of the staff; it is just the reality that they have not got the resources allocated to meet the tasks set for them by government. We also have Centrelink trying to overcome this problem by an increasing reliance on technology, which of course is not always favoured by some of the client groups of Centrelink as they are often unfamiliar with or unhappy with dealing with that sort of technology.
So we have got a whole range of issues occurring inside Centrelink that go directly to their ability to service their client base. It just seems to us that, in that context, it is totally inappropriate to be saying to the client base, `You risk being breached, you risk having financial penalties put on you if you fail to notify us of a change of circumstances within seven days,' when the system is clearly incapable of servicing that client base and meeting that seven-day deadline in all circumstances. So, for those reasons in particular, we think the move from 14 to seven days is particularly inappropriate at this stage. We may well have taken that view anyway, but 
 it certainly reinforces our view that now is not the time to reduce the notification period.
I notice also that this measure is due to commence on 1 July. July is not a terribly good time for Centrelink from what we have seen in the last year or so. I gather there are child-care funding changes also proposed for the start of the financial year. We just think that Centrelink will be under enormous pressure at that time of the year, and we suspect we might have problems similar to the disaster that was the introduction of the youth allowance last year, where so many clients of Centrelink could not get proper service.
Those contextual matters lead us to the position that we want to see the 14-day notification retained. I think the government has yet to make a convincing case for moving from the 14-day to the seven-day notification period anyway. In the absence of that case being put, I think we would have adopted a position of opposition to the reduction in notification, but in the current context I think it is even more important.
In conclusion, the opposition supports the bill because we recognise that running costs may indeed be reduced without harm to Centrelink clients by moving away from the overload of administration associated with pension Thursday. We support the rationalisation of payment cycles, but we are convinced that halving the notification period would cause hardship to clients, particularly given that the government has deprived Centrelink of the resources necessary to deliver income support fairly and efficiently within the current 14-day regime. In committee, we will seek the Senate's support to remove those provisions of the bill that would reduce the notification period from 14 to seven days.",SENATE,<title>PAYMENT PROCESSING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-12-07,"—The Payment Processing Legislation Amendment (Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements) Bill 1998  before us tonight will make a number of changes to the way in which social security payments are made. At the moment, some social security payments, such as Newstart, are calculated over a two-week period. That is, if a person is qualified for that payment for the whole of that two-week period, then they receive a full payment, 
 but if they are only qualified for one of those weeks, they only receive half of the regular period payment. These types of payments are known as `period based payments'.
While this system applies for some social security payments, other payments such as age pensions and family allowances are made under a different system altogether. Under that system, a person only needs to be qualified for their payment on one day in the fortnight to receive a full payment. For example, if a person's payment day is Thursday, it does not matter if that person qualified for the payment a fortnight ago or on the Tuesday two days prior, they still receive a full payment. Those types of payments are known as `payday based payments'.
This legislation we are debating at the moment is seeking to do away with these payday based payments and have all payments made under the period based system, using the rationale that it will simplify the system—something the Democrats always are keen to see—and introduce consistency into the way in which welfare payments are made. It will also more closely match the level of payments received with a person's period of eligibility. The Democrats are strongly in favour of any moves to simplify the social security system. We do not have any significant objections to the government's proposal. As such, we will be supporting schedule 1 of this bill.
This change will allow pensioners to receive their payment on a day of their choice, rather than having to receive it on a so-called pension Thursday. I do not know how many senators have been into their local bank on pension Thursday, but if they had they would realise that this is by far the busiest day of the fortnight for many bank branches. And that is not surprising when we see in the explanatory memorandum for this bill that there are around 2½ million pension payments made every second Thursday. I have no doubt that the banks would see a spreading of pension payment days as highly desirable. I am also sure that there will be a certain number of people who will welcome the opportunity to be able to choose, for whatever reason, to receive their pension on a different day.
Having said that, though, I think we do need to take note of the issues which were raised by the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation in their submission to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry. The APSF pointed out that in communities throughout Australia there can be a range of activities organised to coincide with pension Thursdays. For example, some local authorities provide community buses to collect older people from their homes and take them to the banks to collect their pension and then take them on to the shops and supermarkets to do their shopping. Also, some older persons' social groups base their activities around pension day. These are issues which can easily be overlooked in the development of a policy change like this one, but these are issues which are directly relevant to the way in which many older people live their lives.
As the APSF pointed out, these activities often provide avenues of friendship and social contact for isolated older people. Because of this, and because of other arrangements people may have made around their pension payday, I am sure a large number of people—at least for the first few years of their new arrangements—will continue to choose to receive their pension on the current pension Thursday. As such, the Democrats strongly support the call of the APSF that people should not be placed under any compulsion whatsoever now or in the future to move to a different pension payment day.
Whilst there may be administrative benefits for the government and the banks to have people's pension days spread evenly across the fortnight, the Democrats believe that the principle of choice that underlies this change must be retained across the board and people must be free to choose their day of payment, including retaining their existing one. At this stage, as far as I am aware, the government has not indicated any desire to require people to accept certain payment days, so I would simply put the Democrats' concern on the record for any future changes that might be considered.
Before moving on to other changes in this bill, I think it is appropriate to take the 
 opportunity to highlight again the valuable role that the APSF played in the inquiry into this legislation, their submission to that inquiry and their continuing role as advocates for older people. The federation is surviving in the face of very harsh and, in the Democrats' view, unjustified cuts to their funding by this government. These cuts came about following the APSF's criticism of the government's aged care reforms. The APSF is now surviving primarily due to the great dedication of those who work for it. I would again put on the record the Democrats' very strong desire to see the government reconsider the APSF's funding situation because they clearly do play a very important role in providing advice and information to all political parties, including the government, about issues affecting older people.
Turning to schedule 3 of the bill, the primary change contained within this schedule is that it will reduce the period in which people must report changes in their circumstances to Centrelink from 14 days to just seven days. I note some circulated amendments to be moved on behalf of the government which appear to be reversing that situation to a large extent. I look forward to the parliamentary secretary's clarification of that. That seems like an improvement which goes a fair way to meeting the concerns that the Democrats expressed in our minority report to the community affairs committee and that Senator Evans outlined in his speech.
At the moment, if a person notifies Centrelink of changed circumstances which gives them an increased payment, they only receive that increase from the date of notification. Under this bill as it stands, Centrelink will backdate that increased payment to the date of the event which brought about the increase. That is actually quite positive, although if I read the government's amendments correctly that will be changed, but I will wait until the committee stage for the parliamentary secretary to clarify that.
The reduction in notification limits from 14 days to seven days has attracted criticism. The APSF, in addressing this part of the legislation, stated its opposition to this part of the legislation, as has the Welfare Rights Centre 
 in Sydney. The principal criticism is that it places too onerous a requirement on pensioners and families to notify Centrelink of their changed circumstances. This is particularly so given the ongoing difficulties people have in actually getting through to Centrelink on the phone.
I think it is worth raising this issue again, because it is such a fundamental one. I am sure any senators who have contact with members of the public who try to have dealings with Centrelink, which I imagine is just about all of us, will agree that it is one of the issues of greatest frustration, and one that, to be fair, has been an issue of frustration for such a long time, going back to the time when Labor was in office as well as when the coalition gained power. It has been an ongoing source of great irritation and annoyance to a huge number of people. It really is time something concrete and significant was done about it. Reducing staff is hardly the best way of addressing that.
I wish to read from a letter to the editor in the Sydney Morning Herald on 24 November from a Belinda Carson of Pymble, who wrote of her experience. She had been on the phone for 30 minutes trying to dial the Centrelink office. She had received a letter from Centrelink, asking her to get in touch within 14 days. She promptly reached for the phone to dial the number listed on the top of the page. She hit the redial button over and over within the space of half an hour. She could not even get through to be put on hold—just an engaged signal for half an hour. If that is the situation which is still facing people in Sydney, let alone in regional areas, just a couple of weeks ago, then clearly it is a problem that has not been addressed. Whilst that is the case, then it is clearly inappropriate to reduce any further the amount of time that people have to notify changes in their circumstances.
It is also worth highlighting the huge range of reasons that people have to give for changes in their circumstances. Whilst all of us in whatever role and responsibilities we have in life try to make sure we read all the fine print and all the details of every form that gets sent—forms can have a whole page of reasons 
 why one needs to notify of a change in circumstances—it often takes people a little while to realise that they need to notify Centrelink about a particular change in their circumstances. If they run into the problem of not being able to get through, it is not surprising that often people have trouble meeting that deadline. I think it is a great myth to suggest that people on income support payments of whatever sort may have nothing better to do than to sit around all day and try to get through on the phone. Most of them live lives just as busy as any other people in the community.
Not long ago, following the introduction of the common youth allowance, we saw media reports of 90 per cent of calls to Centrelink not being answered. A proportion of these calls would obviously be repeat calls by the same person. Again, it is important to recognise some of the efforts Centrelink has taken to address this problem. But it does remain the case that it is very difficult for people to get through on the phone, and the telephone is the most commonly used means of informing Centrelink of changed circumstances. It is also worth noting the recent report of the Ombudsman in which the Ombudsman said:
At certain times of the day Centrelink's teleservice centres cannot cope with the level of inquiries. At peak times, even though the teleservice centres have a call queuing system, the caller gets a busy signal because the queues are already full.
So there are ongoing problems with the teleservice centres. The Democrats have grave reservations about the prospects of those problems being rectified in light of the many thousands of jobs that Centrelink is planning to shed over the next few years. Even putting those significant telephone contact problems to one side, the Democrats still believe that seven days may not be a sufficient period in which to require pensioners and families to contact Centrelink.
It is probably worth reminding the Senate that this chamber, including I believe the government senators, accepted that seven days was insufficient time for notification when we debated the common youth allowance legislation last year. Originally a seven-day notification period was proposed for that payment, but the Senate supported an amendment 
 moved by my colleague Senator Stott Despoja to increase that to 14 days. As we heard via Senator Stott Despoja in question time in this place last week, there are huge problems even under that system in terms of the number of young people that will potentially have their payments cut off due to not getting forms back in in the appropriate length of time.
 The only other comment I would make on this schedule is that, while the government wants to force people to inform Centrelink of any changes within one week, Centrelink has a full six weeks before it needs to act on that information. As a result of a government amendment some time back, Centrelink can take up to six weeks to act, safe in the knowledge that any overpayments it might make can be recovered as a debt. This applies where people have acted in good faith and have met the requirements for notifying Centrelink. Some of these overpayments are then able to be portrayed as fraud and used as justification for a further reduction in social security support.
That is an unfortunate side effect of some of the public campaigns that have been run on the quite justifiable government attempts to ensure people are receiving their accurate and appropriate payments. That is not something the Democrats have a problem with, but we do have a problem with some of the public interpretation of the information that comes out of those data-matching exercises. In this day of so-called reciprocal obligations the onus to act on new information seems to fall only on individuals, with no corresponding onus—or a much reduced onus—being placed on the department to act quickly on that information. As with many other measures in this area often dressed up under that reciprocal obligation tag, it seems fairly close to being a one-way street.
Just briefly, I would signal that during the committee stage of the debate on this bill I will be taking the opportunity to again request the Senate to reconsider the continuing operation of the two-year wait for newly arrived migrants in relation to the special benefit. I will go into that in not too much detail during the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>PAYMENT PROCESSING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1998-12-07,"—I thank Senator Evans and Senator Bartlett for their contributions. The Payment Processing Legislation Amendment (Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements) Bill 1998  contains two major provisions: proposals to move all social security and veterans' affairs payments to an arrears basis so that people receive their exact entitlement, and proposals to amend the date of effect provisions to give a seven-day notification period for changes in payments, events, et cetera. I have noted the comments that honourable senators have made, and the Minister for Family and Community Services was aware of the comments in the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee report. The government will be agreeing to accept the 14-day notification period but without beneficial backdating. We can discuss that further as we get into the committee stage.
 The payment in arrears proposals will correct present problems which result in some customers receiving too much and others receiving nothing at all. Customers will be paid for each and every day to which they are entitled—no more and no less. Currently, for example, a person who turns 65 the day before a pension payday gets a full pension payment, yet a person who turns 65 the day after the payday has to wait a full fortnight to receive payment.
 On the date of effect provisions, customers will generally have a standard seven-day period to notify of changes in circumstances for the first time. Customers entitled to increases in their rate because of a change will be able to receive arrears, provided they notify Centrelink within the 14-day period when we have the amendments, seven-day period under the bill as it stands. Currently, increases only apply from the date of notification.
 I want to reply to Senator Bartlett's comment about the difficulties of people contacting Centrelink. Whenever one has a telephone service, there will always be periods of peak pressure on those services. I have been advised that it is easier to get through in the 
 more off-peak times. If we move to the 14-day notification, it gives people greater opportunity if they cannot get through in a peak period. There are also other methods of notifying the department, through mail or by dropping in the form.
 Senator Bartlett highlighted the issue of pension day in particular for older pensioners. I say, `Halleluja, this bill is going through.' During the consultations for the International Year of Older Persons, one of the issues that came up over and over again was that older people saw themselves as being discriminated against and as being stigmatised. One of the very things that stigmatises people on age pensions is having to line up at the bank on pension day. Many people have a negative attitude that the banks are busy because pensioners are there on pension day. It also makes pensioners softer and easier targets for muggers, for people who know that pensioners are more likely to go to the bank on that day.
 When we were doing the consultations, an older gentleman from one of the Victorian regional areas said to me, `What I would like to see you do is to stop them putting up petrol prices in regional areas on pension day.' I said, `Hopefully we are going to fix that with the new legislation because pension day will gradually disappear. There won't be a day on which prices can be put up.' So this is great news for older people in particular because it will relieve the strain. It will give them some opportunity to be paid on a day which is more suitable to them.
 This is a great initiative that Senator Newman has put in place. She had to think about it some time ago for the legislation to get to this point. She saw it as one of the initiatives that social security could put in place for the International Year of Older Persons.
It is one way in which we can demonstrate our care for older people in particular, although it does benefit all other recipients of social security benefits and payments. I commend the bill to the Senate. I believe that the measures in it are innovative and have a number of foreseen positive benefits that the minister has outlined previously. I think she 
 will be telling us much more about these benefits because this is a very good news story, particularly for older people.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

—I apologise but—
—Perhaps the parliamentary secretary could wait just a second. I have only just seen these amendments to be moved on behalf of the government, so I have a range of questions I want to ask about them. It would probably be useful if the parliamentary secretary started by explaining why the government sought to change its position. I do not know about Senator Bartlett but I would certainly be interested, as I am sure other senators listening to the debate in their offices would be. Perhaps the parliamentary secretary could take us through that and that would save us time down the track.

Most of those amendments that you see there relate to substituting 14 days for seven days, as I indicated in the second reading speech. The government agrees with the sentiments of the chamber and the sentiments of the two senators who spoke—Senator Evans and Senator Bartlett, on behalf of the opposition and the Democrats—that it would be a more feasible, workable and acceptable process if we had a 14-day reporting period. Although it seems like there are a lot of amendments, they basically substitute 14 days for seven days in the various schedules.
—I think you will find they do more than that.

There are two separate issues contained in her amendments. It would be my intention that we deal with them separately, not as a whole. I was more interested in her explanation for the second part, and I am not sure whether she has had a briefing on that yet. That goes to the nub of the issue.
—I think I indicated in my second reading speech that we weren't going to accept beneficial backdating but we would accept substituting 14 days for seven.
—I just thought it would be interesting to know why. You proposed it in your bill originally. You then produced amendments which were circulated in the chamber today seeking not to proceed with that matter and change the act. I think the Senate is entitled to an explanation.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-12-07,"—In terms of contrasting the government's amendments with the opposition's amendments, I understand that the government's amendments are basically doing the same thing as the opposition's except for the beneficial backdating. Is that correct?",SENATE,<title>PAYMENT PROCESSING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1998-12-07,"—The answer to Senator Bartlett is that that is correct. The reason we are accepting the 14 days without beneficial backdating is that we are moving from seven days to 14 days. Beneficial backdating is not, nor has it ever been, a part of the social security system and it should not become so now. The government was prepared to accept beneficial backdating in the context of seven-day notification because it was a shorter period of time. However, given the Senate's reluctance to 
 adopt a seven-day notification period, we have compromised by offering a 14-day notification period. This is, after all, what we currently expect of age pensioners—that is the system as it exists for age pensioners—and we cannot see any reason why other customers should not be treated in the same way and be expected to meet this basic requirement, given that we are agreeing to a 14-day notification period.",SENATE,<title>PAYMENT PROCESSING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-12-07,"—I want to briefly respond to that by saying that the parliamentary secretary is not actually agreeing to a 14-day period. That is what currently exists in the act and the impact of the amendments are to take us back, as I understand it, largely to the status quo, but I am happy to be corrected if that is not right. My understanding is that, in the majority of cases, the 14-day period already applies.
The government had convinced us on this beneficial backdating question. We had been swayed by the force of their arguments and had agreed to support that measure, so we are a bit surprised that the government do not wish to proceed with it. In that event, it seems to me that the government amendments would be best considered in two groups rather than in one. I understand what they are trying to do, but I think we need to have a vote on the measures separately. The government can seek leave to move those amendments together—and I am not sure why they are listed first on the running sheet—but I would have thought, and it may not be my place to say this, that as there are two groups of amendments that go to two separate issues they ought to be voted on separately.",SENATE,<title>PAYMENT PROCESSING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1998-12-07,"—Senator Evans mentioned a notification period for the payments of 14 days. In fact, a number of payments do not currently have a notification period of 14 days: Newstart allowance, mature age allowance, sickness allowance, special benefit and partner allowance. I am advised that they currently have a seven-day notification period.
—I was referring to this bill.
—Senator Evans keeps shouting out that they are not in this bill. The issue is that we have a range of notification periods. One of the reasons we are making the notification periods all the same is that there is one that is 21 days, some that are 14 days and some that are seven days. Throughout social security and social security benefits they have grown like Topsy. There has been no uniformity. One of the problems when you do not have uniformity is that individuals, especially if they are moving from one benefit to another, are not as aware of the rules and are more likely to be in receipt of an overpayment through an error because they thought they had 14 days and it was seven days, or they thought they had 21 days and it was 14 days or whatever. This will make them all the same. Also, it is more likely that staff at Centrelink will be able to give them the correct advice because there is one notification period for all payments.
The reason for trying to bring them together and make them the same was to make the rules about social security much more transparent and much less likely to be subjected to errors, either on the part of the recipient or on the part of the people advising them.

—Are you asking Senator Evans a question? And does Senator Evans want to respond?
—It is going to create confusion if we cannot move the amendments as a whole because they are integral to each other. That is why we sought leave to move them as a whole.
—I am advised that we will need to move items separately where there has been opposition indicated.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I take a point of order. Some of these items on the running sheet are actually making an amendment, that is, the first group. The second group relates not to the question of whether the amendment will be accepted, because they are opposition to what is printed. The question has to be that the clause stand as printed. Therefore, it has to be divided into two groups. Then you can have a debate between yourselves as to whether you move bundle A together, by leave, and what to do with those in bundle B. But you cannot treat government amendment No. 3 in the same way. The government `amendment' is not an amendment; the question is that the bill stand as printed. You cannot put everything together.
—That is correct.
—With due respect, Mr Chairman, I thought that was the very proposition I put to the government five minutes ago—that we deal with them in two groups.
—I must have misunderstood you. I said that I hadn't seen the running sheet because I had moved them all together. I was prepared to move those listed on the running sheet—(1), (2), (5), (4), (7), 
 (8), (10), (11), (13), (14), (16), et cetera—as a whole.
—I think you will get unanimous support for that.
—I am moving, as on the running sheet, the first group of amendments to be moved by the government.
—As I understand it, you sought leave to move those amendments (1) through (78), with the exception of (3) and all of those others that are integrated with some opposition amendments that are the same but different. At this point in time the question is that schedule 3, item 10 stand as printed. That is where we are at.
—And you are voting against it.
—Yes. That is right.
—I put the question. I called in favour of the noes. To confuse Hansard even further, I call in favour of the noes again.",SENATE,<title>PAYMENT PROCESSING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-12-07,"—It would perhaps clarify things for us all if you could actually put government amendment No. 3, describe what you are doing and put the vote again. As I understand it, the government is seeking to deny. I would be interested in your explanation.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-12-07,"—Could I ask why we are doing that rather than dealing with them in order. I just want to be clear that I know what we are doing. I indicated to the parliamentary secretary that we would take a vote as indicative and not divide on all of the measures. I am happy for us to take them in groups. My original suggestion was that since there were two issues at stake we ought to move them as two debates—that is, the 14-day debate and the beneficial provisions debate. I think we are in thunderous agreement on the 14-day provision so I thought it was sensible for us to move the rest of those amendments and have them passed—I assume they will be passed—and then to move the remainder of the amendments which go to the question of the beneficial provisions. We will still be adopting the same position that we indicated but, the chamber having divided, I would not be forcing us to a new set of divisions on those issues. I am not sure why we are now going to jump to that schedule and I want to be clear that we know what we are doing.",SENATE,<title>PAYMENT PROCESSING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1,speech

—The question is that items 22 through 204, as marked on the running sheet, stand as printed.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-12-07,"—I seek your advice, Mr Temporary Chairman. Because we have moved fairly quickly and I was not aware that the government amendments were going to be moved in that form, I am not sure that we have not dealt with those issues by virtue of the previous votes. It is my understanding that the only outstanding issue that has not been determined by the Senate is Senator Bartlett's particular amendment for a new schedule 3A. I think, by virtue of the previous decisions, all of the other amendments are redundant. I would appreciate your expert advice on that before declaring that with any great certainty because I want to be sure that I have not dudded myself and I want you to share the responsibility for that decision, Mr Temporary Chairman!
—Senator Evans, we have backtracked slightly through the maze and we think you are correct. Senator Patterson, do you want to add something?
—I had hoped that you were calling on the Temporary Chairman's 
 expert advice, Senator Evans, because I agree that those are now redundant and all we have left to deal with is Senator Bartlett's amendment.
—We will proceed with Senator Bartlett's amendment while we figure out what the state of the opposition amendment is.",SENATE,<title>PAYMENT PROCESSING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-12-07,"—I move Democrats amendment No. 1 on sheet 1179:
That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendment:
(1)	 Page 156 (after line 30), after Schedule 3, insert:
Schedule 3A—Newly arrived resident's waiting period for special benefit
Social Security Act 1991
1 Subsection 23(1) (paragraph (g) of the definition of  newly arrived resident's waiting period )
	 Repeal the paragraph.
2 Subsection 23(1) (paragraph (ka) of the definition of  waiting period )
	 Repeal the paragraph.
3 Paragraph 732(1)(da)
	 Repeal the paragraph.
4 Sections 739A, 739B and 739C
	 Repeal the sections.
This amendment relates to the newly arrived resident's waiting period for special benefit. I do not want to go into this in great detail, although I feel four minutes probably is not adequate to deal with it—15 minutes maybe—in which case we probably will not get to a vote on it tonight.
Just briefly, it is a matter that has been dealt with by the Senate a couple of times before. Whilst I do not like making a habit of continually bringing back decisions for another vote when I do not like the decision, I think this is an issue which is one of great significance. It is clearly causing a lot of hardship out in the community and I think it is fair to say that the evidence of that hardship is such that it is becoming clearer over time that unintended consequences have come forward from this measure and they are still happening out there. So rather than traverse over the arguments that I have put forward 
 many times before in this chamber, I would simply request that the Senate give this matter consideration again because I do believe it is important. It is not a very costly measure, but it will clearly alleviate a lot of hardship that is happening out in the community.
Since senators will probably have the chance to ponder this matter overnight, for those senators who wish to get a reasonably good snapshot of such hardship, I refer them to the very extensive article that was in the Sydney Morning Herald Good Weekend Magazine on 12 September 1998 by David Lazar. This article outlined in great detail the impact of this measure on a number of families. The simple measure that we can adopt now to remove that hardship is to support my amendment.
Senator Harradine has suggested that it may be beneficial for me to read a couple of examples. I do urge senators to read through this article. Basically it gives examples of a number of families who have migrated to Australia—who have basically been invited into this country to be productive citizens—including skilled migrants as well as people coming here under sponsored migration. Circumstances for these families have not, for a variety of reasons, panned out the way they suspected, and the article gives quite clear examples of absolute extreme hardships—children suffering malnutrition and parents suffering psychiatric breakdown and becoming potentially suicidal.
I am sure that was not the intention of this measure when it was introduced. This amendment is not going to cost a great deal in terms of budgetary implications and it is going to save a great deal in the long term in terms of social damage as well as the economic impact of trying to pick up the pieces after this sort of hardship happens. I would urge the Senate, if they have not yet made up their minds, to ponder this overnight and to give consideration to supporting this amendment.",SENATE,<title>PAYMENT PROCESSING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-12-07,"—This is an extremely important amendment. It is one that I feel should, as Senator Bartlett mentioned, be considered in depth and thoroughly. I, together with Senator Bartlett, urge all honourable senators in this 
 chamber and outside the chamber to have a look at this measure overnight. I do not suppose we will get to it until maybe 5 o'clock or half past four tomorrow afternoon, so I do urge honourable senators to have a look at this matter, to realise its importance and to consider voting for the measure.

"Lightfoot, Sen Phillip",LP,1998-12-07,"—I want to spend the short 10 minutes that I have available to me tonight to give the Senate some warning of the recent decision made by the Federal Court judge Justice Malcolm Lee with respect to the Miriuwong and Gajerrong people of the East Kimberley. The decision that the judge made goes well beyond the Mabo decision made in 1992, and one would not have thought that that would have been possible with the devastation and the potential that that had for political and economic disruption to what was previously seen as always being a politically stable country.
The decision made by Justice Malcolm Lee in effect gave 28 applicants over 7,000 square kilometres of land in a very potentially wealthy part—and, in fact, manifestly wealthy  part—of the East Kimberley with respect to minerals and agriculture. It also included rights to fishing. Whilst the application was made by only 28 people, it encompassed no more than 200 people from both the Miriuwong and Gajerrong families. The area is larger than some countries in Europe. It is the first time that any judge in Australia has made such a decision in respect of the Australian mainland.
When the decision was made by the High Court of Australia to grant the Murray Island people, the Mer people, right and title and to recognise their native title to the islands just south of the coast of Papua New Guinea, it had few serious ramifications for Australian 
 people. The extrapolation of what Justice Malcolm Lee has now done in Australia throws that into disarray. He has gone, as I said, far beyond what the High Court did with the Mabo and the more recent Wik decisions.
I guess it would be fair to say that, now that the land has been granted by the Federal Court, the Western Australian government has no option but to appeal that decision. It has no option because Justice Lee has said that the area encompassed in that in excess of 7,000 square kilometres includes mineral rights. The serious outcome of that for pastoralists is obvious. The serious outcome of that for miners is equally obvious. And there are serious outcomes for tourist operators and for everyone engaged in the agricultural industry there because it also includes vast amounts of the Fitzroy Valley, Lake Argyle, the Argyle Dam and areas that are of significance to the economy of Australia.
This opens the floodgate for similar applications to be made unless the insanity of Justice Lee's decision is overturned by either the full bench of the Federal Court or, ultimately, one would hope, the High Court of Australia. I live in hope that, when the High Court of Australia finds that the native title it said existed for the Mer people of the Murray Island could be extrapolated to the mainland of Australia—3,000 square miles of Australia; an area the same size as the United States of America—the High Court will in its wisdom find that the excesses of Justice Malcolm Lee cannot be allowed to be tolerated both for the political stability of Australia and for Western Australia.
This will not just stop in Western Australia, of course. Let me cover the ramifications of this for Western Australia and the nation. Whilst Western Australia has 9.7 per cent of the population of Australia, nonetheless it produces 27½ per cent of national export income. If a claim were to cover other areas in Australia—and anyone could claim it; 28 people claimed 7,000 square kilometres—what a catastrophe. The claim of those 28 people, unwittingly or wittingly through their legal advisers, now encompasses an area of land that could inhibit the development and the wealth of Australia.
Western Australia produces the greatest amount of oil condensate and gas in the nation. It is the biggest producer and exporter of alumina powder in the world. It is the biggest producer of diamonds in the world, mining over 40 million carats last year from the Argyle diamond mine, which is encompassed by this grant. It is also the biggest producer of gold by far in the nation. It is the third biggest producer of gold in the world, mining over a record $5 billion of gold last fiscal year. It is the biggest producer of iron ore in the world. It is the biggest producer of wheat in the nation—not that too much is grown in the Kimberley, but the extrapolation of that must go to other areas of Western Australia and other areas of Australia if this is allowed to pass.
It is the first time, as I said, that this sort of native title claim has been successfully granted by a superior court in Australia. The decision contradicts the Howard 10-point plan, that plan that we reassured the mining industry, the pastoral industry and the rural industries of Australia would be amended so that there would be not just certainty with respect to the production that makes Australia such a wealthy place to live in and the envy of the world but certainty of title for people engaged in those industries. Once again it creates uncertainty both for those industries I have mentioned and for the titles. It leaves a potential liability of $1.3 billion if the state government successfully overturns that; it is liable for the payment to 28 applicants—possibly up to 200—of $1.3 billion.
The justice gave no reason for some of the things that he did. Why did he do this when the High Court clearly gave a judgment that we thought was harsh, that we, as the engine room of Australia in Western Australia, thought was a harsh judgment against Western Australia? Why did Justice Lee do this? I cannot answer that. But I can say that, unless the full bench of the Federal Court or ultimately the last appellate court in Australia overturns that decision, you will have a few people controlling and owning Australia—not necessarily Aboriginal people but people who choose to call themselves Aboriginal people.
We have an island continent with no frontiers and we are creating frontiers. You have to get a permit to enter places. The middle of Western Australia, part of the Northern Territory and the north-west corner of South Australia is an area larger than France that Aboriginal people already have. Aboriginal people have 50 sheep stations and cattle stations in Western Australia that already amount to 25 million acres of land. Is it that we should live in a fraction of the land and that a few people who decide to call themselves Aboriginal or are Aboriginal should live in the vast bulk of it? It is a formula that is bound to fail. It is a formula that is going to create much more dissension between people who choose to say they are black Australians or those of us who choose to call ourselves white Australians or from Asia or anywhere else, bar being an Aboriginal person. It will create dissent.
Native title cannot be partly extinguished. It can either be extinguished or native title exists. Justice Lee makes no mention of how coexistence works there. He makes no mention of how much minerals should be given to Aboriginal claimants over the area. He makes no mention of access. But he does say that, if Aboriginal people want to keep out other people, they are quite entitled to do that. This has set a precedent in Australia. In an island nation with no frontiers we are creating frontiers for ourselves. Whether you want to call that a permit to enter or a visa to enter, as they do in Europe or other parts of the world, it makes no difference. We have created a situation where visas will be needed to enter Aboriginal land.
Future generations will not thank us for what we have done. They will not thank Justice Lee for what he has done. The time has come for us to legislate away native title with fairness. If that cannot be done, it is time for us to seriously consider a referendum to control native title once and for all.
