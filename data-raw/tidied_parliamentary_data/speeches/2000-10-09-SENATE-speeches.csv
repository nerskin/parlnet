"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-10-09,"—Last Thursday when speaking to the Interactive Gambling (Moratorium) Bill 2000 I was referring to the moral hypocrisy of the Liberal-National Party government in attempting to prohibit, I would argue unsuccessfully, one form of gambling. Senator Chapman had made the point that gambling is a zero sum game, and that is true. I made the further point that it is not just gambling that is a zero sum game—so is smoking and so is alcohol consumption. But often in these circumstances, with these commodities and social problems, the outcome from a prohibition and a ban is far worse than the outcome from attempting effectively to regulate and deal with the social problems that emerge from these forms of activities. I acknowledge that the social problems can be very severe, but we have to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of prohibition.
In the legislation which we are considering, as I outlined in summary in my contribution last Thursday, there are four or five compelling reasons why this legislation should not be passed. Firstly, the moratorium, or ban, will not prevent access to online gambling. According to the explanatory memorandum to the bill, the moratorium:
... will not restrict Australian gamblers' current ability to access offshore sites ... the moratorium will not prevent the expansion of the offshore industry or the availability of traditional gambling products ...
That is from the government's explanatory memorandum. In practice, access to online gambling will not be restricted and, provided the service is conducted offshore, Australians will not be prevented from accessing offshore interactive gambling sites. Often these offshore interactive gambling sites are far less effectively regulated than the proposals we have within the various Australian state jurisdictions. Australian online gambling operators have indicated that they will simply relocate offshore if this bill is enacted and continue operating and servicing local and international online gamblers outside Australian regulations, which apparently are amongst the toughest, if not the toughest, in the world.
The second issue the bill does not deal with is problem gambling—you have only to read the Productivity Commission's report into gambling in this country—and I acknowledge that there are significant social problems associated with gambling. The community concerns about problem gambling are not addressed by the legislation. The main forms of problem gambling are poker machines and casinos. Currently, online operators derive most of their income from overseas, with up to 90 per cent of online gambling transactions emanating from offshore—principally the United States. Australian online gamblers make up approximately five per cent of the market. Whilst this market potential will grow, there is evidence that online gambling offers a range of consumers' and problem gambling protections unavailable in traditional forms of gambling and wagering and, in practice, this bill could exacerbate problem gambling by removing a regulated service but allowing access to unregulated or unlicensed offshore sites. This was a point that even the Inter-church Gambling Task Force acknowledged in their expression of values. This is a severe practical problem with the legislation.
The online gambling industry is already subject to a high degree of regulation and oversight by state and territory governments. Australia has a reputation for providing good consumer protection legislation and this was acknowledged in the Productivity Commission report. In addition, the Australian Casino Association has updated a code of practice that prohibits credit gambling, allows members to preset betting limits, provides personal identification numbers to ensure family members cannot access gambling sites, ensures the privacy and security of participants, issues winnings via non-negotiable cheques, not credit cards, and works with AUSTRAC to counter money laundering. These are all protections that, I might point out to the Senate, are more effective than those that exist in respect of traditional forms of gambling such as persons walking into casinos or playing with poker machines. 
Existing and prospective online gambling companies favour strict regulation and a federal legislative framework worked out cooperatively with the states, including codes of practice for sporting organisations to ensure that match fixing, point shaving and insider information are addressed. As to the issue of criminal sanctions, the bill will make it a criminal offence to intentionally supply an interactive gambling service. The retrospective application and specific nature of the ban permits existing services to be maintained and prohibits new services after 19 May 2000. I might point out that those existing services—and they are few in number—that were fortunate enough to obtain operational licences before 19 May will effectively gain a massive windfall if this legislation is passed. The maximum penalty that can be imposed on a corporation that breaches this legislation is $1.1 million.
For a Liberal-National Party government that occasionally boasts about states' rights and consultation with the states, and in what is clearly an area where state and territory governments have the legal right to legislate and regulate, this bill is an appalling trampling on states' rights and the publicly announced consultation process. A majority of the states and territories oppose a moratorium, although New South Wales and Western Australia are reported as supporting it. It is unclear whether this support extends to a full ban capturing the existing industry. The Northern Territory government indicated in June 2000 that a High Court challenge might be mounted. The ACT government issued two online gambling licences. After the coalition announced their proposed moratorium, Tasmania issued five. These companies have indicated that they will seek legal remedies if this bill is enacted. 
The gambling industry has indicated opposition to the bill because a number of operators held off in good faith the commencement of their services only to face an outright ban. They are being penalised retrospectively. The ban on existing services will stifle innovation, rendering the companies uncompetitive. There was no industry consultation. It is creating a barrier for new entries, for new operators, which is going to have a severe distorting effect on the market, to the massive advantage of the very few existing operators that were able to obtain licences and become operational before 19 May. Just on the process, I might read out, in the context of Tasmania, the evidence that was given to the Senate committee, which is on page 53: 
On 17 May this year the state government—
the Tasmanian government—
wrote to Senator Alston and Senator Newman offering to sit down with the federal government and the states and territories to develop a national code of conduct to apply to Internet gambling. On 19 May 2000 we—
the Tasmanian state government—
received a letter from the federal government inviting the Tasmanian government to have input into the development of moratorium legislation. 
So there was a consultative process taking place. It was taking place with a letter from Senator Alston on 19 May inviting input. Ten minutes later—I stress that—after receiving a letter from the federal minister inviting consultation into a proposed moratorium, the Tasmanian government received a press release, not a letter, from the federal government, from Senator Alston's office, announcing a moratorium unilaterally. What has happened to federal-state consultations? What has happened to federal-state rights in respect of this issue? It is an appalling process that Senator Newman and the federal government have embarked on in respect of this legislation. 
I turn to some specific issues in relation to my home state of Tasmania. I have already referred to the lack of consultation with the Tasmanian state government on this matter. The Tasmanian government was not consulted. No sooner had a request come from the Commonwealth seeking input than 10 minutes later, via a press release, there was an announcement of a total prohibition. There was no real attempt to consult with Tasmania on the introduction of this moratorium. This is very disappointing, considering the extensive experience in Tasmania with the introduction of terrestrial gaming and the stringent regulatory regime that has been developed in relation to online gambling in expectation of a new industry and a new source of export income.  
The Tasmanian government has a strategy for developing and encouraging e-commerce in Tasmania. Internet gambling is a development in the right direction. It is an opportunity for my state to take advantage of international trade in Internet gaming services. I make the point that if this legislation is passed, Tasmania misses out altogether. It is unilaterally excluded from the market. Those few licensees that were lucky enough to beat the 19 May deadline as well as all of those Internet gambling services located overseas, which offer far less protection, will have access to Internet gambling and the very strict regulatory regime that was developed in Tasmania. Those who wish to offer services based in Tasmania will be excluded all together. 
If you are going to have an effective Internet gambling prohibition, if you accept that moral premise, then you at least attempt to prohibit all Internet gambling, whether it is located in Australia or overseas. I would submit to the Senate that that is totally impractical; it simply cannot be done. But as was noted in the report of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts report into this bill, Australia's online operators derive most of their income from overseas, not from within Australia. Up to 90 per cent of online gambling transactions emanate from offshore, principally the United States. In other words, online gambling will have minimal impact on the amount of money spent on gambling in Australia, when all this bill will do—I say as a Tasmanian senator, from a Tasmanian perspective—will deny the Tasmanian economy, in a competitive market, at least a valuable slice of that export income. 
Tasmania has very stringent legislation and regulations in place for Internet gambling. The Tasmanian regulations are far more stringent than those for terrestrial casinos. I would urge senators to take the time to have a look at the regulatory regime that has been developed in Tasmania, the way it is proposed to put it into practice. It is world's best practice. It is extraordinary. I was surprised myself. The regulations on Internet gambling are much more effective than on traditional forms of gambling. The Tasmanian legislation gives the Tasmanian Gaming Commission the power to impose certain conditions on licence holders without requiring new legislation. This means that the commission can react very quickly where there are social implications of concern and where new conditions need to be placed on licence holders.
I make the point that this legislation in Tasmania was initially developed by the previous state Liberal government led by the previous Premier, Mr Tony Rundle—not by a state Labor government but by a state Liberal government. I have already made the point that businesses that spend millions of dollars developing new services have effectively had their investment gutted, their services gutted, by this legislation. I know of one particular case, Federal Hotels, which is on the record in the evidence to the committee. Federal Hotels is a major Tasmanian company. It spent $14 million in developing its systems and its safeguards. I can see why it is very annoyed at this legislation: it has spent a considerable amount of money developing effective online gambling, along with protection, and it is effectively excluded from the market.
Tasmanian legislation also provides for strong penalties against the licence holder. For example, the legislation provides for a first offence penalty of $60,000 where a minor has been allowed access to a site and a $100,000 penalty for subsequent offences plus two years jail and the loss of the gaming licence.

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2000-10-09,"—I rise to speak on the Interactive Gambling (Moratorium) Bill 2000 because of a lifetime personal involvement and also professional involvement in dealing with the victims of gambling. I do not know how anyone can argue that an extension of gambling in this country, or an extension of outlets for gambling, can be beneficial. I cannot even accept the argument that it is better to extend gambling facilities in Australia to stop people going offshore and gambling overseas. For me, any extension of any gambling outlets in this country is a bad thing. In support of what I am saying, I want to read from Alive Magazine, in an article that is introduced with these words: 
Lady Luck is not smiling down on Australia. Although the government is reaping the financial benefits of gambling, local businesses and families are bearing the consequences of our growing addiction to games of chance.
I want to read from this article, because it quotes a friend of mine who has been involved for most of his life in counselling victims of various forms of addiction, including, particularly on the Gold Coast, addiction to gambling. He is a Uniting Church colleague of mine, John Tully, who was a foundation member of both the Australian National Council on Compulsive Gambling and the National Association of Gambling Studies. I also was an early member, and the first treasurer, of the National Association of Gambling Studies, because I wanted not only to have a personal and professional involvement but also to have access to the academic research which has been going on in this industry, particularly for the last 10 or 20 years. The article says:
John Tully ... has been counselling people with addictions for the last forty years. He believes gambling creates a no-win situation for those participating. 
This is what the article reports John Tully as saying:
When players become victims repeatedly and cannot learn from loss, and when they are encouraged to find enjoyment in being at risk even when they have little or no chance of winning, I do not see people engaged in legitimate play ... I see injustice and immorality. I see big business and government engaged in the unjust exploitation of little people ... Gambling results in pain and destruction for families ... It is not a form of play and healthy relaxation, but a psychological and emotional catalyst that lures people into a life of endless indebtedness and antisocial behaviour such as cheating on tax returns, fraud, armed robbery, theft, domestic violence, suicide and other criminal activities. 
I hasten to add, of course, that we are not talking about all gamblers. Obviously not. For the majority of people who engage in gambling it does not result in any of those problems. The majority of gamblers are socially responsible and are able to control the problem. But there is a minority of people for whom gambling is a real problem, and any extension of gambling facilities simply means that that problem will increase. Tully says:
These families often suffer in silence and are treated like lepers because a pathological gambler usually has a criminal record. The gambler and his or her family need to know that help is available. 
That certainly is where I want to put the emphasis. I am not sure that this legislation does that sufficiently, but it at least does something: it sends a signal to the gambling industry that there is a serious social problem with gambling in Australia and that it is growing more serious year by year.
The other issue that I want to raise in relation to gambling is that not only individual people are affected: all of the states in Australia are also addicted to gambling. Each of those governments increasingly depends on gambling to boost its revenue. That, I believe, is a serious issue—that gambling revenue within state governments creates a potential for corruption and for governments themselves to be so addicted that they are prepared to increase outlets for gambling without taking any account of the social consequences.
I listened carefully to what the previous speaker, Senator Sherry, said and he spoke glowingly about the regulation of gambling in the different states. I believe that regulation is ineffective. Individuals and families are not the only ones affected by gambling, though there are many tragic situations surrounding that abuse; the growing dependence of state governments on revenue from gambling taxes is also cause for great concern. The taxes are an inequitable and indirect form of taxation that is derived from human misery and they have a tendency to corrupt any government that depends on them.  
Let me quote you a classic example. Last year, the Netbets affair in Queensland occurred when the Treasurer, David Hamill, granted an Internet gambling licence to GOCORP, a company with three Labor mates as shareholders. A senior member of Mr Hamill's staff, one Labor MP and another Labor councillor held shares in GOCORP, but Mr Hamill maintained he had no conflict of interest. I admit that he stood aside during an investigation which found that he was aware of the two MPs' interest in GOCORP but that he had followed correct procedure. In other words, he had subjected himself to the regulation and was found to be not contravening the regulation which was in place. I say to that: so much for the state's willingness to regulate in order to stamp out corruption, if that kind of thing can happen and the people involved are then absolved. This incident, I believe, came close to bringing down the Beattie government which, at the time, had a one-seat majority—and I say here, on the record, that I want that government to survive. But these people are saying, `Trust us to regulate Internet gambling.' I remain acutely aware of the premature closure of the Senate inquiry into the Victorian Premier's awarding of the Crown Casino licence to a colleague. This matter has never been resolved. I believe this inquiry was shut down because both of the older parties had skeletons in their closet regarding gambling licences. Should we be giving them a new bunch of gambling licences to hand out? It is obvious what my answer is.
The other issue which has been raised in debate is the technical feasibility of regulating Internet gambling. If, as some people have claimed, the proposed government moratorium is technically impossible, why then are the gambling industry, state governments and the IT industry so opposed and so vocal in opposition to the government's bill? I suspect they understand the weight of political pressure and public opinion which would be applied if the moratorium succeeded.
In terms of offshore gambling, I have no commitment to protect the Australian gambling industry against any other industry, but I am concerned to do something about the abuse of gambling by those people for whom it is a problem. I urge the Senate to support the Democrat amendments, which actually seek to do something about problem gambling. If they do so, then I believe we can move forward on this issue. I conclude my remarks on this bill with the editorial from the Sydney Morning Herald of 30 May this year. It talks about state governments rushing headlong into the extension of gambling facilities in order to gain more revenue and says:
Even so, given the recent headlong rush by some States to issue licences, the case for a 12-month moratorium is overwhelmingly strong. Assuming it is approved by Parliament ... a pause will enable the two tiers of government to consider whether a ban on Internet gambling would be feasible or effective. If the answer is yes, that is certainly the way to go. If it is no, the best alternative would be a national regulatory framework with appropriate privacy, harm-minimisation, education and anti-corruption safeguards. Ideally, this would be achieved by agreement, not a Canberra dictate.
At this stage, the problem is that none of the states are in agreement at all about any halt in their dependence on and access to gambling revenue, so the editorial expresses a forlorn hope. I believe that some form of the current legislation must pass this parliament. I hope that the Democrat amended bill will be the one which is put into force. In any case, in at least sending this signal to the gambling industry we may do something about those people for whom gambling has become a personal and very serious family problem.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2000-10-09,"—The Interactive Gambling (Moratorium) Bill 2000 that is before us proposes a 12-month ban on the development of the interactive gambling industry in Australia, by creating a new criminal offence which prohibits a person from providing an interactive gambling service unless they were already providing such a service before the retrospective commencement date of 19 May. It is designed to halt the development of this industry while the government investigates, as it says, the feasibility and consequences of extending the ban to all interactive gambling. However, there has been much speculation about the intent of this government to declare its intention and certainly the Prime Minister's intention to pursue extending the ban to a permanent ban. 
The online gambling industry is an industry that is growing rapidly worldwide, as the Internet continues to expand. The reason I have chosen to speak in this debate today is because it has significant impact on two businesses in the Northern Territory. If, in fact, the Prime Minister's declared intention in relation to extending the ban permanently comes into effect, this may have severe consequences for those industries in the Territory and the contribution to the economy that those businesses make. The latest estimates suggest there are over 700 online gambling sites operating in the Internet, including sports books, lotteries, horseracing, bingo, keno and casino sites. A quick look on the Internet will give you an idea of how many gambling sites there are.
This bill is significant in what it does not do, as opposed to what it does do. For example, as we have stated in the amendment that we intend to move, this bill does not provide strong regulation of interactive gambling—the most practical and effective way of reducing social harm arising from this activity. In an article in the Australian Financial Review on Thursday, 28 September entitled `No sure bets for online gambling's future prospects', David Crowe quoted Professor McMillan as saying:
`The regulations at the moment are a dog's breakfast, inconsistent and uneven,' said Professor McMillan. `We can't get our States to agree on anything, but this is one case where agreement is essential.'
This bill also does not extend current regulatory and consumer protection requirements applying to offline and land based casinos, clubs or wagering venues to online casinos and online wagering facilities. I believe it exacerbates the problem in Australia by barring access to regulated online gambling services with in-built safeguards while allowing access to unregulated offshore online gambling sites that do not offer consumer protection or probity. It singles out one form of gambling in an attempt to create the impression that somehow this government is doing something to alleviate the community's concerns about the adverse social consequences of gambling, but it does not address more prevalent forms of gambling in Australian society such as poker machines and casinos like Crown Casino in Melbourne and the games that they offer. We also believe that it is contrary to the best interests of the Australian Internet industry and the development of e-commerce in Australia.
A number of distinctions need to be made in this bill, including a distinction between unregulated and regulated online gaming sites and a distinction between gambling and a wagering service. This bill defines an interactive gambling service as a service which involves gaming and wagering. However, wagering is betting with a third party and is skills based whereas gaming is betting on chance, for example the poker machines and the casinos. This bill also defines an interactive gambling service as a service that is pro-vided in the course of carrying on a business, a service that is provided to customers using an Internet carriage service and any other listed carriage service, a broadcasting service or any other content service, a datacasting service provided under a datacasting licence, and a service which is linked in a specified way to Australia. If the government's intent was to do something about the way that gambling pervades our society, this bill will not achieve it. The bill excludes telephone betting services, services relating to contracts that under Corporations Law are exempt from a law regulating gambling or wagering, services that the minister deems exempt services, and share trading.
Australia is getting left behind as other countries develop regulations to control the growth of online gambling in their jurisdictions. In addition, the proliferation of unregulated sites will ultimately leave Australian operators behind. Many gamblers will go offshore, often into unregulated gambling environments. This will mean lost revenue for Australia and lost jobs for Australians. There are currently 14 online operators in Australia, employing about 400 people. The information technology people and the companies employed to service these companies also benefit. Banning Internet gambling would send the message that it is not all right to bet online in Australia—and then all you have to do is simply go offshore to place a bet. Last week another senator in this chamber gave us many examples of this. I also saw it myself when I had the chance to visit Lasseters in Alice Springs. I saw many examples of Internet sites overseas based in the Americas, particularly in South America, using Australian acronyms to try to con people, to lead people to believe that they are Australian regulated sites, and yet we do not see this government trying to come to grips with some of the problems that are confronting this industry.  
The moratorium may lead to the banning of online gambling, but this is not technically feasible or necessary. I want to spend quite a deal of time this morning talking about—as I mentioned in my introduction—the impact this will have on Centrebet racing and Lasseters Casino, both based in Alice Springs. In the Northern Territory, it is estimated that, if a ban on online gambling were introduced, Alice Springs would lose an industry worth more than $27 million a year—that is, if the federal government moves to ban Internet gambling permanently post their one-year trial. The amount of money involved in online gambling at Lasseters Casino in Alice Springs surpasses the amount of money gambled in on-site casino betting. If the moratorium ended in a total ban of Internet gambling, Lasseters have said that they will simply move their Internet operations offshore. They will not close down; they will move offshore, taking at least 25 jobs out of the Northern Territory.
I received a letter from Lasseters Casino, and I have no doubt that other senators in this chamber have also received a similar letter. The letter goes into some detail about the way in which they regulate their operations now. They say in their letter to me:
During Lasseters' 12 months of operation—
because I think they formally gained their licence around April 1999—
Lasseters Online has demonstrated that online gambling can be effectively regulated to introduce an even greater degree of control than is possible with physical casinos and to protect players' interests.
If you go into the Lasseters Casino home page, you will see a program that you can download to provide children in your household with protection. There is also information about counselling services, and Lasseters provides regulation as to how much you can bet. They say that they fulfil the demand in the global community for new forms of home based entertainment services in line with the growing acceptance of the Internet, particularly in those countries where accessibility to land based gambling opportunities is low.
They also make the point that it is a natural business extension for traditional casino operators to access greater markets and improve company performance and has the potential to be a successful and strong export industry for Australia, capitalising on the strong reputation this country holds for operating a trusted gaming industry. Their letter also points out the way in which they regulate their operations and the way in which, for example, they have security controls over what they do. Some of those examples are: the player account is opened by credit card and authorised by credit limit; no wager is placed directly through credit card transactions; there is an initial monthly maximum deposit limit of $500; winnings are paid by account payee only cheque addressed to a nominated personal account of the registered player; there is 120-byte key encryption security for financial transactions; players only wager with their deposit funds and any winnings accumulated; and the list goes on and on. 
I know, for example, that those members of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee who participated in the Interactive Gambling (Moratorium) Bill inquiry did go to Lasseters, and I am surprised at the report of the government members, given the probably more thorough briefing they were given at Lasseters than I had the opportunity to attend. But you certainly come away from Lasseters with no doubt in your mind whatsoever that they are taking the lead in trying to regulate this industry, attempting to make sure that those people who access their online gambling services are doing so with as much protection as they possibly can have. They say there is evidence they can produce that people are in fact accessing Internet and online gambling services that are provided overseas, and those overseas services have nowhere near the amount of framework regulation and control that somewhere like Lasseters have. So it is hard to understand why this government would not want to be in there actually supporting places like Lasseters, listening to the Australian Casino Association and trying to work with these people to provide for what we know is a market out there, what we know is an interest amongst the public. This ban on online gambling will not prevent and will not diminish the gambling activities of people in this country simply by placing a ban on the activities. So it is disappointing that this government is not prepared to work with these people and look at providing some national framework regulation and guidance. 
Centrebet is another business in Alice Springs. Its sports betting manager said:
... internet gambling represented 80 per cent of his firm's $7 million-a-year business. If it was forced offshore it would mean more than 70 Alice Springs people would be out of work. 
And, as we know, Lasseters is the only online casino site and is said to be probably the most regulated one in the world.
The issue that needs to be resolved is how states recover taxes from gamblers logging on to online gambling in other states. When I was at Lasseters I spoke with Peter Bridge, and it is an issue that needs to be sorted out. It is an issue whereby state and territory ministers responsible for racing and gaming and people in the industry, like Centrebet and Lasseters, need to get around the table and have a look at that. If in fact Lasseters is regulated under Northern Territory legislation and if someone from New South Wales or Victoria uses that online gambling facility, how can it be organised so that the due proceeds and taxes from that access go to the Northern Territory, for example, as opposed to the Victorian or New South Wales governments? This is an issue that needs to be addressed and resolved, not ignored.
Let us have a look at the issue of the social problems of gambling. These also need to be addressed in regulating the online gambling industry. We consider the effective regulation of gambling online to be the most practical way of substantially restricting the harm of gambling, including criminal harm. In other words, the way in which you could start to look at the social problems of gambling is not in fact to place a 12-month moratorium on what is happening, with a possible future permanent ban, but to actually regulate the gambling online activities. It appears that more regulation will assist problem gamblers online rather than nothing being done and their going offshore for their activities.
State and territory governments are trying to ensure a regulated online gambling environment, but it needs to be done with the assistance and help of the federal government. The regulatory framework needs to address consumer protection issues characteristic of online gambling, such as a mechanism to exclude those not eligible to gamble under Australian law; problem gambling control, for example exclusion facilities; expenditure thresholds; the availability of transaction records; privacy protection; regulation of propriety in advertising; and software and accounting procedures. Some of the other important issues that I think this bill brings to light are that the federal government must develop anti-money laundering and anti-taxation evasion measures. It must arm enforcement agencies with the funding and expertise to detect and pursue criminal activities relating to emerging online technologies. The online gambling industry needs to be brought within the purview of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988, requiring large or suspicious transactions to be reported to AUSTRAC. The Australian Federal Police must be empowered to direct ISPs to take down foreign or offshore gambling sites engaging in illegal or grossly improper activities. The federal government has a responsibility to ensure that the AFP is adequately resourced to effectively deal with these issues. 
In closing, I would like to draw the Senate's attention to an article that appeared in the Centralian Advocate on 25 August this year. It is headed `Alice to lose $20m if 'net bets are banned'. As I said earlier, Alice Springs will lose business worth more than $20 million a year if the federal government moves next May from this moratorium to a permanent ban. The article states:
Lasseters Casino chief executive Peter Bridge said internet gaming would match on-site casino betting this financial year and make more than $20 million.
And next fiscal year it would become more profitable than the casino proper.
If the one year moratorium on internet gambling ended in a ban in May 2001, Lasseters will move it's operation offshore.
We know that the Northern Territory government threatened some months ago that, if this legislation is endorsed, it may seek to challenge its legality in the High Court. We also have Centrebet based in Alice Springs and its betting manager, Gerard Daffy, said:
... internet gambling represented 80 per cent of his firm's $7 million-a-year business. If it was forced offshore it would mean more than 70 Alice Springs people would be out of work.
The Territory and the ACA have the most to lose out of this bill. There are 14 online operators in Australia employing about 400 people and there are all the staff who support them. Centrebet is the biggest online sports betting company in Australia and is at the top five of the 170 operators around the world. Mr Daffy goes on to say, and I think he is correct:
What John Howard is saying is it's not okay to bet with us, but it's okay to bet with any of the other 169 places—
around the world. I draw the Senate's attention to the Labor Party's recommendations in the minority report that was tabled last month and the motion we have moved in relation to the Interactive Gambling (Moratorium) Bill 2000. Our motion highlights a number of those areas which we believe the government needs to address. A number of those areas need to be looked at and worked on. It will be hard work to try to get all states, territories and businesses online and agreeing with regulations and providing the framework which this industry needs. What it does not need is a moratorium with a possible threat of a permanent ban.
Amendment agreed to.
Question put:
That the motion, as amended, be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-10-09,"—My question is directed to Senator Newman, the Minister for Family and Community Services. Can the minister confirm that the revised Commonwealth disability strategy, released last Friday, was primarily revised because of the Commonwealth's complete failure to meet the original objectives? Is it true that just 30 out of a possible 202 Commonwealth organisations lodged a disability action plan with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission as required under the strategy? Can the minister confirm that the revised strategy no longer requires Commonwealth organisations to lodge a disability action plan unless they wish to publicly announce their intention to do so? ",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Disability Action Plans: Commonwealth Authorities</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,question
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-10-09,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. I note the minister confirms that those requirements have been abandoned, but she said in her answer that she was more interested in improving employment opportunities and ensuring that the Commonwealth led by example. Can the minister therefore confirm that the proportion of people with disabilities employed by the Commonwealth has fallen significantly since she has been the minister?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Disability Action Plans: Commonwealth Authorities</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,question
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-10-09,"—I thank Senator Evans for his question. While the previous strategy may have had some benefits, it did not have as many benefits as we would have liked. Of course, that was a system that we inherited. The government have looked very carefully at trying to improve the opportunities for people with disabilities insofar as they go to accessing employment or facilities or goods and services funded by the Commonwealth. We believe that the Commonwealth needs to lead by example. While we are obviously doing our best to encourage the private sector to take account of the capacities of people with disabilities and give them better access to jobs, facilities, goods and services, et cetera, we must also be taking the lead.
Consequently, when an evaluation was done of the previous strategy, it was clear that, although quite a lot had been achieved, more could be done. In announcing the strategy last week, I was very pleased and impressed by the fact that not only did the secretary to my department—the Department of Family and Community Services—speak at the launch, which one would have expected, of course, but also the Secretary to the Department of Finance and Administration, Dr Peter Boxall, gave a speech. Dr Boxall, for me, put it in a nutshell. He said, `We want to see that government agencies are accountable to Australians, and especially to people with disabilities.'
—Well, why didn't they lodge the plans?
—You are so hung up on structures that you are not listening to what I am trying to tell you. Dr Boxall made it very clear that the important thing about the new strategy is that agencies and the heads of agencies will now, for the first time, be clearly accountable for the actions or inactions of their agency, because in their agency reports they will be required to set goals to be achieved in the ongoing year and to account for how they have met the goals that they have set. Some portfolios, some agencies, are purely policy related, some are providers of goods and services and some are financing activities of government. Here was the Department of Finance and Administration, which is usually regarded by people in Canberra as being the body that keeps an eye on how taxpayers' money is spent, saying, `This gives real accountability.' In my view, people with disabilities are going to get value for the dollar that is spent. Taxpayers who want to see people with disabilities looked after better in this country will be confident that they can go to the annual reports of each of the agencies, see what goals each agency has set for itself and how it marks the results at the end of the year.
The Merit Protection Commissioner and the Public Service Commissioner will be constantly monitoring how the various agencies perform according to the goals they have set themselves but, most importantly, so will the Australian people and the Australian parliament—estimates committees and the parliament in question time. They will all have a better opportunity to see what has been achieved. Senator Evans is very keen to talk about plans. It is still appropriate for agencies to do action plans if they wish, in addition to the new directions.

"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-10-09,"—No, I cannot confirm that and I will not have the senator putting words into my mouth that I did not utter. Regarding the action plans that he is so hung up on, it was made very clear in the launch of the strategy that agencies were still able to launch action plans if that suited them, but they were not obliged to do so. The reason for that was that it had not been as effective a way when people who have the mentality of Senator Evans get hung up on process instead of outcomes. We are concerned to see that the outcomes are greater. 
—The outcome is that there are less disabled people working for the Commonwealth.
—For all that Senator Evans will shout about this, the reality is that this government has been working very hard to improve the lot for Australians living with a disability.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-10-09,"I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Newman) to a question without notice asked of her today, relating to disability services.
I think it is fair to say that the Minister for Family and Community Services failed to provide answers to the questions asked of her today and tended to waffle on with a lot of rhetoric. But the reality is that this government's policies in the disability area are very weak. The government has shown no real interest in the subject.
The Minister for Family and Community Services today was defending her announcement on Friday of a new disability strategy for Commonwealth departments. The reason she needed a new strategy was that the previous strategy had not met any of its key objectives. In the four or five years of this government there has been no effort put into meeting that disability strategy. Of the 200-odd departments and agencies inside the Commonwealth, only 20 or so had bothered to submit a disability strategy to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, as required under the disability strategy. So there had been no effort to have the reality of the Commonwealth's role meet the rhetoric the minister continues to espouse. 
The minister said today in answer to my question that she was more interested in results than process and more interested in ensuring that the Commonwealth led by example. So, in my supplementary question, I asked her about the results and the Commonwealth's record. An APS statistical bulletin released earlier this year shows that the Commonwealth's record in terms of employing people with disabilities is one of a drop in the number and percentage of people employed. Under this government, the Commonwealth no longer provides leadership in employing people with disabilities. It is a government whose record shows that there is a declining number and proportion of people with disabilities employed in the Commonwealth. That is this government's leadership role. That is the measure that the minister invited us to apply when assessing her and her government's record. So under any measure—be it the disability strategy; be it their own employment record—the Commonwealth's record in terms of leadership in assisting people with disabilities is a very poor one indeed.
There has been some publicity recently about the mess that is the situation with the HREOC Disability Commissioner. The government was finally embarrassed into giving another temporary extension to the acting Disability Commissioner because the government has not brought the legislation on in this place which seeks to abolish that position. I suspect the reason that the government has not brought that legislation on is that that section, at least, will be defeated. I understand that the minors and the Democrats, like Labor, will be opposing the abolition of the Disability Commissioner's role. That is because we think there is a real role for a rights framework for people with a disability. There is a real role for a specialist disability commissioner in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The government is alone in advocating that that position ought to be abolished.
While the Minister for Family and Community Services goes on with her rhetoric about how much she cares and how much she is doing for people with disabilities, if you look at all the objective measures of the government's performance you see a government trying to downgrade the rights framework, a government not committed to providing employment opportunities for people with disabilities and a government, in its own purview, within its own departments, not committed to ensuring higher standards and not committed to making sure its own departments provide employment opportunities.  
We hear a lot from the minister about mutual obligation for people with disabilities, but what we do not hear a lot from her about is the Commonwealth meeting its obligations to people with disabilities. Senator Denman asked a question about the people on the disability support pension who want to access employment programs but cannot, about the freeze that has been put on accessing those programs. That is a genuine concern about the Commonwealth's own role, and the minister does not seem to have any grasp of that issue. She is not able to explain why it is that people are not able to access employment programs. The minister talks of trials. That is all we get from her—more and more trials—and, when we have a successful trial, that is abandoned and we have another trial.
There is no disability policy from this government, other than to remove the framework of rights that Labor established and to deny opportunities while talking about mutual obligation. I have not yet met a person with a disability who was not keen to get employment, was not trying to get the opportunity to seek employment. All the government wants to talk about is mutual obligation in the framework as if people with a disability are not interested in seeking to enter the work force. It is quite the opposite: they are not being given the opportunities or the assistance to make those efforts.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2000-10-09,"—I find Labor's record on this, and their attempt to dismiss what Senator Newman and the government have done for disability services, absolutely hypocritical. Senator Chris Evans was not here when the Labor Party were in government and did not have the opportunity to see the appalling treatment that was given to people with disabilities. I start first of all by saying that the minister responsible, Minister Howe, under the then Labor government, had a policy of closing down what were then called `sheltered workshops'—now called `disability business enterprises'. I went to business enterprise after business enterprise around Australia, particularly in Victoria, where parents and providers were in tears because they were not allowed to—and I will use the word that Labor used, a dreadful word—`backfill', which means that when a person with a disability was found work in open employment they were not permitted to put somebody into that place. The aim was basically to close down most of the services unless they could reach an unattainable standard.
The Labor government had to back down. It was one of the most compelling times in this chamber. There are not many times when you see a debate change policy. When I spoke on how the Labor Party were not employing people with disabilities in government services and how their numbers were decreasing, the Labor Party actually said that almost all people were able to be employed in open employment and that they were going to close sheltered workshops. I got up and spoke on the figures. I said that federal government departments had decreased the number of people with disabilities. Senator Flo Bjelke-Petersen got up and talked about what an organisation, which she was a patron of, was doing in Queensland, and then Senator Herron got up and asked a question about what was going to happen to his daughter who was severely disabled, and who unfortunately has since died, when her sheltered workshop shut down. Senator Tate, His Grace, was absolutely embarrassed and pursued the advisers. I remember that he leant across to the advisers and said, `Have you been to this place?' They said, `No.' He said, `Well, get something done and fix it up.' Labor backed down on that policy. It is one of the few times when I think a debate in this chamber changed policy.
It was a very good question that Senator Herron asked. Labor had an appalling record. They let a contract to publicise the disability reform package, and the company given the contract at the time was balance sheet insolvent. People with disabilities were left unpaid, the groups that had been contracted to work for this company were left unpaid, tax was not paid by the company, and the company did not complete its contract. So to come in here and bleat about what this government has done about people with disabilities is just hypocritical when you see what Senator Newman has been able to achieve. Unlike Labor, the coalition has delivered $150 million from the Commonwealth towards the important issue of unmet need. Unlike Labor, the coalition has delivered better employment assistance services and, through changes to the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service, which provides employment related rehabilitation, the coalition has provided a more responsive service. I have not got time to tell you the myths that Ms Macklin has put around about what we were going to do about the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. I have spoken about that before.  
We have actually seen a significant improvement in disability employment assistance. There has been a 20 per cent increase in the number of people with disabilities placed and supported in employment through Commonwealth funded disability employment assistance services between 1995 and 1998. These services were in disarray when Labor were in government, but we have seen a 20 per cent increase. One of the other things we have done—and I remember being in the chamber when the Labor Party opposed this and then came around to it—is that we have given funding to carers of children who are profoundly disabled, enabling about 980 parents of profoundly disabled children to access a carer payment for the very first time. Labor were about to oppose it, then they finally caved in because they wanted to extend the categories. But never had there been a carers allowance for people looking after incredibly disabled children. Carers are allowed to take up to 63 days respite in a year and still remain eligible for their payments. To come in here and say that we have not done things for people with disabilities is an absolute furphy and is a misrepresentation of the case. Labor ought to go back and look at their own record, because when they were in government it was appalling and people with disabilities were being treated abysmally.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Disability Action Plan: Commonwealth Authorities</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,speech
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,2000-10-09,"—I wish Senator Patterson would listen to her own words. It is important that we tell the whole story and the accurate story. What you have just done by criticising the way the Labor Party acted in government was to tell a very insufficient story.
—You closed down sheltered workshops, Rosemary.
—Yes, a lot of the sheltered workshops were closed because they were nothing more than formidable exploitation of workers, particularly people with disabilities, who were being treated in an appalling way. It is also true to say that, on balance, you would like to think that we did not close those workshops simply to deny people with a disability jobs. What was being done—and you rightly remind us that it was being done by Minister Brian Howe—was to try to provide a much fairer, a much better and a more decent working opportunity for people with a disability. In many cases that succeeded. I also appreciate the point that sometimes governments can go too far, and I would have thought that, if we had to agree with what you said—and I think we do—and if there was a change of policy so as to make sure that not all people who used workshops were denied access to those sheltered workshops, that was a very right and proper thing to do. The reason for doing it in the first place was to try to make sure that people with a disability had access to some kind of reasonable job and reasonable pay and that they were not being exploited through some of the sheltered workshop arrangements.
Just the same, it is right and proper for us to say that at the moment the government is getting it very wrong about disabilities and, I think, more particularly, about women with a disability. I want to pick up on the question and answer related more particularly to my area. I asked the minister about Women with Disabilities Australia, an organisation that has achieved tremendous things for people with disabilities and an organisation where the spokespersons are women with disabilities. It has 2,000 members, including 600 organisations; uniquely, it is run by women with disabilities for women with disabilities. In 1999 it received the Australian Violence Prevention Award. The work that it has been doing is so good that it is being used as a model for best practice internationally. It has particularly looked at the way people with a disability—and particularly women with a disability—have been subject to a variety of types of domestic violence. This is really beyond the ordinary campaign against domestic violence that the Labor government started and the Liberal government continues. Certainly, it was recognised for the extreme need to address expansion of the issues around violence against women with disabilities. In fact, it was not, first of all, included in the project `Under partnership against domestic violence'. What the women did was to negotiate so as to expand the definition of `domestic' to encompass the various domestic arrangements for people with disabilities, such as group houses and boarding houses. They also campaigned to fund and implement a fourth national project dedicated to researching the issue of violence against women with disabilities and to develop information resources on domestic violence for people with disabilities in Australia. 
The question to me is: why is an organisation that has been honoured by the Prime Minister and honoured internationally in jeopardy of losing its funding? Under the current arrangements, it is about to be unfunded. It will cease to get any money at all. Why would you stop funding an organisation that has been so honoured and so successful? It is because of a peculiar policy in the government to cease funding many women's organisations, to try to fund a couple of peak organisations and to mainstream—as they call it—funding for women. Most of us who fought for rights for women know that it is far too early to be mainstreaming—as it is called—women's issues. They are not set solidly in the community. Sometimes women's organisations that lose their funding fade out very quickly and the rights and services that people are campaigning for for women are lost very quickly. When an organisation has been so successful, why would this government use their strange way of realigning the funding under the Office of the Status of Women for women's organisations? Why would they put in jeopardy an organisation which they themselves acknowledge has been so good and which has done such wonderful things for women—which has been a voice for women and a voice for women with disability? To my mind, it is not unlike what the government have done with the Equal Opportunity Commissioner and the Disability Commiss-ioner. They do not like it.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Disability Action Plan: Commonwealth Authorities</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2000-10-09,"—Like so much of what the Labor Party has to say in this chamber, very little of what has been said this afternoon about disability has had anything to do with the truth or the way the Labor Party conducted its policy.
—You're not calling me a liar, are you, Senator?
—I would never call you a liar, Senator. I would simply say that you were not presenting the facts as well or as accurately as you might.
—That is calling me a liar and that's just terrible.
—I would be careful and address the chair: ignore the interjections.
—Senator Evans said that the number of disabled people offered jobs within the Commonwealth under this government has fallen dramatically. Yet the facts of the matter are that there has been a significant improvement in the amount of disability employment assistance offered by this government. In fact, there has been a 20 per cent increase in the number of people with disabilities placed and supported in employment through Commonwealth funded disability employment assistance services between 1995 and 1998, the period of this government. That makes the point that I opened with—that is, the real facts have not been presented in the most accurate way that they could have been. 
There is no doubt that the government is very concerned about providing better disability services to people in this community who are disabled and a great deal has been done to help them. Basically, this government has sought to streamline the mechanisms that are available to disabled people and to simplify the access that they have to jobs. That needed to be done because, under the previous Labor regime, the whole system of providing services to disabled people was very complicated and difficult. There was a confusing set of rules and regulations and it was very hard for people with disabilities to find their way through them.
The Howard government announced, in its first budget after gaining office, a broad reform agenda for disability employment assistance and rehabilitation services. At the time of that first budget in 1996, the Howard government articulated its vision to enhance job seeker access, choice and employment outcomes for disabled people, to make funding arrangements more equitable and to provide employment assistance to as many people as possible with existing funding and to promote flexibility and innovation. These were all important goals in view of the rather confusing and difficult bureaucratic arrangements which existed under the Labor government, which certainly did not have any feeling or sensitivity for the needs of disabled people and the need for a simpler system to be put in place. The Howard government's vision, put simply, was to provide people with disabilities with more opportunities to participate in the economic and social life of the Australian community and to achieve better outcomes for individuals.
The government's strategies to achieve this vision involved an independent eligibility assessment and referral process, which is a very good thing to have done, a new quality assurance system—again important—and to have funding linked to individual needs and outcomes and contestability for rehabilitation services. An independent reference group on welfare reform was set up to reinforce this focus on participation outcomes. Work on the employment assistance reform strategies has proceeded under this government. Many senators would be aware of the community consultations that have already taken place and which have led to the formulation of better employment policies and access—leading, among other things, to the 20 per cent increase in the number of people with disabilities placed and supported in employment through Commonwealth funded disability and employment assistance services under the life of the Howard government—and better linking of funding to individual needs. That is an excellent record indeed.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Disability Action Plan: Commonwealth Authorities</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,speech
"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,2000-10-09,"—Most of us know that the Paralympic Games commence next week. It is an event that celebrates the courage of those with disabilities. I have been told that it is a very humbling experience to have the privilege of observing the courage of the disabled who participate in those games, and I am sure we all wish them well. However, most of the time people with disabilities are not seen and their plight is not acknowledged. An example of this would be the cuts to the supported wage system. The answer given by Senator Newman is not satisfactory. This is not just an issue about waiting lists. The supported wage system is important, not just in providing adequate variety for those with disabilities but also in giving respite to the carers who so diligently cater for their needs.
A few months ago, a constituent came to see me in my office. Her son had benefited as a result of the supported wage system. She was distressed, as cuts to the system would mean that her son would no longer receive assistance in his work capacity. She was worried not only about the lack of work and what that would do to his self-esteem, but also about how she would cope with a reduction in respite as a result of her son missing out. The respite she received when her son was at work allowed her to do the family shopping, pay the bills and, if there was any time left, grab a few quiet moments for herself during the week. It is easy to see that the loss of that time would impact not only on her son but also on the quality of their family life. Having spent quite a lot of time with my daughter, who is a manager of one of the respite disabled and accommodation disabled centres in Sydney, I appreciate the need for people to have respite.  
Fortunately, because of advances in medications and medical services, those with disabilities are living longer and the commitment to the continuation of any work program is vital. It gives disabled people social contacts which they do not always have, particularly the disabled who are being cared for at home and who do not have employment. Their social contacts are very limited. It is vital for them to continue to have those social contacts. It is important that we encourage disabled people—and provide the necessary funding—to work for as long as possible, for their self-esteem and for the social contacts that work provides as well. Most disabled people have to retire much earlier than other people, but we need to encourage them to stay in the work force as long as possible. If the funding is not there, it is just not possible for them to do that. 
Some agencies are running at deficits to accommodate the needs of their clients. That is not because they are inept. Rather, they are trying to meet the needs of the disabled person and also community demand. In some cases, the deficit is close to $3,000 a client. This is an untenable situation. We have to look at where our funding goes and provide more funding for these programs, not cut back on funding. I will digress a bit here. I joined the Labor Party in the late 1970s. The reason I joined was that I was involved with a family day care centre, and that centre was unable to take children with a disability into care while their mums—and it was normally the mums—had a break. Fortunately, since then life has moved on. It is now possible for people who have children with disabilities to leave them in family day care and those sorts of supported situations. But the families of disabled persons who are living to be older, and who have no money to support them, are going to go through the same dilemma—(Time expired)

Dear Minister
I refer to Instrument No. CASA 06/00 made under regulation 152 of the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988, that sets out the specifications in accordance with which members of the Australian Parachute Federation may conduct parachute descents.
Paragraph 4.8.13(a) lists three factors, which cumulatively will render a tandem endorsement not to be current.  The three factors are that the person has (a) made fewer than 50 descents as Tandem-Master; (b) not carried out 3 tandem descents within the previous 90 days, and (c) not carried out one tandem descent within the previous 30 days. This appears to be inconsistent with paragraph 4.10(c), under which an APF member who has made fewer than 50 tandem descents may make a tandem descent with a student parachutist, provided that the member has carried out either 3 tandem descents within the previous 90 days, or one tandem descent within the previous 30 days. If an APF member has fulfilled only one of those alternative requirements, his or her tandem endorsement is rendered non-current by paragraph 4.8.13(a), and yet paragraph 4.10(c) does not forbid the person making a tandem descent with a student parachutist. If, on the other hand, paragraph 4.10(c) is read as subject to the requirement that the APF member hold a current tandem endorsement, then the paragraph appears to be unnecessary, as the conditions for currency of the endorsement are more stringent than the requirements of paragraph 4.10(c).

The Committee has requested clarification of paragraphs 4.8.13(a) and 4.10(c) of the instrument.
CASA has expressed its thanks to the Committee for identifying the raised inconsistency and bringing it to the attention of the Authority. CASA has advised that the inconsistency was due to the material being carried forward without change from the previous instrument.
To address this inconsistency, CASA has undertaken to redraft the instrument, and work has commenced to this end. CASA expects to issue a new instrument by October 2000.

Dear Minister
I refer to the Determination No. PIB 7/2000, made under paragraph (bj) of Schedule 1 to the National Health Act 1953, that amends a determination made on 15 May 2000 to ensure that it operates prospectively and not (as had been the case) retrospectively. 
The Explanatory Statement puts the view that `while s 48A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 appears to prevent the determination on 15 May 2000 from being remade, it does not appear to prevent the determination made on 15 May from being amended'.  The Committee would appreciate receiving further information on the basis for this view.
The Committee would be grateful for your advice as soon as possible but before 31 August 2000 when disallowance action may be initiated.

Dear Senator Coonan
Thank you for your letter of 17 August 2000 concerning Determination No. PIB 7/2000, made under paragraph (bj) of Schedule 1 to the National Health Act 1953, that amends a determination made on 15 May 2000 (Determination No. PIB 6/2000) to ensure that it operates prospectively.
You requested further information on the statement in the Explanatory Statement to the effect that section 48A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (the AIA) prevented Determination No. PIB 6/2000 from being re-made, but did not prevent Determination No. PIB 6/2000 from being amended.
Determination No. PIB 7/2000 made one small amendment to Determination No. PIB 6/2000. It changed the date that Determination No. PIB 6/2000 was to take effect from 16 February 2000 to 14 June 2000.
As I previously advised in response to your letter of 29 June 2000 concerning Determination No. PIB 6/2000, my Department took this course of action on the advice of support staff of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances.
In a telephone conversation on 7 June 2000, my Department consulted support staff of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances about this matter. Following consultations between the support staff and the legal adviser for the Committee, my Department was advised that section 48A of the AIA does not prevent all regulations relating to the original regulation from being made. It only prevents regulations that are the “same in substance” as the original regulation from being made. My Department was advised that section 48A of the AIA would prevent Determination No. PIB 6/2000 from being re-made but that section 48A of the AIA would not prevent a new determination that amended the date of effect of Determination No. PIB 6/2000 from being made.
It is important to note that my delegate has now made a new determination (Determination No. PIB 19/2000 dated 31 July 2000) that substitutes a new Schedule 5 to the determination made under paragraph (bj) of Schedule 1 of the National Health Act 1953 dated 30 June 2000. Determination No. PIB 19/2000 effectively replaces Determination No. PIB 6/2000 as amended by Determination No. PIB 7/2000. Accordingly, Determinations No. PIB 6/2000 and PIB 7/2000 are no longer operative.

Dear Minister
I refer to the Hearing Services Providers Accreditation Scheme Amendment 2000 (No.1) made under subsection 15(1) of the Hearing Services Administration Act 1997, and the Hearing Services Rules of Conduct 2000 made under subsection 17(1) of the Hearing Services Administration Act 1997,
Hearing Service Providers Accreditation Scheme Amendment 2000
Item 3 of Schedule 1 inserts a new subsection 6(5) which makes a decision to accredit an entity conditional on the entity not providing false or misleading information to the Commonwealth in connection with the accreditation scheme or the provision of hearing services to voucher holders. The Committee would appreciate your advice as to whether it is intended that this imposes a form of strict liability on the entity or whether the condition is intended to apply only to the intentional or careless provision of false or misleading information. 
Hearing Services Rules of Conduct 2000
Rule 5 provides that a contracted service provider must not refuse or fail to supply hearing services to a voucher-holder unless `it is reasonable to do so'. Rule 13 provides that a contracted service provider must `take reasonable steps' to ensure that a voucher-holder's consent to the supply of services is informed. Rule 16 provides that a contracted service provider must `take reasonable steps' to ensure that a voucher-holder understands the effect of and liability arising from a document which is to be signed by the voucher-holder. Rule 17 provides that a contracted service provider must give the voucher-holder any information the contracted service provider `reasonably believes the voucher holder reasonably needs'. Rule 36(2) provides that a contracted service provider must not recommend a top-up device (as defined in rule 3(5)) to a voucher-holder unless `it considers on reasonable grounds' that the device will meet the voucher-holder's hearing rehabilitation needs in an appropriate way.  The Committee is concerned that the reliance on a standard of reasonableness in each of these rules offers little guidance to contracted service providers and consequently an uncertain level of protection for voucher-holders. The Committee would therefore appreciate your advice as to whether some guidance could be included in the Rules to clarify the requirement of reasonableness in these situations.
Rule 31 provides that the Minister may refuse to approve or register a person if the Minister is satisfied that the person should not perform hearing services to voucher-holders. Rule 34 provides that the Minister may revoke an approval or registration. The Explanatory Statement does not advise whether these decisions are decisions made under the accreditation scheme and therefore subject to reconsideration under section 29 of the Hearing Services Administration Act 1997 and review under section 35 of that Act. The Committee would appreciate your advice on this matter.
Rule 38 deals with complaints procedures established by a contracted services provider. The Rule does not specify what procedures apply if the complaint is not resolved to the satisfaction of the complainant. As such, the Committee would appreciate your advice on this matter and in particular whether any further procedures are envisaged and, if so, whether they are to be specified in the Rules.
The Committee would be grateful for your advice as soon as possible but before 7 September 2000 when disallowance action may be initiated.
Yours sincerely

Dear Senator Coonan
Thank you for your letter of 17 August 2000 concerning the Hearing Service Providers Accreditation Scheme Amendment 2000 (No. 1), and the Hearing Services Rules of Conduct 2000.
Hearing Services Rules of Conduct 2000
I have noted your comments regarding the inclusion of reference to a standard of reasonableness in the obligations imposed on approved providers in Rules 5, 13, 16, 17 and 36(2). The Committee asks whether some guidance could be included in the Rules to clarify the requirement of reasonableness in the relevant situations.
The Committee would be aware that reference to a standard of reasonableness has a long history in common and statutory law. I am informed that in the statutory context there are relatively few examples where any associated definition has been included. I believe that the standard of reasonableness would require the action or belief of the accredited service provider concerned to be viewed objectively by reference to what would be expected of an ordinary, competent, accredited service provider in the particular circumstances. Administration of the relevant provisions can be expected to be based on this interpretation which I believe would broadly accord in any event with a common sense reading of the provisions. I would mention also that any decision of the Minister relating to a failure to comply with the Rules of Conduct is potentially subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I do not consider therefore that it is necessary to attempt to prescribe the meaning of “reasonableness” in the Rules. 
The Committee has requested in regard to Rules 31 and 34 whether decisions by the Minister under these Rules are subject to reconsideration and review. These Rules do not apply to decisions made under the accreditation scheme, but rather to decisions concerning the approval of persons as being professionally qualified. The Committee can be informed that decisions made by the Minister under Rules 31 and 34, if affirmed or varied, can be the subject of application for review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal under section 35 of the Hearing Services Administration Act 1997.
Complaints Procedures
The Committee has inquired what procedures would apply if a complaint dealt with under the procedures established by a contracted service provider was not resolved to the satisfaction of the complainant.
Under the Commonwealth Hearing Services Program clients are able to make complaints about a contracted service provider, regardless of whether they have complained to the service provider, and if they have complained to the service provider, regardless of whether the complaint was resolved to the satisfaction of the complainant or not. Clients of the Program receive a brochure with their Hearing Services Voucher detailing their rights in this regard. A copy of the brochure Getting It Right Information for Clients is enclosed for the information of the Committee.
I am advised that the complaints management process, which is administered by the Office of Hearing Services, is well established and has proven most effective in resolving complaints from clients against contracted service providers to date. Except for complaints about processes which are able to be resolved by the appropriate administrative staff, the resolution of almost all other complaints from clients of the Program involves a professional Audiologist employed by the Office of Hearing Services.
Hearing Service Providers Accreditation Scheme Amendment 2000 (No.1)
The Committee has questioned whether in relation to the inclusion of new subsection 6(5) in the Hearing Services Accreditation Scheme 1997, it is intended to impose “a form of strict liability”. The new provision subjects the accreditation of an accredited service provider to the condition that it must not provide false or misleading information in connection with the accreditation scheme or the provision of services to voucher holders. I wish to advise the Committee that this not a situation of strict liability.
A contravention of this condition, and any other condition of accreditation, falls to be dealt with under section 10. The Minister, after considering any written submissions, has a wide discretion to deal with contraventions in a number of ways. Such action would be most unlikely in the event of a purely accidental provision of incorrect information.
Yours sincerely

"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,2000-10-09,"—On behalf of Senator Coonan, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that 15 sitting days after today I shall move that the following delegated legislation, a list of which I shall hand to the Clerk, be disallowed.
The list read as follows—
1.	Australian Federal Police Amendment Regulations 2000 (No.2), as contained in Statutory Rules 2000 No.138 and made under the Australian Federal Police Act 1979.
2.	Civil Aviation Amendment Order (No.9) 2000 made under the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988.
3.	Determination No.PB9 of 2000 made under subsection 99AAC(2) of the National Health Act 1953.
4.	Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Regulations 2000, as contained in Statutory Rules 2000 No.181 and made under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.
5.	National Food Authority Amendment Regulations 2000 (No.1), as contained in Statutory Rules 2000 No.122 and made under the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991.
6.	Quarantine Regulations 2000, as contained in Statutory Rules 2000 No.129 and made under the Quarantine Act 1908.
—As usual, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short summary of the matters raised by the committee.
Leave granted.
The summary read as follows—
Australian Federal Police Amendment Regulations 2000 (No.2), Statutory Rules 2000 No.138
The Regulations amend the Principal Regulations in relation to employment decisions, suspension from duties of AFP employees and confidentiality of handling of financial statements.  
Item 3 of Schedule 1 introduces a new regulation 5 which provides that the Commissioner may suspend an AFP employee in certain defined instances. The operation of this regulation appears to cover suspensions that might be regarded as involuntary (for example where it is believed that the employee has committed a disciplinary offence) as well as those which are voluntary (for example, where the employee wishes to contest an election to a non-parliamentary body). With regard to the first type of suspension, the new regulation does not specify any processes for a suspension decision (for example, whether written notice must be given), nor does it indicate whether such a decision is reviewable. With regard to the second type of suspension, the reference to `an election to a non-parliamentary body' is vague.
Item 3 of Schedule 1 introduces a new regulation 13 which provides for the attachment of salaries to satisfy judgment debts. The subregulation 13(1) provides that `The AFP may make deductions from the salary of any of the following persons to satisfy a judgment debt:' There is then a list of four categories of person. The words quoted appear to be drafted widely, covering the judgment debt of any person..
Civil Aviation Amendment Order (No.9) 2000
The Amendment Order requires the installation of portable megaphones in passenger aircraft with certain defined seating capacities.
Clause 2 of the Order states that the Order commences on 1 September 2001 but the Explanatory Statement provides no explanation for the lengthy delay in commencement.
The Regulatory Impact Statement notes that the genesis of the changes introduced by this Order was a review of aviation safety requirements that commenced in June 1996. The Committee notes that the Explanatory Statement provides no information on why its has taken four years for this amendment to be made.
This amendment is limited to aircraft carrying more than 60 persons with no explanation of why it has been limited to these aircraft. 
Determination No.PB9 of 2000 made under subsection 99AAC(2) of the National Health Act 1953
The Determination specifies the conditions under which payments will be made in respect of the supply of pharmaceutical benefits by approved pharmacists and approved medical practitioners. By virtue of clause 1(a) of this instrument, it is taken to have commenced retrospectively on 1 January 2000. Although it appears that it does not detrimentally affect the rights of any person other than the Commonwealth, there is no assurance to that effect in the Explanatory Statement. 
Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Regulations 2000, Statutory Rules 2000 No.181
The Regulations provide for environmental assessment and approvals, conservation of biodiversity, various conservation principles, enforcement and administrative matters. The Committee has received a response from the Minister which met most of its concerns but is seeking further information on the following matters.
The Regulations expressly create a number of strict liability offences. Some of these offences were not previously strict liability offences under the previous National Parks and Wildlife Regulations 1975 (new regulations 12.14, 12.28, 12.29, 12.43, 12.44, 12.48 and 12.54). Others are newly introduced strict liability offences (new regulations 12.50 to 12.52 and 12.55). No explanation is given in the Explanatory Statement for these changes.
Regulation 12.13 sets a penalty of 50 penalty units where a person damages, defaces, moves, possesses or interferes with heritage. Heritage is defined broadly and includes `objects that have aesthetic, archaeological, historic, scientific or social significance or other special value'. It is quite possible that a person may not know whether an object falls within this broad definition and it may be appropriate to confine this offence to intentional acts.
Regulation 12.24 imposes a penalty of 50 penalty units on a person who captures an image in or of a Commonwealth reserve in contravention of a prohibition or restriction imposed by the Director. The heading to the regulation refers to `capturing images or recording sound', yet the regulation does not refer specifically to `recording sound'. There is no information on the processes required where the `device or means used' to capture the image has been confiscated by the Director, ranger or warden, under subregulation 12.24 (5).
National Food Authority Amendment Regulations 2000 (No.1), Statutory Rules 2000 No.122
The Regulations prescribe various charges for services provided by the Australia New Zealand Food Authority, prescribe certain agencies to which the Authority may disclose confidential commercial information, and make other amendments to the Principal Regulations to reflect changes to the Act.
New subregulation 8(1) fixes a fee for an application of $2,800. Whilst a note to the subregulation explains the components of the fee, the Explanatory Statement does not explain the basis for these components nor for the total amount. 
New subregulation 8(2) deems that the application fee (if any) for an application is taken to accompany the application if it is paid `without delay' when the applicant receives notification under paragraph 13A(2)(a) of the Act that the application has been accepted. The words `without delay' do not give the applicant sufficiently clear guidance about the time for payment.
New regulation 10 provides for the refund of fees in certain circumstances.  Subregulations 10(3) and (4) provide that one amount will be refunded if the application is withdrawn before `half of the work required for full assessment is completed', while a lesser sum is refundable if the withdrawal occurs after `half of the work required for full assessment is completed'. Neither the regulations nor the Explanatory Statement indicate how it is to be determined whether half of the work has been completed, or who is to make that decision.
New regulation 14 provides for the review of decisions under subsection 13A(2) or (3) of the Act. Subregulation (1) does not specify any time limit within which the applicant must apply for reconsideration of a decision. Subregulation (2) does not set any time limit within which the Authority must reconsider the matter.
Schedule 3 sets out the charges payable in relation to full assessment, drafting and inquiry. The Risk Impact Statement explains that these fees are based upon `an estimate of anticipated costs' but does not advise how this estimate has been made.
Quarantine Regulations 2000, Statutory Rules 2000 No.129
The Regulations repeal and replace the Quarantine (General) Regulations 1956, Quarantine (Plants) Regulations 1935, and Quarantine (Animals) Regulations 1935.
New subregulation 10(1) items 12 and 13, 10(2) items 5 and 6, and regulation 12 items 4 and 5 each require that certain information must be reported under s.27A(2) of the Act (for regulation 10) and s.27B(2) of the Act (for regulation 12). Regulation 18 items 13 and 14 prescribe the matter about which a quarantine officer may require the master, commander, medical officer, or agent of certain vessels to answer questions. These requirements and reporting obligations arise `if any live animal is on board' the vessel, installation, or aircraft, or `if any animal died' during the voyage or flight. There is no indication whether these requirements and reporting obligations are intended to apply broadly to `any' live animal on board, regardless of whether the presence of the animal was actually known to the master of the vessel or commander of the aircraft. 
New subregulation 21(1) states that a person must not give or report information, or cause information to be given or reported to a quarantine officer under certain other regulations if that information is false or misleading in a material detail. A penalty of 50 penalty units is specified for breach. It is not stated that this is a strict liability offence, as is the case with new subregulations 27, 31, 34, and 58(1). There is no indication whether subregulation 21(1) is intended to impose liability regardless of the person's knowledge of the falsity or misleading nature of the information.
New subregulation 28(1) provides that a quarantine officer may secure any stores or waste that are on an overseas vessel or overseas installation at a port in Australia or the Cocos Islands. New subregulation 28(2) then provides that `a person' must not interfere with the stores or waste, or the means of its security, without the master's permission. Literally the reference to `a person' in subregulation (2) can include the quarantine officer who has caused the stores etc to be secured in the first place.
New subregulation 41(5) refers to a `communicable disease'. This term is not defined in the Regulations or in the Quarantine Act 1908.
New subregulation 76 specifies that an officer who seizes an animal, plant or other goods must give a notice `as soon as practicable' rather than stating a time limit.

"McKiernan, Sen Jim",ALP,2000-10-09,"—I present the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration entitled Review of Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000, together with the Hansard record of the committee's proceedings, minutes of the committee's proceedings and submissions received by the committee. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to incorporate the tabling statement into Hansard and to briefly speak to the report.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Madam President, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs referred the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No 2) 2000 to the Committee on 12 April 2000.
The Committee received 31 submissions on this very specialised area of legislation; it held public hearings in Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney, and heard evidence from eleven organisations.
On behalf of the Committee, I extend the committee's appreciation for the assistance given to this review by all those that provided submissions or gave evidence at public hearings.
The Bill's stated aim is to reduce the opportunity for non-permanent residents to seek to use judicial review of migration decisions to extend their stay in Australia. The Committee considered the issues raised in connection with the Bill and were unable to agree that the abuse of the system was proved or that the government's actions to prevent or halt the so-called abuse were warranted.
In addition, having examined the evidence put to it, the majority of the Committee concluded that the Bill's proposed restriction of access to judicial review by non-permanent residents did not breach Australia's international obligations.
The Committee agreed that the rejection by the courts of cases pursued through class actions in the migration jurisdiction did not necessarily indicate an abuse of the judicial review process.  However, the majority believed that judicial review provided an opportunity for abuse, and that there was persuasive evidence that this was occurring in the case of class actions.
The majority conclude that the opportunity for potential abuse arises because non-permanent resident applicants for judicial review automatically acquire bridging visas which entitle them to legally remain in Australia until 28 days after their case has been decided.  Class actions can take an average of 18 months to resolve, compared with approximately five months for an individual action.  The majority argues that the potential duration of class actions can be the incentive to pursue them, rather than a desire to resolve a point of migration law, or any expectation that members of a class action will acquire residency in Australia as a result of the class action.
The majority make a quite extraordinary suggestion that if a large number of participants do not benefit from a positive decision in the class action which they had joined, then this was a key determinant of their decision to support the aim of restricting access of non-permanent residents to class actions.  The Committee found it significant that some involved in class actions might not have even applied for the visa that was the subject of the action.
Overall, the majority concluded that, although not quantifiable, there had been an abuse of the judicial review and the class action process and that this abuse should be addressed.
The majority suggests that issues currently addressed by class actions could be appropriately handled through test cases.  Test cases permit a number of cases to be resolved through the hearing of a single case, and having the outcome apply to cases which have been identified as similar.  This arrangement permits efficient use of the court's resources.
The Committee notes the comments of witnesses on the Bill, that test cases would be precluded or that class actions in other, non-migration, jurisdictions would be prevented by the enactment of this bill.  The Committee therefore recommended that these potential unintended consequences of the Bill be clarified. 
With all of the above provisos, the majority concluded that
access to class actions should be restricted; and
there should be time limits placed on applications for judicial review of migration decisions.
President, class actions in the migration jurisdiction offer the opportunity for a number of cases to be resolved though the hearing of one appeal that represents many others.  This considerably reduces the case-load on courts.
Despite this, the majority supported the restriction of access to class actions in the migration jurisdiction; it considered that efficient use of the court system should be discouraged or even removed.  Therefore, in addition to recommending the adoption of the Bill's proposals for restriction on access to class actions, the majority also recommended steps to encourage more use of test cases.
The Committee also noted that some of the perceived abuses of judicial review would have arisen because of the advice which applicants had received about seeking review.
The Committee was critical of migration agents who encourage non-permanent residents to participate in class actions without apparent regard for the specifics of the individual's cases.
When unsuccessful applicants for judicial review are advised that, and I quote:
“you might be able to immediately qualify for our new class action, and to obtain a further Bridging Visa”
the potential for exploitation of both the legal system and the applicants is obvious.
In response to such approaches to migration litigation the Committee has recommended that the activities of migration agents be brought under closer and continuing scrutiny by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and the Migration Agents Registration Authority
The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000 also seeks to limit access to judicial review by more strictly defining those able to apply for it.  The proposed provisions are designed to ensure that only those who stand to benefit from the outcome of a review may bring a challenge in the Federal Court.
The Committee saw this as an important move to improve the operation of judicial review and recommended that the proposed changes to clarify who may commence or continue a proceeding in the Federal Court should be adopted.
The Bill proposes to impose time limits on applications for judicial review by the High Court.  The Committee noted that migration appeals to the Federal Court have to be undertaken within 28 days of a decision being notified.  However, no such time limit applies to the High Court.  That Court, therefore, was being asked to determine migration matters, rather than the more appropriate Federal Court.
The Committee noted that there are already time limits imposed in other jurisdictions. Evidence was presented to the Committee that the proposed time limit of 28 days was not unreasonable.
The Committee was sensitive to the importance of the High Court as the last resort for people seeking review of their migration status.  The Committee was advised that actions in the High Court do raise genuine life and death concerns.  The Committee therefore recommended an extended period for appeal to the High Court of 35 days.  The Committee believed that, because the initial application to the High Court required only an outline of the grounds for appeal, rather than a detailed argument, 35 days was a sufficient time period.
The Committee considered whether there should be an option for the High Court to waive the time limit in exceptional cases.  This approach, the majority believed, was at odds with the overall aim of the Bill, which is to limit judicial review being used as a means of remaining in Australia.  To allow such an exception would be to allow another avenue for non-permanent residents to extend their stay.
A number of submissions to the Committee raised the question of whether or not the Australian Constitution permitted such a time limit to be imposed.  There was no agreement on the position among the witnesses or the submissions.  The Committee concluded that the matter could only be resolved in the event of a constitutional challenge.
President, there was some confusion among some witnesses that access to the courts by non-permanent residents would be eliminated by this Bill.  This was a misunderstanding of the Bill.  Yes, there are restrictions.  But individuals still have access to judicial review if they appeal within a reasonable time and stand to benefit from the outcome.
The dissenting report by Opposition and Democrat members of the Committee provides a useful reminder that the Migration Legislation Amendment (Judicial Review) Bill 1998 is listed on the Senate Notice paper.  This bill seeks to further restrict access to judicial review in migration matters by inserting a privative clause in the Migration Act. 
The Bill was referred at a time when the Committee had already embarked upon a program with respect to two other inquiries.  This caused some delay in reporting on this reference. 
On behalf of the Committee, I would like to extend the gratitude of the members of the committee to the committee secretariat: Gill Gould, Steve Dyer, Emma Herd and Vishal Pandey.  I thank them very much for the help that they gave to all committee members during the committee hearings and inquiry.
Madam President, I commend this report to the Senate.
—I thank the Senate. The opposition members and the Democrat member of the committee have made a dissenting report. Whilst the tabling statement incorporates, in the main, the words of the committee as were read to the House of Representatives earlier today, I want to add a few words that would express the views of the opposition and possibly the Democrats—although they can perhaps speak for themselves, in speaking to the report.
The opposition members of the committee and the opposition as a whole welcomed this inquiry and welcomed the opportunity to test, in the public arena, a number of theories that abound about the system of judicial review in the migration area. This Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000 is brought into the parliament of Australia essentially to address what is called the `abuse' of class actions in the judicial review area. The bill provided the minister, his department and all those interested with the opportunity to present the committee and therefore the parliament with details of the abuses that are occurring within the system. At the conclusion of the inquiry, after hearing from the department and receiving a number of submissions from officers of the department, I am both saddened and pleased to note that that evidence has just not been presented to the committee. I am saddened, on the one hand, because the minister and the department are proved to be incorrect in their public statements about what is purported to be happening in the community. I am also pleased because it does give the opportunity, when this bill comes on for debate in the House of Representatives and in this place, for us to put the department and the representatives of government under greater scrutiny to ask where the evidence of the abuse of the process is occurring.
We have ended up, at the conclusion of the inquiry, in rather a strange circumstance. The report, at 3.34, states:
The Committee also considered that migration class actions were not, of themselves, an abuse of process. However, the Committee considered that the process could be subject to abuse—
as indeed any process in any part of our democratic system in this country could be subject to abuse. The report goes on, at 3.49, to state:
Overall, the Committee concluded that, although not quantifiable, there was abuse of the class action process and that this abuse should be addressed.
What an extraordinary statement for a parliamentary committee to be making! They are saying that our system of judicial review is being abused but we cannot measure it. Despite all the resources available to the minister, to his department, to the Attorney-General's Department and to the various law councils throughout Australia, we cannot measure it. Is it any wonder that the opposition members of the committee concluded, at the conclusion of the inquiry, that the evidence just was not available to it? The committee's report includes, at 3.101—and this is a very telling statement in itself—the following statement:
... it is also noted that the DIMA evidence indicated that detailed examination of the individuals in class actions had not been undertaken systematically, apparently because of the volume of applications. This meant that its data were only indicative, rather than conclusive evidence of the scale of apparent abuse.
What an appalling indictment of the committee itself, where they admit that the evidence is not available but they are going to go out and recommend to the parliament of Australia that this equitable and accessible avenue for individuals to seek justice in this country be removed from the statute books! The opposition members are not going to go along with actions such as that. I make the point, and make it very, very strongly, as indeed we do within the dissenting report: if the system of review of migration decisions is being abused or taken advantage of by individuals who do not need to access or have the advantage of the system, the opposition members will look at that, will seek out the evidence of that, will seek out the proof of where the abuses are occurring, and then we will address it. But regrettably for the minister and his department, that evidence was not presented to the committee on this particular occasion.  
Government members of the committee make the point, at 3.128 on page 40 of the report, that `judicial review would still be available to applicants through the lodgement of an individual appeal', that is, they say that, if the access to class actions in the federal system was removed, judicial review would still be available. Opposition members of the committee were very mindful of the fact that the Migration Legislation Amendment (Judicial Review) Bill 1998 [2000] is still listed on the Senate Notice Paper. This bill seeks to further restrict access to judicial review in migration matters by inserting a privative clause in the Migration Act. Government members of the committee might be comforted by the fact that if you remove the access to class actions you can still undertake individual actions, but if this other bill is passed the access to individual actions will be restricted in a number of areas.
I also make the point that, of the seven recommendations in the committee's report, opposition members are only opposing one recommendation—that is, recommendation 1, which addresses the removal of class actions. Other matters contained in the bill are of value and of use and are objective in what they are seeking to do. We have tested those in the course of the committee's proceedings, and we end up supporting what is being proposed by the minister and his department.
There is one final point I want to end on, and I have addressed this matter in the Senate on a recent occasion—that is, the actions of migration agents and lawyers who act in this field. The committee as a whole found that some migration agents and lawyers were exploiting the procedures about class actions. The committee recommends—and we join them in this recommendation—that the activities of migration agents be brought under the closer, continuing scrutiny of DIMA and the Migration Agents Registration Authority. We would like very quick and immediate action regarding that recommendation. I refer the Senate back to an earlier speech of mine where I expressed my disappointment that the representatives of the Migration Agents Registration Authority, who were appearing at a Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee estimates hearing in May or June of this year, were not aware of pretty damning advertising that had taken place to recruit people to become part of class actions. We ended up with the scenario where the representatives of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs were saying yes, they were told, but the MARA representatives were looking dumbfounded. It was only later that they brought their omission to the Senate's attention.
Overall, this is a useful report. Despite the shortcomings of the report, despite the lack of evidence that the system is being abused, we look forward to further specific debate on the bill when it comes before the parliament. We hope that by then the government would have had second thoughts about the removal of class actions from the migration area. On the whole, I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2000</title>,<title>Report of Migration Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-10-09,"—As the Democrats representative on the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, I would also like to speak to this report. It is a little bit unusual for legislation to be referred to a joint committee rather than one of the Senate legislation committees but I think it is quite appropriate in this context, with a committee that specialises in migration issues having the opportunity to examine migration legislation and perhaps the policy and legislative end of some of the broader issues that the committee looks at from time to time. I will not repeat my views on the issues and the legislation, as they are contained within the dissenting report along with the views of the Labor Party senators. They are on the record. I would like to thank opposition members for their assistance and the secretariat for their work on the inquiry. 
Assuming that the government brings this legislation on, at some stage we will have the opportunity to debate it—although we must keep in mind the government's record on another piece of legislation that was supposedly meant to deal with inappropriate activities and abuse, the so-called privative clause legislation, which has been sitting on the Notice Paper for a long time now. The government has chosen not to bring that on for debate, and one can never tell for sure whether or not one will get the chance to discuss the legislation in this chamber because one never knows whether the government will ever get around to bringing it on. The Migration Legislation Amendment (Judicial Review) Bill 1998 [2000] has been adjourned here since 2 December 1998. Despite the government repeatedly saying that the Senate is holding up consideration of that issue, it is clearly the government that is choosing not to bring it on—not that that troubles me terribly, because it is an appalling piece of legislation and I would be quite happy to throw it out. 
With regard to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000, the Democrats share the concerns that have been expressed by Senator McKiernan, for a number of reasons. We are always anxious whenever we see a proposal for some people in Australia to have fewer legal rights than others—in this case, people who are seeking to pursue their legal rights under the Migration Act, whether they are asylum seekers or people dealing with other migration matters—and for them not to have the same right as other Australians to use class actions. Certainly one would be apprehensive about agreeing to a principle like that unless a clear need and good cause for it were shown. As Senator McKiernan has outlined, comprehensive evidence was not provided by the department about the extent, the size, the nature or the impact of the abuse. Indeed, it was hard to even get a clear statement from the department or government as to whether this measure would save money, as was suggested in the explanatory memorandum, or actually cost money. Obviously, class actions are a very efficient form of pursuing legal ends and legal means. If even a proportion of those who are signed up to class actions—or who would otherwise have signed up to class actions in the future—chose or were forced to pursue those actions individually, it would lead to a huge increase in costs and in the workload of the High Court. We already see growing concerns about the workload of the High Court specifically as a result of the changes to legislation made by this government in the area of migration law, and the Democrats would be very concerned about adding to that burden.
I would also say that it seems strange to the Democrats that the government chose this particular area as their focus of action to deal with this so-called problem, this unquantified problem, of misuse and abuse of the legal system when there are other avenues—I would suggest far more potentially effective avenues—of targeting misuse and misconduct by lawyers or by migration agents. Obviously, if any abuse is there, these are the people that are facilitating it. Very little seems to have been done by the government to target that type of area of activity. Until stronger efforts are made in that regard, it is very hard to take the government seriously as to what they are saying is their intent. From my perspective, it is much more likely that this is simply about this government once again trying to reduce the legal rights of people in the area of migration law.
I share the concern in relation to some of the comments Senator McKiernan made about MARA, the Migration Agents Registration Authority, although I would probably be slightly less critical in the sense that I think it is a group of people that is still finding its way somewhat as a body that has been recently set up, and it is still coming to grips with its role, how it will operate and indeed how it relates to the department. If the department were serious about this issue, it would have done a lot more to follow up communication with MARA. Nonetheless, I hope that the issue that was raised is properly examined by MARA. We often run into difficult areas in relation to lawyers touting for business, and this is no different in that regard.  
I would be a bit apprehensive about being too critical about some of the advertisements that were put forward as examples of alleged abuse, again in the sense that you are often dealing with people who do not have a good understanding of our legal system and people who do not necessarily have a good understanding of English. If you want to make people aware that they have a legal right, you sometimes do that in a fairly simplistic way to make sure it is clear and that they understand the message. And, if people do have a legal right to pursue, it is not necessarily problematic for a legal firm to make them aware that they may have that right. Having said that, it is not helpful for our legal system—and, indeed, for some of the people involved in some of these issues—if these people are given false hopes by migration agents or lawyers that pursuing a particular avenue is likely to end up in a positive outcome for them when in some cases clearly that is not the case. I think that area of activity really does need to be examined more closely because it is not only adding costs and delay to our legal system but adding costs to those individual people who are being given false hope. This leads to stress and unhappiness when they are continually strung along thinking there is hope there when clearly there is not. In my situation, dealing with immigration issues for the Democrats, I do come across people who have quite genuinely pursued avenue after avenue in the belief that it is going to get them somewhere when you really feel they would be better served by someone having told them, years earlier in the piece, `Look, you're not going to succeed. You're better off just accepting that.' It would save them a lot of unnecessary hardship, heartache and expense. So I do urge more action in that regard.
Overall, the report is positive, even the majority report, which obviously I dissent from. In terms of the information that the inquiry managed to identify, and the gaps as well that were able to be identified through the questioning and inquiry process, it was a thorough inquiry. The Democrats will maintain our opposition in the absence of any evidence being forthcoming about the pressing need for such a drastic move. We look forward to the government either bringing forward the evidence or bringing the legislation on for debate so that at least we can explore that further through the second reading and committee stages of the process and also deal with the other parts of legislation that we are not opposed to.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-10-09,"—When we were discussing this legislation last week, I sought deferral on the basis that there was a particular problem with respect to fixed price non-reviewable contracts which affected—and probably still do affect—a whole range of government utilities across at least four states. Our concern was that, to the extent that those contracts were fixed term, there was no capacity to pass on the penalty charge to the contracting parties. The issue is complex. The reason we deferred this legislation was to give the parties some extra time to get into the debate and to give the minister some time to focus on the issue when he returned from his most recent trip overseas and before the next one. I gather this issue has attracted some discussion between lawyers on behalf of the Australian Greenhouse Office and Macquarie Generation. In a sense, it has probably been disappointing that Macquarie Generation has been the only company which has been prepared to get into discussion with the government. I was led to believe that there might have been other companies as well.
We have come to a stage now where, I gather, discussions have not led to any consensual outcome. I gather the parties are still at odds, although the one extra bit of information that has come out is that, once the legislation is passed, particularly clauses 111 and 160, the regulator will have access to contracts to be able to satisfy himself or herself as to the powers of review that may be encompassed in the contracts. Without consensus, we have to make a decision as to whether we would proceed with the amendments that we were contemplating last week. We had not formulated those amendments and put them into the Senate last week—basically, they were amendments that Macquarie Generation put to the government.
It is our view now that we have identified a problem, but we are not sure that the amendments would satisfactorily rectify the problem, nor are we sure that the amendments would not have unintended consequences. If we were to allow for total passing on to the contracting parties, it has been put to us by some in the Green movement that this may take the pressure off some of these utilities to focus on renewable sources and not have to pay the penalties. I raise this issue in this context once again for the minister. It is an issue which concerns not just us but I gather at least four state governments. It is an issue which may contain a degree of inequity in the way that the government's legislation will impact on consumers and taxpayers as opposed to the contracting parties. I ask the minister whether he is prepared to have these issues as part of an ongoing scrutiny with a view to ensuring, if any problems do arise—if they do, they will arise in the immediate future—that the government is prepared to come back to this place to rectify the problems.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-10-09,"—Firstly, can I record my thanks to Senator Ian Campbell, who ably looked after this matter last week; although, I regret to say, he was unable to complete the matter. The issue which has just been raised by Senator Bolkus has been one which the government have been considering for some time. I think it is fair to say that, while the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Bill 2000 clearly sets out the liable parties—and that was in terms of the government's decision on the matter—we nevertheless expected that the cost would be passed on. Macquarie Generation have suggested to the government that they will not be able to pass on some costs because of the terms of certain contracts. Unfortunately, they have not been prepared to show us those contracts. It is very difficult for the government to verify that circumstance. Macquarie Generation, through their solicitors, have suggested a number of alternative courses that we might consider. At one stage, the course involves amendments that specifically mentioned their contracts. 
In more recent times, amendments have been in more generic terms but, nevertheless, I presume, in such terms that Macquarie Generation believe that their contracts would be covered; in other words, they would refer to an acquisition of electricity that is pursuant to an agreement entered into before a certain date and would cover certain quantities of electricity, and so forth. I think honourable senators would understand that, in such vague circumstances, it really is very difficult for the government to address the issue of Macquarie Generation. Senator Bolkus has suggested that there may be others who also have a difficulty in this regard. As far as I know, no other party has come forward on the matter. We therefore think the bill should stand as it is.
If passage is achieved and Macquarie come forward and convince us that they are unable to pass on the cost, we would look to see whether there was any course of action that we could take. I would not want that interpreted as an undertaking to legislate further, because preliminary examination indicates that such legislative amendment may have a range of inadvertent consequences addressing not so much how it relates to Macquarie but how it might relate to other parties, how that might affect the intention of the original bill, whether it could be done under this legislation or whether it would require a separate piece of legislation of a different type. 
There is a whole range of complex legal questions involved in this matter, therefore all I can indicate at this stage is that, if, after passage, Macquarie believe that they are in some way discriminated against in relation to their existing contracts, we would be prepared to look at the matter further. I presume that, in that circumstance, if they did take the matter seriously, they would provide the contracts for the consideration of the government's lawyers, and we would see whether anything could be done to assist. That is as far as we are prepared to go. Senator Bolkus said there is a provision in the bill that could allow the regulator to call in the contracts, but that was not the purpose of that provision. The provision, as I recall it, was part of the enforcement provisions of the legislation to ensure there is no abuse. Senator Bolkus is talking of using that provision for a significantly different purpose for which it was not designed.
I think that, if, after the passage of this legislation, Macquarie do seriously believe they have been disadvantaged, they will come forward with their contracts, will seek to openly make out their case and will give us the chance to verify the information, by which time we no doubt will know whether any party has been similarly affected or whether other parties have been affected in a different way but in a way that could have a similar consequence. We would look at all of those circumstances at that time. We obviously want the legislation to work effectively. It is a new scheme for Australia, and it is innovative, but whenever you get into legislating in a new area there is the chance of inadvertent consequences. That is something that any sensible government would look at when the scheme is in operation and has been put into practice. That is how we are approaching the matter.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-10-09,"—The answer the minister gave is totally unsatisfactory. A major problem with this legislation has been identified by a major generator in New South Wales. To put the case simply, the problem is due to a bulk buyer of electricity being under a contract which cannot be altered. The extra cost of producing renewable energy is not to be passed on to them, so who does it get passed on to? It is the generator of the electricity that has to make up the cost of providing the new—what the government calls `ecofriendly'—power. It gets passed on to all the other consumers. That means that the cost involved goes on to the rest of the retail sector in New South Wales, and that includes home owners, while the big aluminium processor is freed of that cost through their contractual arrangement for however long their contract might go. I understand that in this case it may be as far away as the year 2017, so it is for the next 17 years. 
It is not a small matter. The bulk buyer involved purchases 10 per cent of the electricity in New South Wales, so it means that other consumers will be paying at least 10 per cent more of the added cost, if there is added cost, for providing green energy. The minister is unable to say that this is not the case. We do understand that he has traversed the argument. He knows there is a problem, but he has not come up with an answer. He says that, if we wait until some future time, there will be a review if this problem really surfaces—notwithstanding the fact that it is already on the surface—and that something could be done about it. It is totally unsatisfactory. The minister, Senator Hill, is effectively prepared to expose all the rest of the New South Wales consumers—at least those supplied by this generator—to an unnecessary, unfair and unwarranted cost. The argument that you cannot deal with this is specious; of course you can. There is a very specific problem here, and amendments have been put forward by the people who have spotted that problem. It is up to the government to come up with better amendments.
The minister has indicated that other generators may have the same problem. Tasmania is one of them. As you will know, Mr Temporary Chairman Murphy, some 66 per cent of the power in Tasmania is bought by bulk contractors. They are secret contracts, as is this one in New South Wales. I have spoken with the Hydro Electric Corporation in Tasmania, and they say that, whilst the biggest contract there, which is with Comalco, may not be a problem because it has been recently drawn up in light of the changes to the Tasmanian system—whereby the Hydro Electric Corporation produces the power and Aurora sells it—some of the other bulk contracts are not in that league, and there could be a problem with some of them. It is not known, but they could fall into this same situation in New South Wales. I put it to the government that that burden of extra cost on Tasmanian small business and house-holders will be comparatively greater. There is an identifiable problem here. Without fixing it, there is not just the risk on the face of it but the reality of an unfair cost going on to small business and to home owners in at least two states—and very likely in more states.
I understand that the government is not prepared to furnish its legal advice. That is not new. But it is not acceptable for the government to say, `There's a problem here that we'll deal with later.' The time to deal with this is while this legislation is before this committee. Senator Bolkus brought the problem forward; the government should fix it. Unless of course the government says, `There is no problem.' That is very evidently not the situation as far as the minister is concerned. He has not said that. He cannot say that, because there is a problem. All he has said is, `We don't know how to fix it,' or `We don't quite know how extensive the problem is.'
It is totally unsatisfactory for a minister to put that to this committee, and I suggest that the minister roll up his sleeves and do some work on this. It is totally unacceptable to leave this to be fixed up further down the line. It is sloppy and unacceptable for Senator Hill to come in here and say, `There's a problem in the offing but I'm not going to do anything about it because it looks too hard.' If it is too difficult for him he should give it to somebody else. It is an identifiable problem coming from the industry itself that needs fixing at this juncture while the legislation is before this committee. It ought not be too difficult for the opposition to amend the legislation to fix the problem. Senator Bolkus moved last Thursday that we wait until today so that the government would have the time to consider the legislation and to fix it. All we get from the government is that, yes, they agree there is a problem but they are not going to do anything about it. That is totally unacceptable. 
 (Senator Murphy)—The question is that the bill be now passed without requests.
—I do not agree that the bill should be passed in this unacceptable form, and I hope that will be recorded.
—That is your prerogative. It certainly will be and I am sure Hansard have taken note of the point you have made. I put the question again: that the bill be now passed without requests.
—You have spoken twice, Senator Brown. I understand that you have asked that your opposition to this motion be recorded. I assume that is what you are seeking to do again but I am just finalising the question that I did previously put.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-10-09,"—I move Democrats' amendment No. 1:
(1)	Clause 3, page 2 (lines 4 to 9), omit the clause, substitute: 
Simplified outline
		The following is a simplified outline of this Act:
This Act prohibits a person from providing an Interactive gambling service, unless the person was already providing, or was licensed to provide, the service before the commencement day.
The prohibition ceases 3 months after the Act commences.
I believe we were listening to Senator Lundy when this debate was adjourned earlier. Just to reiterate: the aim behind the Australian Democrats' proposed—and what we consider workable—solution is to give credence to some form of moratorium that is non-retrospective and that, therefore, does not carry with it some of the compensation problems that have been outlined previously in this debate. 
I want to respond very briefly to some of the assertions—or attacks—from the minister. Firstly, it is a little unfair—an understatement—of the minister to suggest that this is motivated by a stunt or by not really caring about the issue or by the Democrats not having realistic concerns about the issue of gambling or, should I say, problem gambling. That is another distinction this government fails to make. Just because people gamble in whatever arena, in whatever form, does not necessarily make them pathological or problem gamblers. That distinction might be lost on people who have not been intimately involved in this debate. 
I reject the minister's assertions made earlier in this debate. Minister—through you, Chair—if we did not want to participate in this debate, if we did not think that it was a worthy and perhaps unique opportunity to debate both the social and the legal issues, then we would not have come to you with a proposed alternative. You may not like the alternative, but it is a little churlish of you to make out that this was done as a stunt or as an attempt to show you up. We showed quite a degree of goodwill in attempting to discuss this with you and your office. To that extent we have had regular contact with your office. We were keen to seek some common ground that would further the interests of those people who were concerned about this debate. That was an unfair accusation. 
Clearly, it seems that the debate is not going to progress. We are aware of both the government's and the Labor Party's views on this. There is an impasse. It was an impasse that we sought to redress, not necessarily with a compromise but with a workable proposition that fixed up some of the flaws that we considered a part of the government's proposal. It proposed not simply—as the government said in its explanatory memorandum and as the minister reminded us in this debate—to pause the development of the Australian based interactive gambling industry and to allow for an investigation into the feasibility and consequences of banning interactive gambling, because that is not what we see as the key objectives here. What we were offering was a real solution that would examine strategies to ensure that harm minimisation strategies were implemented, that there was a national public education campaign and counselling support and that all those services were examined. 
I acknowledge—and the minister placed it on record earlier today—that this is not a `long-term solution'. Indeed, it is a very short-sighted, short-term, populist solution designed to result in no particular assistance to those people who may have problems in relation to gambling. The memorandum itself has exposed the government's agenda, and that is to look at banning—not necessarily to look at regulation or services that might assist those people. 
Clearly there is an impasse. It is one that the Democrats and, I acknowledge, Senator Harris have tried to break. I get the impression that neither of the old parties will even be considering amendments in this debate. On that note, Minister Alston did mention that a majority of my colleagues support the proposition we have put forward. In fact, all my colleagues support the solution proposed on behalf of the Democrats. At least one Democrat senator has indicated in this chamber that he has concerns with the issue of gambling and therefore would probably support the legislation. Funnily enough, that does not seem to threaten the Democrats as much as it threatens Senator Alston. It is absurd for him to pretend that he may not be aware of that fact. Of course he knew, otherwise his staff would not have been madly ringing every Democrat senator's office this morning. You probably would have got a bit more support if you had not done that, Minister. We actually respect the fact that we will have differing views on this issue.  
We also acknowledge that this is an issue that requires an understanding of the complexities of the technology involved as well as a compassion for, and a willingness to try to do something about, some of the adverse social consequences of gambling. I think there are a number of people in this chamber who are coming to grips with that and who are recognising that the legislation before us does nothing to assist that and that amendments would be the best way to go. But I see the writing on the wall and recognise that probably most of our amendments will be defeated. I think that is a great shame. As I said, if, as the government believe, we were doing this as a stunt, we would not have been so keen to interact with both them and the ALP to try to come up with a solution. We will see how the vote goes—and be it on your head, Minister.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-10-09,"—I should perhaps indicate that the Labor Party will not be supporting this Democrat amendment. As I am sure all other senators would be aware—they would know from the contributions in the second reading debate that occurred earlier, some of which occurred last Thursday—the Labor Party is opposed to this legislation in total, as has been indicated by a number of speakers, including me. I will not go over the reasons for that on this amendment; we have our reasons on the record as to our concerns about this legislation. 
There is one issue that I do want to raise at this stage, Minister, and that is compensation. You might be able to address this now; I certainly hope so. As I am sure everyone who is familiar with this legislation is aware, there have been a significant number of companies which have developed product and which have been caught by the May deadline. They have spent very significant amounts of money in the development of their product. It is on the record on page 56 of the Hansard. I did refer to this one because it relates to my home state of Tasmania by way of example. The Federal group—which, so that people are aware, actually owned and operated Australia's first legal casino—according to evidence given to the Senate committee, have spent some $14 million in developing their web site. I have had the opportunity to look in some detail at what Federal Hotels have developed. It is an impressive product in terms of the safety and security in a variety of areas. I will not go into that in detail but, nevertheless, they have spent some $14 million. I do not have figures available for other individual companies, but I am aware that the Northern Territory government indicated in June this year that a High Court challenge may be mounted if this bill is passed. The ACT government, according to page 55 of the Hansard, has sought general advice about possible compensation.
In short, has the government obtained legal advice about the implications of compensation and/or litigation, given the stated intentions of state and territory governments? There certainly seems to me to be the possibility of legal action by at least some of the companies that have developed product and that have been caught or will be caught if this legislation is passed. They are significant issues. They are issues of concern not only to those people who are affected by the legislation but also to the opposition in that there could be an ongoing legal saga if this legislation is passed, with significant ongoing cost implications for the Commonwealth. We would like some indication of what the government's attitude is in respect of those matters.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2000-10-09,"—I listened to what Senator Sherry said. He raised the question of the issue of Federal Hotels. I would like a bit of clarification on this amendment. This amendment actually covers that situation, as I understand it. In other words, in Federal's case the licence was actually issued before the commencement date. This amendment would take that into account and, therefore, satisfies that side of the argument. I come back to the point that the government is genuinely trying to give a message to those who are involved in online gambling that there has to be a good look at this before it is too late. I think most of us would agree that the greater the extension of gambling opportunities, the greater the number of problem gamblers there will be. The reason I raise this is to ask Senator Stott Despoja for clarification. I presume we are only dealing with amendment (1) on sheet No. 1935. Is that right? 
—Yes. 
—On that particular one I assume that what I have suggested is correct. Amendment (1) states:
This Act prohibits a person from providing an Interactive gambling service, unless the person was already providing, or was licensed to provide, the service before the commencement day.
Is that likely to cover it?
—Yes.
—I am getting an acknowledgment there.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-10-09,"—In speaking to the Democrats' amendment, for clarification for the chamber I would like to acknowledge the reason why One Nation has not continued with the first of our amendments—and that is because it is substantially similar to the Democrats' amendment. The Democrats' single amendment covers two of our proposed amendments. So I support the Democrats' amendment to this bill. In speaking to that, I would like to address a couple of issues that arose during the second reading debate.
In Senator Ellison's speech just prior to lunch, he inferred that gaming and wagering were basically equivalent when viewed in relation to problems with compulsive gamblers. I believe that there is nothing that could be further from the truth. In actuality, gaming machines—that is, poker machines—represent 76 per cent of the turnover, on average, of gambling, and wagering represents 14 per cent. There is an enormous difference in the amount of money that is being invested in gaming and wagering. The Australian gambling statistics for the year 1998-99 clarify that situation extremely well. In New South Wales, $964 per capita was spent in total wagering—that is oncourse totalising, oncourse bookmaking and offcourse bookmaking. I am not for one moment saying that that is not a substantial amount of money and that we in this chamber should not have concerns that that amount of money is being spent by each and every person in New South Wales. But compare that with the gaming machines, by themselves, where $7,260 per person was spent on average. In Victoria, there are similar figures: the total wagering was $866 and gaming machines $5,842. We are not a great degree better in Queensland; it causes me great concern that on wagering we in Queensland are spending on average $651. But the difference is there again on gaming machines: $2,040 was spent on gaming machines alone. So for the minister to stand up and infer that the problems with gaming machines and wagering are one and the same is, I think, grossly misleading this chamber.
The legislation in its current form is retrospective legislation, because it affects the rights. People in this industry have, on the receipt of government licences, gone out and expended considerable amounts of money on both research and development and on employment. The minister said that 12 months is a short time. I would hate the minister to have to hold his breath for 12 months, because that is about the same effect it is going to have on the Internet technology relating to the gaming industry. Twelve months is a huge period.
The other issue we need to focus our minds on is: is there any influence by the haves and the have-nots? A group of people have paid for their licences and have got their sites up and operating. Has there been any influence by them on the government to exclude those who have been granted licences but do not have their operations up and running? These are questions that I believe have not been answered.
The industry itself turns over $1.56 billion; it is a substantial industry. I believe the majority of senators in this chamber, if we had the ability to have that amount of money transformed into development capital for development in Australia, would all prefer to see it going there where its benefits for this country would be substantially greater. But that is not the case, so we need to look at this industry from the overall perspective of what the government is setting out to do. 
The government has said that the primary motivation for this bill is to protect the Australian people from the effects of Internet gambling for a period of 12 months. If that is its reason for this bill, then the government should support the amendments that are going to be moved in this chamber subsequently, amendments which would have that effect in a more fulfilling way. The government's bill fails in that all it does is restrict the Australian operators while leaving the playing field wide open for the industry that is set up offshore. If the government is genuinely concerned about the effects that this form of gambling is going to have on both the Australian people and the Australian economy, then it should be supportive of measures that would make it far more effective.
In conclusion, I support the Democrats amendment, because in the simplified outline that the Democrats have put forward there is a reference to a licence that was provided. If we are going to have a moratorium, then the exception to it should apply to all of those participants who have paid for their licences and who have been granted their licences. They should be on the same footing as anyone who was granted a licence and had their business up and operating. I commend the Democrats amendment to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-10-09,"—I will deal firstly with Senator Stott Despoja's contribution to the debate. I do not know whether or not it is deliberate, but there seems to me to be a refusal to face up to what is essentially being put forward by the Democrats: a proposal which is not a moratorium proposal. It is using the term `moratorium' to cover the fact that the Democrats are opposed to a ban; they are in favour of harm minimisation. That is the start, middle and end of what the Democrats are on about, whereas we want a breathing period to look at all the options, including a ban. That is really where the difference lies. I took exception to Senator Stott Despoja saying that she would not contemplate going down this path because she was not satisfied that we were not motivated by concern for the polls—a statement I find offensive because intellectually it is quite dishonest. It means you are not prepared to look at the legislation on its merits. It then turns on whether or not you accept our bona fides—and that is an absolutely treacherous stretch of sand to walk on. You cannot ever vote on legislation depending upon what you might think of someone's bona fides—for example, I might prefer yours but not those of one of your colleagues. I thought the whole underpinning of your reasoning was an absolute nonsense to disguise the fact that you were never interested in a moratorium as such, that you were never interested in a ban; you were interested in harm minimisation. Harm minimisation is one of those matters that may well emerge—
—Have you read the Netbets report by the Democrats, Minister?
—Yes, I have. I have also read your response, which promotes a three-month period of time. No-one can tell when it starts or finishes, so no-one would have any idea who is covered by it. Anyone who was in any shape or form interested in avoiding it would simply start up now. If you were so slow as to have been asleep at the wheel before the thing was proclaimed, you might be caught, but otherwise it is business as usual for virtually every operator or aspiring operator in the country. If that is not a farce and a charade, I do not know what is. I hope you will understand why I regard this as nothing more than window-dressing. I acknowledge that you have made a number of attempts to persuade us to back away from a moratorium, to back away from a ban and to settle for harm minimisation, but they are all the sorts of things that can be looked at during the period of the moratorium. You look at what is feasible, you look at what is economically and socially desirable, and you may well in the course of that come to the view that harm minimisation is a better path to travel. That is not our predisposition, but the whole purpose of having an open mind during the moratorium period is to honestly examine those issues. You have closed your minds to that. You have decided that there are no circumstances in which a ban is justified, and you have effectively decided that there are no circumstances in which a moratorium is justified. You simply want to carry on with what the states have been talking about for some years, and that is harm minimisation strategies. As I have said to you more than once, the tougher those are the more likely it is that people will avoid them and go offshore.  
Quite clearly, the proposition of the Democrats—and, by extension, of Senator Harris—does not commend itself to the government. To have a non-fixed and prospective commencement date does not give anyone any sense of what might be caught down the track. A lot of the criticism of this plan—and I will move on to the compensation issue next—is that, because some people have already embarked upon a business plan, we should not put at risk their hard-spent dollars. There is such a thing as legislative risk. There is such a thing as an obligation on governments to take action in areas where they have concerns or where they believe the community might be justified in having concerns. We can go back almost 12 months to the time when the Prime Minister effectively put the gambling community on notice by saying that the government would have a serious look at Internet gambling, obviously with a view to taking some action to restrain or prohibit it. That is what has eventuated, and that is why 19 May was ultimately selected as a date—so that people would have some certainty. A few people were up and running by that date, and therefore they qualify. The mere fact that people might have been granted licences even some years ago is surely not a basis on which government should be paralysed or intimidated out of taking what the community might regard as sensible action. Therefore, the government simply do not accept the proposition that, because some people have started to spend money in a particular area, it is all too hard and we should throw in the towel. 
In terms of compensation, all the advice available to us is that the Commonwealth has clear constitutional powers to regulate Australia's communication services, and that includes interactive gaming and gambling. The advice also confirms that acquisition of property claims are unlikely to succeed because there is not a clear reciprocal benefit to any other party. We cannot guarantee that people will not take action, but once again the mere threat that someone might take action that might bog down in the courts and protract the resolution of an issue surely cannot be a sufficient reason for governments not to even get into the business in the first place. Others are entitled to take their own legal advice. I must say most of the people who have spoken to me have proceeded on the basis that the Commonwealth does have clear constitutional powers, just as the states in many respects have a lot of the other powers to do with traditional gambling, and that is why the responsibility has been in their courts. To the extent that they have been derelict, you can well argue that there is a case for further intervention. But the powers of the Commonwealth to intervene in those areas are certainly not clear and stand in marked contradistinction to its powers in relation to interactive services.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-10-09,"—I have a process query, Chair. I wonder whether the chamber would agree to my moving the first three Democrat amendments en bloc. I realise that a couple of those amendments are identical to those proposed by Senator Harris of One Nation, but it might facilitate this debate, given that most of the arguments have been canvassed.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2000-10-09,"—Can I explain why I think leave cannot be granted. I will be seeking to amend the boxed area of the proposition that is before the chair by deleting the words `the commencement day' and inserting in lieu thereof `19 May 2000', and by deleting the second dot point.
—Leave is not granted. I think that makes it clear that we might put the subsequent ones together but at this stage we are looking at Democrat amendment No. 1. ",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-10-09,"—I would like to briefly place on record that some of the amendments that I will move have different purposes from the Democrats' amendments, and I will continue to move those amendments.
—Senator Harradine, we may need you to move your amendments now.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2000-10-09,"—I was not going to move them now; I would move them after this was disposed of.
—You are not moving an amendment to Democrat amendment No. 1?
—In the end, Madam Chair, what I would like to see is this. I acknowledge that the government had to make a decision about this matter and I acknowledge that 19 May 2000 is the date on which it made the announcement. I disagree, with respect, with Senator Stott Despoja that this is retrospective legislation. The announcement was made on that date and the government has introduced the legislation, which operates from the particular date. But the difference I have with the government is simply on the question of whether or not a licence was provided. While the government includes in its legislation a person who was already providing a service, I believe it is fairer to include those who were licensed to provide the service as well before 19 May 2000. So what I would be proposing by way of an amendment—I will write it out shortly—is the deletion of the words in the first dot point `the commencement day' and the insertion of the words `19 May 2000', and the deletion of the second dot point.
—So you are suggesting that the best way to operate would be to deal with the Democrat amendment first and then come to you. We will proceed in that manner.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2000-10-09,"—I would like to make a number of general comments. First of all, I give a clear indication of Labor's position on the amendments before us. Labor will not be supporting any amendments because this legislation is beyond salvation. Whilst I acknowledge the efforts of those who have spoken from the crossbench about their concerns about problem gambling, I maintain, and Labor maintains, that this bill is not designed in any way, shape or form to assist those afflicted with problem gambling in this country. The fact that the coalition's rhetoric associated with this bill dwells on harm associated with problem gambling typifies the fact that they are trying to once again demonise the Internet as being the source of social harm, either currently or in the future.
I also acknowledge Minister Alston's comments about harm minimisation and how somehow a position opposing this particular bill relates to a stance on harm minimisation or any other approach, such as prohibition, to gambling in this country. It seems to me to have lowered the sophistication of this debate somewhat to have to remind Senator Alston that prohibition does not work as a solution to resolving problems, no matter what their nature, and that as a civil society we acknowledge that some people will always have problems of some sort and that the most responsible course of action of a legislature is to put in place structures to support a wide range of people across society and a whole range of experiences, acknowledging that we are not able, in our red-carpeted rooms, to prevent them from coming to any harm whatsoever.
In saying all of these things, I would like to reinforce the original point which underpins Labor's position. The Interactive Gambling (Moratorium) Bill 2000 is not about gambling; it is about a government trying to position the Internet in a place where it is demonised and the source of social harm—in this case, it is gambling. Last year, during debate on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill, it was pornography. I remember distinctly, in the emotive way that the coalition pursue anti-Internet legislation, that the word `paedophilia' was used in a way that perpetuated the fear associated with the Internet. Here we are hearing about harm minimisation. This is not a debate about the merits or otherwise of gambling and how we as a legislature protect people. To vote against this bill is in no way voting against the fact that we need to address issues of social harm relating to gambling. As I said before, I acknowledge those sentiments expressed in the chamber because Labor have expressed them ourselves. We have expressed them in the form of a successful second reading amendment and we will continue our positive endeavours to find a way forward to address the issues of social harm relating to gambling. 
I say to the Democrats, in acknowledging their comments, that it is entirely valid that you hold those concerns and views and vote against this government's bill. You will not be perceived in any way, shape or form as not having those concerns and not caring to the greatest of your ability. In fact, voting for this bill demonstrates that you acknowledge and in some way you actually respect the government's pitiful manipulative tactics to place the very serious issue of social harm associated with gambling at the front of a very flaky and flawed piece of legislation which does not solve those problems.
I believe that all of the crossbenchers have been placed in the position where, because of the flawed structure of this bill, they are going through comprehensive damage control. They are trying to find ways to section bits off, to exempt bits, and to change the application, the timing and the operation of this bill. In fact, all of those efforts just perpetuate the government's original position that somehow this bill does have an impact on the future and nature of gambling, and indeed problem gambling, in this country. I continue my contention that that is not the case.
I would like to draw the Senate's attention to an interesting document which came my way during the early stages of the debate. It is the coalition's background briefing for the joint party room meeting. It gives some insight into the cynicism of the motivation behind this bill. One of the dot points in this document states:
The Commonwealth is particularly keen to cooperate with the states and territories throughout the review and has invited the states and territories to take part in this study.
An earlier point states:
During the 12-month moratorium, the National Office of the Information Economy (NOIE), in consultation with Treasury, the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Family and Community Services, will conduct a thorough and considered study into the feasibility and consequences of banning Internet gambling.
We have already heard in the Senate today how completely opposite the coalition's conduct has been in terms of that consultation, despite the states giving an indication very specifically to the Commonwealth at that ministerial council, where Senator Alston first dropped his bombshell, that they were working very strongly towards strengthening state regulations in states which did not have regulations on interactive gambling. This statement to their own party room supports the notion that the government are deluding themselves and deluding their own backbench as to the serious intent of their party to deal with this in a realistic way. 
We have heard evidence from the state governments as to how they were not consulted. I acknowledge Senator Harradine's point: why would you tip people off—if there were a moratorium coming—to go into damage control with this bill and allow those who were licensed before 19 May to continue operating? It does not help when, clearly, there is an agenda here that the coalition are seeking to push through to the point where they are attempting to mislead their own backbench. State and territory governments have placed on the public record their surprise and their disappointment in the federal government for not providing the leadership that they have actively subscribed to. `You give us leadership,' they said, `and we will work with you in coming up with an appropriate regime.' The coalition government, in typical style, particularly in relation to regulations concerning the Internet, said, `Go away; we're on a little crusade here and no sensible suggestion is going to divert us.'
In another area of this document, I note with interest that the government presents its arguments for this course of action as marketing points—they are not arguments in favour but marketing points. Among the marketing points, a lot of the buzz words that you have heard in this legislation come to the fore, including another piece of misleading information which says: 
The government is enforcing a pause to thoroughly consider issues associated with what the Productivity Commission call the `quantum leap' in accessibility to gambling services provided by Internet gambling—a poker machine in every lounge room—before the problem becomes the size of the current pokies problem.
Well, well, well! Doesn't that just defy what we know to be the facts as a result of the Productivity Commission Report! Here we have the government feeding their emotive line of a poker machine in every lounge room to try to stir up the anti-Internet sentiment of the population, who are actively and genuinely concerned about the issue of problem gambling. The point goes on:
The government is particularly concerned that the alluring interactive nature of these services could attract a new and younger market of gamblers, particularly amongst the Internet generation.
That is the first time I have heard the coalition acknowledge that there is a generation that is interested in the Internet. I quote further:
The government is determined not to allow this new mode of gambling to exacerbate problem gambling in this country.
This is my point: these are all marketing points that the government has positioned itself around in this debate. You can see by the structure of this legislation—by virtue of the fact that this moratorium bill does not stop you going to those sites that are placed offshore that are a bit unreliable in terms of both their legality and their reliability—that it does not go to the heart of all these rhetorical points. It just puts in place a flawed mechanism that in turn demonises the Internet and fails to address any of the genuine social concerns.
Another point I would like to take this opportunity to make is about hypocrisy, and this has been mentioned by several of my colleagues. It is ironic that this matter comes up on the day that we see John Howard, the Prime Minister, actively trying to defend the dive of the dollar, saying, `We really are a new economy country. We really are on the ball with the technology new wave.'
—The coalition gets it so wrong, and, Senator Alston, you should know this because you are the one in the hot seat here, aren't you? The government is scraping the bottom of the barrel to present itself as somehow understanding the implications of the Internet and the new economy and all of the social and economic restructuring that comes with it. In the other chamber, the government is telling us how savvy it is; in this chamber we find ourselves arguing about yet another bill that seeks to place Australia in this artificial wall of non-progression when it comes to embracing the opportunities that the Internet provides to our society. The Internet brings with it a series of social challenges, and that is widely acknowledged. What it does not bring with it is an environment full of fear; it is actually an environment full of hope if you believe that information is power. This technology brings with it an opportunity for so much to be gained by so many in our society.
This type of legislation reinforces the concerns of those who, by virtue of this government's policies, have found themselves on the wrong side of the digital divide. It makes it a scary place to go. We see nothing in this bill about the support and the education that our second reading amendment and the Democrats and others have given articulate expression to. We see nothing positive about that education campaign and support and encouragement; we just see fear being perpetuated by a government that is not capable of providing leadership through change but indeed finds itself, with its ministers, at the forefront of blocking initiative and blocking opportunity.
The bottom line is that the government are trying to make something illegal online that is entirely legal offline. This time it is gambling. I think the efforts in their doing so send a very singular message. As I said, in the other place they are trying to argue that they get it, whereas the dive of the dollar and other factors like a reduced investment in education, industry and R&D demonstrate otherwise. In this chamber we find ourselves arguing about the types of legislation that give absolute substance to the belief of a large proportion of the international community, and a growing number of Australians, that the government are not up to the leadership required through this period of great technological progression that is being accompanied by a series of social challenges. It seems that it is just beyond them. 
I would like to acknowledge the quite significant role that Senator Alston has played in this too. It is from him that we always hear all the rhetoric about the new economy. How uncomfortable you must be to find yourself being the one that has to stand up in this place and defend a piece of legislation you know to be a piece of rubbish—that you know undermines every argument you spruik from a platform in front of every IT conference around this country. I can imagine, from your point of view, that the best thing that could conceivably happen would be that this bill go under. And I bet you are hoping that that is exactly what happens. If it gets up in its current form—which is likely, given your office has been lobbying every Independent on the crossbench for the last four hours—you will be the minister that has to solve the mess, because you will be the minister that is singularly responsible for inflicting it on Australia.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-10-09,"—I am afraid I will have to respond to some of that. It is hard to know how seriously to take Senator Lundy on these matters. I can understand the frustration of being in opposition for a period of years. I can understand the frustration of reading that your colleagues think you are not up to the job—and that is why even Dr Lawrence has to be recycled into a space where no doubt you were hoping to go—but none of that justifies most of what you have said. I will have to at least deal with some of those points.
You seem to suggest that somehow it is improper to have concerns about paedophilia in relation to the Internet content regulation; yet, if you had looked at the report of the ABA after the first six months of the operation of that legislation, you would have seen that the bulk of the take-down notices in relation to Australian content sites were related to paedophilia. If your view is that it is not a matter of concern, I would be surprised if that view is shared by the bulk of your colleagues. I would have thought that they would be particularly anxious to take whatever steps were available to them to at least clean up the Internet to that extent.
This whole notion of genuflecting at the shrine of the Internet as though it is an untouched area, the last frontier where no-one should even think about imposing restraints, suggests that you really have not been following the debate over the last 12 months or so. There have certainly been a number of books—and I could recommend The Control Revolution: How the Internet is Putting Individuals in Charge and Changing the World We Know to you as one—magazines and articles that are very much trying to come to terms with where the balance ought to be struck. You will not find too many IT leaders in the US who are saying, `We want untrammelled rights to do whatever we choose, irrespective of community standards.' I do not know where you get your philosophy on these things from, but it certainly does not come from the community, or indeed from the mainstream of the Internet community.
There will always be arguments about balance and about particular aspects, but I did not notice you, for example, in any shape or form attempting to suggest that it was either not possible or not feasible to ban Internet gambling. So I was at least encouraged by the fact that you did not even advert to that. But I was nonetheless concerned at your suggestion that we were wanting to demonise the Internet, because nothing is further from the truth. I personally and the government in general regard the Internet as overwhelmingly socially beneficial. It provides enormous opportunities to the community, to business, to schools and to every citizen. Does that mean that we should therefore ignore any social issues that might emerge? Again, I do not know whether you really meant it when you suggested that we were somehow trying to pretend this was going to fix problem gambling. We have never suggested any such thing. We have said that, because there are problem gamblers out there, if you provide a new medium for gambling that is as accessible as Internet gambling it is likely that a cohort of problem gamblers will emerge in due course. 
Senator Lundy seems to think that we are arguing that this bill could have no impact—or as she might have asserted—on problem gambling. Of course it can, and should. If you were to go down the path of banning and it were effective, there would not be any problem gamblers on the Internet by definition. The unwitting casuistry involved in saying that, because problem gambling is allowed offline it should be allowed online, defeats me entirely. Clearly if it is a social evil or a social problem that is within our capacity to address, I cannot see why we should not want to tackle that issue. This is not about banning; this is about breathing space—a moratorium. It is very convenient to pretend that it is something more and worse. I think your point was that we have not sought to involve the states and territories.
What you read out from that briefing note were all points that seemed to me to be quite unexceptional. I did not have any difficulty with any of them but you seemed to have. If you are somehow under the mistaken impression that we are saying we want to involve the states and territories and we are ignoring them, the facts are that we have written to them on several occasions. We have made every attempt to—
—There have been discussions going on between the Commonwealth and the states for months and months and months. They have not all been asleep at the wheel since the Prime Minister signalled his intentions back in December last year. They had a very good sense of where we were coming from. It is not as if they turned up to Canberra thinking that, somehow, we were about to say, `Let's have a cosy chat about harm minimisation,' which is what Senator Stott Despoja would like to think the debate should be all about. We turned up with a tougher agenda. We make no apologies for that. They knew it. They came in on that basis and they did not like it. A number of them had been telling us that in advance. And after the event we have sought to involve them in having this discussion and conducting a number of reviews into both the economic and social implications, as well as the technical feasibility. We would welcome their involvement in any of those review processes. So I cannot for the life of me see why you would take exception to something like that. I suppose it is just grasping at straws. But certainly there was nothing in any of those points that I think in any shape or form contradicts our approach here. I do not think I need to say much more than that. If you were minded to take a balanced view of these things, you would be in a better position to debate the merits. But to simply get up on an opportunity like this and rant about how sacrosanct the Internet ought to be and that no-one should even think of taking action, even when you have the Productivity Commission foreshadowing that there is likely to be a quantum increase in accessibility, seems to me to be not really concerned about the emergence of a new form of problem gambling and, therefore, not interested in taking action to deal with it, all because you like to think that the Internet is where life starts and finishes. The fact is that not even your colleagues think you should be entrusted with that sort of wisdom.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-10-09,"—I would like to test the minister on a couple of assertions he made earlier in the day, because I think they are quite important to the outcome of this debate. Firstly, he said that he has had, from a number of sources, clear technical advice on how to block or prevent interactive gambling. I know that the point of the moratorium the government is proposing is to put some meat on the bones of that advice. I ask the minister to give that advice to the committee. Secondly, I think the minister said that it is now possible to block international outlets by putting blocks on providers. I would like him to expand on that and to explain how that is done. With reference to his statement that wagering is second only to poker machines and that, as far as problem gambling is concerned, it is a third of the problem—I think he mentioned half a million dollars a year in effect—I notice that Senator Harris said the figure he has is 14 per cent. I wonder if the minister could say where those figures came from that show that one-third of problem gambling, and indeed it being second only to poker machines, comes from wagering. ",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-10-09,"—I am not about to provide a technical exposition on how these matters work. Suffice it to say that you can certainly require an ISP to block certain sites. If that then induces a user to seek to bypass the Internet and to go via an international ISP, then that would involve the cost of an international call, which could of course be absorbed by the offshore provider, but it could also mean that you are using much slower lines, data rates would be lower, and therefore it would be unattractive. It would be highly unlikely that an offshore provider would find it worthwhile to restructure the site simply to cater for the prospect of a few potential gamblers in Australia, locating on another as yet unblocked site, but you could play that game of cat and mouse. I think you would find that the economics of that are very heavily on the side of saying that they simply would not bother. They would cater for the rest of the world and they would therefore effectively accept the block that would be put in place at the level of the telephone carrier or domestically.
I should make the point that, in any event, the moratorium is not about making a definitive finding on any of these matters. It is about providing time for that work to be done by the experts. I am giving you a layman's recitation of what has been put to me, but all that does is give me a prima facie sense that it is doable. The purpose of the moratorium is to allow the experts to come back and formally give us advice on the issue.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2000-10-09,"—It is amazing: you ask a technical question and then watch Senator Alston flounder in his responses. I feel obliged to challenge Senator Alston on his reflections on me and my comments, particularly in relation to the paedophilia issue. I do so on the basis that Senator Alston's comments expose very clearly the fact that he still does not get it when it comes to the online services bill. There is illegal content, Senator Alston, as you know, and that includes paedophilia. It is unacceptable, it is illegal. Your online services bill, despite your using that word throughout the debate, is in fact about making illegal online what was legal in other forms in other rated categories offline. There is no doubt that there is a place for laws that capture and prevent illegal content on the Internet and the production and hosting of illegal content. This bill is not about illegal content. It is about services that are currently legal in other media and through other technology. That is the difference here.
—What, interactive gambling? I did not know that was available offline.
—Telephone gambling, Minister, as you know—specifically exempted from this legislation—is a form of interactive gambling. What we are talking about here in this bill, despite its name of `interactive gambling' is Internet gambling—gambling on the Internet. Telephone betting is interactive because you interact with the person you are placing the bet with. We heard evidence at the IT select committee inquiry that you can get the information from the punter and process it via the phone or by the punter using the input frames on a web site and hitting `submit'. There is very little difference whether you glean that information over the telephone or over the keyboard and screen of a computer that is connected to the Internet. The business process at the back end of that wagering operation, we heard in evidence, is exactly the same. So do not stand up here in this place and talk about interactive gambling as though it is something special and unique.
I would also like to challenge you about the Productivity Commission reports and your comments about technical feasibility. I think you were not paying attention when I made my comments about what I believe is a technical, unfeasible approach. Even now your comments in relation to the online services bill and its operation in forcing the ISPs to actively block content is not how that legislation is operating via the code of practice out in the field. The mandate that exists places an obligation on those ISPs to carry the filters and, indeed, to make public and offer a whole range of mechanisms to do that. So let us get very clear the facts of the legislation that this government is contemplating in perpetuating this ban on Internet gambling and interactive gambling services online. The minister has claimed that it is technically feasible, based on the possibility of an increased usage of interactive gambling services. There are a lot of ifs and buts in there, and there are a few too many ifs, buts, possibilities, may be feasibles, and what ifs than I think constitutes any sensible excuse for a piece of legislation. There are far too many ifs and buts in this legislation to make it stand up in a credible light in this chamber. 
In closing, the Internet is quite an extraordinary medium and this government has shown a propensity to misunderstand and mishandle it in a legislative sense. This bill, once again, stands as evidence of their ongoing ignorance about change, particularly in relation to the Internet and information technologies.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-10-09,"—I wonder if the minister would like to comment on those figures again. I drew his attention to the figures from Senator Harris that 14 per cent of problem gambling comes from wagering, and the minister said before lunch that it was a third.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-10-09,"—While the minister is considering Senator Brown's questions, I have some questions for the minister that go to exactly the same issue—that is, how to block overseas IPs. With the minister assuring us that it is possible or feasible, what would the actual costs be of putting those blockages in place? Secondly, who would be expected to pay? Would it be the government, because it would be requiring that Australian people do not participate in interactive gambling, or would the government merely offload those costs to the present IP providers?",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-10-09,"—The answer to Senator Brown's question is that about a third of the money lost on wagering is derived from problem gambling. The answer to Senator Harris's question is that they are precisely the matters that ought to be examined by the review process. If we knew all the answers we would not need to have a review. Quite clearly, blocking can occur at different levels and it can have different cost implications for different ISPs. So I do not think there is a single answer to the question in any event. It is one of those matters that I would have thought people would be interested in knowing.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-10-09,"—Briefly, before the amendment standing in my name is put, I just want to tackle a constant misrepresentation by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. Obviously, the Democrats are concerned with harm minimisation strategies, but our concerns are clearly much broader than that. We seek to achieve a national regulatory system for Internet gambling. We have said repeatedly in our reports, both to the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies and the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee, that we support the provision of a national standard and, therefore, an easily recognisable guarantee for domestic and international users. I reiterate that because Senator Alston seems to be passing off the Democrat proposal as merely an interest in harm minimisation strategies—although I acknowledge that that is a key component of the Democrats' proposal. 
We believe we have had an opportunity today to promote effective legislation and, I believe, effectively curb adverse social impacts related to gambling. We have put on record—and I do acknowledge this point that the minister has made in relation to my party—that we have grave concerns about bans and prohibitions online, again for the reasons we have outlined in reports, including Netbets. To correct the minister and for his information, when I asked him whether he had read the Democrat report, we actually did sign off on a moratorium but it was not in that report that we advocated a three-month moratorium. We actually signed off on the bulk of the evidence contained in the report of the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies with additional comments, recognising some of those issues that Senator Lundy and Senator Harris have referred to in the chamber today—that is, the difficulties associated with banning content online.  
So we have acknowledged in the past and in this debate that a moratorium has some value. But we have also acknowledged for the record, as have most groups in the community, most states and territories and even some of those groups associated with trying to curb the adverse impact of social gambling, that this bill is particularly poorly thought out and that its retrospective nature potentially poses problems for this government either because the basis on which it has been constructed is constitutionally questionable or because there will be compensation claims arising from people in the industry or the states and/or territories. We believe a ban will only facilitate the proliferation of unregulated or poorly regulated sites offshore. That is a concern that has been raised repeatedly by the Labor Party and by Senator Harris, and it is a concern that I do not believe the minister has proven is one that does not have justification. 
I commend the amendment to the Senate. I have appealed previously to others on the crossbenches and also the opposition to consider this amendment as at least an attempt to ameliorate some of the worst aspects of this flawed piece of legislation. It offers a realistic way through that has received support from the states and territories, whose goodwill—before it was completely smashed by this government on 19 May when it legislated by press release—still actually remains in some degree. They are keen to get over this period of uncertainty. They are keen to actually investigate the possibility of a national standard. Many of them have standards in place in relation to regulation of online interactive gambling. They have perhaps better regulations than exist for land-based gambling practices. I would say to the minister: if this government is really keen to do something about problem gamblers or unrestricted or poorly regulated gambling practices elsewhere, let us hear about it and do not just say, `That's a state and territory responsibility.' Clearly, this is an example of where the states and territories do have a responsibility that the government is quite clear to get involved in.
I should also acknowledge the support not only of the states and territories but also of one of the key Internet groups—the Internet Industry Association—who have obviously worked before with the government and other parties in this place to try to further the debate about online regulation or, probably more appropriately, online freedoms. They have come out very strongly both in a release on 31 August and since saying that they support the Democrat amendments to the gambling bill. In commending this amendment to the Senate, my party and I had hoped that this would lead to a realistic debate about some of the concerns associated with gambling. But the Labor Party is correct in stating that this bill really has little to do with curbing any of those social problems. However, this was a unique opportunity to try to amend this legislation in a way that might actually not only investigate harm minimisation strategies, Minister, but also look at a national framework and national standards which the Democrats have conceded all along are called for. This is, I guess, a last ditch opportunity by us. But this debate is so full of simplistic arguments and misrepresentations by the government that I am not quite sure why we are bothering. I seek leave to table the press release from the Australian Internet Industry Association.

 (Senator Bartlett)—We now proceed to Senator Harradine's amendment, which, I am told, leaps its way up the running sheet.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2000-10-09,"—I move: 
 (1)	Clause 3, page 2 (lines 4 to 9), omit the clause, substitute:
3  Simplified outline
		The following is a simplified outline of this Act:
This Act prohibits a person from providing an Interactive gambling service, unless the person was already providing, or was licensed to provide, the service before 19 May 2000.
The prohibition ceases at the end of 18 May 2001.
The only reason for this amendment is a genuine attempt to get some bipartisan support to address at a national level the grave problems that are likely to be associated with the extension of online gambling. The amendment that I have circulated follows in a way the amendment moved by Senator Stott Despoja. It differs from that amendment in that the operative date is 19 May 2000. Previously I indicated that I would concede that the government did in fact announce its intentions on that particular day to introduce legislation for a moratorium. To suggest that the legislation that is currently before us is retrospective flies in the face of the practice of both Labor and coalition governments that a piece of legislation was not considered retrospective if it commenced operation from the date of the announcement. In the current circumstances it would be impossible, I suggest, to allow a situation to exist whereby the moratorium would commence on the date of the commencement of this legislation. 
The reason that I say that is that there might well have been a number of firms and others involved in Internet gambling who have taken advantage of, or have taken a risk in, the matter being operative from the date on which the act commences. So I have proposed in the first dot point of the amendment to go back to the date that is suggested by the government. But the significant difference between what I am proposing and what the government legislation is proposing is that my amendment, if accepted, would prohibit a person from providing an Internet interactive gambling service, unless that person was already providing or was licensed to provide the service before 19 May 2000.  So in fairness to those in receipt of a licence on that particular date of 19 May—and a number were, including, I am sure, Federal Hotels—and who had expended a very substantial amount of money in order to establish their site, this would enable their operation to continue. 
The second part of the amendment deals with the question of prohibition and is virtually the same as the government's legislation—in fact, it is the same. We are really talking only about a couple of months difference—three months or 18 May 2001. It might be six months by the time the legislation gets through the House of Representatives and back here. Who knows, it might be five, but it is not a real big issue to argue about. I would suggest to the Australian Democrats and my other colleagues on the crossbenches that they might give that consideration. I particularly ask the Labor Party to have a good look at this amendment and to have regard to the merits of the amendment.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.
—I was, at the break, urging the Labor Party to consider this amendment and to support it. Indeed, I would urge the government to do so as well. So far as the government is concerned, I would indicate that the only difference between this and the government's proposal is that this would exempt a person who was licensed to provide the service before 19 May 2000. I gave an example of one such organisation which had been provided with a licence by the state government and had spent something like $14 million or a very substantial amount in preparing for the launch of the sites. They would, of course, be caught up in the government's legislation. So in fairness to those to which it should apply, unless the person was already providing the service, as the government has stated, or was licensed to provide a service by 19 May 2000, I have supported the government's date. The second dot point is identical to the government's bill. 
So far as the Labor Party is concerned, Senator Lundy will recall that on the committee we did receive—I think you have already mentioned it—some substantial submissions, and particularly some substantial oral submissions, which expressed a high degree of concern about problem gambling and the extension of the service exacerbating that problem gambling. I take it on face value that the government is genuine in attempting to address that situation by means of a moratorium, during which time there will be efforts made by experts and by state and Commonwealth governments to address the situation and to finally determine on a situation with regard to Internet gambling at the end of the moratorium. I think amongst the public there is widespread support for that. Given the fact that the moratorium would conclude all events on 18 May 2001—and this is not an enormous length of time; it is a short period—it does give us a breather which should be accepted.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2000-10-09,"—I have some brief comments. I would like to acknowledge the points made by Senator Harradine, but I also want to remind you, Senator, of points made earlier. Very clearly this government have not, in either this legislation or in stating their intent with the legislation they are contemplating for banning interactive gambling in perpetuity, explored at any great length the issue of the control and regulation of online gambling content. This has not been done either within state legislation or through umbrella legislation at a federal level. That is an area of great neglect. I think the fact that there are significant consumer protections and consumer protection opportunities for gambling in an interactive or Internet environment means that the responsible approach is to actively secure a highly regulated environment for gambling content. The appropriate jurisdiction for regulating that content is the states. 
On top of that, several of the states have already embarked on this endeavour, and I think their pursuit is genuine. There is no doubt that, whether this bill fails or indeed is successful, there is still a desperate need for leadership in producing and working towards a consistent, strong regulatory environment for gambling content on the Internet. I maintain that the appropriate and proven jurisdiction for success in that endeavour is indeed the states. Very clearly, however, this is not the direction that the coalition chooses to move in. Nowhere in this bill does it give expression to a great deal of the substance that was explored through that Senate inquiry and that is discussed both in the government's report and indeed in the minority reports of other participants, where the focus was on the consumer protections.
This bill creates a space for the government to move, sometime, in a different direction. That is one of the most disappointing features about it. I think it exposes the coalition for not being genuine about issues relating to social harm in gambling. In the essence of this bill, they are still not standing up in this place and talking about how they are going to create a better environment for those who do choose to gamble online. From all the evidence, we know that people will still be able to access those types of sites, regardless of bans and other legislative intentions. We are still not hearing that commitment from the coalition in any sense. Their activities to date demonstrate quite specifically that they have little regard for and are not prepared to tolerate an active involvement of the states in providing that regulatory environment. This feature of the legislation shows that it is not the wellbeing of the community that is at the forefront—it is for all the wrong reasons that I have probably spent far too much time already in this committee debate making the points on.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-10-09,"—The Democrats will support Senator Harradine's amendment insofar as it endeavours to take up some of the wording contained in our original amendment. I still state, for the record, that we do not support the 12-month moratorium but, if the legislation is going to pass, I would prefer this wording than the one currently in the bill.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-10-09,"—I would like to express support for the amendment that Senator Harradine has just moved. Senator Harradine has refined an amendment that had been put forward by both One Nation and the Democrats and it provides more clarity for whoever ends up administering the bill. Senator Harradine has put it very clearly and succinctly that only those people who received a licence before 19 May will be able to operate effectively. I take his point because, in the amendment that we had proposed, it could have been construed that anybody who had applied for or received a licence between 18 May 2000 and the date on which the bill commenced would be able to operate as well. I can understand very clearly what Senator Harradine is doing. To a large degree, his amendment will achieve what the Democrats and One Nation set out to do, that is, to allow somewhere between four and six operators who had paid for their licences, had them granted and were in the process of having the web site developed to proceed without being affected by this cut-off procedure.
The Federal group is one of those operators. Senator Harradine was a little unsure about the amount that Southern Cross Casinos had put into the development. It is $14 million. They also have about 28 staff involved in the process. The Federal group has also put into IT a considerable amount of development capital over and above that $14 million. I believe that, in actuality, all the groups involved in the IT have invested the sum of $400 million. It is a considerable investment. In a country that is sorely lacking in terms of industries having an incentive to put R&D into whatever sector they are working within, this bill should cause alarm bells to ring that should be heard everywhere in this country—and if the government continues the process of introducing legislation relating to IT that will make their commitment and their expenses in R&D null and void, virtually with the stroke of a pen.
In conclusion, I support Senator Harradine's amendment. I understand, with clarity, what he is doing—that is, ensuring that those who were provided with licences before 19 May will be able to operate. I commend the amendment to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-10-09,"—I respond to Senator Harradine's amendment by saying that, on the face of it, it does seem to go some distance—certainly from where the Democrats were until a moment ago—but, in a sense, the fact that the Democrats came on board demonstrates that the gap is simply too wide. The problem is that, if you are serious about trying to stop the growth of interactive gambling for a period, you really should be trying at the same time to ensure that the major players are not able simply to go ahead irrespective of that. As we know, the Tasmanian government took it upon itself to grant six licences the day before our announcement, and I think the ACT granted another five. So you would have all the major players licensed, which would probably be up to 15 people, and the amendment does not say by whom—but assuming it meant even by the state or territory authorities—so basically everyone would be able to get cracking as though there were no such thing as a moratorium. There would be no-one left at the barrier. Anyone who is serious, even if they have not spent much at all, would have a licence to simply ignore the moratorium and I do not know who it would catch. At the end of the day, whilst it might have some superficial appeal, I have to say that it just leaves a gaping hole there and defeats the whole purpose of the moratorium legislation.
In relation to the states, because Senator Lundy does not seem to quite know whether or not the states should have responsibility here, to the extent that they have been working on a so-called national model now for some five years and have had great difficulty in achieving agreement amongst themselves, presumably in part because they are all seeking to obtain competitive advantage, there is absolutely nothing to stop them putting in place harm minimisation regimes right now in relation to anything, whether it is online or offline. But they have not. They are basically just stalling. I do not think we should be crying too many crocodile tears for the states on this front. The states will basically go along with what they are forced to go along with, and not much more. The finger can be pointed even at those states that supported our moratorium—and bear in mind there were two out of the six. New South Wales is already up to its eyeballs in poker machines, and that is why it has announced that it will not license any more in the foreseeable future. It is the same with Victoria. I do not think we could say the states have a great track record in this area.  
I do not quite understand the distinction Senator Stott Despoja wants to draw between national regulation and harm minimisation. I would have thought they are pretty much one and the same thing. If they are not, Senator Stott Despoja has not indicated what more she would be proposing to do other than persuade the states to come behind a uniform scheme. 
At the end of the day, whilst I think Senator Harradine is at least endeavouring to act constructively, the fact is that this would render the moratorium process meaningless. Anyone who wants to get out there, whether it is Tabcorp, Tattersalls, Federal Hotels or anyone else, could just treat it as though there was not any restriction on their activities even if they had not started to spend money, which some have and some have not.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2000-10-09,"—In relation to this particular amendment, we in Labor are being consistent in our opposition to the Interactive Gambling (Moratorium) Bill 2000 and the attempts at damage control that ultimately will be unsuccessful in ameliorating the adverse effects. I would like to say a few things about the government having just failed an essential litmus test on this bill. It is very clear from Senator Alston's comments that the bill is designed to actively hurt those who got in before the prime ministerial decree that it would be banned forthwith. It was designed with that specific view in mind. It is an entirely valid point to say that those companies who have invested considerable amounts, were not outside the law and had no belief at that time prior to 19 May are being in some way actively victimised by the coalition. The opportunity was there for the coalition, if it had any sense of commitment to what it says it is trying to achieve, to see this as one of the few amendments it would have contemplated actively and supported. The fact that it did not stands as a strong argument reinforcing the position that Labor has taken on this in that this is not a bill about practical operation, implementation, meaningful pause or anything else that the government has sought to position itself on. It is just a crusade that will achieve little—in fact, achieve nothing—of the proclaimed moral agenda that the government says it is pursuing.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-10-09,"—The purpose of the amendment is to bring clarity to the bill because, the way it is drafted, the bill refers to a closing date for the one-year prohibition and fails to identify a commencement date. What we are doing here in line with a further amendment that will be moved later on in the debate on this bill is establishing clarity for when the bill will commence. Earlier on, Senator Alston made mention that there is nothing in the bill referring to the commencement day. It would seem, for the benefit of both the members of this chamber and the people who ultimately will be required to administer this bill, that it would clarify that point very succinctly and clearly. If the minister was saying earlier on that there is no real commencement day, here is the opportunity for the minister to reverse that situation and for the government to clearly set out when the commencement day for the bill is. I commend the amendment to the chamber.

	(ba)	a service to the extent to which it relates to betting on a horse race, harness race, greyhound race, sporting event or sporting contingency, conducted by a person who is authorised under a law of a State or Territory to do so;
I seek some clarification: the running sheet shows that this amendment is in conflict with Senator Harradine's amendment (1) on sheet 1950, but I believe they are identical.
—I could clarify that. Mine does not have the words `sporting event or sporting contingency'.
—I have spoken earlier on about the problems relating to gambling and how there are some anomalies relating to what the government is telling us in relation to where that problem gambling lies. In moving this amendment, which is identical to Senator Brown's and I believe also the Democrats' amendment as well, I would like to make very clear to the chamber the considerable difference between what is referred to as `wagering' and interactive gambling. Wagering is different from interactive gambling in that it is the actual placing of a bet on an actual event that will occur either on that same day or at some time in the future. It could be on horseracing or on a football game. Internet interactive gambling, on the other hand, is an interaction between the person who is playing the game and a supposedly real life respondent—whoever is providing the service.
Wagering is something that Australians have done normally by going into their TAB and placing a bet, and they can now do that over a phone line if they have an account established with any of the TAB agencies, whereas interactive gaming is a game that is played in real time between the person themselves and the service that is being provided by the casino, whether it is onshore or offshore. So you have a situation where other issues can come into play. For example, in arcade games and the like—and I am not inferring that interactive gambling does use this process—it is not uncommon to see processes that will gradually lift what is for all intents a human heartbeat, accelerating the speed of that heartbeat to arouse the emotions of the player to `hook' the player into that game. I am not saying that interactive gaming uses any of those processes at all, but it leads towards the situation where the person is pitting their skills against the computer that they are operating on. 
Wagering is totally different. Wagering is either ringing up on the phone and placing a bet with the TAB or merely using the PC to place a bet on an actual event that is to occur. They are extremely different in the approaches to them and the personal participation of that person. If this bill continues in its present form, we are going to see enormous impacts on what has been the normal wagering sector of this industry. As I have clearly shown earlier, that makes up only approximately 14 per cent of what is being put through the gambling industry. So therefore, although it is not of little significance, it is reasonable to assume there would be far fewer compulsive gamblers tied up in it.
TABCORP is one of those services that comes out of Tasmania. It contributes $4 million in income and government taxes and charges, and its net expenditure is $12 million. In total, over half a million people are employed, either directly or indirectly, in casinos, clubs, hotels, TABs, lotteries and the racing industry. The total economic contribution of these industries exceeds $6 billion. This figure has been reached through extrapolation from figures in a report by the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research, so it has not been plucked out of the air. That report was presented in March 2000, and it stated that Victoria's gaming industry had a gross state product of $1.9 billion. Therefore, the national gross product from the gaming industry would exceed $6 billion, a figure about four times greater than the mid-point average suggested by the Productivity Commission. Those figures were produced by Dr Peter Brain, the director of the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research. 
I would like to close by saying that wagering is not interactive gambling. It is quite different from interactive gambling in that wagering is the placing of a bet on an event that will occur, such as a horse race or a football game. I commend the amendment to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-10-09,"—I am not yet decided as to how this legislation shapes up, but it will certainly make a difference to have the exemption which the Greens amendment and the One Nation amendment would make. It is a very big glitch in this legislation that the Tasmanian and Victorian TABs are, for the period of the moratorium, shut out of the advantages that online gambling offers to New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia and shut out of the potential flow-on effects to the racing industry. I have always been a strong supporter of the racing industry in Tasmania. It is a prodigious employer and a very important rural industry, with beyond-the-course activities that take place as a result of the breeding of horses and dogs. It is an enormous interest, and a traditional interest, for a fairly big section of the community. I rarely go to the races—I think the last time I went was the interdominion final in Hobart a couple of years back. I enjoyed that greatly except for the earful I got from a couple of non-Green participants who had had too much to drink on that evening.
I readily understand how important the industry is, how much income it produces and what enjoyment it gives to many Tasmanians—that is why I brought forward my amendment. I note that Senator Harradine has a refined version, and I am inclined to think that that is good as well. I would be loath to support a piece of legislation if Tasmania—and indeed our daughter state across Bass Strait, Victoria—came to be in a disadvantaged position, even for a period of six months or so, because of that legislation. It is quite important that the government look carefully at this amendment and the logic in it. Senator Harris has explained the difference between wagering and other forms of gambling, such as casino gambling in particular and not least poker machines, and I concur with that as well. I recommend this amendment as I think it is quite an important one. As far as I am concerned, it is the signal one in terms of getting rid of, as far as is possible and for the short period of the moratorium, inequalities which are state based. Let us be clear about this: this is one case in which Tasmania would be clearly disadvantaged if the legislation stands as it is. The minister may say that not much is going to happen until 20 May next year and that those few Tasmanians who want to go online will be able to do that through a New South Wales or South Australian agency. But if nothing much is going to happen, then why the worry? Why have a moratorium at all? It will be interesting to hear from the government as to what it thinks is going to be the difference to its legislation if this amendment is adopted and whether it thinks that it is indeed not a positive difference.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-10-09,"—The Democrats recognise the differences between wagering and gaming. Indeed, we recognise the differing requirements or harm minimisation strategies that might be required for both of these pursuits, and we also acknowledge that the states and territories already differentiate between wagering and gaming. Many have different ministers or representatives for each area and, if they have the same minister, he or she wears very clear hats. We believe that any required differences between the two pursuits would be reflected in a national regulatory approach formulated by the states and territories. While we are cognisant of that distinction, we feel that that could still be taken into account in any discussion taking place among the states, the territories, industry, other stakeholders and the federal government. 
We are not convinced that further exemptions and specific provisions would further the promotion of a coordinated or a comprehensive regulatory approach, although, having said that, I do not necessarily believe that we are pursuing, with the bill as it remains, a step towards a comprehensive or coordinated national regulatory approach. But any further delineations we believe may further complicate and polarise a young and innovative industry, and certainly this relates to an amendment with which we will be dealing later, moved by Senator Harris, that may appeal to outdated national boundaries that are meaningless in this global information medium. So, while we are aware of the arguments, we are not supporting the amendment. Senator Alston finds that funny. He might even change my mind. Given that the prerequisite for not supporting Senator Harradine seemed to be the fact that the Democrats were supporting the amendment, you never know.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-10-09,"—I suppose I have got to respond to Senator Brown. As I understood it, it is being suggested that there is somehow some valid distinction between gaming and wagering. Each of them involves putting money on an outcome or, if you like, having a bet. One is a mechanically determined outcome; the other is a real-life event. Beyond that, they each involve the outlay of money based on some element of chance, and in that sense they both constitute interactive gambling. The government's view is that, to the extent that through the Internet, the television set or otherwise it is possible to generate a new industry that caters for either or both of those streams of chance, they should all be put on hold for the period of the moratorium in order to make a judgment about what is a sensible approach. That does not involve having a guess at this point in time about which is more likely to take off or to what extent people are likely to go down that path or suppliers are likely to come up with business cases. 
We have taken the view that you have got to draw the line somewhere. It is reasonable to say that if you are already offering a service then you should not have to, if you like, retrospectively close that service down, but if all you have is merely a ticket by way of a licence then you are not disadvantaged because you are not offering a service to the public. Therefore, to the extent that some jurisdictions might already be offering some form of interactive gambling service, they could continue during the period of the moratorium but they would not be allowed to enhance it. I think the evidence to date suggests that there has not been a great take-up, and that is probably because you will need to refresh the technology in order to get to the next stage, and that is the very sort of thing we think should not be occurring during the moratorium period.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-10-09,"—I support the Democrats amendment for a moratorium of three months, which is identical to Pauline Hanson's One Nation's amendment. The purpose of the amendment is to minimise the moratorium period in which the industry will find itself if the government's bill proceeds unamended. As I said earlier, I disagree totally with the minister, who said that 12 months is not a long time. With technology as we know it today, 12 months is a huge gulf for an industry which has invested up to $400 million in R&D and finds itself locked out of the process. The amendment is an attempt to bring some reality to the period of the moratorium and to bring it back to a three-month period from the assent of the bill, which I believe would give the government ample time to put in place a consultative process with the people of Australia.
The minister is saying that the purpose of the moratorium is to consult with the Australian people, at which time the government will make up its mind whether it is going to legislate for Internet gambling or ban it totally. I believe that it would be extremely unjust for the government to stand up in this place and purport to be consulting with the Australian people if it has the intention to totally ban Internet betting. I support the Democrats amendment as it is identical to Pauline Hanson's One Nation's and call on the government to listen to what the industry is saying. You are consigning the Australian interactive gambling industry to the rubbish pile.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-10-09,"—I withdraw amendment No. 4 standing in my name. The changes relate in particular to an earlier amendment in relation to commencement, and that amendment was not successful. I am happy to move on to debate Senator Harris's amendment for the same clause.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-10-09,"—I move:
(5)	Clause 11, page 8 (lines 16 to 32), omit the clause, substitute:
11  Exemption for interactive gambling services in existence before the commencement day
	(1)	In a prosecution for an offence against section 10 in relation to the provision of a particular interactive gambling service (the current service) during a particular day, it is a defence if the defendant proves that:
	(a)	on a particular day before the commencement day, the defendant provided, or was licensed to provide, an interactive gambling service (the pre-commencement service); and
	(b)	the current service is the same or substantially the same as the pre-commencement service; and
	(c)	the current service is provided under the same name as the pre-commencement service; and
	(d)	in the case of a pre-commencement service that was in operation before the commencement day—the service had at least one arm's length paying customer.
	(2)	In a prosecution for an offence against section 10 in relation to the provision of a particular interactive gambling service during a particular day, it is a defence if the defendant proves that:
	(a)	on a particular day before 19 May 2000, the defendant was licensed to provide an interactive gambling service (the licensed service); and
	(b)	the service in question is the licensed service; and
	(c)	the licensed service is provided only to persons located outside Australia.
Note:	A defendant bears a legal burden in relation to the matters mentioned in this section (see section 13.4 of the Criminal Code).
The purpose of this amendment is to replace clause 11 of the bill. This clause refers to the exclusions or the exemptions for interactive gambling. The government is clearly indicating as we progress through this bill that it is not interested, as Senator Lundy said earlier on. The government is not interested in putting forward legislation that will address the problems with excessive gambling. I believe that the government has an alternative motive for bringing this bill on.
If the government is intent on protecting the Australian people from interactive gambling, I draw the attention of the chamber to subsection (2)(c), which has been changed to read:
... the licensed service is provided only to persons located outside Australia.
This would allow the Internet providers who are up and running to continue to operate provided that the service is not provided to a person located within Australia or its territories.
I come back to my opening remarks. If the government is concerned about compulsive gambling and the problems associated with Internet gaming, it should have no problem supporting this amendment, which excludes the Australian people from participating in this activity but leaves the businesses that are there now to operate. Those businesses provide a sound interactive gambling process for people who are offshore. In particular, it has been indicated by some of the participants in this industry that 80 per cent of their income is derived from overseas. By agreeing to this amendment, we would be doing two things: we would be protecting the Australian people, as the government is purporting to do; and we would be assisting these industries to continue. The industries would provide R&D while they are operating, they would provide jobs for Australians within Australia because they would not have to go overseas, and they would contribute in a substantial way to the revenue of the government. If the minister is not going to support the proposal, I look forward to hearing from him as to exactly why not.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2000-10-09,"—Again, I would like to address my comments to the broader issues. Firstly, I want to acknowledge the activities of the Democrats and those on the crossbenches in their continued efforts to go into damage control on a fundamentally flawed bill. Labor is still maintaining its clear and consistent position that this bill is irretrievable in its flawed structure and will continue to oppose it until the bitter end.
It is interesting to highlight the government's immovability on a range of amendments, despite the opportunities to improve the bill quite profoundly and incrementally, according to the crossbenches. As I said before, the government's unwillingness to contemplate any of the amendments I think reinforces the point: (1) that Senator Alston is sitting there hoping like crazy that the bill does not get up because he will inherit the problem; and (2) that if indeed it does get up it will be the Democrats that have to answer to the industry and to the broader Internet community about what they suffer as a consequence. 
Finally, the point I would like to make is about the intent of the bill. It is a point I have made several times so I will be very brief. This bill does not address the consumer protection issues or issues related to Internet gambling and how we support problem gamblers, either in relation to gambling generally or in relation to perceived potentiality for problem gambling on the Internet. This bill and how senators vote on it is not a test about their commitment to alleviating the social harm for people with a gambling problem. It should not be perceived as such because in no way, shape or form does the bill address those concerns. Labor has not approached the bill in this way. We will continue to oppose it, as I said, on the basis that it is a flawed structure on the back of a misguided and manipulative agenda on behalf of the coalition. I would urge the crossbench to keep all of these issues in mind as they sit here, as I do, and watch the minister reject opportunities to improve the operation of the bill and to take it, as I do, as evidence that the government are not interested in the effective operation of the bill at all but are indeed happy to buy trouble if the bill is passed tonight, which, unfortunately, it may well be.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-10-09,"—I would like to respond briefly to those last comments. Indeed this is not a test of senators' commitment to the issue of alleviating the adverse impacts of gambling, and problem gambling in particular. This debate has been a test of legislators' commitment to passing good or bad laws. When it is directed to the Democrats that we may or may not be responsible for the passage and/or defeat of this bill, I point out the numbers in the Senate, for the benefit of the members of the two old parties. If this bill passes in its current form, which is one that most people in this place have accepted as being flawed or requiring amendment, I think it will be a sorry day. Both the old parties in this place have completely disengaged from the debate to the point where there have been no amendments proffered by the opposition or any support proffered for amendments.
I acknowledge the point Senator Lundy made on behalf of the opposition that the bill cannot be salvaged. It is bad. I think certainly on the crossbenches there is an agreement that this legislation is flawed. As legislators we have endeavoured to improve, or ameliorate, the worst aspects of the bill in an attempt to make sure not only that the industry does not suffer in a way that is inappropriate but also that we further the debate we thought we were talking about when this legislation was first mooted, introduced and referred to a committee for discussion. At least the crossbenchers have tried to engage in a process of improving what we acknowledge, and what all Democrats have acknowledged, is flawed legislation.
It should also be pointed out for the record that the proposal that has had the most support in this chamber is the Democrats' proposal, supported and moved by Senator Harris. The proposal is also supported by Senator Brown from the Greens and by industry associations through to the Internet industry associations—that is, from the Internet sector through to the various gambling and state and territory stakeholders—and even those social justice groups who have an interest in alleviating the impact of problem gambling in our society, so there is no question as to what the community would have preferred in this debate. Certainly Senator Lundy is right: Minister Alston is going to have to wear the consequences of this bill and, yes, most of us are aware of the fact that he probably would prefer the legislation to dive so that he could go back to the drawing board and improve it in a way that is certainly not retrospective or open to compensation claims.
It is not enough for the opposition in this place to suggest that they have made a principled decision to back out of this debate and that it will be up to the Democrats and the crossbenchers whether or not the bill passes. Numbers may count in this circumstance because the balance of power comes into play, as it does fairly rarely, but it only comes into play and it only matters when the two old parties disagree. On this occasion, I think that neither of the old parties has engaged in this debate in a legislative manner that perhaps would have suited them. Certainly, and I think typically, the work has been left to the crossbenches to try to improve a poor piece of legislation. I hope that it does fail. If it does pass I think it will be a sorry day not only for the gambling industry in an interactive gambling industry sense but also for the Internet industry more generally. ",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-10-09,"—I would like to comment on the assertion by Senator Lundy that the responsibility for this bill could ultimately lie with the Democrats. I believe that is incorrect, because we have had through this debate a process where every senator in this chamber has had the ability to assess each amendment as it has been put forward. If the bill does go forward in its original form, the responsibility will lie with the Labor Party, because they have had the opportunity to support amendments that would have changed the bill for the better.
The scenario is that, if this bill is supported by a group of senators who are exercising their democratic right to assess this bill on its merits and not on political party lines, then that is how this chamber should operate. It certainly does not appear to be doing that tonight, and it is crunch time—not for the government or the crossbenchers but for the Labor Party. Through the whole of this debate, they have continued to say, and I agree with them, that this bill is not about providing a safe Internet process for people, particularly Australians, who participate in it. It is crunch time because this is exactly what this amendment will achieve. It will protect every Australian so that they will not fall foul of the perceived detriment of interactive gambling. It will assist the industry to continue overseas and it will assist the industry to get a return on their R&D—which the government is so good at saying that we need in this country. So it is actually crunch time for the Labor Party, because if they refuse to support this amendment, what they are actually doing, whether the bill gets up or not, is subjecting the Australian people to exactly what they say they should not be subjected to: betting on the Internet.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-10-09,"—I could wait until the third reading, but I will not; I will say my piece now. As I see it, the vote on this legislation comes down to four, and I am one of them. The difficult decision is whether to vote for it or against it. Through most of this debate, and certainly in the lead-up to it, I have been inclined to vote for the legislation. During the committee stage, I have made it clear why. I think that problem gambling, in particular addictive gambling, is a real blight on society. I have been involved with families, with loved ones and with people suffering from addictive gambling, and I have seen the havoc and distress that it causes. One does not have to be a genius to know that the Internet is going to afford ready access to people who have, or will have, that sort of trouble.
I cannot divorce this legislation from the alarm I have about the social impact of ever easier gambling access on a bigger and bigger number of vulnerable people. I am also concerned about the targeting of Australia by big international gambling interests, which are having their access to Internet gambling facilities blocked, not least in the United States. That is why I first raised the issue of Internet gambling in this place early last year. In fact, I think this matter is much more important than the government's priority, which was to try to stomp on salacious components available on the Internet. 
The two speakers before me were quite right. There has been a block, by the opposition and the government, on entertaining any of the amendments put forward. When it comes down to getting the legislation passed, it is ultimately the government that has got to weigh up the mood of the Senate, and by `mood' I mean the very real concerns that senators have with it. Instead of doing that, the minister has been quite offhand with real efforts to get real information which would help here. When Senator Harris, Senator Harradine and I jointly moved to get rid of one quite unnecessary shortcoming of this legislation, that is, the exclusion of the Tasmanian and Victorian TAB, so that there would at least be a level playing field during the moratorium period—and remember that increases, against my own wishes, access to gambling in some small way—the minister was cavalier about it. He would not entertain it. I made it very clear to the minister that the way the government went on that would help determine which way I would vote on this matter.  
This is a serious matter, and I have had a great deal of trouble coming to a decision on it. But I have been persuaded that not only is the legislation not the right piece of legislation but this government does not mean it—or this minister is not up to putting the case for the government. I have heard that, in cabinet, it is just the Prime Minister who is pushing this legislation, and I have heard lots of other rumours. Watching the performance of the minister in the chamber today could only lead one to believe that the government does not have its heart in it either. Otherwise I would expect that the minister would have been on top of this, he would have had answers where he turned down crossbench amendments, and he would have expressed at least some depth of understanding of the very important amendments which would have led me to support this legislation. 
I reiterate that I began by wanting to support this legislation. I reiterate that I have enormous concerns about the social impact of Internet gambling, and they are not going to go away because of the way I vote on this piece of legislation. However, I am not in the business of having a government with a piece of legislation which it believes it has ownership of, which it is blind to any shortcomings in and which it does not believe is amenable to input from the other parties in the Senate. The government will have to go away and come back with better. This is an interim measure. If the government is building up to a ban on Internet gambling, the fact that I am going to vote against this piece of legislation does not mean I am going to vote against that. I would suggest that the government change its approach. I would suggest that the government puts into the Senate its publicly espoused concern for the nation as far as Internet gambling is concerned. It is not good enough to simply say no to every amendment, including ones which quite patently were going to improve this legislation and make it fairer. Remember that it is a short period that we are involved with—it is just until next May. There was, I think, goodwill in here—a feeling by certainly all the parties up this end of the Senate to work this out, to go a long way, if not all the way, towards the government's wishes, with a few amendments. But the government was not entertaining that. That being the case, the flaws in the government's legislation, including those it quite dismissively refused to fix—and glory knows they were not big enough—lead me to be opposed to this legislation as it stands.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-10-09,"—I will just respond to that latest example of monumental hypocrisy. Quite clearly, what Senator Brown is seeking in that display of petulance is that the government should make a special exemption for Tasmania. That is really what he is asking for. He is not interested in the merits of whether or not there is any meaningful distinction between gambling and gaming or wagering; all he is interested in is protecting a local industry. I can understand why he wants to put that position—that is what representational politics can be about—but to pretend that somehow, because he does not get his way on that, this legislation is flawed is absolutely hypocritical. Anyway, I do not want to get sucked in by Senator Brown because he is a past master at running those sorts of lines and I do not think anyone takes it seriously.
I did want to respond to Senator Harris. He asked me why it was that we were not attracted to his amendment. The answer is that it is essentially the same amendment that we have already dealt with in relation to providing a cut-off in relation to services that have already been licensed as opposed to services that are already available. As I have explained, this would drive a coach-and-four through the whole moratorium concept because, effectively, everyone who is serious about offering these services already has a licence. Therefore, you would render the concept of a moratorium essentially meaningless. The second part of Senator Harris's amendment relates to limiting activities to persons located outside Australia. Again, that is one of those matters that could be further canvassed during the period of the moratorium, but the principle of the issue ought to be whether or not you are concerned to at least nip in the bud for the time being the growth of such an industry. If you allow it to continue on through the moratorium period in relation to offshore services, it inevitably makes it that much harder to decide later on that that is not the way you want to go. So the sensible thing to do is to simply treat interactive services in the same way wherever they might be offered to the extent that it is feasible to do that, have the moratorium and then examine these issues in some detail, and that is the approach we have taken.  
If Senator Brown or anyone else wants to characterise that as intransigence or being bloody-minded, what they are really saying is that, unless the government is prepared to make comprehensive concessions, irrespective of the consequence, it is not acceptable. We can both play that game. To pretend that somehow these were concessions that would inevitably improve the bill is preposterous on its face. It is worse than casuistry; it is absolutely false and misleading. By any stretch of the imagination, it would broaden the scope of the exemptions to the point where it may actually make the moratorium period pretty meaningless. Senator Brown knows that as well as I do. He knows that you cannot allow one very significant section of the industry to carry on business as usual, just as he knows that there is a huge difference between talking about new services before 19 May and new licences. If he wants to pretend otherwise, that is just consistent with the game he plays. The government does not for a moment accept that sort of nonsense.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-10-09,"—I might point out that that section of the industry—the racing industry—would have been able to carry on largely as ever because New South Wales, Western Australia and South Australia have been licensed for this activity and betters in other states would have passed through to them if need be. So Senator Alston is wrong there. There is a very clear message to the states in this; that is, if they do not want to see a comprehensive ban on interactive gambling getting through this place somewhere in the second half of next year, then the time is now for them to get this industry under control with nationally applicable and, as close as possible, uniform laws which do the business of implementing standards that are going to allay the public's fear about problem gambling and that are going to ensure that the community and individuals within the community are protected. The government's proposed ban would eliminate the industry altogether, as far as Internet betting is concerned. If the states do not want that to happen, they have to get themselves into far better order than they have been able to up until now. They have until May next year to come up with a set of standards ready and implemented which are going to allay the fears of those of us who are concerned about problem gambling in particular, and the means of being able to deal with it and cut it off before it happens, in an industry which is going to be tempting people in their homes, through their computers, all over the country. I will be writing to each of the states to make it clear that they have an understanding that, if they do not do that, there is a need for national standards and that legislation of some form or other is going to go through this place. So they have a choice. I think this situation should concentrate their minds on coming up with a satisfactory alternative to the comprehensive ban which the government is contemplating.

One of the major measures contained in this bill is the removal of access to Medicare from parent visa applicants and protection visa applicants who are in Australia temporarily while their permanent visa applications are being processed. This amendment will ensure that future protection visa applicants will be eligible for Medicare on the same basis as applicants for other permanent visas unless they have applied for a parent visa. This amendment reflects the outcome of the government's further consideration of the issue of access to Medicare by protection visa applicants. The effect of this amendment is that persons who apply for a protection visa and who would be eligible for Medicare under current arrangements will retain that eligibility, provided they have never applied for a parent visa.
With respect to sheet DA243, these amendments will provide the government with a more appropriate, flexible and responsive mechanism for extending Medicare access to certain persons who are in Australia on a temporary basis. The Health Insurance Act currently gives temporary visa holders access to Medicare, provided they satisfy the definition of `eligible person' in that act. Amongst other things, this requires temporary visa holders to apply for a permanent visa. This way of accessing Medicare will remain. The government is, however, concerned to ensure that certain temporary visa holders do not have to apply for a permanent visa for the sole purpose of obtaining access to Medicare. The bill currently provides expressly for Medicare access for temporary protection visa holders by defining such persons as `eligible persons' for the purposes of the Health Insurance Act. This will mean that temporary protection visa holders will no longer have to make a separate application for a permanent protection visa application in order to access Medicare. 
The bill does not, however, contain a sufficiently flexible mechanism to enable the government to provide direct Medicare access for other groups of temporary visa holders in the future. These amendments introduce such a mechanism. Consistent with the government's commitment to extending Medicare access to temporary protection visa holders and, in the future, to other groups of temporary visa holders as appropriate, we intend, as soon as this legislation comes into effect, to prescribe temporary protection visa holders, and any other appropriate groups of temporary visa holders, as eligible persons for Medicare access under the proposed new section 6A of the act. As an interim measure and to facilitate timely and simplified access to Medicare for current temporary protection visa holders, the Minister for Health and Aged Care has made an order under the existing section 6 of the act to ensure that all temporary protection visa holders have access to Medicare.
With respect to the amendments on sheet DA248, amendments (1) and (3) are technical amendments which will ensure that, for the purposes of determining a person's eligibility for Medicare, visa applications that have been withdrawn are treated in the same way as visa applications that have been finally determined. As I mentioned before, the government does not propose to move amendment (2) as the essence of this amendment is already contained in the amendment on sheet DA245. I commend the amendments, and the supplementary explanatory memoranda which I have just tabled, to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PARENTS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"McKiernan, Sen Jim",ALP,2000-10-09,"—As a number of the speeches from opposition senators during the second reading stage indicated, we do not have any problems with schedule 1 of the bill, nor indeed the amendments that Senator Patterson has now moved to schedule 1. I thank Senator Patterson for the explanation of how the amending legislation will impact upon those temporary protection visa holders. The information she gave when she moved the amendments was helpful, but I ask for clarification. Will there be a requirement for the individual within a detention centre who is becoming eligible for the grant of a temporary protection visa—an adult individual, obviously—to make application to the Health Insurance Commission for a Medicare card or to access the provisions of Medicare, or will that be something that happens automatically with the grant of the temporary protection visa? 
While the parliamentary secretary is getting the information, I understand that the situation in place at the moment is quite cumbersome and a great problem not only for the individuals who are granted temporary protection visas but also for those individuals in the community who are assisting those temporary protection visa holders to settle into our community. As the parliamentary secretary said in moving the amendments, those individuals now have to apply for permanent residence in Australia in order to access the provisions of Medicare. That in itself is no easy task for individuals who are in a strange country. Some of them have probably spent a period of time in detention and some of them certainly do not have English as a first language and may not have a great command of the English language itself.  
The other thing that impacts upon individuals who are in receipt of the grant of a temporary protection visa is the fact that there is a fee attached to the application for permanent residence in Australia. This has caused some strains upon the persons who are assisting the people once they arrive in the capital cities, and invariably it is a capital city where the temporary protection visa holders are located. I think the parliamentary secretary has now got the information asked for in my question, and I await the answer.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PARENTS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2000-10-09,"—Apparently it is a requirement of all people, whatever visa they are on, to actually present at a Medicare office to obtain their card. People in detention have access to medical treatment through Immigration until they actually leave the detention centre. When they leave the detention centre, they are eligible for Medicare. They then have to go and apply for their card. I have just asked the officers whether they are advised of that before they leave the detention centre. They could not tell me whether that was the case, but I have asked that they ensure that a process be put in place for people leaving the detention centre to be advised that they need to present themselves at a Medicare office, if it is appropriate. I am not now able to make a commitment here on the floor of the chamber but, if it is appropriate for them to have an application form before they leave and be assisted with filling that out, then I will ask the department to do that. For some reason that I do not know, it may not be appropriate. However, they will be given every assistance in ensuring that they know where the Medicare office is and that they are told that they need to apply. They will be eligible from the time they leave the detention centre.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PARENTS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"McKiernan, Sen Jim",ALP,2000-10-09,"—I appreciate the response from the parliamentary secretary and I do accept that you are not able to give a cast-iron assurance on your feet on the floor of the chamber. But I appreciate the commitment that you have given, and we would hope that it will work out to the satisfaction of all concerned, both the people who have been released on the temporary protection visa and those individuals who have been assisting them, mainly church organisations, who meet them and assist them after the Centrelink people have talked to them and explained some of the other provisions that are in place. If it is not possible to issue the persons with an application form prior to their leaving the detention centre, it may be possible for that application form to be issued to them at the time the Centrelink people meet them when they arrive at their destination, which I am told is invariably a capital city.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PARENTS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2000-10-09,"—I really cannot speak on behalf of the minister for Centrelink and say whether that is feasible, but I will look and see whether there is a possibility of having the application forms at the detention centre. However, as I said to you before, that may not be appropriate. I have taken on board your concern and I will do everything that I can to facilitate their accessing Medicare cards. I know it will require them to attend a Medicare office. They should be provided with the locations of Medicare offices in the city they are going to or close to the Centrelink office they initially go to. As I said, perhaps we can get the form to them, and if it is possible I will arrange for that, but I do not know that I can actually guarantee it being the Centrelink office.

We have canvassed this issue in the second reading stage of the debate, so I do not think we need to go over it in detail again now. These schedules deal with the core component of the bill, the parent visa and the visa application charge. The Democrats are opposed to those for the reasons that I outlined in my speech on the second reading. In the interests of time, I shall not extrapolate further on that.  
One other thing I would state is that it is my understanding—if my understanding is flawed, I would appreciate the parliamentary secretary correcting me before we get to the third reading stage—that schedule 2 being removed relating to the visa application charge therefore negates the purpose of the visa application charge bill that we are debating cognately with this bill and therefore it would be appropriate to knock that out at the third reading stage. It is my intent to vote that way. If that is going to cause an inadvertent consequence, I would appreciate the parliamentary secretary letting me know before we get there. The fundamental component of these schedules, to introduce the special parent visa with the extra charge, is one that the Democrats are not able to support at this time, for the reasons previously outlined.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PARENTS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"McKiernan, Sen Jim",ALP,2000-10-09,"—In the interests of preservation of time, I too will be very brief in my comments. We again indicated during the second reading debate on this bill that schedules 2 and 3 were causing us concern. We did outline our opposition to those schedules at that particular time. That opposition remains and we will be supporting the opposition to the schedules foreshadowed by Senator Bartlett and the Australian Democrats.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PARENTS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2000-10-09,"—The government will not be supporting the foreshadowed opposition  by the Democrats because it would  mean that the two bills will be knocked out. I think I have explained very clearly, as has the minister in his second reading speech in the other chamber, the government's position with regard to the need for people in the community—and there has been a request from people in the community to this effect—to make a contribution towards the costs of somebody coming here later in life. I ask the Democrats and the Labor Party to think very carefully about having discussions with us about what they think is reasonable in terms of the relative cost of someone who comes here later and how many people per annum they think ought to come into Australia.
I think it is reasonable to say to people in the community who want to bring their parents here, `If you oppose the regulations and you oppose these bills, what are you prepared to accept?' Minister Ruddock's office is open and my office is open if somebody wants to tell us so that the people who are applying and waiting for their parents to come will know what the Democrats and/or Labor think is a fair thing. We will not be supporting Senator Bartlett.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PARENTS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"McKiernan, Sen Jim",ALP,2000-10-09,"—To respond briefly to the request by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, a fair indication was given last year when the opposition parties, together with the Democrats and others in this place, disallowed the regulation which put a $17,000 charge on parent visa applications. That should have sent a very strong message to the minister and to the government that we considered that to be an excess. They have come forward now with a $25,000 visa health charge, which obviously indicates to the chamber and to the Australian population that the minister has had no interest in discussing with us, and probably with any other party in the Senate, what fair charges ought to be. Obviously, if $17,000 was considered excessive by the Senate, a $25,000 health levy is most certainly excessive.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2000-10-09,"—I rise tonight to speak on the success of technology parks and my belief in the concept of regional universities as drivers of employment. The University of Newcastle, in my own home town of Newcastle, is the second biggest employer in the Hunter and is involved in various projects that have demonstrated tremendous success in innovation and employment in new industries. The employment benefit of having a university in your region is enormous. Something that needs further development in Australia's universities is the concept of technology parks. This is particularly so for universities based in regional areas. As a driver of employment, universities have a distinct advantage in being able to provide expert advice to locally based industries. This forms one of the main features of the technology parks.
I recently saw the success of technology parks at the National Technology Park at the University of Limerick. Coming back to Ireland after 12 years, I witnessed an economic miracle in this remote region of the European Union. When I was on university sabbatical there in 1987, I was told that anyone with any get-up-and-go had got up and left. Like Scotland, Ireland is still classified as a disadvantaged region in the European Union and receives, in a similar way, additional funding for specific projects. That is just a bonus in addition to the very rapidly expanding tax revenues driven by the booming Irish economy. Over the last 10 years, the population drain from regional areas has reversed. People are moving back to Ireland and back out into regional Ireland. They are moving into high technology industries, for example computing and pharmaceuticals. A lot of the success is due to a long-term program of attracting foreign investment to Ireland, which started in the early 1980s. 
The Irish government facilitated this by creating an arms-length statutory authority, the Industry Development Agency. This agency has very wide discretionary authority to offer incentives to overseas companies to a very high value before having to go to cabinet for approval. The IDA encourages foreign companies to employ local skilled workers and graduates, which exposes them to advanced technologies. Links were forged with universities and increasingly higher levels of R&D have been undertaken in Ireland; sharing in this more and more are the Irish workers. 
To attract and assist foreign investment, the IDA coordinates with governments, universities, economic development organisations and the community to address the need for land, transport, infrastructure, skills decentralisation to rural regions and other issues affecting investment decisions. Underpinning the incentives is the Irish economy's trump card: very low company tax rates which, even now, are at a world leading 15 per cent. Initial efforts during the 1980s to attract foreign investment, however, met with very little success. High profile IT companies like IBM were, by that stage, very well established, with plants in a number of European countries. The Irish Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment then cast a net for new high-flyers with rapid growth potential. In the early days—and remember we are talking about 20 years ago—they managed to attract very promising companies starting in the field, such as Apple, Microsoft and Digital, among others. In the pharmaceuticals area companies like Pfizer, which now has its worldwide manufacturing operations for Viagra in southern Ireland, were attracted. Most of the manufacturing and IT companies were initially attracted to Dublin, a city with a population of 1½ million, which is now bursting at the seams. Increasingly, newer economic development and the more recent companies coming to Ireland are moving into rural and regional areas.
Many IT and manufacturing industries were initially attracted by the very large pool of graduates from Ireland's excellent schools, universities and further education institutions. The universities are very well located across the regions of Ireland. In the late 1970s, a completely new type of university was created in the city of Limerick, on the west coast of Ireland. Formerly an institute of technology, it was upgraded to university status and hired as its professors many former heads of R&D divisions in manufacturing and IT companies. The resulting synergy created between the university and industry found expression in the creation of a high-technology industry park in Limerick. Over the last 20 years, quite a number of the high-technology companies have located in the park, creating a symbiotic relationship between themselves and the university.
Established in 1984, the National Technology Park at Limerick has become home to a growing and influential network of over 90 technology companies, employing some 5,000 people in the precincts of the university. Information technology, including e-business, is the dominant sector in Ireland's first digitally networked science and technology park. Another factor behind its success is that businesses that set up in the park have the latest technology at their fingertips. A fibre optic network loop has been installed that offers a very wide range of broadband services from this regionally based university to the national economy and through to the international economy.
This sets the scene for a clustering of technology based companies in a remote rural and regional area. Both have benefited from this partnership, with expert advice given to local companies and the latest research, design, training and graduate courses meeting the needs of industry. One of the most exciting aspects of the park is its innovation centre. This building is a fast incubator for many start-up IT companies where the research generated from the university is formed into information technology products. For example, two students designed a highly advanced company financial reporting system which was taken up by a number of the Fortune 500 companies in the United States. After six years, the two graduates floated their company and then sold it for $60 million.
The expansion of the university and technology park has helped the Shannon Region on the remote west coast of Ireland to reinvent itself as a showcase information-age city in regional Ireland. The university is an excellent model for Australian universities that may wish to build a more effective link with commerce and industry, particularly in regional areas. The aim of such a technology park is to create the appropriate physical, administrative and technological environment and to aid the growth of technology and knowledge based enterprises. The technology park provides a world-class business environment networked to a modern university. When the two combine in the one location, the benefits to the local community are widespread. While the idea of technology parks and clustering of industry has begun in Australia—for example, at the University of Ballarat in Victoria—other regions need to move to adopt this concept. We must drive this new type of development further in the regional areas of Australia to ensure, during the information age, that we reduce not increase the rural-urban divide and that regional economies can thrive in this new age.
