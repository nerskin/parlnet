Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (09:31):  I rise to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bioregional Plans) Bill 2011, reminding myself this morning that we only spoke about this same issue very recently. It is an issue that has been near and dear to my heart over the years—marine protected areas.


I have been involved with marine protected areas through my research at the University of Tasmania over the years, and I volunteered my time to consult with conservation groups such as the ACF and the Wilderness Society. In the rollout of marine protected areas in South Australia, I have briefed both the South Australian Liberal Party and Labor Party over the years on the economics of marine protected areas. And, of course, the economics are closely tied to the science of marine protected areas. But I will get back to that in a minute.


Essentially, what we are debating here this morning is the role of science: the importance of science in policy and decision making, and whether the government should be able to overturn good science for political reasons. Clearly, this has been a big issue in the chamber with the supertrawler debate over the last six months. I and other members of the Greens and, of course, recreational fishers and a large section of the environment movement have been accused of being anti-science in our questioning of the allocation of the quota for a very large fishing vessel with freezing capacity and the potential risks that poses to Australia's marine resources. In this case it was a small pelagic fishery.


The argument has been put very clearly by the Liberals, particularly by Senator Colbeck, who I expect is going to speak next, that the decision to allocate that quota was made on good science. There are a number of scientists from different agencies who were involved in those decision-making processes. It is interesting that the Greens moved to disallow that quota. The argument was very clearly put that parliament should not have the ability to interfere with the good science of that decision. Certainly, it was suggested that we were being populist and politicising a scientific debate.


I find it very hard to reconcile that logic with the Liberals doing exactly the same thing with marine protected areas, which is essentially what this bill is about, because marine protected areas have been based on years of scientific research. I will fill that detail in in a second, but there is over 30 years of research—not just in Australia, in places like South Australia, but all around the world. Thousands of scientific reports have looked at both the science—




Senator Colbeck:
  Thousands!




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Thousands —and I can give you the source of that quote, Senator Colbeck—have focused on the scientific principles that underlie the benefits of marine protected areas.


Benefits can be increased biomass, increased fecundity and providing buffers against risks in our very complex marine ecosystems; and there can also be, of course, economic benefits and economic costs—which is, no doubt, one of the key reasons that the Liberals are casting concern over the rollout of marine protected areas around the country.


The concept behind a marine protected area is very simple; it is an insurance policy. This is unlike our land-based ecosystems, where we can actually send scientists into places like forests or wetlands and we can actually do science that is visible. We can take samples and we can have easy access to the resource. Of course, that still has a long way to go in terms of how we value our ecosystem services and the science behind that. But when you look at a maritime ecosystem, a lot of what we are focused on is underwater, and it is very difficult, very expensive and very costly to get the exact information that you need.


This has been widely recognised as an issue with marine protected areas over the years. It is not like you can suddenly and easily access the bottom of the ocean floor, potentially kilometres underwater. So with ocean ecosystems we have a much larger uncertainty in our studies and analysis of things such as the biomass of fish species, or the potential risks of extinction of species, or whether the biomasses are at a level where they can be commercially exploited. There is no doubt—and this has come up with the supertrawler debate as well—that it is expensive and costly to do the scientific research that is necessary to understand issues such as biomass and its extraction in our ecosystems. It is expensive, it is difficult and it is complex because marine ecosystems are influenced by thousands of variables.


What is the benefit of having a marine protected area? The benefit of putting aside an area for conservation is really simple. Marine protected areas can be multiple use; they can be no-take zones, which do not allow for activities such as commercial or recreational fisheries; they can exclude other extractive industries such as oil and gas or even tourism; they can leave an area alone. The key reason for doing that is that it provides a risk buffer from what both scientists and economists call exogenous shocks—in other words, things we can put into models for simulation purposes but that we cannot necessarily predict with any certainty.


A really good example is in Tasmania at the moment, with the rock lobster industry on the east coast of Tasmania being shut down because of an exogenous shock—a toxicity impact from algal blooms. We also know in relation to the rock lobster industry and the small pelagic fishery that ocean temperature changes, both at the surface and the subsurface, have been responsible for the productivity of those fisheries. So climate change issues are also exogenous shocks. We have had viruses in our fisheries in species such as abalone. Given the best fisheries management practices in the world—and I am quite happy to accept the argument that Australia has some of the best managed fisheries in the world—we still see declines in species. With all the best intentions and all the best science, we have examples such as the rock lobster industry in Tasmania that show that sometimes we do not get it right. That is no-one's fault. That is because these ecosystems are very complex and the variables that influence them are very difficult to predict. Even the Atlantis model, which CSIRO have constructed and based out of Hobart, cannot possibly accurately predict some of these impacts. So it is really simple: if we accept that we have limitations in our understanding of our ecosystems, that we do not know everything, then we need to put aside some areas that we cannot touch. That is what marine protected areas are designed to do.


A lot of the variables that influence how effective marine protected areas are in rebuilding our marine ecosystems depend on factors such as how denuded they are in the first place, the ocean currents, the bathymetry of ocean floors, the existence of other species, and all these variables need to be modelled. But the studies we have on existing marine protected areas show us that if we put an area aside and leave it alone, then over a period of time—it does not happen straight away—we observe what both scientists and economists call spillover effects. We see a build-up of biomass as we do not fish the area, as we take that pressure off it. Clearly, fishing is a man-made activity that puts pressure on ecosystems. We know that overfishing all round the world has been one of the most significant causes of species decline and loss of biomass. There are some really famous examples, not necessarily in Australia but certainly internationally, that no-one in this chamber would dispute have led to species collapse in commercial fisheries.


If we take the human element out of it, we have to assume that other impacts will occur in our marine protected areas such as from climate change. Agricultural run-off is another really good example of a man-made influence that negatively impacts on our marine ecosystems. We have also seen nutrient changes. We can see issues with shipping and pollution from oil and gas. What we saw recently with the BP spill in the US is a very good example of where the externalities posed by commercial activities in marine protected areas can cause extensive damage to marine ecosystems. So, again, if you put aside an area in the ocean, which is a really simple concept, then that is an insurance policy for future generations to allow marine species to grow in numbers. If you take a lot of that pressure off, you clearly have at least the ability to recoup some of what you have already lost. Over time, these spillover effects, which will include the building of biomass and will vary depending on what species you are discussing, will produce benefits in the areas surrounding the marine protected areas.


I mentioned in the chamber a month ago that the first marine protected area was discovered by accident. It was not protected because people wanted more fish or wanted to leave an exploited resource alone. It was protected because the Space Shuttle and, before that, the Saturn rockets needed a security exclusion zone at Cape Kennedy, which used to be called Cape Canaveral. That exclusion zone varies between 50 and 30 miles, or up to 40 or 50 kilometres. People started noticing that areas surrounding that exclusion zone were very abundant in fish life and other marine species, and that was where the first studies occurred. So marine protected areas were discovered by accident, thanks to the Cape Kennedy space station. That was the birth of the application of science to marine protected areas and the benefits they may have.


I mentioned earlier that there have been a number of studies, and I want to read a quick version of a report put together by Dr Melissa Nursey-Bray at the University of Adelaide. She summarised 48 recent scientific reports on the science of marine protected areas, outlining all their recommendations in terms of the positive impact they have had on fisheries and, in some cases, where the evidence has not shown that. There have been some examples where marine protected areas have not necessarily increased the fecundity or the biomass of fish species, and there are good reasons for that.


These studies were from right across the world: from Arabia, Spain, South Africa, the Philippines, New Zealand, South Australia, Tasmania—including off Maria Island which is a very small marine reserve—Great Britain, the USA—and that includes Florida, California and Maine—Kenya, Fiji, Western Australia and the Bahamas. Wherever marine protected areas have been scientifically studied they have been shown to have benefits to fisheries. One specific report actually summarised 89 separate studies dating back to 1992, and that was just one of the reports that Dr Nursey-Bray aggregated in her report. That was what the Los Angeles Times recently focused on when they wrote a story on the science behind marine protected areas. They said:


In a survey of 89 scientific papers, UC Santa Barbara researchers found that 90% of marine reserves around the world had more fish, 84% had much larger fish and shellfish and 59% had a far greater variety of marine life than did adjacent waters—


that were not protected. They went on:


So far, the spillover effect hasn't won many converts among anglers, who disdain it as ""junk science,"" and fear new limits on where they can fish. 


'Junk science' is the issue that we started with and no doubt it is the Liberals' point here in the Senate when they dispute the benefits of marine protected areas. It is probably the underlying reason they want the ability for parliament to disallow the science behind marine protected areas, because that is essentially what we are doing in here today. We are giving us as senators and as MPs the ability to disallow over 30 years of scientific research on the benefits of marine protected areas.


The economics is slightly different. It is not black and white, and I admit that. Marine protected areas are not a silver bullet solution to providing benefits, because there are costs associated with protecting and conserving parts of the ocean. That is purely from an economic point of view. If there is displaced fishing effort, then that fishing effort should potentially be compensated, and that is certainly something that has been dealt with in the bioregional plans, though no doubt they will dispute that and say that not enough compensation is being paid. 


But we do not just look at costs in terms of financial or economic costs. We have a duty to look at a much larger array of costs when we look at our environment and the importance that it plays in our daily lives. We need to look at social costs and of course those costs need to be assessed in relation to impacts on communities, and we can look at cultural aspects there as well. But we also need to look at environmental costs and ecological costs in areas of overfishing. And, as any first-year economics student should be able to tell you, once you include those extra environmental and social costs into, for example, the price of fish, then that market is suddenly efficient because the price of those goods factors in all the costs. 


I would argue that the externalities that we see in areas such as fisheries—and they are just one example—show that markets have often failed to price those costs into the goods that we buy and sell on markets. It is the role of government, in my opinion and certainly the opinion of the Greens and no doubt Labor on this issue, that the government has a very important role to play in making sure that these externalities are priced into markets. The carbon tax is a very good example of that, and the bioregional plans that provide conservation outcomes reduce the risks of increased costs in the future. If we do deplete our fish stocks—and as I mentioned earlier there are numerous examples of that occurring—then the costs in the future to future generations such as the kids in the chamber here today, are going to much larger. We have a role and responsibility to play in putting aside contingency plans to make sure that we have resources for the future. 


That is what marine protected areas are designed to do. That is what thousands of research reports into marine protected areas have shown. The science has been going on for a long time and it has been funded all around the world. The science has shown that marine protected areas have positive spillover effects and positive benefits not just for fish stocks or other marine species, which further down the chain predate and feed on other types of fish species, but there are also positive benefits for communities in the area. If we do get recovery particularly into depleted and endangered or threatened species, then we have the ability to access those fisheries resources into the future.


Marine protected areas are not perfect because of that complexity that we see in our marine ecosystems and they are only one of the fisheries management tools. I agree that they are a fisheries management tool as well as a conservation outcome.




Senator Colbeck:
  It is not a fisheries management tool.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  It is a fisheries management tool—I will take that interjection. It has to be a fisheries management tool if you believe the science. The science says that fish stocks will recover.




Senator Colbeck:
  You misrepresent the science.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  You will get your chance in 16 seconds. Do I get 16 seconds back, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall?

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (09:52):  I rise to make my contribution to my private senator's bill: the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bioregional Plans) Bill 2011. This is a very simple piece of legislation. It does one thing. It gives the parliament the opportunity to have oversight over the declaration of marine protected areas. It is a very simple piece of legislation.


We have just heard from the Greens what we continuously hear from the Greens—a whole heap of mind-reading. I love it that the Greens think that they know what we are thinking. They attribute thoughts to us. They attribute motives to us. They misrepresent what we say and what we think, even though I do not think they really do know what we think. We have just seen that again today. The representation from the Greens is that the coalition does not believe in marine protected areas. That is patently not true. If you look at our record with respect to marine protected areas, you will see that the areas we implemented in 2006 in the south-east around Tasmania, which is our home state, Senator Whish-Wilson—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  What? One per cent of state waters, Senator.




Senator COLBECK:
  Again, you have no idea what you are talking about. There is danger in coming into this place and not knowing what you are talking about. The marine protected area in Commonwealth waters around Tasmania that we delivered was 20 per cent larger than the area that was proposed by the government in the initial round. What we implemented in those waters in the south-east was 20 per cent larger than what was initially proposed. The Greens were running around Tasmania saying that the coalition wants to shrink it. The initial boundaries were proposed by us. They were not good, I have to say. They had seriously bad impacts on the fishing industry in Tasmania.


There was a cooperative process that allowed negotiation between the fishing industry and the environment groups. We put everybody in the tent. We did not do what this government has done, which is silo the negotiations and play parties off against each other and basically take the line being run by giant environmental groups from not just Australia but the United States. Thousands of emails have come into Australia from overseas trying to push the government into implementing these marine protected areas. Through that negotiation process we changed the boundaries, provided the environmental values and provided the representative areas that were required under this process. We reduced the impact on the fishing industry in Tasmania by 90 per cent and increased the area by 20 per cent. So, Senator, do not come in here talking rubbish. You have no idea what you are talking about, and you have demonstrated that again here today.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Order! Senators will address their remarks through the chair.




Senator COLBECK:
  Let us go to what a globally recognised expert says in respect of marine protected areas. The senator has just gone through that process here yet again in his representations this morning. Professor Ray Hilborn is one of the most globally recognised marine scientists in the world. 



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator COLBECK:
  You say he is paid for by the fishing industry, but when he went to find out what was going on he put together a group of people from across the spectrum. He did not just go and science shop; he put together a group of peers from across the spectrum—from those directly opposed to his view of the world to those who have a more extreme view in the other direction. He did not just go and science shop. He did not find somebody who did not know anything or did not have any expertise in the area, which is what the Greens quite often do, and get them to comment on a scientific area in which they have no expertise and attack scientists who do have expertise. 


He got a full spectrum of people to provide a report that put a very different picture than what one of the scientists, Dr Boris Worm, had initially indicated. He went to the person involved in that piece of science that said that the oceans could be empty of fish by 2047. That was the science that Dr Boris Worm had put together. Professor Hilborn went to Dr Worm. A group of 23 scientists put together a report that caused Dr Worm to step back from his initial statement. That was the work he was prepared to do. Senator, you should not just science shop and pick out a few people who will provide the answer that you want. You should go to the direct science, the real science and the credible science. Do not come in here with your claims.


I am proud of the record that the coalition has with respect to marine protected areas. Our record stands. The people who have been involved in working with us know that that is the case. Why are we taking the stand that we are taking right now? Not because we do not believe in marine protected areas but because in the development of these marine protected areas the science has not been used. That is why we have a concern about this current process. How do we know the science has not been used? Because the government has admitted it.


The Greens are happy to go along with lockups, because that is what they do. They live in the past. Before the EPBC Act came into being and before a whole range of other management tools came into being, the only way to protect some areas was to lock them up. I am happy to concede that that was the case. We in Australia have done some pretty average things to our environment—to our marine areas and our land areas—but we have learnt. As Senator Whish-Wilson has conceded, we do have among the best fisheries management systems in the world. We need to continue to improve those.


Rather than just lock up bits of the environment, which is what the environmental groups who still live in the 19th century would like us to do, we need to look after all of our marine environment. We should not just lock up huge swathes of the ocean and say, 'You can't go there.' That is not what we ought to be doing. We ought to be looking after it all. So do not come in here and tell us that we do not have any desire to look after our marine environment and we do not have any desire to protect areas. We believe that if there are areas that deserve to be protected then we should protect them, but we should not be making decisions based on representations by, for example, the Pew Foundation, which has run a campaign to lock up pretty much the entire Coral Sea.


Senator Whish-Wilson talked about economics. What really gets up the nose of my constituents, your constituents and other people here in Australia is that the Pew Foundation then admit that it is not going to pursue the same scale of lockups in the United States because it does not stack up economically, because of the negative economic impact on the American economy.


So they are happy to come and lock ours up but they will not do it in the United States because of the economic impact.


Here we have Minister Burke admitting that there are fewer marine protected areas off New South Wales because he has locked so much up in the Coral Sea. Tell me that is based on science. What a load of baloney. Here we have an area that has huge potential in respect of meeting our future seafood needs—and they are significant as 25 per cent of the globe's protein currently comes from seafood. If you were to replace that with terrestrially based protein, you would have to clear the world's remaining rainforests 23 times over—so talk about a small picture view of the world from the Greens and talk about a small picture view of the world from the government!


Let us have a look at the broader picture. Let us look at the requirements to look after our environment and also to feed ourselves and those of us on the planet. Let us not lock ourselves out of a huge swathes of the ocean when we have a whole series of other management tools. Let us not lock ourselves out of our oceans and our fisheries because somebody else is raping and pillaging theirs. What a sensible move that is! How ridiculous to suggest that, because fisheries management is unsustainable in other parts of the world, we should close down ours. Give me a break!


What we should be doing—and, in fact, this is what Australia is doing—is participating in improving fisheries management in other parts of the world. We are acting in a whole range of fisheries, through a number of fisheries management systems and through a number of international agreements, to improve fisheries management in those regions. You talk about small pelagics; we are involved in looking at the South Pacific small pelagic fishery and improving that, an area where the fish stocks have collapsed because of overfishing, not because of supertrawlers—as would be implied by the Greens and their environmental group friends—but because the fishery has been overfished for years long before the advent of large freezer vessels. The fishery has been overfished for years and it has not been improved by the fact that there have been no fisheries management systems in place and there have been no quotas in place, but fortunately there now will be. That fishery will have the opportunity to recover because there will be fisheries management put in place and there will be quotas put in place. The decision to do that is already having an effect on the amount of effort that is put into that fishery.


So for Senator Whish-Wilson to come in here and misrepresent where the coalition sits in respect of fisheries management of marine parks is quite dishonest because we have a strong view about utilising the science and about believing the science. And this was coming from a person who said, 'We don't care about the science. We just don't want the boat.' I have to say it is quite hypocritical of him to come in here and lecture us about science.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Where is your evidence of that?




Senator COLBECK:
  Well, you repeated it in this chamber—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President. In fact, questions to the minister in question time here this week confirm they are not interested in the science around the small pelagic fishery, because the weight of the science—the credible science—supports the quota that was set in all of those fisheries.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Credible science?




Senator COLBECK:
  So here they go bashing scientists again. If it does not agree with what they say, they will attack the scientists. That is the process that they run through, and if you do not believe me have a chat in Tasmania to Nigel Forteath, who was hounded out of the state by the Greens because he dared to disagree with Bob Brown. Death threats, phone calls in the middle of the night and he had to take his family out of the state—an absolute disgrace what the Greens did to that man.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Where is your evidence?




Senator COLBECK:
  I will bring the evidence in here, Senator, and I will table it. I sat down and had conversations with Professor Forteath so I can tell you that very well. In fact, the Greens were censured in this place for what they did to him, so go back and have a look at the Hansard and you will find your own history.


This is a very simple piece of legislation. We know because the government has admitted that these zones that are being proposed by Minister Burke at the moment are not based on science. I have already given an indication as to the zones that were declared off New South Wales. I was in Queensland at the beginning of the year. I went up to have a talk to some of the fishermen in that region about the proposed declaration of the Coral Sea. Unfortunately, they could not meet with me on the day because they were meeting with the department to talk about the proposals for declaring the Coral Sea. One of the questions that they went into the meeting and asked of the department was: can you put on the table for us the science that supports declaring the entire Coral Sea a marine zone? When I met with them at morning tea directly after they had had that conversation with the department, I found the answer was: 'There is none.' The only thing that there was was a campaign by the Pew Foundation and environmental groups here in Australia. That is the basis on which Tony Burke has closed off the Coral Sea.


I go back to the discussion I had a moment ago about our seafood needs. As I said, 25 per cent of the globe's protein comes from seafood—a full quarter. The broader environmental impacts of having to replace that with terrestrially based protein do not bear thinking about. As I said, if you were to replace it with grass-fed protein, you would have to clear the globe's rainforests 23 times over. It just does not add up. The health of our marine environment and the capacity to achieve and maintain a level of protein from wild catch fisheries is absolutely vital. In fact, if you look at the wild catch fishery you will find that it is the most environmentally friendly form of gathering protein of the lot. It is much more environmentally friendly than any form of terrestrial farming. It is the most environmentally friendly because you can take out your quota, based on sustainably set quotas with proper management tools, and the natural environment does the rest for you. It is the most environmentally friendly form, so it is vitally important that we maintain it as part of our overall protein task.


Australia's potential demand for seafood will grow by 850,000 tonnes by 2020. I am not talking out to 2030 or 2040 or 2050 but by 2020—that is, in eight years we will need an extra 850,000 tonnes. The potential fishery in the Coral Sea alone is of that magnitude in two species.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  You'd better start protecting it, then.




Senator COLBECK:
  So that is the answer from the Greens: shut down a potential fishery and import from unsustainable sources. Let us offshore our environmental responsibilities. Let us calm our conscience by offshoring. Let us take it somewhere else where they do not have the fisheries management tools in place.


What the coalition would like to see is marine protected areas based on science, not based on campaigns by environmental groups from the United States, not based on, 'Let's move it away from this Labor seat and put it up here next to this coalition seat.' Let us have marine protected areas based on science. Let us put everybody in the room together. Let us put the science on the table. Let us have the conversation between everyone. Let us not play groups off against each other, which is what the government has done in this particular process, because the groups come in and tell me what has just happened to them. Let us have a genuine consultation. Let us not just have show-and-tell, where the government turns up and says, 'Here's the maps; that's what's going to occur.' Let us have a consultation process where the final maps—the maps were put out 60 days ago or a bit longer and the minister said, 'This is not about the boundaries; this is about whether we do it or not.' That is not a consultation. That is a take it or leave it process.


That is what the coalition is concerned about. The coalition is concerned about the process. We are not contesting the science, as the Greens contend we are. We have said we believe in the science. If something needs to be protected, we should protect it. But we need to look after it all, not just bits of it. Let us not salve our conscience by saying that we have locked up 30 per cent of our marine environment, that we have locked out our fishing industry from all of those areas. Let us not salve our conscience by thinking that we have done our job. Let us look after it all. Let us ensure that we have strong fisheries management.


Senator Whish-Wilson indicated that this is a fisheries management tool. Not even the scientists contend that it is a fisheries management tool. The government does not contend that it is a fisheries management tool. It is not a fisheries management tool. The process around the marine protected areas is about looking after important parts of our environment. One of the issues around that is that fish tend to congregate around formations in the ocean. That is just the nature of things, and that is where the contest comes into place as part of the development of these marine protected areas. That is where the difficulty is.


This process also has not compensated people. There is $100 million sitting on the table for the fishing industry, but what about the downstream businesses and communities? There is absolutely nothing there for them. What about the recreational fishing sector, which is something like a $10 billion a year industry? There is nothing there for them. There is no recognition of the bait shops, the boat sellers and the charter operators, so any argument about proper compensation as part of this process is completely and utterly out of order. There is not proper consultation. The process that was put in place in the south-east put up $220 million, just for the south-east. In this process, we have $100 million for the rest of the country. We have a very simple proposition here: allow this declaration process to be scrutinised by the parliament. That is all we say, and that is what this bill does.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2012-11-29,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (09:31):  I rise to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bioregional Plans) Bill 2011, reminding myself this morning that we only spoke about this same issue very recently. It is an issue that has been near and dear to my heart over the years—marine protected areas.


I have been involved with marine protected areas through my research at the University of Tasmania over the years, and I volunteered my time to consult with conservation groups such as the ACF and the Wilderness Society. In the rollout of marine protected areas in South Australia, I have briefed both the South Australian Liberal Party and Labor Party over the years on the economics of marine protected areas. And, of course, the economics are closely tied to the science of marine protected areas. But I will get back to that in a minute.


Essentially, what we are debating here this morning is the role of science: the importance of science in policy and decision making, and whether the government should be able to overturn good science for political reasons. Clearly, this has been a big issue in the chamber with the supertrawler debate over the last six months. I and other members of the Greens and, of course, recreational fishers and a large section of the environment movement have been accused of being anti-science in our questioning of the allocation of the quota for a very large fishing vessel with freezing capacity and the potential risks that poses to Australia's marine resources. In this case it was a small pelagic fishery.


The argument has been put very clearly by the Liberals, particularly by Senator Colbeck, who I expect is going to speak next, that the decision to allocate that quota was made on good science. There are a number of scientists from different agencies who were involved in those decision-making processes. It is interesting that the Greens moved to disallow that quota. The argument was very clearly put that parliament should not have the ability to interfere with the good science of that decision. Certainly, it was suggested that we were being populist and politicising a scientific debate.


I find it very hard to reconcile that logic with the Liberals doing exactly the same thing with marine protected areas, which is essentially what this bill is about, because marine protected areas have been based on years of scientific research. I will fill that detail in in a second, but there is over 30 years of research—not just in Australia, in places like South Australia, but all around the world. Thousands of scientific reports have looked at both the science—




Senator Colbeck:
  Thousands!




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Thousands —and I can give you the source of that quote, Senator Colbeck—have focused on the scientific principles that underlie the benefits of marine protected areas.


Benefits can be increased biomass, increased fecundity and providing buffers against risks in our very complex marine ecosystems; and there can also be, of course, economic benefits and economic costs—which is, no doubt, one of the key reasons that the Liberals are casting concern over the rollout of marine protected areas around the country.


The concept behind a marine protected area is very simple; it is an insurance policy. This is unlike our land-based ecosystems, where we can actually send scientists into places like forests or wetlands and we can actually do science that is visible. We can take samples and we can have easy access to the resource. Of course, that still has a long way to go in terms of how we value our ecosystem services and the science behind that. But when you look at a maritime ecosystem, a lot of what we are focused on is underwater, and it is very difficult, very expensive and very costly to get the exact information that you need.


This has been widely recognised as an issue with marine protected areas over the years. It is not like you can suddenly and easily access the bottom of the ocean floor, potentially kilometres underwater. So with ocean ecosystems we have a much larger uncertainty in our studies and analysis of things such as the biomass of fish species, or the potential risks of extinction of species, or whether the biomasses are at a level where they can be commercially exploited. There is no doubt—and this has come up with the supertrawler debate as well—that it is expensive and costly to do the scientific research that is necessary to understand issues such as biomass and its extraction in our ecosystems. It is expensive, it is difficult and it is complex because marine ecosystems are influenced by thousands of variables.


What is the benefit of having a marine protected area? The benefit of putting aside an area for conservation is really simple. Marine protected areas can be multiple use; they can be no-take zones, which do not allow for activities such as commercial or recreational fisheries; they can exclude other extractive industries such as oil and gas or even tourism; they can leave an area alone. The key reason for doing that is that it provides a risk buffer from what both scientists and economists call exogenous shocks—in other words, things we can put into models for simulation purposes but that we cannot necessarily predict with any certainty.


A really good example is in Tasmania at the moment, with the rock lobster industry on the east coast of Tasmania being shut down because of an exogenous shock—a toxicity impact from algal blooms. We also know in relation to the rock lobster industry and the small pelagic fishery that ocean temperature changes, both at the surface and the subsurface, have been responsible for the productivity of those fisheries. So climate change issues are also exogenous shocks. We have had viruses in our fisheries in species such as abalone. Given the best fisheries management practices in the world—and I am quite happy to accept the argument that Australia has some of the best managed fisheries in the world—we still see declines in species. With all the best intentions and all the best science, we have examples such as the rock lobster industry in Tasmania that show that sometimes we do not get it right. That is no-one's fault. That is because these ecosystems are very complex and the variables that influence them are very difficult to predict. Even the Atlantis model, which CSIRO have constructed and based out of Hobart, cannot possibly accurately predict some of these impacts. So it is really simple: if we accept that we have limitations in our understanding of our ecosystems, that we do not know everything, then we need to put aside some areas that we cannot touch. That is what marine protected areas are designed to do.


A lot of the variables that influence how effective marine protected areas are in rebuilding our marine ecosystems depend on factors such as how denuded they are in the first place, the ocean currents, the bathymetry of ocean floors, the existence of other species, and all these variables need to be modelled. But the studies we have on existing marine protected areas show us that if we put an area aside and leave it alone, then over a period of time—it does not happen straight away—we observe what both scientists and economists call spillover effects. We see a build-up of biomass as we do not fish the area, as we take that pressure off it. Clearly, fishing is a man-made activity that puts pressure on ecosystems. We know that overfishing all round the world has been one of the most significant causes of species decline and loss of biomass. There are some really famous examples, not necessarily in Australia but certainly internationally, that no-one in this chamber would dispute have led to species collapse in commercial fisheries.


If we take the human element out of it, we have to assume that other impacts will occur in our marine protected areas such as from climate change. Agricultural run-off is another really good example of a man-made influence that negatively impacts on our marine ecosystems. We have also seen nutrient changes. We can see issues with shipping and pollution from oil and gas. What we saw recently with the BP spill in the US is a very good example of where the externalities posed by commercial activities in marine protected areas can cause extensive damage to marine ecosystems. So, again, if you put aside an area in the ocean, which is a really simple concept, then that is an insurance policy for future generations to allow marine species to grow in numbers. If you take a lot of that pressure off, you clearly have at least the ability to recoup some of what you have already lost. Over time, these spillover effects, which will include the building of biomass and will vary depending on what species you are discussing, will produce benefits in the areas surrounding the marine protected areas.


I mentioned in the chamber a month ago that the first marine protected area was discovered by accident. It was not protected because people wanted more fish or wanted to leave an exploited resource alone. It was protected because the Space Shuttle and, before that, the Saturn rockets needed a security exclusion zone at Cape Kennedy, which used to be called Cape Canaveral. That exclusion zone varies between 50 and 30 miles, or up to 40 or 50 kilometres. People started noticing that areas surrounding that exclusion zone were very abundant in fish life and other marine species, and that was where the first studies occurred. So marine protected areas were discovered by accident, thanks to the Cape Kennedy space station. That was the birth of the application of science to marine protected areas and the benefits they may have.


I mentioned earlier that there have been a number of studies, and I want to read a quick version of a report put together by Dr Melissa Nursey-Bray at the University of Adelaide. She summarised 48 recent scientific reports on the science of marine protected areas, outlining all their recommendations in terms of the positive impact they have had on fisheries and, in some cases, where the evidence has not shown that. There have been some examples where marine protected areas have not necessarily increased the fecundity or the biomass of fish species, and there are good reasons for that.


These studies were from right across the world: from Arabia, Spain, South Africa, the Philippines, New Zealand, South Australia, Tasmania—including off Maria Island which is a very small marine reserve—Great Britain, the USA—and that includes Florida, California and Maine—Kenya, Fiji, Western Australia and the Bahamas. Wherever marine protected areas have been scientifically studied they have been shown to have benefits to fisheries. One specific report actually summarised 89 separate studies dating back to 1992, and that was just one of the reports that Dr Nursey-Bray aggregated in her report. That was what the Los Angeles Times recently focused on when they wrote a story on the science behind marine protected areas. They said:


In a survey of 89 scientific papers, UC Santa Barbara researchers found that 90% of marine reserves around the world had more fish, 84% had much larger fish and shellfish and 59% had a far greater variety of marine life than did adjacent waters—


that were not protected. They went on:


So far, the spillover effect hasn't won many converts among anglers, who disdain it as ""junk science,"" and fear new limits on where they can fish. 


'Junk science' is the issue that we started with and no doubt it is the Liberals' point here in the Senate when they dispute the benefits of marine protected areas. It is probably the underlying reason they want the ability for parliament to disallow the science behind marine protected areas, because that is essentially what we are doing in here today. We are giving us as senators and as MPs the ability to disallow over 30 years of scientific research on the benefits of marine protected areas.


The economics is slightly different. It is not black and white, and I admit that. Marine protected areas are not a silver bullet solution to providing benefits, because there are costs associated with protecting and conserving parts of the ocean. That is purely from an economic point of view. If there is displaced fishing effort, then that fishing effort should potentially be compensated, and that is certainly something that has been dealt with in the bioregional plans, though no doubt they will dispute that and say that not enough compensation is being paid. 


But we do not just look at costs in terms of financial or economic costs. We have a duty to look at a much larger array of costs when we look at our environment and the importance that it plays in our daily lives. We need to look at social costs and of course those costs need to be assessed in relation to impacts on communities, and we can look at cultural aspects there as well. But we also need to look at environmental costs and ecological costs in areas of overfishing. And, as any first-year economics student should be able to tell you, once you include those extra environmental and social costs into, for example, the price of fish, then that market is suddenly efficient because the price of those goods factors in all the costs. 


I would argue that the externalities that we see in areas such as fisheries—and they are just one example—show that markets have often failed to price those costs into the goods that we buy and sell on markets. It is the role of government, in my opinion and certainly the opinion of the Greens and no doubt Labor on this issue, that the government has a very important role to play in making sure that these externalities are priced into markets. The carbon tax is a very good example of that, and the bioregional plans that provide conservation outcomes reduce the risks of increased costs in the future. If we do deplete our fish stocks—and as I mentioned earlier there are numerous examples of that occurring—then the costs in the future to future generations such as the kids in the chamber here today, are going to much larger. We have a role and responsibility to play in putting aside contingency plans to make sure that we have resources for the future. 


That is what marine protected areas are designed to do. That is what thousands of research reports into marine protected areas have shown. The science has been going on for a long time and it has been funded all around the world. The science has shown that marine protected areas have positive spillover effects and positive benefits not just for fish stocks or other marine species, which further down the chain predate and feed on other types of fish species, but there are also positive benefits for communities in the area. If we do get recovery particularly into depleted and endangered or threatened species, then we have the ability to access those fisheries resources into the future.


Marine protected areas are not perfect because of that complexity that we see in our marine ecosystems and they are only one of the fisheries management tools. I agree that they are a fisheries management tool as well as a conservation outcome.




Senator Colbeck:
  It is not a fisheries management tool.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  It is a fisheries management tool—I will take that interjection. It has to be a fisheries management tool if you believe the science. The science says that fish stocks will recover.




Senator Colbeck:
  You misrepresent the science.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (09:52):  I rise to make my contribution to my private senator's bill: the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bioregional Plans) Bill 2011. This is a very simple piece of legislation. It does one thing. It gives the parliament the opportunity to have oversight over the declaration of marine protected areas. It is a very simple piece of legislation.


We have just heard from the Greens what we continuously hear from the Greens—a whole heap of mind-reading. I love it that the Greens think that they know what we are thinking. They attribute thoughts to us. They attribute motives to us. They misrepresent what we say and what we think, even though I do not think they really do know what we think. We have just seen that again today. The representation from the Greens is that the coalition does not believe in marine protected areas. That is patently not true. If you look at our record with respect to marine protected areas, you will see that the areas we implemented in 2006 in the south-east around Tasmania, which is our home state, Senator Whish-Wilson—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  What? One per cent of state waters, Senator.




Senator COLBECK:
  Again, you have no idea what you are talking about. There is danger in coming into this place and not knowing what you are talking about. The marine protected area in Commonwealth waters around Tasmania that we delivered was 20 per cent larger than the area that was proposed by the government in the initial round. What we implemented in those waters in the south-east was 20 per cent larger than what was initially proposed. The Greens were running around Tasmania saying that the coalition wants to shrink it. The initial boundaries were proposed by us. They were not good, I have to say. They had seriously bad impacts on the fishing industry in Tasmania.


There was a cooperative process that allowed negotiation between the fishing industry and the environment groups. We put everybody in the tent. We did not do what this government has done, which is silo the negotiations and play parties off against each other and basically take the line being run by giant environmental groups from not just Australia but the United States. Thousands of emails have come into Australia from overseas trying to push the government into implementing these marine protected areas. Through that negotiation process we changed the boundaries, provided the environmental values and provided the representative areas that were required under this process. We reduced the impact on the fishing industry in Tasmania by 90 per cent and increased the area by 20 per cent. So, Senator, do not come in here talking rubbish. You have no idea what you are talking about, and you have demonstrated that again here today.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Order! Senators will address their remarks through the chair.




Senator COLBECK:
  Let us go to what a globally recognised expert says in respect of marine protected areas. The senator has just gone through that process here yet again in his representations this morning. Professor Ray Hilborn is one of the most globally recognised marine scientists in the world. 



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator COLBECK:
  You say he is paid for by the fishing industry, but when he went to find out what was going on he put together a group of people from across the spectrum. He did not just go and science shop; he put together a group of peers from across the spectrum—from those directly opposed to his view of the world to those who have a more extreme view in the other direction. He did not just go and science shop. He did not find somebody who did not know anything or did not have any expertise in the area, which is what the Greens quite often do, and get them to comment on a scientific area in which they have no expertise and attack scientists who do have expertise. 


He got a full spectrum of people to provide a report that put a very different picture than what one of the scientists, Dr Boris Worm, had initially indicated. He went to the person involved in that piece of science that said that the oceans could be empty of fish by 2047. That was the science that Dr Boris Worm had put together. Professor Hilborn went to Dr Worm. A group of 23 scientists put together a report that caused Dr Worm to step back from his initial statement. That was the work he was prepared to do. Senator, you should not just science shop and pick out a few people who will provide the answer that you want. You should go to the direct science, the real science and the credible science. Do not come in here with your claims.


I am proud of the record that the coalition has with respect to marine protected areas. Our record stands. The people who have been involved in working with us know that that is the case. Why are we taking the stand that we are taking right now? Not because we do not believe in marine protected areas but because in the development of these marine protected areas the science has not been used. That is why we have a concern about this current process. How do we know the science has not been used? Because the government has admitted it.


The Greens are happy to go along with lockups, because that is what they do. They live in the past. Before the EPBC Act came into being and before a whole range of other management tools came into being, the only way to protect some areas was to lock them up. I am happy to concede that that was the case. We in Australia have done some pretty average things to our environment—to our marine areas and our land areas—but we have learnt. As Senator Whish-Wilson has conceded, we do have among the best fisheries management systems in the world. We need to continue to improve those.


Rather than just lock up bits of the environment, which is what the environmental groups who still live in the 19th century would like us to do, we need to look after all of our marine environment. We should not just lock up huge swathes of the ocean and say, 'You can't go there.' That is not what we ought to be doing. We ought to be looking after it all. So do not come in here and tell us that we do not have any desire to look after our marine environment and we do not have any desire to protect areas. We believe that if there are areas that deserve to be protected then we should protect them, but we should not be making decisions based on representations by, for example, the Pew Foundation, which has run a campaign to lock up pretty much the entire Coral Sea.


Senator Whish-Wilson talked about economics. What really gets up the nose of my constituents, your constituents and other people here in Australia is that the Pew Foundation then admit that it is not going to pursue the same scale of lockups in the United States because it does not stack up economically, because of the negative economic impact on the American economy.


So they are happy to come and lock ours up but they will not do it in the United States because of the economic impact.


Here we have Minister Burke admitting that there are fewer marine protected areas off New South Wales because he has locked so much up in the Coral Sea. Tell me that is based on science. What a load of baloney. Here we have an area that has huge potential in respect of meeting our future seafood needs—and they are significant as 25 per cent of the globe's protein currently comes from seafood. If you were to replace that with terrestrially based protein, you would have to clear the world's remaining rainforests 23 times over—so talk about a small picture view of the world from the Greens and talk about a small picture view of the world from the government!


Let us have a look at the broader picture. Let us look at the requirements to look after our environment and also to feed ourselves and those of us on the planet. Let us not lock ourselves out of a huge swathes of the ocean when we have a whole series of other management tools. Let us not lock ourselves out of our oceans and our fisheries because somebody else is raping and pillaging theirs. What a sensible move that is! How ridiculous to suggest that, because fisheries management is unsustainable in other parts of the world, we should close down ours. Give me a break!


What we should be doing—and, in fact, this is what Australia is doing—is participating in improving fisheries management in other parts of the world. We are acting in a whole range of fisheries, through a number of fisheries management systems and through a number of international agreements, to improve fisheries management in those regions. You talk about small pelagics; we are involved in looking at the South Pacific small pelagic fishery and improving that, an area where the fish stocks have collapsed because of overfishing, not because of supertrawlers—as would be implied by the Greens and their environmental group friends—but because the fishery has been overfished for years long before the advent of large freezer vessels. The fishery has been overfished for years and it has not been improved by the fact that there have been no fisheries management systems in place and there have been no quotas in place, but fortunately there now will be. That fishery will have the opportunity to recover because there will be fisheries management put in place and there will be quotas put in place. The decision to do that is already having an effect on the amount of effort that is put into that fishery.


So for Senator Whish-Wilson to come in here and misrepresent where the coalition sits in respect of fisheries management of marine parks is quite dishonest because we have a strong view about utilising the science and about believing the science. And this was coming from a person who said, 'We don't care about the science. We just don't want the boat.' I have to say it is quite hypocritical of him to come in here and lecture us about science.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Where is your evidence of that?




Senator COLBECK:
  Well, you repeated it in this chamber—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President. In fact, questions to the minister in question time here this week confirm they are not interested in the science around the small pelagic fishery, because the weight of the science—the credible science—supports the quota that was set in all of those fisheries.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Credible science?




Senator COLBECK:
  So here they go bashing scientists again. If it does not agree with what they say, they will attack the scientists. That is the process that they run through, and if you do not believe me have a chat in Tasmania to Nigel Forteath, who was hounded out of the state by the Greens because he dared to disagree with Bob Brown. Death threats, phone calls in the middle of the night and he had to take his family out of the state—an absolute disgrace what the Greens did to that man.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Where is your evidence?




Senator COLBECK:
  I will bring the evidence in here, Senator, and I will table it. I sat down and had conversations with Professor Forteath so I can tell you that very well. In fact, the Greens were censured in this place for what they did to him, so go back and have a look at the Hansard and you will find your own history.


This is a very simple piece of legislation. We know because the government has admitted that these zones that are being proposed by Minister Burke at the moment are not based on science. I have already given an indication as to the zones that were declared off New South Wales. I was in Queensland at the beginning of the year. I went up to have a talk to some of the fishermen in that region about the proposed declaration of the Coral Sea. Unfortunately, they could not meet with me on the day because they were meeting with the department to talk about the proposals for declaring the Coral Sea. One of the questions that they went into the meeting and asked of the department was: can you put on the table for us the science that supports declaring the entire Coral Sea a marine zone? When I met with them at morning tea directly after they had had that conversation with the department, I found the answer was: 'There is none.' The only thing that there was was a campaign by the Pew Foundation and environmental groups here in Australia. That is the basis on which Tony Burke has closed off the Coral Sea.


I go back to the discussion I had a moment ago about our seafood needs. As I said, 25 per cent of the globe's protein comes from seafood—a full quarter. The broader environmental impacts of having to replace that with terrestrially based protein do not bear thinking about. As I said, if you were to replace it with grass-fed protein, you would have to clear the globe's rainforests 23 times over. It just does not add up. The health of our marine environment and the capacity to achieve and maintain a level of protein from wild catch fisheries is absolutely vital. In fact, if you look at the wild catch fishery you will find that it is the most environmentally friendly form of gathering protein of the lot. It is much more environmentally friendly than any form of terrestrial farming. It is the most environmentally friendly because you can take out your quota, based on sustainably set quotas with proper management tools, and the natural environment does the rest for you. It is the most environmentally friendly form, so it is vitally important that we maintain it as part of our overall protein task.


Australia's potential demand for seafood will grow by 850,000 tonnes by 2020. I am not talking out to 2030 or 2040 or 2050 but by 2020—that is, in eight years we will need an extra 850,000 tonnes. The potential fishery in the Coral Sea alone is of that magnitude in two species.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  You'd better start protecting it, then.




Senator COLBECK:
  So that is the answer from the Greens: shut down a potential fishery and import from unsustainable sources. Let us offshore our environmental responsibilities. Let us calm our conscience by offshoring. Let us take it somewhere else where they do not have the fisheries management tools in place.


What the coalition would like to see is marine protected areas based on science, not based on campaigns by environmental groups from the United States, not based on, 'Let's move it away from this Labor seat and put it up here next to this coalition seat.' Let us have marine protected areas based on science. Let us put everybody in the room together. Let us put the science on the table. Let us have the conversation between everyone. Let us not play groups off against each other, which is what the government has done in this particular process, because the groups come in and tell me what has just happened to them. Let us have a genuine consultation. Let us not just have show-and-tell, where the government turns up and says, 'Here's the maps; that's what's going to occur.' Let us have a consultation process where the final maps—the maps were put out 60 days ago or a bit longer and the minister said, 'This is not about the boundaries; this is about whether we do it or not.' That is not a consultation. That is a take it or leave it process.


That is what the coalition is concerned about. The coalition is concerned about the process. We are not contesting the science, as the Greens contend we are. We have said we believe in the science. If something needs to be protected, we should protect it. But we need to look after it all, not just bits of it. Let us not salve our conscience by saying that we have locked up 30 per cent of our marine environment, that we have locked out our fishing industry from all of those areas. Let us not salve our conscience by thinking that we have done our job. Let us look after it all. Let us ensure that we have strong fisheries management.


Senator Whish-Wilson indicated that this is a fisheries management tool. Not even the scientists contend that it is a fisheries management tool. The government does not contend that it is a fisheries management tool. It is not a fisheries management tool. The process around the marine protected areas is about looking after important parts of our environment. One of the issues around that is that fish tend to congregate around formations in the ocean. That is just the nature of things, and that is where the contest comes into place as part of the development of these marine protected areas. That is where the difficulty is.


This process also has not compensated people. There is $100 million sitting on the table for the fishing industry, but what about the downstream businesses and communities? There is absolutely nothing there for them. What about the recreational fishing sector, which is something like a $10 billion a year industry? There is nothing there for them. There is no recognition of the bait shops, the boat sellers and the charter operators, so any argument about proper compensation as part of this process is completely and utterly out of order. There is not proper consultation. The process that was put in place in the south-east put up $220 million, just for the south-east. In this process, we have $100 million for the rest of the country. We have a very simple proposition here: allow this declaration process to be scrutinised by the parliament. That is all we say, and that is what this bill does.

The speech read as follows—



Today in introducing this Bill, I am seeking a commitment from this Parliament to restore the Murray-Darling Basin to health. 


Murray-Darling Basin reform has relied on a number of steps being taken; the National Water Initiative; the development of the water market; the Water Act; the soon to be presented Murray-Darling Basin Plan; with the final step of Parliament to use this Bill to maximise environmental outcomes in the Plan. 


For over a century the Murray-Darling Basin has not been managed with a Basin-wide Plan. This has resulted in environmental degradation, a lack of resilience and an ongoing layer of uncertainty for communities. 


The Basin Plan, to be made later this year, will restore the health of our rivers, support strong regional communities and ensure sustainable food production.


The Murray-Darling Basin Authority is proposing a plan which starts at a benchmark of 2750 gigalitres of environmental water. The proposed Plan includes an adjustment mechanism which will allow the SDL to move up if environmental outcomes can be delivered with less water and move down if constraints are removed and additional water is acquired in a way which is not detrimental to Communities. 


This legislation allows the Commonwealth to use that mechanism. It will provide funding to projects that improve environmental outcomes over and above that in the proposed 2750 gigalitre benchmark.


We will fund removing constraints in the system and we will also fund projects such as on farm infrastructure required to acquire up to an additional 450 gigalitres of water beyond the benchmark in the Plan. This will give us an even better outcome for the Basin.


The additional environmental water made possible by this Bill doesn't only work to achieve better outcomes for the Coorong and Lower Lakes. There are environmental assets, Ramsar listed wetlands, River Red Gum forests, National Parks and homes for Australian wildlife throughout the Basin that will benefit because of this Bill. 


Importantly, the plan being proposed by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority stipulates that additional water beyond the benchmark should only be acquired through methods that deliver additional water for the environment without negative social and economic consequences such as infrastructure.


By way of example, the benefits of modernising on-farm irrigation infrastructure are already well established.


The Government agrees with this approach and this Bill is framed in these terms. 


A secure funding stream extending a decade into the future is required since recovering water is a long-term endeavour.


Accordingly, this Bill amends the Water Act 2007 to provide a secure funding stream to enable up to an additional 450 gigalitres of water to be recovered.


It complements the Water Amendment (Long-term average sustainable diversion limit adjustment) Bill 2012 introduced into this House on the 20th of September this year.


Through the Sustainable Rural Water Use and Infrastructure Program, this Government is already recovering water for the environment through upgrading on-farm and off-farm irrigation infrastructure.


The majority of the proposed funding will be directed towards achieving further improvements in irrigation efficiency.


The Bill also secures funding to enable the increased environmental water to be delivered to wetlands in an efficient and effective manner by addressing existing constraints that limit higher water flows.


Such constraints include outflows from storage dams, low lying infrastructure, and the need to provide for flood easements or agreements with landholders.


All Basin Governments will be fully involved in the development of projects that would underpin Sustainable Diversion Limit adjustments, including initiatives to remove constraints.


Projects to be funded through this special account will be considered alongside projects that allow an increase the SDL by using environmental water more efficiently, so that Governments have a complete picture of what the final SDL will be in all catchments.


Potential enhanced environmental benefits from the provision of an additional 450GL of water and the removal of physical constraints are many. They include: 


salinity in the Coorong and Lower Lakes can be further reduced so that do not exceed levels which are lethal to insects, fish and plants that form important parts of the food-chain;


water levels in the Lower Lakes can be kept above 0.4 metres for 95% of the time helping to maintain flows to the Coorong, prevent acidification, and prevent acid drainage and riverbank collapse below Lock 1; 


The maximum average daily salinity in the Coorong south lagoon can be less than 100 grams per litre for 98% of years and is less than 120 grams per litre at all times in the model period.


the maximum average daily salinity in the Coorong north lagoon can be less than 50 grams per litre for 98% of years, 


maintaining the Murray Mouth at greater depths reducing the risk of dredging being needed to keep it open 


two million tonnes of salt can be exported from the Basin each year as a long term average;


barrage flows to the Coorong can be increased, supporting more years where critical fish migrations can occur for estuarine fish;


there will be opportunities to actively water an additional 35,000 ha of floodplain in SA, NSW and Victoria, improving the health of forests and fish and bird habitat, improving the connection to the river, and replenishing groundwater; and


enhanced instream outcomes and improved connections with low level floodplain and habitats adjacent to rivers in the Southern Basin can be achieved. 


After a century of getting it wrong, this Bill combined with the soon to be finalised Murray-Darling Basin Plan, says that this Parliament will not fail the Basin. The system will return to health and the communities and environment which are nourished by these mighty rivers will have a strong, resilient future. 


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to 5 February 2013, in accordance with standing order 111.

"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2012-11-29,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (13:13):  I resume talking about the draft voluntary code of conduct proposed for the Australian wheat industry. The draft code is flawed in that it is not binding, it is not independent, it does not have a sustainable source of funding via the arbitration act and it may further circumvent the ACCC. In short, the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012 as proposed fails to achieve its competition objectives, hence the reason we now have amendments on the floor, because even the Greens know that any real oversight will only happen if the code is mandatory.


That code should broadly contain, firstly, the adequate provision of grain stock information to enable efficient operation of the market; and, secondly, an enforceable mechanism to ensure fair access to port facilities for non-handling exporters. That means the people who sought to come into this business to compete and to provide an international marketplace, are not prejudiced because they do not own the infrastructure, ports or the up-country rail hubs that have in the past led to a closed market. Thirdly, the code should contain an effective mechanism to provide confidence in cargo integrity, especially in relation to the Australian wheat variety classification system.


The final report of the South Australian Select Committee on the Grain Handling Industry called for the federal government to:


… ensure the benefits of deregulation are fully realised within a competitive and innovative framework that provides the basis for a viable and successful industry.


It is my contention that, unless we ensure that at least those three aforementioned elements are contained within the reform, all of the findings of this inquiry conducted recently, and the many others I have been involved in, will be ignored.


To ensure this actually occurs, the federal government should establish an independent body to maintain this deregulation momentum. I cannot stress enough the importance of the minister appointing a truly representative panel to the proposed advisory body, which is flagged in the amendments to this bill before us. The board should have representatives comprised of grain grower representative bodies, non-bulk handling traders and bulk handlers—and they should all be in equal numbers. This would prevent one interest group from dominating the final code agreement to the detriment of one of the other stakeholders in this very important Australian industry.


The importance of this industry cannot be understated. Not only is wheat growing part of this country's DNA, but also, if demand rises, as everybody expects it will during the much-lauded Asian century, it should be set now to succeed and be the success story for decades to come that it deserves to be. We must get this right now and with the appropriate oversight framework in place—the kind of oversight that the majority of wheat growers of this nation are expecting from the minister. I urge the minister to listen to them. Many of us from this side of the chamber will be working to ensure that the reform required is implemented.


I will be supporting an amended bill. Senator Xenophon, I have some sympathy with a number of your proposed amendments and I will look to talk those through in the committee stage of this bill. I would underline the fact that the minister has a great responsibility to ensure that the proposed advisory body has—if we adopt the amendments to this bill—a mandatory code of conduct so that it functions properly and so that we may look forward to a fair and prosperous wheat industry from this day forward.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:18):  There have been a lot of discussions about the deregulation of the wheat industry, and it is a great tragedy that we have reached this stage without significant and sufficient safeguards in place for producers. The last thing anyone wants to see is the wheat industry turn out like the supermarket industry: controlled by monopolies and with the growers under pressure.


There have been several inquiries in the past to determine how best to deregulate the wheat industry in Australia and what the best arrangements are. Most recently, the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee conducted an inquiry into the operation of grain networks in Australia. That was a very worthwhile inquiry, which I was a part of. The information provided to the committee exposed significant flaws in the grain export networks that must be addressed before complete deregulation can go ahead. Essentially, natural monopolies exist in every state. These companies control grain handling and export from purchasing and storing, to movement, to shipping. That is simply not good enough.


The committee inquiry recommended that Wheat Exports Australia needed a continuing and expanded role in the industry, acting as a combination of ombudsman, accreditor and quality assurance. The committee also recommended that a mechanism to publicise wheat stockpile information should be available to all participants in the bulk export industry, and that the upcoming inquiry into this bill should consider this further. I also made several more recommendations in my additional comments to that report. These recommendations included the establishment of an oversight body for the industry, as well as a mandatory code of conduct relating to the publication of grain storage information, assessment and grading of grain, and access to port and rail transport facilities. My further recommendations related to reviews and investigations that needed to be undertaken by the ACCC or other bodies in relation to specific practices on the part of some bulk grain handlers.


The inquiry into this bill, the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012, by the rural and regional affairs and transport committee also recommended that the government assist the industry in developing measures relating to the publication of information on wheat stock information. There is a clear and compelling narrative running through these recommendations. In the first instance, a lack of clear and complete information on grain stocks that is available to the entire industry is severely disadvantaging producers. This information asymmetry is simply unacceptable. These producers cannot determine when and where they might get the best prices for their product. In fact, this lack of information could be putting the whole industry at risk. In the case of a drought or a crop shortage, the government and other organisations do not have the necessary complete picture of what grain is being held where. The implications of this are obvious.


The other major concern is that there is no oversight of the industry to enforce a code of conduct or to deal with disputes or competition issues. To this end, I will be moving several amendments to strengthen this bill. I note Senator Edwards' sympathy for them; I hope I can have more than Senator Edwards' sympathy. I am grateful for his comments in relation to that, but I hope I can actually have his vote on some of these amendments, particularly on the review mechanism. There must be a review mechanism. I would urge my colleagues in the Australian Greens to consider a review mechanism in relation to this bill, because the implications of this bill are huge for the industry. We need to get it right. If this bill does go ahead in its current form there will be a lack of sufficient safeguards for the industry.


These amendments are designed to build on the agreement with the government reached by the Greens. However, they will go further and insert certain requirements in relation to the structure of the Wheat Industry Advisory Board, the code of conduct—it must be mandatory—and the outline of the act. I will be expanding on these amendments in the committee stage.


Finally, I would like to thank the representatives of Grain Producers Australia, and in particular Pete Mailler and Darren Arney. They have been strong, tireless and articulate advocates for their members. I thank them for the advice and guidance they have given me on this issue.


I want to make it clear that without some form of amendment to strengthen this bill I cannot and will not be supporting this bill. It does not offer enough support and protection for our producers, and I believe it will lead to further market concentration, a severe lack of competition in the market and it will disadvantage our grain producers.

Senator EGGLESTON
 (Western Australia) (13:23):  I rise to speak on the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012, which is before the Senate today. I was one of those who worked with the former member for O'Connor, Wilson Tuckey, and the late Senator Judith Adams towards ending the single-desk marketing system. According to all accounts, deregulation has brought great benefits to the West Australian wheat growers, whose properties are generally larger than those in the eastern states and whose wheat is largely exported. The experience so far in WA has been that deregulation and open marketing has brought great financial benefits to WA growers.


According to the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, the gross value of the Australian wheat crop during the period 2011-12 increased by seven per cent to $7.5 billion. In my home state of WA, again according to the ABS, the value of the wheat crop doubled to $2.8 billion in 2011-12 over the previous year. This period followed the abolition of the single-desk marketing operation in 2008 and surely demonstrates that the strong support by the WA farming organisations in WA for deregulation was proved to have been well worthwhile and in the interests of the Western Australian industry.


The single desk was a monopoly marketing body for wheat overseen by the Australian Wheat Board—AWB. By this process, returns from growers for the sale of wheat, both domestically and internationally, were pooled together on a national scale, the prices were averaged by the Australian Wheat Board and farmers were paid that average price for their wheat. As I mentioned, this covered both domestic and international sales until 1989, after which it focused exclusively on exports before being limited in scope again to bulk exports in its final year of operation.


However, over the years the winds of change for a different wheat marketing system gathered momentum. There was a National Competition Policy review of the Wheat Marketing Act in 1989 which ultimately found no clear benefit to Australian growers from the single-desk arrangements then in place for the export of wheat. Importantly, increasing dissatisfaction with the operation of the single desk mounted, especially in Western Australia. As I have said, farmers in WA have experienced improved financial returns since deregulation was introduced with the abolition of the single desk. Those improved financial returns have in fact been quite substantial. It is therefore unsurprising that WA growers have been very vocal in support of the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012, which, if passed, will complete wheat marketing deregulation following the process set out by the Productivity Commission in an orderly way, albeit with a slight delay from the recommendations of the Productivity Commission.


I acknowledge, as home to the largest grain producers, who are staunch supporters of deregulation, WA and its growers do stand to benefit most by the enactment of this legislation. While not always united in their views in the past, WA's largest and second-largest farm lobby groups, the WA Farmers Federation and the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia, respectively, are now united in their support for the process which will lead to the full deregulation of wheat marketing that will follow the passage of this bill.


Farmers in WA have been pleased with the significant increase in sales and the broadening of the market which deregulation has brought so far. Similarly, the Co-operative Bulk Handling Group, one of Australia's leading grain bodies based in Western Australia, with more than 4,500 grain grower members, also supports this bill. Simply put, WA wheat growers not only are pleased with the deregulated environment in which they work now but also have overwhelmingly benefited from it and wish to see that situation maintained and continued.


I do recognise in saying that that some growers in the eastern states have a different view to those in WA about how wheat is marketed. This is a reflection of the fact that the circumstances and form of the wheat industry differ from state to state. While Western Australian farmers have large acreages and their wheat is mostly exported, by contrast most farms in the eastern states are smaller in acreage and the wheat is largely sold domestically.


I believe it is high time these differences in the form of the wheat industry across Australia were recognised and it was accepted that a 'one size fits all' approach to marketing wheat is just not appropriate. Because of these differences, I believe the growers in each state should have the right to decide their own marketing arrangements and should have local control over how that is done. In other words, I believe wheat marketing should be devolved to the states to organise and run. There are many precedents for this: in the past, the states had marketing boards for products such as eggs, potatoes, rice and so on. There is not a national iron ore or coal marketing board dictating to Western Australia or Queensland the terms and conditions under which iron ore and coal are marketed respectively. Instead, the sale of these commodities is left to the WA and Queensland governments to arrange themselves. 


Similarly, I do not believe that the federal government should have an overall role in legislating for the marketing of wheat given the differences between the states, and the facts are that most wheat produced, as I said already, in the eastern states is sold on the domestic market whereas the grain produced in WA is exported to world markets. As I have also said, this legislation will enable the completion of the process of deregulation of wheat marketing by following the steps recommended by the Productivity Commission, albeit with a slightly delayed time frame of about a year for each of the steps.


Australia is a large island continent, and, as I have said, it has to be acknowledged that there are significant differences across the country and one size does not fit all. This legislation embodies the preferred outcome of the majority of the WA wheat industry participants, as expressed by the WA Farmers Federation, the Pastoralists and Graziers Association and Cooperative Bulk Handling. In addition, the WA Liberal Party has supported this legislation and has been consistent with its support for market deregulation. As a Liberal senator for Western Australia, I support the objectives of this legislation.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2012-11-29,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (13:32):  I rise to support the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012, which will bring to fruition in Australia a truly deregulated wheat export marketing regime—a bill that brings to completion a process that was commenced by the Howard government. I support the path to full deregulation of Australia's wheat export marketing arrangements in the time frame first prescribed in the Productivity Commission's inquiry into wheat export marketing arrangements and now contained—with some minor adjustments—in this bill. I believe strongly that the evidence points to the fact that Australia's wheat export marketing arrangements are sufficiently matured and competitive to allow for the abolition of both Wheat Exports Australia and the wheat export charge—a charge, it must be remembered, that is levied on farmers and their families. This charge hits WA farmers and their families the hardest because, of all the wheat produced in Western Australia, around 90 per cent is exported. It is also worth noting that wheat growers in WA are the nation's largest, with over 75 per cent of them amongst the largest 50 per cent of wheat growers nationally. I have travelled around parts of regional Western Australia, talking with farmers at public meetings and one-on-one in places like Katanning, Wagin, Bruce Rock, Quairading and Gnowangerup—amongst others. In WA, these remain challenging times for wheat growers. It is important to remember that this debate is not occurring in a vacuum; we are talking about people's livelihoods and the viability of regional communities.


Some in this debate have said that the wheat export charge is a small thing and continuing to levy it will make little difference. However, I contend that removing the charge sends a powerful signal that we in this place understand that farming is often a difficult task. By removing the charge, we explicitly acknowledge this fact. We are showing that we understand that the last thing growers need is another government impost on their activities, especially for those growers who may not be experiencing the harvest they had hoped for.


It is also my considered judgement, a judgement formed after years in both the insurance and telecommunications industries dealing with competition related issues, that matters such as port access arrangements, transparency regarding stock information and quality standards for wheat exports can be appropriately overseen by existing competition law, by a code of conduct and by the industry themselves. I believe that a core component of maintaining Australia's international competitiveness is to embrace free and open markets, to abandon regulation and red-tape when the opportunity arises and at every step to reduce the tax burden on Australian businesses and families—especially on its agricultural businesses and farming families.


After careful consideration, robust debate and many discussions with wheat growers and their representatives, I can find no defensible justification for not actively supporting the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012. At its core, this bill is an economic one as much as it is an agricultural one. As a coalition senator, I believe that I have a responsibility to stand up for those policies that I consider will lead to smaller government, removing unnecessary bureaucracy and reducing taxes and charges. I do not believe that the path that was agreed to many years ago should be delayed or deviated from. 


Long before I came to this place, I did not believe the proposition that Australia's single-desk wheat export regime was a successful mechanism to extract a premium wheat price in global markets for the benefit of Australia's wheat exporters. The very idea runs against every economic and political principle I hold dear. Every monopoly should be treated with suspicion, and I do not believe that there should be any sacred cows in Australia's economic landscape, no matter how cherished the institution or longstanding its contribution to our economic prosperity. The Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012 is a simple one: it will transition Australia's wheat export marketing arrangements to a truly, fully deregulated market—a process that was first begun in 2008.


The story is well known but worth briefly recapping: in 2008, Australia's single-desk wheat export marketing arrangements were abolished and a system for regulating the export of bulk wheat through the accreditation of bulk wheat exporters under the Wheat Export Accreditation Scheme was established and administered by the body Wheat Exports Australia.


The new regime was to be funded by the wheat export charge. These were always intended to be transitional arrangements—transitional arrangements which were found by the Productivity Commission in 2010 to be unnecessary for a maturing wheat export market. The editorial of the Australian Financial Reviewof 3 October 2012 was correct in identifying that an accreditation system had some uses in transition to a free market but there was no reason to put off full deregulation.


I agree this bill will bring the bulk wheat export market into line with other agricultural commodity markets. It will promote further competition in the wheat industry and will be a driver for increased productivity and profitability. It will mean more buyers of wheat will be competing for wheat, ensuring growers can attract and get prices that reflect the true market value of their product. We can have every confidence that it will drive further market innovation and improve the services that marketers provide to secure wheat supplies. Importantly, it will remove costs for industry.


I support the bill because it will bring significant economic benefits to WA wheat farmers, their families and their communities. I support the bill because, uniquely, it has the united endorsement of WA farming organisations: the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of WA, the WA Farmers Federation and the Co-operative Bulk Handling Group. Given the enormous sensitivity this issue has traditionally invoked amongst WA's agricultural community, a common position is remarkable.


Western Australia's wheat growers support the bill because they believe in themselves and in their product and have confidence that they are best able to make decisions about their own future. In the words of the PGA, the wheat industry has made 'remarkable progress' since 2008. Of course there are challenges, but the PGA's firm view is that these can be addressed using current means without further direct government interference. The PGA has said, 'Abolishing the scheme will ensure that the benefits to industry provided by accreditation during the transition to full deregulation are not undermined in the longer term by the direct and indirect costs of continuing with a scheme that has served its purpose.' The PGA identified these costs as being 'the WEC and the administrative and regulatory burden of accreditation, as well as the necessary regulation on efficiency and competition in the wheat industry'. This attitude was echoed by WA's CBH Group when it said:


… there is no need to continue with any partial regulation of wheat exports …


…   …   …


The CBH Group incurred costs in excess of $1.2million … These costs are ultimately borne by Western Australian growers with no net benefit to them.


…   …   …


The CBH Group supports the view that the role of Government is to provide necessary services and safeguards to support industry without distorting the economic environment.


…   …   …


It is now time to allow Australia’s wheat export industry the flexibility to take advantage of the opportunities that await it, free from any additional layers of regulation.


I should also note for the record that both the PGA and the CBH Group have advised me that, although they do not believe the mandatory industry code proposed in amendments to the bill are necessary, they are nonetheless satisfied that the amendments put forward by the Greens will not disadvantage WA growers. The CBH Group advises, 'This outcome remains favourable for WA growers and the industry more generally.' The WA Farmers Federation has also added its voice, saying: 'WA Farmers position in respect to the deregulation issue is that we do not see value for growers in WEA and hence agree with the proposed wind up and call on all WA federal politicians to support the proposed Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012. However, great caution should be exercised over other amendments that specifically seek to address stocks information and quality issues. These will have a disproportionately adverse on WA growers. In practice, they would be unworkable and add costs to growers.'


The bill is also strongly supported by the Premier of Western Australia, the WA Liberal Party's state council and the many, many people living and working across WA's farming communities. The view of many West Australians has been best expressed by the West Australian newspaper. It said, 'Wheat Exports Australia is the last vestige of centralised marketing bureaucracies in Australia' and pointed to the fact that 'Pointless delay will cost wheat growers money and traps the industry in an early-20th-century mindset of protectionism and closed-shop marketing.'


This bill deserves the support of the Senate because the facts speak for themselves. The facts are most accurately presented in the ACIL Tasman report Continuing the reforms of the Australian export wheat market: why the WEMA Amendment Bill 2012 should be passed into law. It was released in July this year. The ACIL Tasman report makes the case that significant investment has occurred in Australia's wheat export market both as a result of the 2008 reforms and, more importantly, in anticipation of their conclusion in 2014. The report makes it clear. It states: 'Since 2008 a number of large mergers have occurred together with significant levels of infrastructure investment, to unlock scale and scope economies in bulk handling, marketing and grain transport. Grain is now exported to more countries than was previously the case under the single desk operator. Growers have been the main beneficiaries of these reforms through improved services and more competition for their grain. Export dependent WA grain growers in particular have in recent seasons experienced improved prices for their wheat exports when compared with Australian east coast growers. These recommendations, which have little if any apparent industry support in WA, Australia's largest wheat export state, will, if implemented, be a significant departure from the industry's current and generally accepted course and would reverse many of the reforms already implemented.'


I am conscious that as a result of the government's guillotine there are restricted times available to us. I will not go through the entirety of my speech—as much as I would like to—out of courtesy for those other coalition senators who I know have a different point of view, and I do believe that their view should be recorded in this debate. Out of respect for their positions, I will keep my last remaining comments brief.


This place, in deliberating on this issue should not be ignorant to the sovereign risk and disincentive to invest that arises from delaying—even stalling—the passage of these final deregulation initiatives.


Deviation and delay from our publicly stated intentions acts as a powerful disincentive to invest and diminishes the confidence of exporters and international buyers in our wheat export arrangements. This point was echoed and has been made very clear by CBH Group and GrainCorp in their presentations to the Senate inquiry. The clear intention of Wheat Exports Australia was always to act as a transition mechanism. Its role is to merely accredit exporters to give growers confidence that new exporters were 'fit and proper' and would reduce the business risk to wheat growers. This legislation is supported by a long and impressive list of organisations and people, many of whom I have referred to in the course of my contribution and many of whom, I might say, I trust.


Having weighed the evidence, I have concluded there is no rational reason to delay the abolition of Wheat Exports Australia and the wheat export charge. The national interest and the interest of wheat growers and exporters across Australia is best served by supporting this legislation. I am aware that others in my party have reached a different conclusion, giving weight to other considerations and evidence. I respect the difference of view. However, in preparing for this debate, I have been deeply conscious of my responsibilities to Western Australia—to the united position of WA's farming groups, the position of the WA Liberal Party and, most significantly, the regional people of WA, who have taken time to share their strong opinion with regard to this important and meaningful step in our agricultural policies.


I celebrate the fact that my own political party, unlike the one opposite, permits me to faithfully represent my constituents in this place. In explaining my decision to the Senate to support this bill, I return to the words of my first speech, which I made in this place six months ago:


I regard the Senate as the first child of Federation and the most significant of our democratic institutions, and I challenge the view that its creation was a compromise. In prescribing how Australia's representative government would operate, our founding fathers took a deliberate and conscious step—our democratic style would consist of two separate and distinct mandates: one representing the people as a whole and one representing the people voting by their states. In every deliberation I will sanctify this historic fact.


In supporting this bill, I have chosen to remain faithful to that promise to stand up for WA and its wheat growers, their families and communities, and to be an active champion for the benefits of free enterprise and competition in our country.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2012-11-29,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (13:47):  I acknowledge that a lot of people want to speak in this debate on the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012, so I will try to limit my remarks to around five minutes. If there is one good thing that comes out of this, it will be that the Senate is actually going to operate as a Senate and that the people from the different states who have different views will express those views—and that is how the Senate is supposed to work.


I concur with the remarks that there is a circumstance in Western Australia that is more evident towards a larger grower. I do not understand why—and I am agreeing here with Senator Eggleston—we would be moving in a direction to change the outcome with this legislation beyond Western Australia. We are changing it for the whole nation. The reality on the eastern coast—and I am there and I have grown wheat; I have a grain place—is that we are getting ripped off.


If people want to talk about access to markets, let us make sure that we bring into the chamber right now legislation for the ACCC, because it has had no chance against the regional based monopolies which have taken the place of a regulator. We acknowledge that the single desk was a regulated monopoly, but it was regulated. It worked on behalf of the best return to the growers. What it has been replaced with is regionally based monopolies for which we are definitely at a strategic disadvantage, and that is reflected in the price that we get for our product. But no-one seems to be suggesting changes to the ACCC, to bring in laws so that we can get fairness for these people and a better price—a price that is a better reflection on the market price. The multinational monopolies now dominate so many sections of regional New South Wales and regional Queensland. The latest one is Archer Daniels looking to buy GrainCorp, in which case we will be completely and utterly over a barrel and exploited. All of a sudden the bells are starting to ring.


In the east, we are in a different circumstance. I concur with Senator Eggleston that maybe the time has come to have a different regulations on this for the different states. If growers in Western Australia are certain that their situation works for them, then we are absolutely certain that it does not work for us. Western Australia has an advantage because it is the cooperative bulk handler. It is a monopoly owned by the growers; it is owned by individuals. We do not have a cooperative bulk handler. We have Viterra. We are going to have Archer Daniels. We have Cargill. They are doing what monopolies do. Once they dominate the marketplace, they work to exploit the people who supply them the product to try and get the best return for them, not for the grower.


It is incumbent upon this parliament, if we believe that all controls should be removed and we acknowledge that farmers are being exploited, that we move towards a broader and more instructive process in the ACCC so that fairness can be brought back to the farm gate. With access arrangements and quality arrangements, it is a one-size-fits-all approach. I think we all agree on this now: the one-size-fits-all approach across the nation is just not working.


I heard mention of the Productivity Commission. The Productivity Commission study went over one year. That is hardly the time frame required to get a proper assessment when there are variant seasons from droughts to bumper seasons and everything in between. You cannot do an assessment on the wheat industry on an examination of one year. The process that we ask for, especially in the National Party, is not a position that is driven by philosophy.


It is driven by experience. It is driven by pragmatism. It is driven by a desire to deal with an issue which is completely and abundantly apparent to us now—that there is exploitation in the new arrangements that have come as we predicted to the people predominantly in the eastern states.


We are not supporting this, because the issue has not been resolved. We will not walk away from people that are being exploited on the premise of a philosophy when the reality for them is clear and apparent. I acknowledge that they are the small growers but we, especially in the National Party, look out for those small growers because, if we do not look after them, then who on earth will?

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2012-11-29,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (13:53):  I rise to make some comments regarding this Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012. Like Senator Joyce in front of me, I am a wheat farmer. While I am a senator for New South Wales, I am also a wheat farmer. Senator Joyce and I have some skin in the game in this. Senator Joyce could not have been more right when he talked about those with a philosophical view. I completely understand that and acknowledge absolutely the right of my colleagues to have a philosophical view on this. They do not have the practical experience of being on the ground, day in and day out, knowing how this affects wheat growers and rural communities across the country.


I have not changed my position one bit from 2008 when I thought that getting rid of the single desk for wheat was singularly one of the most stupid things a government has ever done in this nation. I stand by that now and I have seen nothing in the last four years to change my view on that. Interestingly, at the time when we looked into the legislation that was going to get rid of the single desk for wheat through the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, the committee as a whole had serious concerns about the fact that if we removed the single desk we would end up with regional monopolies. Remember, colleagues, this was 2008. Indeed, in the dissenting report put forward by me, Senator Joyce and Senator Scullion, we said:


The draft bills as proposed clearly do not satisfy the requirements necessary to ensure a wheat marketing system that would deliver the best outcomes for wheat growers. More dangerously, the draft bills lack sufficient safeguards to prevent regional monopolies from arising.


Madam Acting Deputy President, it is a really sad thing to say I told you so in this place, but we told you so.


Four years ago we could see exactly what was going to happen, that we would end up with regional monopolies in place of a single monopoly that served wheat growers very well, replaced with regional monopolies whose instincts at heart are to serve their own interests. I excuse CBH from that in that they do operate on the notion of returning to growers. I do see that they are different and, indeed, as Senator Joyce said earlier, perhaps there is a case for having different arrangements in different places across the nation.


What we had with the cessation of the single desk for wheat was for the Wheat Export Authority to put in place transitional arrangements—I do acknowledge they were transitional arrangements—to a fully deregulated system. What that Wheat Export Authority has done is accredit wheat growers and also put in place some requirements on the bulk handlers for continuous disclosure to oversight what those bulk handlers were doing and, of course, the access undertakings for those bulk handlers who also had port operations.


What we now see from the government is complete dismantling of the Wheat Export Authority as well. On this side of the chamber, we recognise that the industry has said, 'We are not yet ready to transition to complete deregulation, because there are a number of industry good functions that need to be performed since the cessation of the single desk.' It has become increasingly apparent that these industry good functions need to be performed to ensure the optimum running of the wheat industry, particularly for those wheat growers. It has become increasingly clear that the most appropriate way to deal with that is, as we have reflected in the coalition amendment, through continuing the Wheat Export Authority and then appropriately reconfiguring it to be able to provide the proper processes for those industry good functions to be performed. It is sensible; it is a no brainer. We already have an industry body that is funded by growers at a 22c a tonne levy that is already in place that could easily be reconfigured to do those industry good functions that the industry itself wants to see performed.


Colleagues, we had a Senate inquiry into this and it was abundantly clear that the great majority—again notwithstanding some industry voices in Western Australia—saw that as the appropriate mechanism to provide these functions: primarily access to stocks information and equal and fair opportunity access to ports and quality assurance. Those are very simple, practical, sensible things that the industry and those of us actually out there on the ground understand need to be addressed, so much so that the majority of the state organisations came before the Senate committee to put their collective voice about the fact that the WEA should not be disbanded until these issues were addressed and resolved.


I will just place on the record that AgForce Queensland, Grain Producers South Australia, New South Wales Farmers and the Victorian Farmers Federation all joined forces to reject the bill. They believed that rules were needed if Australian grain was to retain a premium on the world market, if fair access to port terminal services was to be maintained and if the market supply chain was going to be transparent. How sensible and practical is that? Grain Producers South Australia chairman Garry Hansen said:


As the major grain farmer representatives organisations on the East Coast and in Southern Australia, we are united in our opposition of the Government's Wheat Export Marketing Bill.


… we join together to support an evolution of the existing regulation to better facilitate competition for our members' grain. 


New South Wales Farmers Grains Chairman, Mark Hoskinson, said:


We are concerned that the removal of specialised wheat regulation in the present market will see the influence held by the three major bulk handlers inhibit competition. This would ultimately be to the detriment of the grain farmers our four organisations represent …


Debate interrupted.

"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2012-11-29,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (13:13):  I resume talking about the draft voluntary code of conduct proposed for the Australian wheat industry. The draft code is flawed in that it is not binding, it is not independent, it does not have a sustainable source of funding via the arbitration act and it may further circumvent the ACCC. In short, the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012 as proposed fails to achieve its competition objectives, hence the reason we now have amendments on the floor, because even the Greens know that any real oversight will only happen if the code is mandatory.


That code should broadly contain, firstly, the adequate provision of grain stock information to enable efficient operation of the market; and, secondly, an enforceable mechanism to ensure fair access to port facilities for non-handling exporters. That means the people who sought to come into this business to compete and to provide an international marketplace, are not prejudiced because they do not own the infrastructure, ports or the up-country rail hubs that have in the past led to a closed market. Thirdly, the code should contain an effective mechanism to provide confidence in cargo integrity, especially in relation to the Australian wheat variety classification system.


The final report of the South Australian Select Committee on the Grain Handling Industry called for the federal government to:


… ensure the benefits of deregulation are fully realised within a competitive and innovative framework that provides the basis for a viable and successful industry.


It is my contention that, unless we ensure that at least those three aforementioned elements are contained within the reform, all of the findings of this inquiry conducted recently, and the many others I have been involved in, will be ignored.


To ensure this actually occurs, the federal government should establish an independent body to maintain this deregulation momentum. I cannot stress enough the importance of the minister appointing a truly representative panel to the proposed advisory body, which is flagged in the amendments to this bill before us. The board should have representatives comprised of grain grower representative bodies, non-bulk handling traders and bulk handlers—and they should all be in equal numbers. This would prevent one interest group from dominating the final code agreement to the detriment of one of the other stakeholders in this very important Australian industry.


The importance of this industry cannot be understated. Not only is wheat growing part of this country's DNA, but also, if demand rises, as everybody expects it will during the much-lauded Asian century, it should be set now to succeed and be the success story for decades to come that it deserves to be. We must get this right now and with the appropriate oversight framework in place—the kind of oversight that the majority of wheat growers of this nation are expecting from the minister. I urge the minister to listen to them. Many of us from this side of the chamber will be working to ensure that the reform required is implemented.


I will be supporting an amended bill. Senator Xenophon, I have some sympathy with a number of your proposed amendments and I will look to talk those through in the committee stage of this bill. I would underline the fact that the minister has a great responsibility to ensure that the proposed advisory body has—if we adopt the amendments to this bill—a mandatory code of conduct so that it functions properly and so that we may look forward to a fair and prosperous wheat industry from this day forward.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:18):  There have been a lot of discussions about the deregulation of the wheat industry, and it is a great tragedy that we have reached this stage without significant and sufficient safeguards in place for producers. The last thing anyone wants to see is the wheat industry turn out like the supermarket industry: controlled by monopolies and with the growers under pressure.


There have been several inquiries in the past to determine how best to deregulate the wheat industry in Australia and what the best arrangements are. Most recently, the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee conducted an inquiry into the operation of grain networks in Australia. That was a very worthwhile inquiry, which I was a part of. The information provided to the committee exposed significant flaws in the grain export networks that must be addressed before complete deregulation can go ahead. Essentially, natural monopolies exist in every state. These companies control grain handling and export from purchasing and storing, to movement, to shipping. That is simply not good enough.


The committee inquiry recommended that Wheat Exports Australia needed a continuing and expanded role in the industry, acting as a combination of ombudsman, accreditor and quality assurance. The committee also recommended that a mechanism to publicise wheat stockpile information should be available to all participants in the bulk export industry, and that the upcoming inquiry into this bill should consider this further. I also made several more recommendations in my additional comments to that report. These recommendations included the establishment of an oversight body for the industry, as well as a mandatory code of conduct relating to the publication of grain storage information, assessment and grading of grain, and access to port and rail transport facilities. My further recommendations related to reviews and investigations that needed to be undertaken by the ACCC or other bodies in relation to specific practices on the part of some bulk grain handlers.


The inquiry into this bill, the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012, by the rural and regional affairs and transport committee also recommended that the government assist the industry in developing measures relating to the publication of information on wheat stock information. There is a clear and compelling narrative running through these recommendations. In the first instance, a lack of clear and complete information on grain stocks that is available to the entire industry is severely disadvantaging producers. This information asymmetry is simply unacceptable. These producers cannot determine when and where they might get the best prices for their product. In fact, this lack of information could be putting the whole industry at risk. In the case of a drought or a crop shortage, the government and other organisations do not have the necessary complete picture of what grain is being held where. The implications of this are obvious.


The other major concern is that there is no oversight of the industry to enforce a code of conduct or to deal with disputes or competition issues. To this end, I will be moving several amendments to strengthen this bill. I note Senator Edwards' sympathy for them; I hope I can have more than Senator Edwards' sympathy. I am grateful for his comments in relation to that, but I hope I can actually have his vote on some of these amendments, particularly on the review mechanism. There must be a review mechanism. I would urge my colleagues in the Australian Greens to consider a review mechanism in relation to this bill, because the implications of this bill are huge for the industry. We need to get it right. If this bill does go ahead in its current form there will be a lack of sufficient safeguards for the industry.


These amendments are designed to build on the agreement with the government reached by the Greens. However, they will go further and insert certain requirements in relation to the structure of the Wheat Industry Advisory Board, the code of conduct—it must be mandatory—and the outline of the act. I will be expanding on these amendments in the committee stage.


Finally, I would like to thank the representatives of Grain Producers Australia, and in particular Pete Mailler and Darren Arney. They have been strong, tireless and articulate advocates for their members. I thank them for the advice and guidance they have given me on this issue.


I want to make it clear that without some form of amendment to strengthen this bill I cannot and will not be supporting this bill. It does not offer enough support and protection for our producers, and I believe it will lead to further market concentration, a severe lack of competition in the market and it will disadvantage our grain producers.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2012-11-29,"



Senator EGGLESTON
 (Western Australia) (13:23):  I rise to speak on the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012, which is before the Senate today. I was one of those who worked with the former member for O'Connor, Wilson Tuckey, and the late Senator Judith Adams towards ending the single-desk marketing system. According to all accounts, deregulation has brought great benefits to the West Australian wheat growers, whose properties are generally larger than those in the eastern states and whose wheat is largely exported. The experience so far in WA has been that deregulation and open marketing has brought great financial benefits to WA growers.


According to the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, the gross value of the Australian wheat crop during the period 2011-12 increased by seven per cent to $7.5 billion. In my home state of WA, again according to the ABS, the value of the wheat crop doubled to $2.8 billion in 2011-12 over the previous year. This period followed the abolition of the single-desk marketing operation in 2008 and surely demonstrates that the strong support by the WA farming organisations in WA for deregulation was proved to have been well worthwhile and in the interests of the Western Australian industry.


The single desk was a monopoly marketing body for wheat overseen by the Australian Wheat Board—AWB. By this process, returns from growers for the sale of wheat, both domestically and internationally, were pooled together on a national scale, the prices were averaged by the Australian Wheat Board and farmers were paid that average price for their wheat. As I mentioned, this covered both domestic and international sales until 1989, after which it focused exclusively on exports before being limited in scope again to bulk exports in its final year of operation.


However, over the years the winds of change for a different wheat marketing system gathered momentum. There was a National Competition Policy review of the Wheat Marketing Act in 1989 which ultimately found no clear benefit to Australian growers from the single-desk arrangements then in place for the export of wheat. Importantly, increasing dissatisfaction with the operation of the single desk mounted, especially in Western Australia. As I have said, farmers in WA have experienced improved financial returns since deregulation was introduced with the abolition of the single desk. Those improved financial returns have in fact been quite substantial. It is therefore unsurprising that WA growers have been very vocal in support of the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012, which, if passed, will complete wheat marketing deregulation following the process set out by the Productivity Commission in an orderly way, albeit with a slight delay from the recommendations of the Productivity Commission.


I acknowledge, as home to the largest grain producers, who are staunch supporters of deregulation, WA and its growers do stand to benefit most by the enactment of this legislation. While not always united in their views in the past, WA's largest and second-largest farm lobby groups, the WA Farmers Federation and the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia, respectively, are now united in their support for the process which will lead to the full deregulation of wheat marketing that will follow the passage of this bill.


Farmers in WA have been pleased with the significant increase in sales and the broadening of the market which deregulation has brought so far. Similarly, the Co-operative Bulk Handling Group, one of Australia's leading grain bodies based in Western Australia, with more than 4,500 grain grower members, also supports this bill. Simply put, WA wheat growers not only are pleased with the deregulated environment in which they work now but also have overwhelmingly benefited from it and wish to see that situation maintained and continued.


I do recognise in saying that that some growers in the eastern states have a different view to those in WA about how wheat is marketed. This is a reflection of the fact that the circumstances and form of the wheat industry differ from state to state. While Western Australian farmers have large acreages and their wheat is mostly exported, by contrast most farms in the eastern states are smaller in acreage and the wheat is largely sold domestically.


I believe it is high time these differences in the form of the wheat industry across Australia were recognised and it was accepted that a 'one size fits all' approach to marketing wheat is just not appropriate. Because of these differences, I believe the growers in each state should have the right to decide their own marketing arrangements and should have local control over how that is done. In other words, I believe wheat marketing should be devolved to the states to organise and run. There are many precedents for this: in the past, the states had marketing boards for products such as eggs, potatoes, rice and so on. There is not a national iron ore or coal marketing board dictating to Western Australia or Queensland the terms and conditions under which iron ore and coal are marketed respectively. Instead, the sale of these commodities is left to the WA and Queensland governments to arrange themselves. 


Similarly, I do not believe that the federal government should have an overall role in legislating for the marketing of wheat given the differences between the states, and the facts are that most wheat produced, as I said already, in the eastern states is sold on the domestic market whereas the grain produced in WA is exported to world markets. As I have also said, this legislation will enable the completion of the process of deregulation of wheat marketing by following the steps recommended by the Productivity Commission, albeit with a slightly delayed time frame of about a year for each of the steps.


Australia is a large island continent, and, as I have said, it has to be acknowledged that there are significant differences across the country and one size does not fit all. This legislation embodies the preferred outcome of the majority of the WA wheat industry participants, as expressed by the WA Farmers Federation, the Pastoralists and Graziers Association and Cooperative Bulk Handling. In addition, the WA Liberal Party has supported this legislation and has been consistent with its support for market deregulation. As a Liberal senator for Western Australia, I support the objectives of this legislation.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2012-11-29,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (13:32):  I rise to support the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012, which will bring to fruition in Australia a truly deregulated wheat export marketing regime—a bill that brings to completion a process that was commenced by the Howard government. I support the path to full deregulation of Australia's wheat export marketing arrangements in the time frame first prescribed in the Productivity Commission's inquiry into wheat export marketing arrangements and now contained—with some minor adjustments—in this bill. I believe strongly that the evidence points to the fact that Australia's wheat export marketing arrangements are sufficiently matured and competitive to allow for the abolition of both Wheat Exports Australia and the wheat export charge—a charge, it must be remembered, that is levied on farmers and their families. This charge hits WA farmers and their families the hardest because, of all the wheat produced in Western Australia, around 90 per cent is exported. It is also worth noting that wheat growers in WA are the nation's largest, with over 75 per cent of them amongst the largest 50 per cent of wheat growers nationally. I have travelled around parts of regional Western Australia, talking with farmers at public meetings and one-on-one in places like Katanning, Wagin, Bruce Rock, Quairading and Gnowangerup—amongst others. In WA, these remain challenging times for wheat growers. It is important to remember that this debate is not occurring in a vacuum; we are talking about people's livelihoods and the viability of regional communities.


Some in this debate have said that the wheat export charge is a small thing and continuing to levy it will make little difference. However, I contend that removing the charge sends a powerful signal that we in this place understand that farming is often a difficult task. By removing the charge, we explicitly acknowledge this fact. We are showing that we understand that the last thing growers need is another government impost on their activities, especially for those growers who may not be experiencing the harvest they had hoped for.


It is also my considered judgement, a judgement formed after years in both the insurance and telecommunications industries dealing with competition related issues, that matters such as port access arrangements, transparency regarding stock information and quality standards for wheat exports can be appropriately overseen by existing competition law, by a code of conduct and by the industry themselves. I believe that a core component of maintaining Australia's international competitiveness is to embrace free and open markets, to abandon regulation and red-tape when the opportunity arises and at every step to reduce the tax burden on Australian businesses and families—especially on its agricultural businesses and farming families.


After careful consideration, robust debate and many discussions with wheat growers and their representatives, I can find no defensible justification for not actively supporting the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012. At its core, this bill is an economic one as much as it is an agricultural one. As a coalition senator, I believe that I have a responsibility to stand up for those policies that I consider will lead to smaller government, removing unnecessary bureaucracy and reducing taxes and charges. I do not believe that the path that was agreed to many years ago should be delayed or deviated from. 


Long before I came to this place, I did not believe the proposition that Australia's single-desk wheat export regime was a successful mechanism to extract a premium wheat price in global markets for the benefit of Australia's wheat exporters. The very idea runs against every economic and political principle I hold dear. Every monopoly should be treated with suspicion, and I do not believe that there should be any sacred cows in Australia's economic landscape, no matter how cherished the institution or longstanding its contribution to our economic prosperity. The Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012 is a simple one: it will transition Australia's wheat export marketing arrangements to a truly, fully deregulated market—a process that was first begun in 2008.


The story is well known but worth briefly recapping: in 2008, Australia's single-desk wheat export marketing arrangements were abolished and a system for regulating the export of bulk wheat through the accreditation of bulk wheat exporters under the Wheat Export Accreditation Scheme was established and administered by the body Wheat Exports Australia.


The new regime was to be funded by the wheat export charge. These were always intended to be transitional arrangements—transitional arrangements which were found by the Productivity Commission in 2010 to be unnecessary for a maturing wheat export market. The editorial of the Australian Financial Reviewof 3 October 2012 was correct in identifying that an accreditation system had some uses in transition to a free market but there was no reason to put off full deregulation.


I agree this bill will bring the bulk wheat export market into line with other agricultural commodity markets. It will promote further competition in the wheat industry and will be a driver for increased productivity and profitability. It will mean more buyers of wheat will be competing for wheat, ensuring growers can attract and get prices that reflect the true market value of their product. We can have every confidence that it will drive further market innovation and improve the services that marketers provide to secure wheat supplies. Importantly, it will remove costs for industry.


I support the bill because it will bring significant economic benefits to WA wheat farmers, their families and their communities. I support the bill because, uniquely, it has the united endorsement of WA farming organisations: the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of WA, the WA Farmers Federation and the Co-operative Bulk Handling Group. Given the enormous sensitivity this issue has traditionally invoked amongst WA's agricultural community, a common position is remarkable.


Western Australia's wheat growers support the bill because they believe in themselves and in their product and have confidence that they are best able to make decisions about their own future. In the words of the PGA, the wheat industry has made 'remarkable progress' since 2008. Of course there are challenges, but the PGA's firm view is that these can be addressed using current means without further direct government interference. The PGA has said, 'Abolishing the scheme will ensure that the benefits to industry provided by accreditation during the transition to full deregulation are not undermined in the longer term by the direct and indirect costs of continuing with a scheme that has served its purpose.' The PGA identified these costs as being 'the WEC and the administrative and regulatory burden of accreditation, as well as the necessary regulation on efficiency and competition in the wheat industry'. This attitude was echoed by WA's CBH Group when it said:


… there is no need to continue with any partial regulation of wheat exports …


…   …   …


The CBH Group incurred costs in excess of $1.2million … These costs are ultimately borne by Western Australian growers with no net benefit to them.


…   …   …


The CBH Group supports the view that the role of Government is to provide necessary services and safeguards to support industry without distorting the economic environment.


…   …   …


It is now time to allow Australia’s wheat export industry the flexibility to take advantage of the opportunities that await it, free from any additional layers of regulation.


I should also note for the record that both the PGA and the CBH Group have advised me that, although they do not believe the mandatory industry code proposed in amendments to the bill are necessary, they are nonetheless satisfied that the amendments put forward by the Greens will not disadvantage WA growers. The CBH Group advises, 'This outcome remains favourable for WA growers and the industry more generally.' The WA Farmers Federation has also added its voice, saying: 'WA Farmers position in respect to the deregulation issue is that we do not see value for growers in WEA and hence agree with the proposed wind up and call on all WA federal politicians to support the proposed Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012. However, great caution should be exercised over other amendments that specifically seek to address stocks information and quality issues. These will have a disproportionately adverse on WA growers. In practice, they would be unworkable and add costs to growers.'


The bill is also strongly supported by the Premier of Western Australia, the WA Liberal Party's state council and the many, many people living and working across WA's farming communities. The view of many West Australians has been best expressed by the West Australian newspaper. It said, 'Wheat Exports Australia is the last vestige of centralised marketing bureaucracies in Australia' and pointed to the fact that 'Pointless delay will cost wheat growers money and traps the industry in an early-20th-century mindset of protectionism and closed-shop marketing.'


This bill deserves the support of the Senate because the facts speak for themselves. The facts are most accurately presented in the ACIL Tasman report Continuing the reforms of the Australian export wheat market: why the WEMA Amendment Bill 2012 should be passed into law. It was released in July this year. The ACIL Tasman report makes the case that significant investment has occurred in Australia's wheat export market both as a result of the 2008 reforms and, more importantly, in anticipation of their conclusion in 2014. The report makes it clear. It states: 'Since 2008 a number of large mergers have occurred together with significant levels of infrastructure investment, to unlock scale and scope economies in bulk handling, marketing and grain transport. Grain is now exported to more countries than was previously the case under the single desk operator. Growers have been the main beneficiaries of these reforms through improved services and more competition for their grain. Export dependent WA grain growers in particular have in recent seasons experienced improved prices for their wheat exports when compared with Australian east coast growers. These recommendations, which have little if any apparent industry support in WA, Australia's largest wheat export state, will, if implemented, be a significant departure from the industry's current and generally accepted course and would reverse many of the reforms already implemented.'


I am conscious that as a result of the government's guillotine there are restricted times available to us. I will not go through the entirety of my speech—as much as I would like to—out of courtesy for those other coalition senators who I know have a different point of view, and I do believe that their view should be recorded in this debate. Out of respect for their positions, I will keep my last remaining comments brief.


This place, in deliberating on this issue should not be ignorant to the sovereign risk and disincentive to invest that arises from delaying—even stalling—the passage of these final deregulation initiatives.


Deviation and delay from our publicly stated intentions acts as a powerful disincentive to invest and diminishes the confidence of exporters and international buyers in our wheat export arrangements. This point was echoed and has been made very clear by CBH Group and GrainCorp in their presentations to the Senate inquiry. The clear intention of Wheat Exports Australia was always to act as a transition mechanism. Its role is to merely accredit exporters to give growers confidence that new exporters were 'fit and proper' and would reduce the business risk to wheat growers. This legislation is supported by a long and impressive list of organisations and people, many of whom I have referred to in the course of my contribution and many of whom, I might say, I trust.


Having weighed the evidence, I have concluded there is no rational reason to delay the abolition of Wheat Exports Australia and the wheat export charge. The national interest and the interest of wheat growers and exporters across Australia is best served by supporting this legislation. I am aware that others in my party have reached a different conclusion, giving weight to other considerations and evidence. I respect the difference of view. However, in preparing for this debate, I have been deeply conscious of my responsibilities to Western Australia—to the united position of WA's farming groups, the position of the WA Liberal Party and, most significantly, the regional people of WA, who have taken time to share their strong opinion with regard to this important and meaningful step in our agricultural policies.


I celebrate the fact that my own political party, unlike the one opposite, permits me to faithfully represent my constituents in this place. In explaining my decision to the Senate to support this bill, I return to the words of my first speech, which I made in this place six months ago:


I regard the Senate as the first child of Federation and the most significant of our democratic institutions, and I challenge the view that its creation was a compromise. In prescribing how Australia's representative government would operate, our founding fathers took a deliberate and conscious step—our democratic style would consist of two separate and distinct mandates: one representing the people as a whole and one representing the people voting by their states. In every deliberation I will sanctify this historic fact.


In supporting this bill, I have chosen to remain faithful to that promise to stand up for WA and its wheat growers, their families and communities, and to be an active champion for the benefits of free enterprise and competition in our country.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2012-11-29,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (13:47):  I acknowledge that a lot of people want to speak in this debate on the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012, so I will try to limit my remarks to around five minutes. If there is one good thing that comes out of this, it will be that the Senate is actually going to operate as a Senate and that the people from the different states who have different views will express those views—and that is how the Senate is supposed to work.


I concur with the remarks that there is a circumstance in Western Australia that is more evident towards a larger grower. I do not understand why—and I am agreeing here with Senator Eggleston—we would be moving in a direction to change the outcome with this legislation beyond Western Australia. We are changing it for the whole nation. The reality on the eastern coast—and I am there and I have grown wheat; I have a grain place—is that we are getting ripped off.


If people want to talk about access to markets, let us make sure that we bring into the chamber right now legislation for the ACCC, because it has had no chance against the regional based monopolies which have taken the place of a regulator. We acknowledge that the single desk was a regulated monopoly, but it was regulated. It worked on behalf of the best return to the growers. What it has been replaced with is regionally based monopolies for which we are definitely at a strategic disadvantage, and that is reflected in the price that we get for our product. But no-one seems to be suggesting changes to the ACCC, to bring in laws so that we can get fairness for these people and a better price—a price that is a better reflection on the market price. The multinational monopolies now dominate so many sections of regional New South Wales and regional Queensland. The latest one is Archer Daniels looking to buy GrainCorp, in which case we will be completely and utterly over a barrel and exploited. All of a sudden the bells are starting to ring.


In the east, we are in a different circumstance. I concur with Senator Eggleston that maybe the time has come to have a different regulations on this for the different states. If growers in Western Australia are certain that their situation works for them, then we are absolutely certain that it does not work for us. Western Australia has an advantage because it is the cooperative bulk handler. It is a monopoly owned by the growers; it is owned by individuals. We do not have a cooperative bulk handler. We have Viterra. We are going to have Archer Daniels. We have Cargill. They are doing what monopolies do. Once they dominate the marketplace, they work to exploit the people who supply them the product to try and get the best return for them, not for the grower.


It is incumbent upon this parliament, if we believe that all controls should be removed and we acknowledge that farmers are being exploited, that we move towards a broader and more instructive process in the ACCC so that fairness can be brought back to the farm gate. With access arrangements and quality arrangements, it is a one-size-fits-all approach. I think we all agree on this now: the one-size-fits-all approach across the nation is just not working.


I heard mention of the Productivity Commission. The Productivity Commission study went over one year. That is hardly the time frame required to get a proper assessment when there are variant seasons from droughts to bumper seasons and everything in between. You cannot do an assessment on the wheat industry on an examination of one year. The process that we ask for, especially in the National Party, is not a position that is driven by philosophy.


It is driven by experience. It is driven by pragmatism. It is driven by a desire to deal with an issue which is completely and abundantly apparent to us now—that there is exploitation in the new arrangements that have come as we predicted to the people predominantly in the eastern states.


We are not supporting this, because the issue has not been resolved. We will not walk away from people that are being exploited on the premise of a philosophy when the reality for them is clear and apparent. I acknowledge that they are the small growers but we, especially in the National Party, look out for those small growers because, if we do not look after them, then who on earth will?

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2012-11-29,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (13:53):  I rise to make some comments regarding this Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012. Like Senator Joyce in front of me, I am a wheat farmer. While I am a senator for New South Wales, I am also a wheat farmer. Senator Joyce and I have some skin in the game in this. Senator Joyce could not have been more right when he talked about those with a philosophical view. I completely understand that and acknowledge absolutely the right of my colleagues to have a philosophical view on this. They do not have the practical experience of being on the ground, day in and day out, knowing how this affects wheat growers and rural communities across the country.


I have not changed my position one bit from 2008 when I thought that getting rid of the single desk for wheat was singularly one of the most stupid things a government has ever done in this nation. I stand by that now and I have seen nothing in the last four years to change my view on that. Interestingly, at the time when we looked into the legislation that was going to get rid of the single desk for wheat through the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, the committee as a whole had serious concerns about the fact that if we removed the single desk we would end up with regional monopolies. Remember, colleagues, this was 2008. Indeed, in the dissenting report put forward by me, Senator Joyce and Senator Scullion, we said:


The draft bills as proposed clearly do not satisfy the requirements necessary to ensure a wheat marketing system that would deliver the best outcomes for wheat growers. More dangerously, the draft bills lack sufficient safeguards to prevent regional monopolies from arising.


Madam Acting Deputy President, it is a really sad thing to say I told you so in this place, but we told you so.


Four years ago we could see exactly what was going to happen, that we would end up with regional monopolies in place of a single monopoly that served wheat growers very well, replaced with regional monopolies whose instincts at heart are to serve their own interests. I excuse CBH from that in that they do operate on the notion of returning to growers. I do see that they are different and, indeed, as Senator Joyce said earlier, perhaps there is a case for having different arrangements in different places across the nation.


What we had with the cessation of the single desk for wheat was for the Wheat Export Authority to put in place transitional arrangements—I do acknowledge they were transitional arrangements—to a fully deregulated system. What that Wheat Export Authority has done is accredit wheat growers and also put in place some requirements on the bulk handlers for continuous disclosure to oversight what those bulk handlers were doing and, of course, the access undertakings for those bulk handlers who also had port operations.


What we now see from the government is complete dismantling of the Wheat Export Authority as well. On this side of the chamber, we recognise that the industry has said, 'We are not yet ready to transition to complete deregulation, because there are a number of industry good functions that need to be performed since the cessation of the single desk.' It has become increasingly apparent that these industry good functions need to be performed to ensure the optimum running of the wheat industry, particularly for those wheat growers. It has become increasingly clear that the most appropriate way to deal with that is, as we have reflected in the coalition amendment, through continuing the Wheat Export Authority and then appropriately reconfiguring it to be able to provide the proper processes for those industry good functions to be performed. It is sensible; it is a no brainer. We already have an industry body that is funded by growers at a 22c a tonne levy that is already in place that could easily be reconfigured to do those industry good functions that the industry itself wants to see performed.


Colleagues, we had a Senate inquiry into this and it was abundantly clear that the great majority—again notwithstanding some industry voices in Western Australia—saw that as the appropriate mechanism to provide these functions: primarily access to stocks information and equal and fair opportunity access to ports and quality assurance. Those are very simple, practical, sensible things that the industry and those of us actually out there on the ground understand need to be addressed, so much so that the majority of the state organisations came before the Senate committee to put their collective voice about the fact that the WEA should not be disbanded until these issues were addressed and resolved.


I will just place on the record that AgForce Queensland, Grain Producers South Australia, New South Wales Farmers and the Victorian Farmers Federation all joined forces to reject the bill. They believed that rules were needed if Australian grain was to retain a premium on the world market, if fair access to port terminal services was to be maintained and if the market supply chain was going to be transparent. How sensible and practical is that? Grain Producers South Australia chairman Garry Hansen said:


As the major grain farmer representatives organisations on the East Coast and in Southern Australia, we are united in our opposition of the Government's Wheat Export Marketing Bill.


… we join together to support an evolution of the existing regulation to better facilitate competition for our members' grain. 


New South Wales Farmers Grains Chairman, Mark Hoskinson, said:


We are concerned that the removal of specialised wheat regulation in the present market will see the influence held by the three major bulk handlers inhibit competition. This would ultimately be to the detriment of the grain farmers our four organisations represent …

Senator BOB CARR

Indeed, I would have liked, during the period when we were campaigning for votes for the Security Council seat, to have been able to have said: 'We will not oppose the bid signalled by the Palestinian delegation.' I would have liked to have been able to say that.


In September, we received a letter from the Palestinian delegation, indicating they were disposed or they were planning to make a bid for increased non-state status. We did not reply to that letter. At a meeting in New York, at the Waldorf Astoria hotel, in September, between me and the Gulf Cooperation Council—a large number of Arab nations—the foreign minister of Oman asked me what would be the Australian response to the Palestinian bid. My reply was, 'We won't make a decision until we see the wording of the draft resolution.' Let me say, uninhibitedly, that the job I had of lobbying for a vote would have been easier if I had been charged with the possibility of saying: 'We are committed not to oppose the Palestinian bid that is expected in November.' But we did not say that. I did not say that. I would have liked to have been able to say it. I could not say it, because it was not our position. On that one occasion, as I said, when the matter came up at a meeting between me and members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, my reply was—disappointing to my interlocutors, I am sure—'We would need to wait until we see the wording of the motion.'

Senator Abetz:

Senator BOB CARR:
  All right, it is marginally different. Let me answer that: absolutely not. In fact, I was not seeking that. I did not imagine that as a possibility. The position I canvassed in the first part of the question was whether I would have been able to have said, back in September—before 18 October—that we would not oppose a bid for Palestinian status. I did not say that. And, not even being able to say that, I certainly was not able to say that we would vote yes. That was not even a question. 


So I can underline for the benefit of the Senate that we won on 18 October, having been silent to the request from the Palestinian delegation expressed in a letter to, I think, our ambassador seeking our support or, at any rate, seeking our position on this. We did not respond to that letter. There are no settings where we gave any other indication.

They said the government should 'avoid, at all costs', the devolution of the government's environment powers. This comes on the heels of Tim Flannery's Quarterly Essay, which predicts a second wave of species extinctions throughout Australia.

Senator Birmingham interjecting—




Senator CONROY:
  I am sure Senator Birmingham is champing at the bit. My apologies for acknowledging the interjection. The government is working closely with the states and territories to implement the COAG agreements to meet the deadlines of developing standards by December 2012 and agreeing on new bilateral arrangements for the accreditation of assessment and approval processes by March 2013. These reforms are about eliminating duplication and making processes more efficient for business. They are not about reducing standards or winding back environmental protection. High environmental standards will be maintained and businesses will benefit from reduced regulatory burden.


The EPBC Act has made a significant contribution to environmental regulation in Australia. These COAG reforms are consistent with the government's commitments made in response to the independent review of the EPBC Act that Minister Burke announced on 24 August 2011.

Senator CONROY:
  Yes, from the minister involved, given that I am representing him. You are very observant, Senator Abetz, as always. The Australian government is involved with the national agenda for reform of environmental regulation. The minister announced the government's response, and the environmental department and Minister Burke have pursued these reforms actively, consulting with many groups, including the Business Advisory Forum prior to COAG.

The standards will ensure that high environmental outcomes are maintained. On 2 November 2012, the minister released a draft framework of standards for accreditation. The draft standards, along with the accompanying statement of environmental and assurance outcomes, were released so that people could be clear on what the draft standards were and the approach the government would take to the negotiation of the bilateral agreements with states and territories, and to ensure there were no omissions.


The draft standards are the foundational rules for the negotiations. They are about keeping the bar high, and making sure Australia's environmental protection standards are maintained.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:01):  I move:


That the Senate take note of answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.


As we end 2012 we see a government in shambolic disarray, a government that has no agenda other than spin; a government that is being led around by the nose by the Australian Greens; a government that promised there would be no carbon tax and then foisted a destructive carbon tax on all Australians; a government that promised every year 9 to 12 child access to their own computer at school, a plan announced on 14 November 2007, a plan that failed to reach its targets, a plan was abandoned this year; a government that promised to take over public hospitals if the states did not act by mid-2009, a plan announced before the 2007 election, where the deadlines have not been met and the plan now thoroughly abandoned; a government that promised that the Commonwealth share of hospital funding would increase to 60 per cent. That was announced by Ms Gillard on 29 November 2010 and abandoned on 11 February 2011. 


This is a government that promised to establish a citizens assembly on climate change, a plan announced on 23 July 2010 and abandoned on 7 October 2010; a government that promised Grocery Choice and Petrol Watch, both abandoned; a government that promised an East Timor solution and a Malaysian solution, both in tatters; a government that promised to build 64 GP Super Clinics, a plan that was abandoned after only 36 were built; a government that promised to establish a department of homeland security, announced prior to 2007, a plan that was abandoned within days of Labor taking office; a government that promised to establish 260 new childcare centres, a plan announced before the 2007 election. They funded 38 centres and the plan has now been completely abandoned.


This is a government that promised to require full mandatory precommitment technology for all poker machines, announced in September 2010, abandoned in January 2012; a government that promised to establish a trade centre in every Australian secondary school, announced before the 2007 election, a plan that has now been abandoned; a government that promised a real increase in the defence funding base by an average of three per cent each year through to 2017-18, a plan announced in August 2010, abandoned in the budget of May 2011.


And if that is not enough, this is now the government that seeks to spin and promise a National Disability Insurance Scheme, a dental scheme, a Gonski scheme—all hollow, cynical promises. Australians are deservedly distrusting of this government. And why wouldn't they be? Mr Rudd does not trust the Prime Minister, she who claims that she was foisted into the job of Prime Minister, yet conveniently overlooked that she had prepared the acceptance speech 14 days beforehand. People with private health insurance know they cannot trust this Prime Minister and government. Mr Wilkie, the member for Denison, knows that he cannot trust this Prime Minister and government over poker machines. The car industry knows that they cannot trust this government with a more than $6 billion plan, a plan which has now been absolutely slashed. The State of Israel knows that they cannot trust the Australian government, and of course all Australians know that they cannot trust this government because of that broken promise in relation to a carbon tax.


So as we end the year 2012, we have a government that is in shambolic policy disarray. We also have a Prime Minister who is in personal credibility disarray given the revelations today that have blown out of the water all her pathetic defences to date in relation to the Australian Workers Union scandal. The coalition provides hope, reward and opportunity for the future of this great country. (Time expired)

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I remind senators that when I call them to order they must come to order. Senator Abetz, there was no point of order.




Senator CAMERON:
  Senator Abetz walks out of the chamber, probably feeling a little bit better because he tried to defend the indefensible. He comes in here and talks about people acting with credibility. He was the guy who had to apologise to the chamber and apologise to the Australian people because of his behaviour.




Senator Nash:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The senator is misleading the chamber. Senator Abetz is not leaving the chamber. He should withdraw those remarks.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr Deputy President, I have a different point of order. The motion we are debating is that we take note of answers to questions by all opposition senators. There was no question and no answer mentioned, related to, referred to or anywhere near the topic that this senator has continually talked about. I ask you to bring the senator to order.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I will rule on Senator Nash's point of order. There was no point of order. Senator Nash, you were debating the point. Senator Cameron, I remind you of the topic before the chair.




Senator CAMERON:
  The topic before the chair, as I understand it, is the behaviour of politicians. If ever there was an issue on behaviour of politicians it was Senator Abetz and it was the former Leader of the Opposition Malcolm Turnbull, who lost his job because of the behaviour involved. Senator Abetz was up to his neck in it. I just will not accept any lectures from Senator Abetz about the behaviour of politicians or political parties, given his behaviour.


He spoke about private health insurance. I do not want the cleaners in Parliament House subsidising my private health insurance payments. That is what the coalition are arguing. The cleaners in Parliament House should not be supporting the subsidy for private health insurance for me or any senator here. It was an absolute disgrace. Who supported that? Who wanted the cleaners in Parliament House to be subsidising the richest people in the country? It was the coalition who were doing it. So do not talk to me about policy. I have not heard a word about policy from the coalition. Senator Abetz got up—and he is supposedly going to be a senior member in a coalition government—and there was not one issue on policy. He has not said to the Australian public how they would pay for the policies that they have announced—and I use the word 'policies' advisedly. He did not get up there on one constructive issue. 


Who was it that put the issue of national disability insurance on the agenda? It was Labor. For 11½ years the coalition did nothing. Who increased pensions to historic highs in this country? It was the Labor Party. Who had the courage to take on the vested interests in this country to tackle climate change? It was Labor. Who are the apologists for the mining industry in this chamber? It is the coalition. Who gets flown around the world by Gina Rinehart? It is the National Party. Who are the people who suck up to big business, saying to them that they will do something about labour flexibility, which is code for ripping away workers' penalty rates, ripping away workers' allowances, ripping away their annual leave and leaving them with no control over what they achieve in their workplaces? It is the coalition.


Senator Joyce mentioned letting the public determine on Work Choices. Well the public did determine and they threw you lot out on your backsides. That is what will happen continually when you guys want to take from ordinary workers in this country. That is what you are about. Do not give us any of the nonsense that Senator Abetz put up. You are absolute policy vacuums. (Time expired)

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2012-11-29,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:13):  It is amazing: every time you think the Labor Party has got as mad as they can possibly get, they outdo themselves. We always remember the Craig Thomson story and we always remember the Peter Slipper story—an appointment by the Labor Party—and now, of course, we have the latest one, the Bruce Wilson story.




Senator Cameron:
  Very funny! Even your advisers are laughing!




Senator JOYCE:
  You will be laughing at this. This is what we have got. We are back in the 1990s. The Prime Minister comes back to her boyfriend, Bruce. She comes in: 'How are you, Darling?' 'I'm not bad. How are you, Petal?' 'All's good. What have you got on for dinner?' 'I've got a casserole on.' 'Oh, isn't that lovely! What's that out in the backyard?'



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator JOYCE:
  'Well, that's Ralph Blewitt.' 'What's he up to?' 'Just burying money.'



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Sit down, Senator Joyce. Senator Wong, on a point of order.




Senator Wong:
  That contribution is completely out of order, Mr Deputy President. The standing orders are quite clear about reflecting on members in another place. The imputation there was quite clear, of criminal conduct, and should be withdrawn. It really says something about the senator that he would use the Senate chamber to make those sorts of allegations.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  On the point of order, clearly nothing Senator Joyce has said makes any allegation, Mr Deputy President, in relation to criminal matters. It was a humorous account and unfortunately Senator Wong has lost her humour—and I do not blame her, I might say. I would urge you to dismiss the point of order.




Senator Thistlethwaite:
  On the point of order, Mr Deputy President, the motion was moved to take note of answers given by government ministers. The point that Senator Joyce is making has no relation whatsoever to anything that was said by a minister of this government. On that basis he should refrain from seeking to smear the reputation of people in the other place without basis.




Senator Cameron:
  On the point of order, Mr Deputy President, it is quite clear and unequivocal that this was a reflection on the Prime Minister. It should be withdrawn. I think it is the clearest reflection I have seen here in many times. You cannot hide a reflection on the Prime Minister by saying it was a joke and it was supposed to be humorous. It is clearly unacceptable.




Senator JOYCE:
  On the point of order, Mr Deputy President, there was no reflection on the Prime Minister whatsoever—so if may continue.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Joyce, I will just rule on the point of order first. First of all, there is no point of order and there is no need for you to withdraw anything but I will say this, Senator Joyce, and to all senators: firstly, the debate is wide ranging and we have steered off the topic but all speakers to date have steered widely from the topic and, secondly, be careful with your language and what you do say and how you reflect on people in the other chamber. Senator Joyce, you have the call.




Senator JOYCE:
  Thank you. So we had Bruce Wilson saying the other night that Ralph Blewitt was occasioned to burying money in the backyard. Of course, that is what you do! So she looks out the back and says, 'What's Ralph up to?' 'Oh, he's burying money.'




Senator Cameron:
  On a point of order, Mr Deputy President: I accept that we do range widely in the take note debate but what Senator Joyce is talking about now has got absolutely no relevance, absolutely none, to any of the issues that were raised by a government minister in response to questions today—absolutely nothing.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  On the point of order, Mr Deputy President—and I am sure you do not need my help—it has as much relevance as Senator Cameron's comments about Gina Rinehart and Godwin Grech.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I will rule on the point of order, Senator Cameron. There is no point of order and I would take you back to the comments I used when you were pulled up on a point of order for your comments. So I remind Senator Joyce of the question before the chair.




Senator JOYCE:
  So Bruce Wilson, the Prime Minister's ex-boyfriend, has said, 'Well, what happens is that Ralph Blewitt—he's a funny bloke—used to bury the money in the backyard.' Of course, why do we need a bank when you have got a perfectly good backyard! That is where you put money these days. You put money there because you want to be transparent and you want to be above board. What was the source of this subterranean benevolence? Where did it come from? Why would people be burying money in a backyard? I do not know, but they were probably getting it from somewhere. Who would know? Anyway, there is a bit of a pattern here, and it goes with the Craig Thomson story and it goes with the Peter Slipper story and it is all part of this 'there's something that's not right'. The Australian people wake up and go: 'Who on earth is running the show? Who are these people? Where did they come from?' Let us go back. Imagine we had a story of Menzies or someone and somebody said, 'Oh, yes, and then he had this mate who was a bit of a one.' You see we have the description of Ralph Blewitt by the Prime Minister: he was 'an imbecile', he was a 'sexist pig' and he was 'an idiot'. They are the sorts of thing that I want to hear my Prime Minister say at a press conference! That is the sort of character I expect to be running the country! And who was their associate back in the 1990s? Well, it was a person who was getting money from somewhere and just hanging around the petunias burying the dough. There might be still a bit there. We should go and have a look and we could give it back to the AWU and probably back to the members. That is probably where it could go. Maybe it could go back via the way it got there, through this slush fund. That is possibly how it could go back there. So this is running the country! The country has descended into anarchy. It is totally and utterly out of control. This is why we can find ourselves $252.9 billion in debt as I speak now. This is why we borrowed in excess of $3 billion last week, because of this absolute pandemonium palace and every day just when you think it could not get any stranger, that it could not get any stranger than Craig Thomson or that it could not get any stranger than Peter Slipper, Bruce Wilson then comes out to help the Prime Minister out and, by gosh, didn't he help her! What help! Such friends like that!


There are still some serious questions that need to be asked and I will ask just one. So there is only one question and it is serious: did the Prime Minister witness the power of attorney? I do not want to hear the answer that she has witnessed lots of powers of attorney and she has witnessed lots of documents. Did she witness the power of attorney that was responsible for being able to move a house from Mr Wilson's name into Mr Blewitt's name and what was the reason for that? Did she witness it on the day and at the time that they signed the document? I ask because if you do not witness it at the time they sign a document, then, as any solicitor will tell you, you have done something very, very naughty. Anyway here we are and we have got the NBN story and we could go on with the ceiling insulation and houses burning down story but let us stop it there and see if we ever get an answer.

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2012-11-29,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (15:22):  That contribution from Senator Joyce was one of the most disgraceful, irrelevant pieces of diatribe that I have heard in this place since I became a senator here.




Senator Brandis:
  You're the ones with a criminal in the Lodge.




Senator THISTLETHWAITE:
  This is our nation's parliament—




Senator Chris Evans:
  Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Senator Brandis just said, 'You are the ones with a criminal in the Lodge.' Mr Deputy President, I ask you to make him withdraw, and he ought to when he is on his feet withdraw the outrageous statements he made yesterday. For a man who seeks to be the chief law officer of the nation, his performance over the last few days has been an outrage and disqualified him from the job. Mr Deputy President, we should not allow what occurred yesterday to again be repeated today. It is an outrageous inference on the Prime Minister and it ought to be withdrawn.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Evans. Before I call you, Senator Brandis, I will deal only with the point of order before the chair today. The matter of yesterday is not before the chair. Senator Brandis, I do ask you to withdraw that comment concerning the Prime Minister. It did adversely reflect on the Prime Minister.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Deputy President, yesterday I made a number of specific allegations about breaches of the Western Australian Criminal Code by Julia Gillard.




Senator Wong:
  Withdraw.



Senator McEwen interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Brandis, I am not going to deal with anything that happened yesterday. There is only one matter before the chair and that is a point of order on a reflection made on the Prime Minister.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Deputy President, I seek your guidance on this question.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Certainly, Senator Brandis.




Senator Brandis:
  Are you ruling that to say that a member of parliament has committed a crime is unparliamentary?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, it was the reflection on the Prime Minister and the way you said what you said about the Prime Minister.




Senator Brandis:
  You see, I do say, Mr Deputy President, and I will expand in my contribution shortly, that the Prime Minister has committed a series of breaches of the criminal and commercial laws of Western Australia.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, I think it would assist—it was the way in which it was said. There was a reflection, adversely, on the Prime Minister in your brief comment. How you contribute to the debate after this is fine. The matters before us about yesterday are irrelevant, in my view. I ask that you do withdraw that comment that you made about the Prime Minister.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Deputy President, I withdraw it if you instruct me to but, in doing so, let me make it perfectly clear that I am not withdrawing an allegation that the Prime Minister has committed a breach of the criminal law, because I make that allegation.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, I ask you just to withdraw the comment you made.



Senator Chris Evans interjecting—



Senator Wong interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Evans, I am trying to determine this matter. Senator Wong you are not assisting either. Senator Brandis, I ask if you would withdraw the remarks you made concerning the Prime Minister a moment ago.




Senator Brandis:
  I have already done so, Mr Deputy President.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Senator Brandis. Senator Thistlethwaite, you have the call.




Senator THISTLETHWAITE:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. This is our nation's parliament and it should devote most of its time to debating policy, to the contest of ideas. That is what the Australian people seek and expect from us as representatives. They want to know what our plans are for the nation, where we will take the people over coming years. Three weeks ago, I had the great pleasure of visiting Mungindi, a town that borders New South Wales and Queensland. I was there to open a trade training centre, a $2.4 million investment by this government in a hospitality and metalwork trade training centre to provide better skills development for the town.


Anyone who has visited Mungindi would know that it is a town with very big social problems. It has a very large Indigenous population. While I was at Mungindi Central School to open this trade training centre, I met a young girl, an Indigenous student, in year 10 who explained to me that she was so excited about becoming a chef because of the hospitality trade training centre that had been placed in her school. Her teacher was teaching her how to become a chef and she was just about to begin her apprenticeship. She was telling me that the school had developed a vegetable patch at the back of the school and that they were teaching the kids not only how to cook but how to cook healthy food. This young Indigenous girl would then go home to her family and was teaching her mother how to cook healthy food.


When we talk about closing the gap on Indigenous disadvantage in this country and when we talk about real social change, that is an example of real social change. That will not show up in any of the statistics that we see published on education or on indifference in this country. But that is real social change. What people have to understand, and what the Australian public are coming to understand, is that those opposite and Tony Abbott have a plan to cancel the trade training centres program in this country, to get rid of that program that is delivering real results for the Australian people.


One of the programs that this government can be most proud of is the Building the Education Revolution. We have rebuilt every single school in this country. At the moment, in New South Wales, the O'Farrell government is cutting $1.7 billion from the education budget. Last year I was at East Maitland Public School to open a new BER facility. This wonderful school with a wonderful principal, Sheree O'Brien, who is passionate about special-needs education, had put all of their BER money into building two special-needs classrooms. I was there to open that facility. At the morning tea after the opening of those wonderful new facilities, where kids with severe Down syndrome and autism are now getting an education, I spoke to some of the parents. One of the parents came up to me and said, 'Can you send my thanks to Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd for this program.' She explained that she had moved her family all the way from Perth to get her son into East Maitland Public School because she had heard how passionate that principal was about special-needs education and because the school was investing in special-needs education.


Any special needs classroom has two teachers and at the very least a teacher's aide. When you talk about $1.7 billion worth of cuts to education, have a guess what positions will go first in those cuts. They are going to be those teachers' aides that assist those teachers providing special needs education in public schools throughout the country. That is the difference between a Labor government and a Liberal government when it comes to education. That is what this Senate and this parliament should be focusing on—the future of our schools, our hospitals and our nation. (Time expired)

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2012-11-29,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:30):  Australia today is led by a Prime Minister who faces serious and specific allegations of misconduct, including breaches of the criminal law, and other conduct which makes her unfit for office.




Senator Chris Evans:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Not only is that, again, Senator Brandis trying to make an improper suggestion about the Prime Minister, but there has been no accusation made.



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator Chris Evans:
  I did not, Senator. I paid attention to the Senate during Senate question time.




Senator Brandis:
  And today I listened to the House of Representatives.




Senator Chris Evans:
  Senator, I understand where your priorities are. You have made that very clear in recent years. You are in the gutter with your leader—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Evans, can you address your remarks through the chair.




Senator Chris Evans:
  and you have done yourself a great disservice. We are not going to allow Senator Brandis to abuse the right of privilege in this parliament, and I will constantly take points of order if he does not adhere to the standing orders. He is seeking to allege corruption and conspiracy. If he has such a charge to make, he should take it to the police—not ring up his mates and try to get them to do it, but to take a complaint to the police. Making an allegation against another member is not in order, Mr Deputy President.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Evans, you are now debating the point. Senator Brandis, is this on the point of order?




Senator BRANDIS:
  Mr Deputy President, I have two points to make on the point of order. The first is a narrow and technical point, and the second is a more substantive point. First of all, what I said was that the Prime Minister faces accusations—




Senator Chris Evans:
  Made by you.




Senator BRANDIS:
  And by Mr Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition.




Senator Chris Evans:
  No, he didn't have anything when he got up today.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Yes, he did. I listened to Mr Abbott's speech and I listened to the subsequent questions from both Mr Abbott and Ms Bishop, and I can assure you, Senator Evans, that those specific allegations were put to the Prime Minister and were not dealt with by her. So, Mr Deputy President, the narrow point is this: it cannot possibly be unparliamentary to say that a member of the lower house faces accusations of misconduct, including a breach of the criminal law, when in fact they do face those allegations. That is an objective truth. Ms Gillard does face those accusations. Whether or not she is guilty is a matter for a court of law.


The broad point is this: it cannot possibly be the case that the parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia is denied the capacity to debate whether the most senior minister of the Commonwealth has committed a wrongdoing or breached the criminal law.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, thank you for your contribution. Senator Evans, on the point of order: in light of Senator Brandis's comments earlier, on which I ruled that he needed to withdraw, I was listening very carefully. I do not believe he does on this occasion. Senator Brandis was using language that I believe was satisfactory in the debate.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on another point of order. Senator Evans is holier than thou in accusing others of bad manners. He accused the current speaker of getting down in the gutter, or being in the gutter.




Senator Wong:
  And he does!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Wong!




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I ask you, Mr Deputy President: is the accusation by the Leader of the Government in the Senate parliamentary? It is an accusation that was just repeated by a senior so-called minister of this so-called government.




Senator Wong:
  That is dead right! He is in the gutter and everybody knows it. Just like you; you and he both!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Thank you, Senator Macdonald. I think it would assist the debate if we move on. There has been a lot of interjecting across the chamber. Senator Brandis, you have the call.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Mr Deputy President, when I hear government ministers, from the Prime Minister to Senator Wong and others, say the opposition is in the gutter, I am reminded of the late President Richard Nixon, who said the same thing. He used the same words about his accusers during the course of the Watergate affair. It is the defence of the scoundrel to say that the accuser is in the gutter. I remember the late Creighton Burns, one of the great giants of Australian journalism, who exposed during a previous Labor government—the government of Gough Whitlam—the foreign loans affair. He was accused of being in the gutter and accused of muckraking, and he said famously: 'If there's muck, let's rake it; that's what journalists do.'




Senator Chris Evans:
  You're not a journalist.




Senator BRANDIS:
  If the government or ministers of the government have engaged in misconduct or have broken the law—



Senator Chris Evans interjecting—



Senator Wong interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order on my right!




Senator BRANDIS:
  If the Prime Minister or ministers of the government have engaged in misconduct or broken the law, it is at the very heart of the role of the parliament to expose that wrongdoing and to call them to account.




Senator Wong:
  Go to the authorities if you've got something, George.




Senator BRANDIS:
  What I have is a document called a 'Specific Power of Attorney'. And the specific power of attorney—it is the power of attorney referred to by my friend Senator Joyce—is signed, sealed and delivered by Ralph Blewitt and is witnessed by Julia Gillard over the impressed stamp—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Table it! Incorporate it!




Senator BRANDIS:
  I am happy to. It is witnessed by Julia Gillard over the impressed stamp of a solicitor holding a current practising certificate. The specific power of attorney by Mr Ralph Blewitt appoints Bruce Morton Wilson as Mr Blewitt's attorney.


The power of attorney is recited to have been made on the fourth day of February 1993.


I also have here an advertisement placed by a real estate agent called Thomsons for a property at 85 Kerr Street, Fitzroy. The document advertises that the auction is to take place on 13 February 1993. It is not in dispute that the auction did take place and that the property was knocked down to Mr Wilson, who purported to acquire it in the name of Mr Blewitt. Mr Blewitt at the time the power of attorney was ostensibly executed on 4 February 1993 was in Perth. Ms Gillard, who witnessed the power of attorney, lived in Melbourne. It is not impossible that on 4 February 1993 Ms Gillard was in Perth personally present with Mr Blewitt. Nor is it impossible that on 4 February 1993 Mr Blewitt was in Melbourne personally present with Ms Gillard. It is even possible that the two of them were together somewhere else. But it would be a fraud and it would be a crime—it would be the crime of creating a materially false and misleading document—if in fact that power of attorney was backdated.


In the House of Representatives about an hour ago the Prime Minister was asked specifically by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Ms Bishop, 'Were you personally present when this power of attorney was executed?'—because, if the Prime Minister was not, then this document would be a forgery. And do you know what, Mr Deputy President, if the Prime Minister were personally present, there was one very simple answer that would put all suspicion at rest. She could simply have said yes. But she did not. She declined to do so. She said, 'I've witnessed thousands of powers of attorney in my career as a lawyer.' If this document were not a falsification why didn't she just say 'yes'?

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:39):  I rise to speak on the motion to take note. Mr Deputy President, you have allowed a wide-ranging debate. I do not query that. That has been the tradition here. But I would point out, of course, that the opposition did not ask one question today about the AWU matter. In fact, they have largely failed to all week.




Senator Joyce:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. In fact we did. On supplementary, two of my questions—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Joyce, that is not a point of order; that is debating the matter. Senator Evans, you have a call.




Senator CHRIS EVANS:
  Mr Deputy President, I think if you check the Hansard record, you will find the question was about the electricity privatisation. The fact that the senator then went on to try and cast slurs and aspersions later in his contribution is a reflection on him.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Deputy President, on a point of order: would you rule, please, Mr Deputy President, whether, when the Senate is debating taking note of answers to questions asked in question time, it is at liberty to address answers to supplementary questions, because if it is—and that has always been my understanding of the practice—then what Senator Evans just said is quite wrong.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I will just clarify for the point of senators here today that the motion moved by Senator Abetz was to take note of all answers—so that is all answers; supplementary questions included—given by ministers to all question asked by opposition senators. That is what we are debating. Senator Evans, you have the call.




Senator CHRIS EVANS:
  We are used to Senator Brandis puffing himself up to his full height of importance and trying to pretend that he brings his legal skills and experience to these debates. What he brings is dirty, low-grade accusations. Yesterday he did accuse the Prime Minister of criminal activity. He accused her of being a party to a conspiracy to defraud. This is the same bloke who tries to ring up police commissioners or Liberal police ministers to put in the fix to try to get them to take action to suit his political interests. This is the bloke who has no standards.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Evans! Senator Brandis on a point of order?




Senator Brandis:
  That assertion is false, but it is also unparliamentary because it suggests corruption. I ask that it be withdrawn.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  You were debating the point on the second matter. As far as the unparliamentary matter is concerned, Senator Evans, if you wanted to withdraw that part of your comment, I would be happy for you to do so.




Senator CHRIS EVANS:
  Mr Deputy President, I am not sure to which part you refer, but I am happy to cooperate with you. If I said something unparliamentary I would of course withdraw it.


I was referring to the fact that Senator Brandis has been known in the past for getting politically involved in questions around the member for Dobell, Mr Thomson, and to engage with the then New South Wales Attorney General on that matter. I also understand that he sought to engage with the New South Wales police minister on that issue and also sought to engage with the police commissioner. Senator Brandis has form.




Senator Brandis:
  On a point of order, Mr Deputy President: the third of those statements—the statement referring to the New South Wales Police Commissioner—is false.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, you are debating—




Senator Brandis:
  It is an invention. It implies improper conduct and I ask that it be withdrawn.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There was no point of order, Senator Brandis—you were debating the matter. Senator Evans, you have a call.




Senator Wong:
  You can dish it out but you cannot take it.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Wong!




Senator CHRIS EVANS:
  Senator Brandis's glass jaw is famous. Senator Brandis has form. He has abandoned any pretence of impartiality, of the rule of law, as he has gone along with the Liberal Party as they sought to slur the Treasurer, Mr Swan, with the information from Godwin Grech. Remember of the accusations they made? Remember the prosecution? Remember the allegations of improper conduct that they cast then? That brought down their previous leader.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Deputy President, my point of order is not that I had nothing whatsoever to do with the Godwin Grech affair—




Senator Wong:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Wong! I am dealing with a point of order. You can speak to the point of order in a moment. Senator Wong, you do not have a call.




Senator Brandis:
  Let me start again. My point of order is not that I in fact had nothing to do with the Godwin Grech affair. My point of order is that I was the chairman of the Senate Privileges—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  You are debating the point, Senator Brandis. That is not a point of order.




Senator Brandis:
  Let me finish the point of order.



Senator Wong interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Wong, I will give you the call in a moment.




Senator Brandis:
  Let me finish my point of order.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Wong, first of all, I will come to you in a moment. Senator Brandis, if you can explain the point of order or indicate what the point of order is and come to it quickly, I will appreciate that.




Senator Brandis:
  This is the point of order: I was the chairman of the Senate Privileges Committee, which examined the Godwin Grech affair.



Government senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! I am going to deal with the point of order first.




Senator Brandis:
  In making the statement he just made, the Leader of the Government in the Senate reflects upon me as the chairman of the Senate Privileges Committee and on the Senate Privileges Committee itself.

National wheat industry advisory taskforce to be established



The Minister must cause to be established a wheat industry advisory taskforce by no later than 5 February 2013.


I will try and move through these amendments quickly, because I know we have a short amount of time. These amendments relate to the wheat industry advisory task force. As I articulated in my speech on the second reading , the Greens have spent a lot of time consulting and talking to people about the bill. We indicated during my speech on the second reading that without these amendments the Greens would not be supporting the bill. We recognise there are still some issues that need to be resolved in the full deregulation of this market. There are still issues around access to stocks information, there are still issues around wheat quality and there are other issues around the efficiency and effectiveness of the market.


We then decided it would be a good idea if there were an expert body established—an advisory task force—to specifically look at these issues. These are the issues that were identified in the dissenting report that was put in to the inquiry on this bill. The letters that I tabled in the chamber yesterday—a series of three letters—clearly articulate the purpose of this advisory group and the way they will report the issues around independence, transparency and all those sorts of things. What I want to do, though, is ask a question of the minister on this. I realise that advisers are not here yet.



Senator Wong interjecting—



The CHAIRMAN:  Just a moment. People cannot speak without getting permission from the chair. That is the first issue. Secondly, Senator Siewert was just ensuring, Minister, that you were listening.




Senator Wong:
  She asked me a question.



The CHAIRMAN:  But Senator Siewert has not concluded. You have concluded?




Senator SIEWERT:
  No, sorry.



The CHAIRMAN:  I did not think you had.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I was going to ask a question, but I realised—and I was not trying to be rude—that there was no point in me asking the question without actually having someone able to hear. I also appreciate that the advisers are not here yet. My question relates to the independence of this task force. I understand that, through the correspondence, the minister has agreed to the points that we have been discussing. However, I want to clarify and make absolutely sure that it is the government's understanding that this advisory body will be as independent as possible both from the minister and from DAFF.



The CHAIRMAN:  Do you want to take further questions first, Minister? Senator Nash was going to get to her feet. It might assist you with the advisers on the way.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (15:50):  I was just going to, perhaps, assist. I wonder if this would be possible, given that I think Senator Ludwig is on his way and we are still waiting for the departmental advisers. If the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry would like to make sure their advisers are here fairly shortly, the Minister for Finance and Deregulation would really appreciate that.




Senator Chris Evans:
  It would help in the next budget round too, for them!




Senator WONG:
  I thought I should get that on the Hansard. But I might—through you, Mr Chairman—suggest that, if we could put a number of questions on notice, I am sure the minister, who is arriving now, will be able to respond.



The CHAIRMAN:  I will call Senator Nash while Senator Ludwig is moving to his seat.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:51):  Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. I am happy to assist, but I note that we are, I think—and I seek your guidance—only allotted till 4.15 pm for the consideration in committee, and any delay caused by the lack of officials really causes some great consternation given that we only have 25 minutes here. So I also will be brief. With regard to this amendment and the wheat advisory body, I would ask the minister about the make-up of the body, the process by which the body will be appointed and the date by which that advice is due to come back to government, because I do not have much confidence in the government getting even this right.


We have seen through the process of the legislation that we have before us that on the code development committee, which was the development committee for the voluntary code, the owners and users of the ports had seven positions while the producers only had two. It was completely inappropriately weighted in my view. The voluntary code simply will not work. I know we are coming to the mandatory code issue later, but I will take the opportunity now as I am sure we will run out of time before we get to the voluntary code. To have the whole premise of the WEA being disbanded and that, at the end of the day, it would be overseen by a voluntary code is simply stupid and shows that the government does not understand the operation of the industry and how this is all working.


The Greens are also moving some amendments, and I agree they are a slight improvement on the dog's breakfast piece of legislation we have in front of us. The Greens signed up with the coalition to a lengthy dissenting report when this legislation came to the committee. That dissenting report had a very comprehensive set of recommendations that went with it. We were tremendously pleased on this side when we saw that the Greens were going to do that, but now we see the Greens rolling over to do the bidding of their government partners, the Labor Party, on the back of a couple of small amendments. If the Greens had truly believed and insisted on those recommendations that they had signed up to in the dissenting report, they would have voted with the coalition against this legislation so we could have done it properly. It is extremely disappointing to see that.


We will have the ACCC overseeing this, and I simply do not have the confidence that the ACCC will be able to oversee this in an appropriate manner. The government has made a complete mess of this. There was a simple way forward to reconfigure the WEA to be able to do all those industry-good functions—




Senator Ludwig:
  Bring back WEA!




Senator NASH:
  Methinks thou dost protest a bit too much, Minister Ludwig. You just do not understand this. We have here a government that is quite happy to listen to the large bulk handlers and the big end of town and not listen for one moment to those producers, those people in the industry, who actually understand the ramifications of this. That is simply unacceptable and reprehensible. The government is going with the big end of town. A Labor government is doing this when we have producers out there who in no way, shape or form made any kind of abrogation about getting out their message that they know these industry-good functions need to be performed. The government simply has not listened. So we have a government that has absolutely pandered to the big end of town and the Greens that have rolled over to support that government, and the people who are going to lose out are those hardworking grain producers out in our rural communities who deserve much better than this.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (15:55):  I have been so controlled over how the coalition has handled this debate—and I am not going to waste too much time—but Senator Nash has no understanding of the industry in, for example, WA and what has been going on with the farcical situation with the coalition there. She embarrasses herself. We have spoken to all the players in this. We know we have worked very hard to try to come up with a solution that moves us forward, because the coalition's solution is no solution and entrenches the industry in a mire.




Senator Nash:
  Mr Chairman, I rise on a point of order. The senator is misrepresenting me. If she had heard the beginning of my speech, she would know that I acknowledge the differences in Western Australia.



The CHAIRMAN:  There is no point of order. That is debating the matter. Senator Siewert, you have the call.




Senator SIEWERT:
  Instead of sitting on our hands and watching the industry stagnate for two years, we have sought to find a solution. I do not usually take offense and raise the matter in this chamber when they continually attack us. They have an obsession with us—and that is fine because they are obviously worried about us. But, when they seek to denigrate the work that the industry has put in to try to find a solution here, that is when it presses my buttons. When she says we have rolled over when we have worked to try to find a solution, yes, I take offense. If you call me soft-skinned or thin-skinned, yes, I am on this one. Senator Nash may like to know that the very producers and organisations she has been talking about have contacted us and said they like the letters and the response that we have had from the government.


So let's get serious and talk about the real issues instead of trying to denigrate the work that has been done in this chamber, the very serious work that, I must say, has been put in on all sides of the chamber. There are other coalition members who do take this issues seriously and have been looking to find a solution so that we can move this industry forward and take a serious opportunity to look at the real issues to find a way forward with those sticking points that have been there for a long time and need to be resolved if we are really going to see this industry overcome the barriers to it proceeding effectively and efficiently.


Senator Ludwig, before you came into the chamber I was seeking your assurance that the wheat industry advisory task force would be as independent as possible from both the minister and the department.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2012-11-29,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (15:58):  I thank Senator Siewert for her contribution. Yes, the purpose of the task force is to do the work that is set out. It is important that its work is supported by the secretariat of DAFF, but DAFF certainly has no intention to deliver the work or drive the outcome. What I want—and I suspect it is the same as you—is for that task force to do the work. I am not going to cavil with it and neither is the department. I can make that very plain. This is critical work that needs to be done.


You are right that Senator Nash, unfortunately, misses the point completely. I am not going to get into the negative arguments that she wants to run and which are personal denigrations as well. This industry needs this work done. It needs the work of the task force, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us to use the funds from the WEA to progress this debate further.


Where we have landed in the last short while is that the industry, which has effectively been saying this for a year, want the outcome that we have now got—in fact, so much so that it has been working on the voluntary code. Should the amendments pass, it will be a mandatory code. I think that is a sensible solution for the industry. We do need the facts on the table, and that is what the task force will do.


As to the make-up of the task force, we will consult with industry to ensure that we get the best possible people on the task force to be able to provide those outcomes. It is critically important that we look at opportunities from industry to put forward drivers who can contribute to the outcomes of the task force. In terms of the timing, clearly I will have to wait for the legislation to pass and it to be established to manage some of that. But I can broadly say that we will ensure that the task force is up and running as soon as practicable. Of course, we have to go through a consultation process with industry to get their input on who the people will be on the task force and, of course, consultation with those people who are appointed to the task force. That will obviously depend on the legislation passing, and it will depend on how long it takes industry to respond. I would imagine that will occur in a relatively short period of time. 


This is one of those areas where industry, if you look across it, has unfortunately been significantly divide. The division between WA and the eastern seaboard is just so stark. The WA industry has embraced competition since 2008 and it has continued to prosper and thrive within a competitive environment. On the eastern seaboard, there are two different markets but the majority of the eastern seaboard has a range of market opportunities from domestic through to export. To put it mildly, I think they have embraced competition and continue to strive and achieve. They have, though, in this respect, not moved on from a regulated market in part. I think this gives the industry a great opportunity to look at some of the issues that they say trouble them and to drive the change that is so desperately needed. This industry has all the elements of a great industry, and this change will ensure that it can continue to prosper.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:02):  by leave—I move amendments (3) and (1) on sheet 7328 together:


(1) Clause 2, page 2 (table item 1), omit ""3"", substitute ""4"".


(3)   Page 2 (after line 11), after clause 3, insert:




4 National wheat industry advisory body to be established



   (1) The Minister must cause to be established a wheat industry advisory body by no later than 31 January 2013.


   (2) The wheat industry advisory body must consist of the following members, appointed by the Minister:


   (a) an independent Chair;


   (b) at least 9 skills-based members appointed from the production, bulk handling and non-handling export sectors of the industry;


   (c) 2 non-voting observer members.


   (3) The wheat industry advisory body is to administer the Wheat Industry Special Account.


Time is short so I will be very brief. These amendments are very similar to those just passed by the Australian Greens. The only difference is that they are somewhat more prescriptive in terms of the advisory board, and that is a fundamental difference. I think that fairly characterises it. So I will not be seeking to divide. If I could get an indication as to what the positions are, we can then just get on with it.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (16:03):  I just want to let Senator Xenophon know that we will not be supporting these amendments. We have dealt with these issues in the correspondence with the minister, which we have tabled. This task force was specifically set up so that it could be flexible, and I think these amendments tie it down too much. We want a degree of flexibility because if other issues come up we want the body to be able to deal with them in a more flexible manner. We also are concerned about it being too heavily prescriptive about the make-up of the body. We do address those issues in the minister's agreement to the make-up of the body and what the organisation will do. That is in the correspondence, which, as I said, has been tabled. The minister has agreed to the way that the body will operate, and we have just had a discussion about that. So we will not be supporting these amendments.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (16:04):  The government, likewise, will not be supporting the amendments moved by Senator Xenophon. Can I say, Senator Xenophon, that I do understand what you are trying to achieve. We are not actually that far apart, in truth. It is about making sure that we do set up a task force. It will effectively be me who establishes it, and I intend to ask for stakeholder input into its make-up so that I can then appoint them to the board. Whether that can occur by 31 January will depend on the passage of this legislation, the ability to be able to consult with industry and for industry to provide the input into that and then to be able to do the machinery matters.


I certainly hope that it can meet your expectation. I think it would also be the Greens' expectation that we do it as quickly as possible. We may even do it before that date. So you would actually be a drag on the system. You would be taking too long for me. Hopefully, we can move very quickly. There is a lot of work that we want them to do. You have structured it in a way that the minister appoints an independent chair. You state:


The wheat industry advisory body must consist of the following members, appointed by the Minister:


(a) an independent Chair;


(b) at least 9 skills-based members appointed … 


I think it is a little prescriptive. What I want to ensure is that from industry consultation we can get a task force that represents industry, that can move it forward, that can do the work that we want it to do and that has the skills base.


I think we are also very close if we talk about making sure that they have a skills based membership and that they have skills from across the industry. All of that is essential for it to work and become effective. Although I understand your reasons for putting them forward, we are not too far apart in truth and in principle, and for those reasons I cannot support the amendments. I think you could confidently predict that the outcomes will look very similar. 


Question negatived.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (16:06):  I move Greens amendment (2) on sheet 7294, revised 2:


(2) Clause 2, page 2 (table item 4), omit the table item, substitute:







4. Schedule 3







1 October 2014.





However, the provision(s) do not commence at all unless, before that 
day:





(a) the Minister has published a notice in the 
Gazette
 under subsection 12(1) of the 
Wheat Export Marketing Act 2008
 in respect of a code of conduct; and





(b) the code has been declared by regulations under section 51AE of the 
Competition and Consumer Act 2010
 to be a mandatory industry code.










This amendment is essentially about changing what was to be a voluntary industry code to a mandatory industry code, as I articulated in my second reading contribution. There is, I think, very substantial agreement in this chamber that a voluntary code was inadequate. The only way the Greens can support this bill is to ensure that this code is mandatory.


As you will see from the documentation that has been circulated in the chamber, there has been some agreement reached already in the voluntary code, including some of the stocks information and access to that information. The minister has confirmed that that process will be maintained in the mandatory code or in some other vehicle if that proves unworkable—because I understand there are some issues there.


As I understand it, there has been some agreement already reached through the discussions—despite the flawed processes Senator Nash articulated—about access to stocks information. That will be maintained and will be either in the mandatory code or some other vehicle. We encourage the Senate to support this amendment, because I understand there is a fairly strong consensus in the place that such a code should be mandatory.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2012-11-29,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (16:08):  The government accepts the amendment. We looked very hard and wanted to see how we would progress with a voluntary code. The voluntary code committee has been meeting for some time. I can say that the representations from a range of industry people really accord with your view and so it did not take much for me to be persuaded by you to adopt a mandatory code.


It is one of those areas where I was probably disappointed that the industry could not come to me with a united way forward. I think you have also heard the criticisms that the industry have reflected about how a voluntary code would operate, and I accept that, if we move to a mandatory code, it will give business certainty and grain growers certainty about how it will operate and the detail that they can operate within it.


I do not share Senator Nash's view about the ACCC. The ACCC are there to manage a range of competition rules—and they will, in this instance, do the work that they do well. Of course, it is always interesting, Senator Siewert, when people want a different type of body than the ACCC. They come up with things like an ombudsman with teeth—which would really fly in the face of what a true ombudsman does—or they come up with another regulatory scheme. Well, in that instance, they really want to go back to a reregulated market. They hark back for quota systems, they hark back for pooling, they hark back for all of those regulatory regimes that actually showed that they did not work. They were very uncompetitive. They led to very negative outcomes and they created bodies that led us into 'oil for food' scandals that we so well know.

This is a port access regime. One of the challenges has been that there is a range of industry issues that have arisen, one of them significantly at the port access arrangements. This is designed to deal with the port access arrangements. The task force is designed to deal with other parts of the supply chain. The way the industry works, you can deal with port access. There is a range of bulk handlers in the marketplace at various ports, so it is easy to identify where they are.

The documents read as follows—





Australian Government Response





Senate Environment and Communications Reference Committee Report: The adequacy of protections for the privacy of Australians online





Recommendation 1 



2.31 The committee recommends that the government consider and respond to the recommendations in the Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre's report: Communications privacy complaints: In search of the right path, and recommendations from the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network arising from that report. 




Government Response 



Noted. The report raises a number of relevant issues, with comments on the issues set out below: - 




Communications privacy complaints: In search of the right path – Recommendations



(1) There must be a significant improvement in time taken to resolve complaints at the OPC. The have significant resources, skills and expertise in privacy protections, and they only receive a tiny fraction of complaints in the sector. The OPC should aim to resolve the majority of complaints within 30 days. 


The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) receives a very small proportion of complaints about telecommunications but those that they do receives are usually complex. They involve issues such as the listing of debts with credit reporting agencies. The nature of such complaints makes them difficult to resolve quickly. Given this complexity, the OAIC has a current benchmark for finalising investigations of 150 days on average. 


(2) There must be a significant improvement in the information provided to individuals about resolution times. Information should be consistent (across the website, annual reports and verbal advice). It should be frank – e.g. exact timing targets, or an exact average based on prior complaints. It is very poor practice to accept a complaint without warning the consumer that it may take 6 months to resolve, especially when other avenues for resolution are available.


The information should be consistent and based on average times and the OAIC will look to improve the information it currently provides to complainants. 


(3) All three complaint bodies (i.e. Australian Communications and Media Authority [ACMA], the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman [TIO] and the OAIC) should undertake research to assess the demographic profiles of their complaints, to gain better understanding of special needs such as language and disability access. This research will also identify whether some disadvantaged groups are not utilising the services of these complaints bodies, and this information could be used to design outreach and targeting programs. 


The TIO has advised that it has developed a disadvantaged and vulnerable communications strategy, which identifies some targeted activities to research the needs of, and raise awareness of the TIO among, vulnerable groups in the community. These include culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) consumers, consumers in rural and regional areas, people with disabilities, indigenous consumers and young people. 


The OAIC and the ACMA will look at the resource implications of undertaking such research. 


(4) There should be better coordination amongst the three complaints bodies, with the aim of reducing the adverse consequences for consumers of the current disconnection. A formal Memorandum of Understanding should be developed between the three complaint bodies. This agreement should include fair and transparent criteria for the management of complaints and for referrals between the three organisations. A process for sharing the identity of business parties to a complaint should be developed in order to enhance the recognition of systemic issues across the sector.


This recommendation is consistent with recommendation 73-8 from the Australian Law Reform Commission's (ALRC) Report 108 – For Your Information: Australian Privacy Law and Practices, which calls for the development of memoranda of understanding between the complaint handling bodies and clarity around the roles and responsibilities of each complaint handling organisation. 


The ACMA has advised that a memorandum of understanding (MoU) has already been established between the ACMA and the TIO. 


The OAIC has advised that it will explore developing a Memorandum of Understanding involving the three relevant complaints bodies. 


(5) Consumers should be provided with consistent information about where they should complain. This should include information on jurisdiction issues, but also on timelines and expected outcomes where these differ between the three complaints paths. It should be widely accessible and available to consumers contemplating or initiating complaints. 


This recommendation is consistent with recommendation 73-9 from the Australian Law Reform Commission's (ALRC) Report 108 – For Your Information: Australian Privacy Law and Practices, calling for the OAIC to publish its complaint handling policies, procedures and enforcement guidelines, including the roles and functions of the complaints handling bodies under their relevant legislation. 


The Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, (DBCDE) has reviewed the role of the TIO and has recommended that the TIO clarify its jurisdiction over emerging products and services and publish information to establish clear boundaries around the issues, including complaints, that are within or outside its jurisdiction (see http://www.dbcde.gov.au/consultation and submissions/TIO reforms). 


The OAIC's website offers a 'complaint checker' tool that assists potential complainants to identify the appropriate jurisdiction and to understand the complaint process and possible outcomes. The OAIC will consider whether the information provided to complainants can be enhanced to provide additional information, consistent with this recommendation. 


(6) Industry should be provided with consistent information about compliance. There should be no circumstances where the industry is receiving a message from one complaints body that everything is fine, while another complaints body is issuing warnings or enforcement action for non-compliance. Again this should be widely accessible and available for relevant industry personnel.


This could be one of the matters to be included in a MoU between the three bodies – see recommendations 4 and 5 above. 


(7) All three complaint bodies must ensure that they offer (and use) the full range of regulatory tools and remedies. These include:- 


1. Compensation for the individual;


2. An apology for the individual;


3. Prompt correction or removal of personal data;


4. A change to business practice at the individual company;


5. A change to broader industry practice for systemic issues;


6. Occasional naming of individual companies as a warning to inform other consumers, and a lesson for industry that reputation consequences may arise from poor complaint outcomes; and 


7. Occasional enforcement action in order to promote compliance.


In practice this recommendation will necessitate a change of approach at the OPC, so that they utilise their naming and enforcement powers, and a change of approach at the ACMA so that they offer greater individual remedies (such as compensation and apologies).


ACMA's recent Reconnecting the Customer inquiry and the DBCDE's review of the TIO may lead to regulatory change to improve industry behaviour and the end-user experience when seeking redress. 


Currently, the OAIC employs a range of regulatory tools in the conduct of complaint handling activities. The Commissioner is able to seek each of the remedial actions listed above. The OAIC regularly seeks remedies 1 to 6, including the naming of respondents in reports of 'own motion' investigations and in the OAIC's annual report. Under the Privacy Act 1988 (the Act) ""enforcement action"" would necessitate commencing action in the Federal Court to enforce a determination made under section 52 of the Act. The Commissioner also has a power to seek an injunction through the Federal Court to stop a person from engaging in conduct that would constitute a contravention of the Act.  


The ALRC recommended and the Government agreed that the OAIC be granted with additional and improved powers to protect consumers in relation to privacy. The Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012 includes amendments to strengthen the Information Commissioner's powers to conduct investigations, resolve complaints and promote compliance. These amendments will contribute to more effective and stronger protection of the right to privacy.




Recommendation 2 



3.30 The committee recommends that the Australian Privacy Commissioner's complaint-handling role under paragraph 27(1) (ab) of the Privacy Act be expanded to more effectively address complaints about the misuse of privacy consent forms in the online context.


3.31 The committee further recommends that the Office of the Privacy Commissioner examine the issue of consent in the online context and develop guidelines on the appropriate use of privacy consent forms for online services. 




Government Response



3.30 Noted. The ALRC recommended and the Government agreed that the OAIC be granted additional and improved powers to protect consumers in relation to privacy. The Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012 includes amendments to strengthen the Information Commissioner's powers to conduct investigations, resolve complaints and promote compliance. These amendments will contribute to more effective and stronger protection of the right to privacy. 


3.31 Agreed in principle. Implementation is a matter for the OAIC, taking account of available resources and priorities. 




Recommendation 3 



3.50 The committee recommends that the small business exemptions should be amended to ensure that small businesses which hold substantial quantities of personal information, or which transfer personal information offshore are subject to the requirements of the Privacy Act 1988. 


3.51 To achieve this end, the committee urges the Australian Privacy Commissioner to undertake a review of those categories of small business with significant personal data holdings, and to make recommendations to government about expanding the categories of small business operators prescribed in regulations as subject to the Privacy Act 1988. 


3.52 The committee further recommends that the second tranche of reforms to the Privacy Act 1988 amend the Act to provide that all Australian organisations which transfer personal information overseas, including small businesses, must ensure that the information will be protected in a manner at least equivalent to the protections provided under Australia's privacy framework. 




Government Responses



3.50 Noted. The Australian Law Reform Commission Report (ALRC) 108, For Your Information: Australian Privacy Law and Practice recommended (R39-1) that the Act be amended to remove the small business exemption. 


The Government will take the recommendation into account when it considering the ALRC's recommendation to remove the small business exemption. 


3.51 Noted. The Government will consider this recommendation in conjunction with its deliberations on recommendation 3.50 above. 


3.52 Noted. The Government will consider this recommendation in conjunction with its deliberations on recommendations 3.50 and 3.51 above. 


The Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012 creates the Australian Privacy Principles, a single set of privacy principles applying to both Commonwealth agencies and private sector organisations. Australian Privacy Principle (APP) 8 and new section 16C will provide a framework for the regulation of cross-border disclosures of personal information. Before a cross-border disclosure can occur, the draft APP 8 imposes minimum obligations on an organisation to take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances (for example, by imposing contractual obligations) to ensure that the overseas recipient does not breach the draft APPs. 


In addition, an organisation will remain accountable for the acts and practices of the overseas recipient, unless an exemption applies. 




Recommendation 4 



3.86 The Committee recommends that the OPC in consultation with web browser developers, ISPs and the advertising industry, should, in accordance with proposed amendments to the Privacy Act, develop and impose a code which includes a 'Do Not Track' model following consultation with stakeholders. 




Government Response 



Noted. As part of its stage one response to the ALRC recommendations, the Government announced that it supports the development of binding and mandatory codes. Schedule 3 of the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012 contains the new provisions on privacy codes. It will be a matter for the Commissioner to consider whether a code is necessary.




Recommendation 5 



3.96 The committee recommends that item 19(3) (g)(ii) of the exposure draft of amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 be amended to provide that an organisation has an Australian link if it collects information from Australia, thereby ensuring that information collected from Australia in the online context is protected by the Privacy Act 1988. 




Government Response 



Noted. The Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012 inserts the term 'Australian link' and lists additional connections with Australia which would be a sufficient link, see items 2-8 of Schedule 4 of the Bill. 




Recommendation 6 



3.109 The committee recommends that the government amend the Privacy Act 1988 to require all Australian organisations that transfer personal information offshore are fully accountable for protecting the privacy of that information. 


3.110 The committee further recommends that the government consider the enforceability of these provisions and, if necessary, strengthen the powers of the Australian Privacy Commissioner to enforce offshore data transfer provisions.  




Government Response 



Noted. See response to recommendation 3.52. 




Recommendation 7 



3.116 The committee recommends that the Australian government continue to work internationally, and particularly within our region, to develop strong privacy protections for Australians in the online context. 




Government Response 



Accepted. The Australian Government has been and will be continuing to work with appropriate international bodies including in particular regional bodies to further privacy protections. 


The Government actively participates in the work of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and Asian Pacific Economic Council (APEC) on international privacy issues. Australia has played a leading role in the development of the APEC Cross-Border Enforcement Arrangement (CPEA), which allows participating privacy regulators to share information and provide assistance in relation to privacy matters that have a cross-border aspect. The APEC CPEA commenced in July 2010 and the privacy regulators of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Hong Kong China, and the United States are currently participants. 


The OAIC continues to foster strong ties with other privacy authorities in the region via the Asia Pacific Privacy Authorities group. 




Recommendation 8 



3.122 The committee recommends that the government accept the ALRC's recommendation to legislate a cause of action for serious invasion of privacy. 




Government Response 



Noted. In July 2011, following publication of the Committee's report, the Government announced that it will bring forward consideration of those Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) Report 108, For Your Information: Australian Privacy Law and Practice, recommendations which relate to a statutory cause of action for serious invasion of privacy (chapter 74 of the ALRC Report). In September 2011, the Minister for Privacy and Freedom of Information Policy, the Hon Brendan O'Connor, MP, released an issues paper as part of a community consultation to inform the Government's consideration of whether a cause of action should be legislated and, if so, how the elements of such a cause of action should be structured. The paper considers the ALRC's recommendations, relevant recommendations made by the New South Wales and Victorian law reform commissions, the current policy context and the legal position in Australian and other jurisdictions. 


The Government will consider submissions received as part of the consultation process before determining whether to legislate for a Commonwealth cause of action and, if so, how legislation for such a cause of action should be drafted. 


The Government will take the Committee's Recommendation 8 into account in making this determination. 




Recommendation 9 



4.74 The committee recommends that before pursuing any mandatory data retention proposal, the government must: 


undertake an extensive analysis of the costs, benefits and risks of such a scheme; 


justify the collection and retention of personal data by demonstrating the necessity of that data to law enforcement activities; 


quantify and justify the expense to Internet Service Providers of data collection and storage by demonstrating the utility of the data retained to law enforcement; 


assure Australians that data retained under any such scheme will be subject to appropriate accountability and monitoring mechanisms, and will be stored securely; and 


consult with a range of stakeholders. 




Government Response 



Agreed in principle. .The Government is committed to an open, transparent and consultative approach and acknowledges the public's interest in these issues. 


The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is considering a range of measures that will allow law enforcement and intelligence agencies to meet the challenges of rapidly changing technology and the global security environment – including data retention.


The Government has not made a decision about whether or not Australia should have a data retention regime and the Government will consider the Committee's views before making any decisions.


Any proposal must strike an appropriate balance between community expectations regarding individual privacy and the investigation and prosecution of unlawful behaviour, as well as the provision of competitive commercial telecommunications services.




Government Response to Recommendations by the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Immigration Detention Network.





November 2012







Preamble




The Australian Government welcomes the opportunity to respond to the report of the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Immigration Detention Network. The report was presented on 30 March 2012.


The Government has accepted (fully, in principle or partially) 26 of the 31 majority report recommendations made by the Committee. The Australian Government has progressed many of the recommendations. These include:


the development of new infrastructure and improved security at immigration detention facilities, as well as strengthened contract management and improved quality and availability of training for staff. These measures were outlined in detail in the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship's report to parliament on 20 September 2012 on the implementation of the Hawke Williams Review. 


the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, in concert with its Detention Service Provider and Detention Health Service Provider, has reviewed psychological support programs in detention facilities, seeing a significant decrease in the incidents of attempted and actual self-harm in immigration detention facilities. 


the Attorney General has also recently announced the appointment of an independent reviewer to conduct primary and periodic reviews of adverse security assessments for those persons found to be owed protection but facing prolonged immigration detention due to visa ineligibility.


Since the release of the Committee's report a number of significant policy and legislative reforms related to Irregular Maritime Arrivals (IMAs) have taken place. On 28 June 2012, the Prime Minister announced the establishment of an independent expert panel to examine approaches to deterring asylum seekers from embarking on dangerous boat journeys to Australia. The Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers was led by Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston AC AFC (Ret'd), who was joined by Paris Aristotle AM and Professor Michael L'Estrange AO. 


The Expert Panel made 22 recommendations, including measures to implement regional processing to safeguard Australian borders, avert loss of life at sea and offer consistency in affording protection to those in need. The Government endorsed, in principle, all 22 recommendations of the Expert Panel's report. 


The Australian Government believes in strong policies and decisive action to prevent loss of life through dangerous irregular maritime passages and ensuring there is no advantage for those who seek to arrive in Australia by such means. The Government has simultaneously increased the opportunities for offshore resettlement in Australia by increasing the Humanitarian Program to a total of 20,000 places each year, making Australia the second highest humanitarian intake country in the world.


The Joint Select Committee on Australia's Immigration Detention Network conducted its inquiry and reported prior to these significant policy changes. As such, references to IMAs contained within the Committee's report, its recommendations and the Government's response pertain to IMAs who arrived in Australia prior to 13 August 2012. 


The Government is grateful for the work the Committee has undertaken in respect to this important issue and for all those who contributed with their submissions and evidence to the Committee.


The Government's response to the recommendations made by the Committee follows.

RESPONSE TO MAJORITY REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS





DIAC's contract with Serco





Recommendation 5





The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship appoint an independent expert to inquire into the appropriate qualifications for Serco Client Service Officers and make appropriate amendments to its contract with Serco.





Accepted 





The Government considers that appropriate training and qualification of the Detention Service Provider (Serco) staff is fundamental to the delivery of appropriate services to people in detention.





The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) and Serco are currently consulting about the ongoing roles and responsibilities of Serco Client Services Officers in the immigration detention network
. 
Once this consultation is finalised an independent expert will be appointed to inquire into the appropriate qualifications for Serco Client Service Officers. 




Recommendation 9





The Committee recommends that Serco develop and implement improved proactive procedures to support staff following critical incidents.





Accepted





The Government considers that appropriate staff support is fundamental to the efficient delivery of effective services to people in detention by the Detention Service Provider (Serco).





The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) has recommended that Serco develop and implement improved proactive procedures within its current Employee Assistance Program (EAP) to support staff following critical incidents.





Enhanced mental health awareness and mental health policy training (including Psychological Support Program) is also currently being delivered by DIAC and International Health and Medical Services across the detention network to Serco staff
. 
As of 1 September 2012 approximately 975 Serco staff had attended the training.





Provision of health services to people in detention 





Recommendation 6





The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship effectively contract manage Serco
'
s implementation of the Psychological Support Program Policy.





Accepted





See response to Recommendation 7 below.





Recommendation 7





The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship work with Serco and the Detention Health Advisory Group to reform the Keep Safe policy to ensure it is fully consistent with the Psychological Support Program Policy, as soon as possible.





Accepted





The Government has a comprehensive health framework and service delivery strategy for people in immigration detention
. 
The provision of health services, in particular mental health services, is subject to regular review and improvement.





The Psychological Support Program policy (PSP policy) for the prevention of self-harm in immigration detention was developed by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) in consultation with the Detention Health Advisory Group (DeHAG). 





DIAC, its Detention Service Provider (Serco), and Detention Health Service Provider, International Health and Medical Services, (IHMS) have aligned all policies and procedures related to the implementation of the PSP policy and Serco
'
s 
""
Keep Safe Procedure
""
 (Keep Safe). 





DIAC consulted DeHAG in revising the Serco Keep Safe policy and their feedback was incorporated
. 
The revised policies and procedures were rolled-out across the immigration detention network at the end of July 2012.

Health care services are provided by qualified health professionals and take into account the diverse and potentially complex health care needs of people in immigration detention.





The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) acknowledges that it is appropriate to provide 24 hour onsite medical staffing at certain non-metropolitan detention facilities
. 





At present the Detention Health Service Provider, International Health and Medical Services, (IHMS) provides onsite services 24 hours a day at Christmas Island, Curtin, Scherger, Wickham Point and Yongah Hill Immigration Detention Centres
. 





DIAC is considering, on a case by case basis, whether it is appropriate to provide 24 hour medical staffing at other non-metropolitan facilities
. 
Factors that are part of the consideration process include the availability and proximity of external medical services including hospitals.





Recommendation 15





The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship assess, on a case by case basis, the need for International Health and Medical Services staff to be rostered on a 24 hour a day basis at metropolitan detention facilities.





Accepted 





The Department of Immigration and Citizenship is assessing, on a case by case basis, the need for 24 hour a day medical staffing at metropolitan detention facilities
. 
Factors that are part of the consideration process include the availability and 
proximity of external medical services including hospitals.





Recommendation 16





The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship work with International Health and Medical Services to pilot regular mental health outreach services in detention facilities.





Accepted in Principle





Mental health care and support services for people in immigration detention are provided by general practitioners, mental health nurses, psychologists, counsellors and psychiatrists. This care is provided or co-ordinated by the Detention Health Services Provider, International Health and Medical Services (IHMS). 





Since the implementation of the Bridging visa program enabling Irregular Maritime Arrivals who meet identity, health, character and security requirements to live in the community while their claims for protection are being processed, the self-harm rates for the population in detention have significantly reduced.





The Department of Immigration and Citizenship will consult with its service providers about the feasibility of IHMS providing mental health outreach services in detention facilities once the review of Psychological Support Program policy is completed (see recommendation 7 for further details). 





Recommendation 17





The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship develop a transport capability to transfer detainees with non-acute injuries to remote hospitals.





Accepted





A number of Immigration Detention Facilities (IDFs) are located in remote communities.


The Government is committed to ensuring that health care is delivered to people in immigration detention in a manner that minimises the impact on local health resources.





The Detention Health Service Provider, International Health and Medical Services (IHMS), is contracted to provide a comprehensive range of health services to those in immigration 
detention. These services include primary and mental health services.





Local ambulance services are only used for critical injuries or as a last resort when no other transport resources are available
. 
IHMS is responsible for determining whether an injury or medical condition is critical or non-critical.





A range of regional-specific arrangements to address transport arrangements for clients in immigration detention are in place or are being negotiated; for example, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship is negotiating with the Northern Territory Government to provide additional resources to ambulance services, so that ambulance service provision to IDFs will have minimal impact on the local community
. 





Other strategies implemented or under consideration at various facilities across the network include the Detention Services Provider (Serco) having a dedicated vehicle for non-emergency hospital transports and the extension of IHMS clinic hours.





Reforms to the existing network





Recommendation 1





The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship continue to robustly contract manage Serco
'
s obligation to provide appropriate activities for detainees.





Accepted



The Government recognises the importance of providing a program of meaningful activities for clients in immigration detention. 


The Detention Service Provider (Serco) is contracted to develop, manage and deliver structured and unstructured programs and activities (Programs and Activities) designed to provide educational and recreational opportunities, as well as meaningful activities that enhance the mental health and wellbeing of individuals in immigration detention.


Clients in immigration detention have access to a wide range of services and activities including access to the internet, libraries, religious activities, sports facilities, excursions and educational classes.


Since the Serco contract was first executed, there has been significant change in the immigration detention environment including a significant increase in the number of irregular maritime arrivals as a proportion of the total population in immigration detention and a more diverse client composition that includes families, unaccompanied minors and a range of status resolution pathways. The range of types of accommodation and detention facilities across Australia has also increased.


The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) is working with Serco to improve the quality and appropriateness of Programs and Activities delivered in the current immigration detention environment.


At the beginning of 2012, Serco appointed a national senior manager focused on introducing more meaningful Programs and Activities. DIAC has also established a Programs and Activities Framework to provide further guidance to its service providers on the development of an enhanced Programs & Activities operating model.


The programs and activities delivered at each facility are monitored against contractual requirements on a monthly basis.




Recommendation 2





The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship consider other accommodation or recreation options for detainees when the amenity of a facility is compromised due to construction or maintenance projects.





Accepted 



The expansion of the immigration detention network during 2011 and 2012 has enabled more flexibility in the use of facilities and placement of clients across the network. 


The Department of Immigration and Citizenship works closely with contractors and service providers to manage the impacts of construction and maintenance work at immigration detention facilities where this temporarily reduces the amenity of a facility.


For example, the redevelopment of Villawood Immigration Detention Centre will be completed in stages. While the detention centre will remain operational during the redevelopment, the managing contractor has prepared a staging plan to support the security, amenity and safety of the centre for the life of the project.


In addition, the Detention Services Contract requires Serco to develop, manage and deliver both structured and 'unstructured' programs and activities, including 'supervised external excursions'.



When the amenity of a facility is compromised due to construction or maintenance projects, a flexible schedule that allows for a higher proportion of 'unstructured' activities and 'supervised external excursions' will be utilised.




Recommendation 12





The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship require Serco local managers to apply a consistent practice and procedure protocol to visits across the network, in accordance with the information provided on the department website.





Accepted





The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) is working with the Detention Service Provider (Serco) to apply consistent practice and procedure protocols to visits across the network.





DIAC has requested that Serco senior management issue reminders to local site managers regarding the importance of a consistent approach and strict adherence to visitor protocols, as outlined on DIAC
'
s website.





In addition, DIAC is undertaking an internal Quality Assurance Review of the process
. 
The objectives of the review include:



establishing whether procedures and practices in managing visits are efficient, effective and consistent across all immigration detention facilities


establishing whether DIAC's and Serco's procedural advice and training provide adequate support to staff managing visits processes 


improving service delivery.


The review is scheduled to be finalised by end of November 2012.




Recommendation 13





The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship continue to improve visitor facilities across the network.





Accepted



The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) has recently completed upgrades to the visitor areas of the Melbourne Immigration Transit Centre, Sydney Immigration Residential Housing facility and Villawood Immigration Detention Centre (VIDC). A new visitor area is currently being developed at the Curtin Immigration Detention Centre.


Visitor areas have been incorporated in the design of both Wickham Point and Yongah Hill. As part of the VIDC redevelopment, an indoor/outdoor visits area forms part of the works and will be completed in July 2013.


As acknowledged in the Committee's report, DIAC is working to improve visitor amenities at immigration detention facilities and has already implemented much of this work.




Children in detention





Recommendation 19





The Committee recommends that relevant legislation be amended to replace the Minister for Immigration as the legal guardian of unaccompanied minors in the immigration detention system.





Not Accepted



The Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act 1946 (IGOC Act) provides that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (the Minister) is the guardian of certain unaccompanied non-citizen minors who arrive in Australia with the intention of becoming permanent residents. This includes, but is not limited to, unaccompanied minors within the immigration detention system. 


The Minister's guardianship responsibilities are delegated to officers within state and territory child welfare agencies and/or certain Departmental officers.


As part of deliberations on addressing the perceived conflict of interest between the Minister's responsibilities as guardian under the IGOC Act and his other powers and duties under the Migration Act 1958, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) has engaged the services and expertise of a consultant who has extensive experience in the field of children's issues. DIAC is currently taking advice on options and proposals to use the IGOC Act in a more effective way to further the best interests of children within its scope. 


The government is committed to ensuring the needs of unaccompanied minors are met, and is focusing on reviewing and updating existing programs, policies and procedures that directly impact upon the wellbeing of these children. 


Key initiatives being progressed by DIAC to improve the day-to-day wellbeing and experience of minors include:


delivering on the government's commitment to moving unaccompanied minors not subject to the new legislative amendments for regional transfer arrangements into community-based accommodation as a matter of priority – as at COB 1 July 2012, the Minister had approved 4112 clients for residence determination including 1918 children (823 unaccompanied minors), since the announcement to expand the community detention program on 18 October 2010;


the development and implementation of the Refugee Youth Support Pilot, to test new models of settlement services for older unaccompanied minors that recognises their ability, in most cases, to quickly transition to independent living, with a view to implementing more tailored settlement service models for unaccompanied minors within the next 12 months;


the development of a more consistent national approach to the care of unaccompanied minors who have been granted protection visas. This is a joint initiative with the Community and Disability Services Ministers' Advisory Council. A sub-committee of this advisory council has been created to facilitate discussion specifically on guardianship issues, and work towards improved national consistency of guardianship policies and procedures for unaccompanied minors. Membership includes representation from each state and territory child welfare agency, DIAC and the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services, and Indigenous Affairs;


amendments to the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Regulations 2001 to strengthen day-to-day care arrangements by custodians;


the review and update of various policy and procedure manuals and training materials, including the Community Detention Operational Framework, to ensure clear and appropriate guidance on guardianship issues; and


the development of a revised framework on programs and activities for immigration detention facilities which would enhance health and wellbeing of minors. The Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act 1946 (IGOC Act) provides that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship is the guardian of certain unaccompanied non-citizen minors who arrive in Australia with the intention of becoming permanent residents; this includes unaccompanied minors within the immigration detention system. 




Recommendation 20





The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship develop and implement a uniform code for child protection for all children seeking asylum across the immigration system.





Accepted in Principle



The Australian Government recognises that children are a vulnerable group and has policies, procedures and programs in place to address this.


The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) requires that its employees and service providers immediately refer any suspicion or allegation relating to child welfare covered by mandatory reporting laws to the relevant state or territory welfare authority. 


There is currently no single national framework setting out the requirements for working with children checks or police checks, as each state and territory has their own requirements and procedures. However, as part of the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children, the Commonwealth and states and territories are working towards enhancing national consistency in working with children checks. DIAC delivers services to clients across Australia and it is desirable to have a nationally consistent approach to screening of DIAC personnel. To this end, and in anticipation of more uniform working with children screening processes across Australia, DIAC is currently developing a policy requiring appropriate nationally consistent checks for all DIAC personnel who work with children in vulnerable circumstances.


The Privacy Act 1988 governs DIAC's ability to provide government agencies with personal information to facilitate a child's care and protection outside of mandatory reporting laws. In some instances, state law binds the Commonwealth. This allows for the lawful disclosure of personal information to a state or territory child protection agency on a case by case basis, however, this is not consistent across all states and territories. 


To broaden the circumstances in which we can lawfully share relevant public information with state and territory child protection agencies, DIAC is developing a Public Interest Determination proposal for consideration by the Information Commissioner. If agreed to, DIAC could disclose information to certain state and territory governments to facilitate a child's care and protection in certain circumstances, such as if there is a threat to their life, health or welfare.


DIAC is currently exploring the best way to facilitate the sharing of this information in the event that the Public Interest Determination is agreed by the Information Commissioner. Options may include:


becoming a party to the Information Sharing Protocol between the Commonwealth and the eight State and Territory Child Protection Agencies, or 


signing protocols with each State and Territory Child Protection Agency.




Recommendation 21





The Committee further recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship adopt Memoranda of Understanding with children
'
s commissions or commissioners in all states and territories as soon as possible.





Accepted in Principle



As state and territory child welfare agencies are responsible for investigating concerns about child welfare, it would be more appropriate for protocols to be established with those agencies rather than with children's commissioners. This approach is consistent with the advice provided to the JSC by the Australian Children's Commissioners and Guardians.


The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) is currently exploring ways to improve its ability to work more cooperatively with state and territory child protection agencies, outside mandatory reporting requirements.


The Privacy Act 1988 governs DIAC's ability to provide government agencies with personal information to facilitate a child's care and protection outside of mandatory reporting laws. In some instances, state law does bind the Commonwealth, allowing for the lawful disclosure of personal information to a state or territory child protection agency on a case by case basis, however, this is not consistent across all states and territories.


To broaden the circumstances in which we can lawfully share relevant information with state and territory child protection agencies, DIAC is developing a Public Interest Determination proposal for consideration by the Information Commissioner which, if agreed, would enable DIAC to disclose information to state and territory child welfare agencies to facilitate a child's care and protection in certain circumstances, such as if there is a threat to their life, health or welfare.


DIAC is currently exploring the most effective mechanism to outline agreed protocols with state and territory governments on the sharing of information for child protection matters, in the event that the Public Interest Determination is agreed by the Information Commissioner. DIAC is consulting with states and territories on this issue as part of the sub-committee on unaccompanied humanitarian minors established under the Community and Disability Services Ministers' Advisory Council. 


Possible options under consideration include:


Becoming a party to the Information Sharing Protocol between the Commonwealth and the eight State and Territory Child Protection Agencies, which has formally established processes to facilitate the sharing of information to assist child protection agencies where there are concerns about a child's welfare; and/or


Signing separate protocols with each State and Territory Child Protection Agency.




Reforms to detention policy





Recommendation 18



The Committee recommends that, as a matter of policy, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship accommodate detainees in metropolitan detention facilities wherever possible, in particular children and families, and those detainees with special needs or with complex medical conditions.




Accepted in principle



Decisions regarding placement of people across the immigration detention network are made by the Department of Immigration and Citizenships (DIAC) in consultation with the Detention Service Provider (Serco) and the Detention Health Service Provider (IHMS). 


Placement decisions take into account individual client circumstances, such as family composition, age and gender, immigration status, individual security risks and ongoing health issues, as well as broader operational requirements such as accommodation availability and the security and good order of the facility.


While recent expansion of the immigration detention network has resulted in an increase in accommodation options in metropolitan locations, at this time, there is insufficient accommodation across these sites to enable all clients to be located at a metropolitan facility.


Regardless of where a client is placed within the network, all people have access to a broad range of health, support and services.


The immigration detention network will continue to be used in a flexible way to manage changes in the client composition. DIAC has designated some sites to assist with the management of clients that have particular care needs, such as children and people who require ongoing access to specialist health care or have physical disabilities. 




Recommendation 22



The Committee recommends that the Australian Government take further steps to adhere to its commitment of only detaining asylum seekers as a last resort and for the shortest practicable time, and subject to an assessment of non-compliance and risk factors, as enunciated by the New Directions policy.




Accepted



Government policy is that all unauthorised arrivals are subject to mandatory detention for the management of any health, identity or security risks to the community. This is in contrast to those who arrive in Australia lawfully and have been assessed during the visa application process in relation to matters such as identity, security, bona fides and health. 


Ongoing Department of Immigration and Citizenship, and Commonwealth Ombudsman reviews consider the appropriateness of a person's detention, their detention arrangements and other matters relevant to their ongoing detention and case resolution.


Significant reforms in the use of community placement options for irregular maritime arrivals (IMAs) whose immigration status has not been resolved have been introduced. This includes the expanded use of community detention announced jointly by the Prime Minister and Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (the Minister) in October 2010 and expanded use of Bridging E visas announced by the Minister in November 2011. This is to progressively allow people who satisfy health, identity and security requirements to be considered on a case by case basis for release from detention while their protection claims are assessed. 




Recommendation 23



The Committee further recommends that asylum seekers who pass initial identity, health, character and security checks be immediately granted a bridging visa or moved to community detention while a determination of their refugee status is completed, and that all reasonable steps be taken to limit detention to a maximum of 90 days.




Partially Accepted



To support the integrity of Australia's immigration program, all unauthorised arrivals will be subject to mandatory detention for the management of any health, identity or security risks to the community.


The Government is committed to minimising the length of time a person is subject to immigration detention. The period of time a person is detained is dependent on assessment of risk factors and varies according to individual circumstances. Immigration detention is subject to regular review but is not time limited.


Significant reforms in the use of community placement options for irregular maritime arrivals (IMAs) whose immigration status has not been resolved have been introduced. This includes the expanded use of community detention announced jointly by the Prime Minister and Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in October 2010 and expanded use of Bridging E visas announced by the Minister in November 2011. This is to progressively allow people who satisfy health, identity and security requirements to be considered on a case by case basis for release from detention while their protection claims are assessed.


Expanded community-based detention arrangements (formally known as residence determination) for IMAs has also enabled significant numbers of unaccompanied minors and vulnerable family groups to be relocated from immigration detention facilities to community-based accommodation.


The Department of Immigration and Citizenship is continuing to work on moving significant numbers of children and vulnerable family groups out of immigration detention facilities and into community-based accommodation.


The Government has not prescribed timeframes for the transfer of IMAs to community-based accommodation as placement is at the discretion of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, and will only occur once a client has satisfied health, identity and security requirements. However, the Government is committed to moving children into the community as soon as possible.



IMAs who are not eligible for community placement because they present risks to the community in terms of identity, security or character concerns will remain in facility-based detention.




Recommendation 24



The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship be required to publish on a quarterly basis the reasons for the continued detention of any person detained for more than 90 days, without compromising the privacy of the individuals. 




Not Accepted



The Immigration Detention Statistics Summary, published by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) on a monthly basis, provides a breakdown of the length of time people are held in immigration detention facilities.


Reasons why people are required to remain in immigration detention beyond 90 days vary depending on a wide range of individual circumstances. For privacy reasons it would be inappropriate to publish this information. 


Detention that is indefinite or otherwise arbitrary is not acceptable and the length and conditions of detention, including the type of accommodation and services provided, are subject to regular review, including by the Commonwealth Ombudsman.




Recommendation 29



The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship consider publishing criteria for determining whether asylum seekers are placed in community detention or on bridging visas.




Not Accepted



Under the Migration Act 1958 (the Act) the only powers that can be used to allow an Irregular Maritime Arrival (IMA) to live in the community (residence determination) or to grant an IMA a Bridging visa are non-compellable powers that can only be exercised by the Minister of Immigration and Citizenship (the Minister) personally, if the Minister thinks it is in the public interest to do so. As such, there are no set criteria as it is for the Minister to decide what is in the public interest.


The Department of Immigration and Citizenship's (DIAC) case managers recommend suitable placement options for clients in immigration detention on a case by case basis. These are referred to the Minister for his consideration, however the Minister is not bound to accept these referrals. 




Recommendation 30



The Committee recommends that the Australian Government and the


Department of Immigration and Citizenship seek briefing on control orders in use by the criminal justice system and explore the practicalities of employing similar measures for refugees and asylum seekers who are in indefinite detention or cannot be repatriated.




Accepted in principle



Where persons found to be owed protections are not eligible for a visa due to an adverse security assessment, the Government will continue to explore the possibility of third country resettlement for the individual.


The Government has been briefed on the control order regime under the Criminal Code Act 1995.


Control orders are only available where a person has trained with a terrorist organisation listed under the Criminal Code or where a control order would substantially assist in preventing a terrorist act. The conditions attached to the control order must each be necessary to protect the community from a terrorist act. These are high legal thresholds, and it is not expected that Criminal Code control orders would be readily available.


The Government is responsible for the protection of national security, and any options that might involve release of persons with adverse security assessments into the community raise complex issues that would need to be carefully considered.




Reforms to processing of protection claims and security assessments





Recommendation 25



The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship consider revising and enhancing its system of quality control to oversee those Refugee Status and Assessment and Independent Merits Review processes still underway.




Accepted



The Government is committed to ensuring rigorous decision making for refugee status determinations so that sound, defensible decisions are made in accordance with relevant law, Australia's international obligations and government policy.


As of 24 March 2012 all primary refugee processing occurs through a single onshore Protection visa (PV) process. This process applies to Irregular Maritime Arrivals (IMAs) arriving on or after 24 March 2012 and before 13 August 2012, and to all those IMAs who had not had a primary interview before 24 March 2012. 


The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) has had in place a formal Quality Assurance (QA) framework for primary refugee decision making since September 2010. The purpose of this framework is to identify opportunities to improve the quality of primary refugee status decision making, based on the findings from a methodical and structured arm's length review of finalised decisions. 


This framework has been used to assess the quality of decisions within the Refugee Status Assessment (RSA) and Protection Obligations Evaluation (POE) processes, and for the current single onshore PV process. There are no longer any RSA processes underway.


Between September 2010 and December 2011, six QA reviews were undertaken. This includes two RSA QA reviews, one POE QA review and three PV QA reviews.


These reviews assessed the consideration of the key components in determining refugee status, including:


the use of country of origin information to support findings


the identification of the correct Convention ground/s


the correct consideration of the key components within the Refugee Convention, such as 'persecution' and 'well-founded fear'


the assessment of credibility. 


Findings from these reviews have indicated steady improvements across most of the quality measures. They have also provided an evidence base for continued investment in remedial action, including targeted training, strengthened supervisor arrangements and strengthened procedures.


DIAC will continue to refine and strengthen its QA framework and its supporting tools to ensure that QA and QC findings are accurate and to enable continuous improvement.




Recommendation 26





The Committee recommends that the Australian Government move to place all asylum seekers who are found to be refugees, and who do not trigger any concerns with the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation following initial security checks, and subject to an assessment of


non-compliance and risk factors, into community detention while any necessary in-depth security assessments are conducted.





Partially Accepted



The Government has not prescribed timeframes for the transfer of IMAs to community-based accommodation as placement is at the discretion of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, and will only occur once a client has satisfied health, identity and security requirements.


The period of time a person is detained is dependent on assessment of risk factors and varies according to individual circumstances. IMAs who are not eligible for community placement because they present risks to the community in terms of identity, security or character concerns will remain in facility-based detention.




Recommendation 27





The Committee recommends that the Australian Government and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation establish and implement periodic, internal reviews of adverse Australian Security Intelligence Organisation refugee security assessments commencing as soon as possible.





Accepted



The Government has announced that it will establish a mechanism for periodic and primary review of adverse security assessments furnished to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship in relation to all persons found to be owed protection who remain in prolonged immigration detention. The Independent Reviewer of Adverse Security Assessments will provide regular 12 month periodic review of adverse security assessments for people owed protection who remain in immigration detention.


The Government notes that periodic review of Australia Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) security assessments would, ordinarily, be an unusual requirement. A security assessment is ASIO's security related advice to a Commonwealth Agency on an individual at the time it is furnished. The security advice can include a recommendation that the Agency take or refrain from taking specific prescribed administration action on security grounds (for example, in relation to the grant of a protection visa). It is open to ASIO to furnish a further security assessment where security-related changes in the person's circumstances are assessed by ASIO to support the provision of further security advice. It would not ordinarily be appropriate to periodically review security assessments (being advice given at a particular time). However, in circumstances where the practical outcome of an adverse security assessment is prolonged immigration detention (due to visa ineligibility), periodic review will provide a basis for the regular review of the security grounds underpinning detention.


Other factors that have a bearing on the person's ongoing detention will also be kept under review.


This includes the circumstances that form the basis of the protection obligations and options for third country re-settlement.




Recommendation 28





The Committee recommends that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act be amended to allow the Security Appeals Division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to review the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation security assessments of refugees and asylum seekers.





Not Accepted



The Government agrees with establishing a review mechanism for persons found to be owed protection who receive adverse security assessments, but rather than extending the Administrative Appeal Tribunal's jurisdiction, the Government has established an alternative review mechanism. The Government has appointed an independent reviewer to conduct efficient and cost effective reviews of adverse security assessments furnished to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship in relation to all persons found to be owed protection who remain in prolonged immigration detention. Implementation of Hawke–Williams Recommendations




Recommendation 3





The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship conduct robust auditing of Serco staffing ratios and training, in line with the recommendations in the Comcare report and the Hawke-Williams review.





Accepted



The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) ensures that the performance of the Detention Service Provider (Serco) is rigorously monitored. Monthly performance reviews are conducted and Serco is subject to penalties or sanctions where it does not meet the standards set out in the Detention Services Contract.




Staffing



Serco staff ratios for immigration detention centres and other facilities are not mandated. However, the Detention Services Contract requires that Serco ensures that personnel levels at facilities are adequate to deliver the required services.


DIAC and Serco work together to plan and manage staff capability, consistent with changes to client and centre risk profiles and service delivery demands. 




Training



Serco must ensure that all its personnel are trained and qualified in accordance with the Detention Services Contract and related state and territory law.


Serco is required to maintain a national training database with records of training undertaken by its staff. Using this information as a basis, Serco provides quarterly reports to DIAC and retains, at each immigration detention site, details of training undertaken by rostered staff. Further work is underway to enhance record keeping in this area.


Serco has advised that a complete audit of qualifications has been undertaken, and it is improving its performance in this area. DIAC commenced a review of qualification, certification and storage of Serco staff records in May 2012.




Recommendation 4




The Committee reiterates the recommendation made by the Commonwealth Ombudsman that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, conduct a review of the quality and management of incident reporting across immigration detention network, and also assess Serco
'
s capacity to monitor its own compliance with the reporting guidelines.




Accepted




The Department of Immigration and Citizenship completed a review of the quality, accuracy and timeliness of incident reporting and post-incident reviews, in relation to the Detention Service Provider (Serco's) contractual obligations, at the end of June 2012.




Recommendation 11





Consistent with the findings of the Hawke-Williams review, the Committee recommends that the government finalise a security protocol between Serco, the Australian Federal Police and local police in each state and territory.





Accepted



On behalf of the Government, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) is negotiating a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and state and territory law enforcement agencies for the provision of policing services to immigration detention facilities (IDFs).


The MoU formalises arrangements currently in place and also enables state and territory law enforcement agencies to build adequate capability and capacity to respond to incidents at IDFs without impacting on the provision of policing services to the local community.


Individual state and territory specific annexures will sit under the MoU. These annexures enable the jurisdictions in a position to sign onto the agreement, in advance of others, to do so. It also allows the agreements to be tailored to the specific requirements of each jurisdiction.


The Detention Service Provider (Serco) is not a party to the MoU. However, its roles and responsibilities when responding to an incident are clearly articulated within an Implementation Protocol which is attached to the MoU. Serco has been closely consulted on this protocol. 




Recommendation 31





The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship continue to work towards implementing all of the recommendations made by the Hawke-Williams review, and that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship report to the Parliament no later than 20 September 2012 on progress in implementing the review recommendations.





Accepted



The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) has worked to implement the recommendations made by the Independent Review into the Incidents at the Christmas Island and Villawood Immigration Detention Centres as a matter of priority. The majority of the recommendations have been implemented and, in many instances, DIAC has gone beyond its stated commitments in order to comprehensively address the broader issues raised by the Review and to facilitate improvements across the detention network.


The implementation of these measures has resulted in significant improvements in the management of clients, infrastructure and service providers in the immigration detention network. DIAC has developed new infrastructure and enhanced security at existing facilities, significantly developed its critical incident management response capabilities, improved the quality and availability of training to staff, strengthened contract management and put in place broader incident prevention strategies.



The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship reported to the Parliament on the progress made implementing the Review recommendations on 20 September 2012.




Coalition Members and Senators Dissenting Report Recommendations





Coalition Recommendation 1





Restore the Coalition
'
s proven border protection regime Coalition Members and Senators recommend that the Government restore the proven measures of the Howard Government, abolished by the Rudd and Gillard Governments, to once again deter illegal boat arrivals to Australia, including, but not restricted to the following measures:





Restoration of the Temporary Protection Visa policy for IMAs 





Re-establishment of offshore processing on Nauru for all new IMAs by reopening the taxpayer funded processing centre on Nauru; and





Restoration of the policy to return boats seeking to illegally enter Australian waters, where it is safe to do so.





Not Accepted





Following the parliamentary impasse on the 
Migration Legislation Amendment (The Bali Process)


Bill 2012
, the Prime Minister announced on 28 June 2012, the establishment of an independent expert panel to examine approaches to deterring asylum seekers from embarking on dangerous boat journeys to Australia. The Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers was led by Air Chief Marshal


Angus Houston AC AFC (Ret
'
d), who was joined by Paris Aristotle AM and Professor Michael L
'
Estrange AO. 





The Expert Panel made 22 recommendations, including that a number of principles should shape Australian policy making on asylum issues
. 
The key principle is the implementation of a strategic, comprehensive and integrated policy approach that establishes short, medium, and long-term priorities for managing asylum and mixed migration flows across the region. The Expert Panel also clearly articulated that there are no quick or simple solutions to the policy dilemmas surrounding asylum issues
. 





The Australian Government endorsed, in principle, all 22 recommendations of the Expert Panel
'
s report.





In accordance with recommendation 7 of the Expert Panel
'
s report, the Government introduced legislation to support the transfer of people to regional processing centres, which received Royal Assent on 17 August 2012. The Government is now working with the governments of Nauru and Papua New Guinea to establish regional processing centres in those countries (in line with recommendations 8 and 9 of the Expert Panel
'
s report).





The Expert Panel also recommended that the Government 
""
continue to develop its vitally important cooperation with Malaysia on asylum issues
""
 and that the Malaysia Arrangement should 
""
be built on further, rather than being discarded or neglected
""
. Accordingly, the Government remains committed to the Malaysia Arrangement as it provides a genuinely effective approach to deterring people from taking dangerous boat journeys, while also providing durable solutions to genuine refugees who have been in Malaysia for many years
. 





The Expert Panel noted that it is currently not possible to effectively, lawfully or safely turn back irregular vessels carrying asylum seekers to Australia. The Panel
'
s report also noted that public statements by a number of senior Indonesian Government officials indicate that Indonesia
'
s reaction to a turn
-
back policy is likely to be negative. The Government will not turn back boats on the high seas at this time as it is neither safe nor viable. 




The Expert Panel did not recommend reintroducing Temporary Protection Visas. 





Coalition Recommendation 2





Coalition Members and Senators recommend that the Australian Government finalise the memorandum of understanding between DIAC, the AFP and state/territory police forces and reach a binding agreement that clearly stipulates who is responsible for policing and responding to incidents at Australian Immigration Detention Centres.





Accepted



On behalf of the Government, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship is negotiating a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and state and territory law enforcement agencies for the provision of policing services to immigration detention facilities.


See the response to recommendation 11 for further details.


Coalition Recommendation 3




Coalition Members and Senators recommend that the AFP and State/Territory police are funded adequately in order to carry out their regular operational policing responsibilities along with policing the immigration detention centres and responding to incidents.





Accepted





The Department of Immigration and Citizenship is working closely with the Australian Federal Police and individual state and territory law enforcement agencies to put in place Memorandums of Understanding with regard to the provision of policing services to immigration detention facilities
. 
As part of these agreements, provisions have been (where signed) or will be (negotiations are ongoing) included to ensure state and territory enforcement agencies are appropriately funded so the delivery of such services does not impact on regular police operations.



See the response to recommendation 11 for further details.




Coalition Recommendation 4





Coalition Members and Senators recommend that the Australian Government ensure that security infrastructure, including CCTV cameras, security fences and other essential security elements be operational, ready and be of a high standard of functionality and that DIAC, with assistance from Serco, is to undertake a review of infrastructure (including security infrastructure) across the broader immigration detention network.





Accepted



The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) and the Detention Service Provider (Serco) continually monitor the security infrastructure of immigration detention centres across the network to ensure that infrastructure is functional and fit for purpose. 


DIAC ensures that appropriate security is in place and consistent with the security risk of the clients accommodated at the facility. Physical infrastructure upgrades and security improvement works are being implemented at a number of sites across the immigration detention network.


In addition to modifications to the physical security infrastructure, a number of changes have been made to enhance security through operational arrangements across the detention network. This includes more regular checks of the security infrastructure and closer monitoring of client risks identified through internal intelligence activities.




Coalition Recommendation 5





Coalition Members and Senators recommend that the Australian Government seek advice on amendments and addition to the regulations under the Migration Act to clarify the responsibilities and powers of persons who operate detention centres around the limits on their obligations and powers in relation to use of force, to ensure the good order and control of immigration detention facilities.





Accepted



The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship is seeking advice to determine whether there is a need to amend the Migration Act 1958 and regulations to allow the use of reasonable force to maintain the good order of an immigration detention facility where reasonable belief exists regarding a direct threat to the physical safety of an officer, a detainee or a third party.


The Department of Immigration and Citizenship is also well advanced in the negotiation of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Australian Federal Police and state and territory law enforcement agencies for the provision of policing services to immigration detention facilities.


The Detention Service Provider (Serco) is not a party to the MoU. However, its roles and responsibilities when responding to an incident are clearly articulated within an Implementation Protocol attached to the MoU.




Coalition Recommendation 6





Coalition Members and Senators recommend that a minimum quota of 11,000 places of the 13,750 permanent places for the Refugee and Humanitarian program be reserved for offshore 
applicants, in parallel with the introduction of Temporary Protection Visas for all IMAs.





Not Accepted



On 23 August 2012, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship announced that in response to the recommendations of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers, that the Humanitarian Program would be increased immediately to 20 000 places. The expanded Program will continue to provide places for both people resettled from overseas and those already in Australia who have sought protection. 


The expanded Program provides 6250 additional places (a 45 per cent increase) and is the biggest boost to Australia's refugee intake in 30 years.




Recommendations by Senator Hanson-Young for the Australian Greens





Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 1





Migration Act to be amended to ensure that a time limit on detention, preferably 30 days, is adhered to, over which time initial health, identity and security checks can be conducted to ensure there is no risk to the community.





Not Accepted



The Government is committed to treating asylum seekers and refugees humanely and fairly while managing risks to the Australian community. Immigration detention of all unauthorised people arriving at the border is mandatory for the purpose of determining any health, identity or security risk they may present.


While the Government expects the Department of Immigration and Citizenship to resolve all matters associated with determining a person's immigration status as quickly as possible, it does not support the introduction of a mandatory timeframe for the release of individuals from immigration detention.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 2





Detention beyond the legislated time limit must be justified before a court and subject to periodic review by the court from that point, with the onus on the Department of Immigration to make the application and show why extended detention is necessary for that individual.





Not Accepted



The Government's intention is that immigration detention be for the shortest period possible while appropriately managing risks to the Australian community.


Ongoing reviews by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the Commonwealth Ombudsman consider the appropriateness of the person's detention, their detention arrangement and other matters relevant to their ongoing detention and case resolution.


A person in immigration detention may seek merits or judicial review of most visa decisions that result in them becoming unlawful and liable for detention. They may also seek judicial review on the lawfulness of their detention with the Federal or High Courts.


Given the availability of merits and judicial review as outlined above and the broader use of residence determination (community detention) arrangements and Bridging visas transitioning irregular maritime arrivals into the community, the Government does not support periodic review of immigration detention by the courts.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 3





Remote and isolated detention centres should be decommissioned.





Not Accepted



The expansion of the immigration detention network in 2011 and 2012 has provided the Government with a range of flexible options to accommodate people required to be taken into immigration detention to manage community or program risks. The Government continually monitors immigration detention accommodation requirements and makes adjustments as required. 




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 4





The best interests of the child should be enshrined in the Migration Act as the paramount in decisions regarding the accommodation of all children.





Not Accepted



Consistent with Australia's obligations as a party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989, the best interests of the child are a primary consideration in the Government's engagement with children. This includes consideration of the child's individual circumstances and the welfare of the child, as well as other factors, such as maintaining family unity and access to education. As such, the Government does not regard the recommended changes to the Migration Act 1958 (Migration Act) as necessary.


In accordance with section 4AA of the Migration Act, and the Key Immigration Detention Values announced by the Government in July 2008, children are not held in immigration detention centres. Outside of community-based detention arrangements, minors are accommodated at low-security sites, such as immigration transit accommodation and immigration residential housing, or other alternative places of detention, which includes commercial accommodation such as motels. 




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 5





Migration Act to be amended to remove any mandatory detention of children.





Not Accepted



The Government firmly believes that the best place children can be supported during immigration processing is in the community and high priority is given to moving unaccompanied minors, children and their families into community-based accommodation wherever possible.


There will, however, always be a period of time after their unauthorised arrival in Australia when children and their parents and carers will be detained while identity, health and security checks are undertaken. There will also be a small number of children who may not be able to be placed in the community due to particular risks associated with their parents or carers. Children, including unaccompanied minors, are accommodated in alternate places of immigration detention and not in immigration detention centres. Children and young people in immigration detention are processed as a matter of priority to resolve their immigration status as quickly as possible.


The Government considers that this measured approach strikes a balance between operating a migration program with integrity while protecting the welfare of children.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 6





Migration Act to be amended to place time limits on children and their families being accommodated in low security family appropriate facilities prior to being moved into the community.





Not Accepted



The transfer of unaccompanied minors and children with families from held immigration detention to community detention or a Bridging visa is a Government priority. 


Before a child or family can be transferred from a detention facility into the community, mandatory health, identity and security checks must be completed, suitable housing be sourced, and in the case of unaccompanied minors, appropriate carer arrangements must be put in place.


The Department of Immigration and Citizenship continues to transfer significant numbers of children and vulnerable family groups who arrived as Irregular Maritime Arrivals before 13 August 2012 out of immigration detention facilities and into community-based accommodation as soon as they have completed mandatory health, identity and security checks.


While the Government expects that eligible children will be transferred into a community option as quickly as possible, it does not support the introduction of a mandatory timeframe for the placement of children and their families in community-based accommodation.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 7





Children should not be subject to ASIO security checks beyond the standard security checks used at airports (i.e. checks against the Central Movement Alert List).





Not Accepted



The Government's responsibility is to ensure that Australia's security is not compromised. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) rarely conducts security assessments on minors, but this option must remain open where security concerns are identified. Where asylum seekers arrive without documentation it may be difficult to establish conclusively whether a person is a minor. It is also important to recognise that minors may occasionally be involved in activities of security concern and make provision for such situations.


ASIO has a range of policies and procedures in place to address the particular circumstance of dealing with minors, including additional authorisation and internal oversight. External oversight is maintained by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 8





All asylum seeker children of school age (early childhood, primary and secondary) must be given access to local schooling.





Not Accepted



The Government is committed to ensuring that children accommodated in immigration detention facilities and under community-based detention arrangements have access to education in line with community standards and relevant State and Territory laws. 


The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) arranges for children housed in alternate places of detention to have access to education facilities either through education services provided by its Detention Service Provider (Serco) or where agreed with a state or territory government education authority through public education in the local community. 


Where clients are placed into community detention, DIAC has arrangements in place to enrol children in local schools. Children in community detention arrangements who are four years of age (below compulsory school age) may participate in an early childhood education program. For those asylum-seeker children who are not in detention, schooling is a matter for the relevant State or Territory government.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 9





Children should only be housed in facilities where all service providers and officers who interact with them have obtained a Working with Children check.





Accepted



The Government requires the Detention Service Provider (Serco) to meet state and territory child protection laws including working with children checks and mandatory reporting requirements. Serco also works proactively with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) to maintain a child safe environment. 


DIAC ensures that child protection provisions for all external contracts are accountable through reporting and auditing mechanisms. As a minimum, all new contracts with service providers must include a clause that meets the child protection legislative requirements in the state or territory in which they operate. 


There is currently no single national framework setting out the requirements for working with children checks or police checks, as each state and territory has their own requirements and procedures. However, as part of the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children, the Commonwealth and states and territories are working towards enhancing national consistency in working with children checks. DIAC delivers services to clients across Australia and it is desirable to have a nationally consistent approach to screening of DIAC personnel. To this end, and in anticipation of more uniform working with children screening processes across Australia, DIAC is currently developing a policy requiring appropriate nationally consistent checks for all DIAC personnel who work with children in vulnerable circumstances.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 10





IAAAS funding to be expanded to cover independent psychological and psychiatric reports.





Not Accepted



The Immigration Advice and Application Assistance Scheme (IAAAS) provides publicly funded, free independent advice and assistance to asylum seekers, including Irregular Maritime Arrivals, for the processing of their refugee claims. 


Under the IAAAS Deed of Agreement, IAAAS providers receive funding based on the category of the service provided. IAAAS providers have the discretion to seek independent psychological and psychiatric reports if they determine this would assist the client's application. However, any costs associated with the provision of these reports must be absorbed within the existing funding. The Government does not support expanding the funding arrangements.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 11





Relevant legislation to be amended to ensure that detainees have access to a fair and independent review of a negative ASIO security assessments, with appropriate disclosure of the grounds of the adverse security findings regardless of whether judicial or merits review, and with flexible options for protecting national security on a case-by-case basis.





Partially Accepted



The Government agrees with establishing a review mechanism for persons found to be owed protection who receive adverse security assessments, but rather than extending the Administrative Appeal Tribunal's jurisdiction, the Government has established an alternative review mechanism. The Government has appointed an independent reviewer to conduct efficient and cost effective reviews of adverse security assessments furnished to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship in relation to all persons found to be owed protection who remain in prolonged immigration detention.


When an eligible person makes a request for independent review, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation will provide an unclassified written summary of reasons for the decision to issue an adverse security assessment to the Independent Reviewer on the basis that it will be provided to the eligible person. The reasons will include information that can be provided to the eligible person to the extent able without prejudicing the interests of security.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 12





Appointment of a special advocate to conduct reviews of negative ASIO assessments where there is concern maintaining confidentiality of sensitive material.





Partially Accepted



The Government agrees with establishing a review mechanism for persons found to be owed protection who receive adverse security assessments, and has appointed an independent reviewer to conduct efficient and cost effective reviews of adverse security assessments furnished to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship in relation to all persons found to be owed protection who remain in prolonged immigration detention. This mechanism will take into account the need to afford appropriate procedural fairness, while also protecting sensitive national security information, and applicants will be entitled to legal representation. The Government does not consider it necessary for special advocates to conduct the review of negative Australian Security Intelligence Organisation assessments.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 13





Legal assistance should be funded at all stages of resolution of people
'
s immigration status, including increased resources for Legal Aid Commissions and IAAAS agents for merits or judicial review.





Not Accepted



Under the National Partnership Agreement on Legal Assistance Services, migration, where assistance is not available from services funded by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, is a Commonwealth legal aid service priority. Eligibility criteria apply to grants of legal aid, and include merits and means tests. The Government continues to monitor the migration litigation workload. 




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 14





Where an interview is to be conducted between the Department of Immigration and a minor that will have ramifications on visa assessment, there must be a legal advocate present or an accredited Independent Third Person present.





Accepted



The Government already provides this type of support to minors through the Immigration Advice and Application Assistance Scheme (IAAAS) and the presence of independent observers.




Immigration Advice and Application Assistance Scheme



The IAAAS provides publicly funded, free independent advice and assistance to asylum seekers, including Irregular Maritime Arrivals (IMAs), for the processing of their refugee claims. 


IAAAS service providers are registered migration agents or officers of Legal Aid Commissions with experience in protection visa legislative, policy and procedural requirements. They are assigned to asylum seekers prior to the commencement of the assessment of their claims. 


Under the terms of the contractual arrangements between the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) and the IAAAS service providers, the service providers have a responsibility to help their clients with the completion and submission of visa or protection obligations determination applications. This includes accompanying their clients to departmental interviews, liaising with DIAC, providing advice on immigration matters, explaining outcomes of applications and providing information and advice on further options available in the event of a refusal decision. 


When IAAAS service providers are providing assistance to minors, DIAC has issued a general instruction that the service provider should act in the best interest of the child. 


IAAAS assistance is also available at the merits review stage, but is not available to those seeking judicial review or ministerial intervention. 


In the case of IMAs in immigration detention in remote locations, DIAC also funds travel for the IAAAS service provider to attend an initial meeting and interview with their clients soon after referral, and ensures appropriate interpreters are available to support all interactions between the IAAAS service provider and their client.




Legal Assistance for Judicial Review



While the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship does not personally provide legal assistance for judicial review to unaccompanied minors for whom he is guardian, they receive information to assist them to seek legal assistance, including accessing Legal Aid Services.




Independent observers



DIAC engages independent observers to attend formal interviews and, at DIAC's discretion, informal meetings and discussions between unaccompanied minors and DIAC and/or other agencies, where concern exists regarding the adult relative's understanding of processes and capability of acting in the best interest of the minor with regards to their physical and emotional wellbeing.


DIAC gives consideration to the ongoing presence of an independent observer for a person who has recently turned 18, particularly where there are concerns regarding the person's level of maturity or level of comprehension of the process. 


The role of the independent observer is to act in the best interest of a minor and ensure that DIAC's and other agencies' treatment of a minor during certain immigration processes is fair, appropriate and reasonable.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 15





People on community detention or bridging visas must be able to make use of public provision of health services and access public referral services.





Partially Accepted



Unlawful non-citizens in community detention (CD) have access to health services commensurate with the Australian community and those living in the community on a Bridging visa with the permission to work, have access to Medicare services.


The health needs of clients in CD are co-ordinated by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship's (DIAC) contracted health services provider, International Health and Medical Services (IHMS), through a network of community-based providers.


Health services in CD include:


IHMS cards to facilitate clients' access to IHMS-approved GPs, specialists and pharmacists in the community; and


access to a range of health services that includes GPs, specialists, allied professionals and pharmacists.


IMAs granted Bridging visas with permission to work have access to Medicare.


The government recognises that some people who are resolving their immigration status in the community while on a Bridging visa and have vulnerabilities that impede resolution of their status may require assistance to address those vulnerabilities. This assistance may be provided through the Community Assistance Support program or Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme. These programs facilitate access to basic medical services equivalent to those provided under Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 16





Families and unaccompanied minors who are placed on bridging visas should be automatically also placed on the Community Assistance Support program.





Not Accepted



The Department of Immigration and Citizenship's (DIAC) case management service assists clients who hold Bridging visas to understand their immigration position and work towards gaining a timely resolution of their immigration status. Case managers assess whether a client has support needs and are eligible for the Community Assistance Support (CAS) program, and will refer a client to CAS if necessary. 


The CAS program provides access to community-based services that provide health and wellbeing support. In the event that a family is placed in the community on a Bridging visa, their needs would be assessed by their case manager and a decision made as to whether they should be referred into CAS.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 17





All asylum seekers on bridging visas should be provided with Commonwealth certified photo identification.





Accepted



The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) has commenced work on the development of a secure ""Evidence of Immigration Status (EIS)"" card for all humanitarian entrants and protection visa applicants who are granted a Bridging visa. 


The EIS will standardise the documentation provided to these clients, strengthen the bond between the card and the card holder and prevent misuse through enhanced security features and use of biometric data. The cards will contain security features that are commensurate with standards articulated in the whole-of-government National Identity Security Strategy. 



The Secure Card Project is prioritised for implementation in April 2013.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 18





All people on bridging visas should have work rights.





Partially Accepted



A Bridging visa is granted to a person to allow them to remain in the community while they resolve their immigration status.


In many cases the appropriate resolution of status for a Bridging visa holder will be departure from Australia. In such circumstances, providing permission to work may encourage individuals to resist departure or encourage frivolous applications for substantive visas, even those which do not themselves confer the permission to work, in the expectation of delivering work rights while they await an outcome. Granting of work rights may also encourage people on substantive visas without work rights to overstay in the hope of being granted a Bridging visa with work rights.


Nonetheless, it is already possible for Bridging visa holders who have compelling reasons to be granted work rights. For example, the Prime Minister and Minister for Immigration and Citizenship jointly announced in November 2011, the expanded use of Bridging E visas with work rights for Irregular Maritime Arrivals.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2012-11-29,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (17:42):  I present two government responses to committee reports as listed on today’s Order of Business. In accordance with the usual practice, I seek leave to incorporate the documents in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The documents read as follows—





Australian Government Response





Senate Environment and Communications Reference Committee Report: The adequacy of protections for the privacy of Australians online





Recommendation 1 



2.31 The committee recommends that the government consider and respond to the recommendations in the Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre's report: Communications privacy complaints: In search of the right path, and recommendations from the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network arising from that report. 




Government Response 



Noted. The report raises a number of relevant issues, with comments on the issues set out below: - 




Communications privacy complaints: In search of the right path – Recommendations



(1) There must be a significant improvement in time taken to resolve complaints at the OPC. The have significant resources, skills and expertise in privacy protections, and they only receive a tiny fraction of complaints in the sector. The OPC should aim to resolve the majority of complaints within 30 days. 


The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) receives a very small proportion of complaints about telecommunications but those that they do receives are usually complex. They involve issues such as the listing of debts with credit reporting agencies. The nature of such complaints makes them difficult to resolve quickly. Given this complexity, the OAIC has a current benchmark for finalising investigations of 150 days on average. 


(2) There must be a significant improvement in the information provided to individuals about resolution times. Information should be consistent (across the website, annual reports and verbal advice). It should be frank – e.g. exact timing targets, or an exact average based on prior complaints. It is very poor practice to accept a complaint without warning the consumer that it may take 6 months to resolve, especially when other avenues for resolution are available.


The information should be consistent and based on average times and the OAIC will look to improve the information it currently provides to complainants. 


(3) All three complaint bodies (i.e. Australian Communications and Media Authority [ACMA], the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman [TIO] and the OAIC) should undertake research to assess the demographic profiles of their complaints, to gain better understanding of special needs such as language and disability access. This research will also identify whether some disadvantaged groups are not utilising the services of these complaints bodies, and this information could be used to design outreach and targeting programs. 


The TIO has advised that it has developed a disadvantaged and vulnerable communications strategy, which identifies some targeted activities to research the needs of, and raise awareness of the TIO among, vulnerable groups in the community. These include culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) consumers, consumers in rural and regional areas, people with disabilities, indigenous consumers and young people. 


The OAIC and the ACMA will look at the resource implications of undertaking such research. 


(4) There should be better coordination amongst the three complaints bodies, with the aim of reducing the adverse consequences for consumers of the current disconnection. A formal Memorandum of Understanding should be developed between the three complaint bodies. This agreement should include fair and transparent criteria for the management of complaints and for referrals between the three organisations. A process for sharing the identity of business parties to a complaint should be developed in order to enhance the recognition of systemic issues across the sector.


This recommendation is consistent with recommendation 73-8 from the Australian Law Reform Commission's (ALRC) Report 108 – For Your Information: Australian Privacy Law and Practices, which calls for the development of memoranda of understanding between the complaint handling bodies and clarity around the roles and responsibilities of each complaint handling organisation. 


The ACMA has advised that a memorandum of understanding (MoU) has already been established between the ACMA and the TIO. 


The OAIC has advised that it will explore developing a Memorandum of Understanding involving the three relevant complaints bodies. 


(5) Consumers should be provided with consistent information about where they should complain. This should include information on jurisdiction issues, but also on timelines and expected outcomes where these differ between the three complaints paths. It should be widely accessible and available to consumers contemplating or initiating complaints. 


This recommendation is consistent with recommendation 73-9 from the Australian Law Reform Commission's (ALRC) Report 108 – For Your Information: Australian Privacy Law and Practices, calling for the OAIC to publish its complaint handling policies, procedures and enforcement guidelines, including the roles and functions of the complaints handling bodies under their relevant legislation. 


The Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, (DBCDE) has reviewed the role of the TIO and has recommended that the TIO clarify its jurisdiction over emerging products and services and publish information to establish clear boundaries around the issues, including complaints, that are within or outside its jurisdiction (see http://www.dbcde.gov.au/consultation and submissions/TIO reforms). 


The OAIC's website offers a 'complaint checker' tool that assists potential complainants to identify the appropriate jurisdiction and to understand the complaint process and possible outcomes. The OAIC will consider whether the information provided to complainants can be enhanced to provide additional information, consistent with this recommendation. 


(6) Industry should be provided with consistent information about compliance. There should be no circumstances where the industry is receiving a message from one complaints body that everything is fine, while another complaints body is issuing warnings or enforcement action for non-compliance. Again this should be widely accessible and available for relevant industry personnel.


This could be one of the matters to be included in a MoU between the three bodies – see recommendations 4 and 5 above. 


(7) All three complaint bodies must ensure that they offer (and use) the full range of regulatory tools and remedies. These include:- 


1. Compensation for the individual;


2. An apology for the individual;


3. Prompt correction or removal of personal data;


4. A change to business practice at the individual company;


5. A change to broader industry practice for systemic issues;


6. Occasional naming of individual companies as a warning to inform other consumers, and a lesson for industry that reputation consequences may arise from poor complaint outcomes; and 


7. Occasional enforcement action in order to promote compliance.


In practice this recommendation will necessitate a change of approach at the OPC, so that they utilise their naming and enforcement powers, and a change of approach at the ACMA so that they offer greater individual remedies (such as compensation and apologies).


ACMA's recent Reconnecting the Customer inquiry and the DBCDE's review of the TIO may lead to regulatory change to improve industry behaviour and the end-user experience when seeking redress. 


Currently, the OAIC employs a range of regulatory tools in the conduct of complaint handling activities. The Commissioner is able to seek each of the remedial actions listed above. The OAIC regularly seeks remedies 1 to 6, including the naming of respondents in reports of 'own motion' investigations and in the OAIC's annual report. Under the Privacy Act 1988 (the Act) ""enforcement action"" would necessitate commencing action in the Federal Court to enforce a determination made under section 52 of the Act. The Commissioner also has a power to seek an injunction through the Federal Court to stop a person from engaging in conduct that would constitute a contravention of the Act.  


The ALRC recommended and the Government agreed that the OAIC be granted with additional and improved powers to protect consumers in relation to privacy. The Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012 includes amendments to strengthen the Information Commissioner's powers to conduct investigations, resolve complaints and promote compliance. These amendments will contribute to more effective and stronger protection of the right to privacy.




Recommendation 2 



3.30 The committee recommends that the Australian Privacy Commissioner's complaint-handling role under paragraph 27(1) (ab) of the Privacy Act be expanded to more effectively address complaints about the misuse of privacy consent forms in the online context.


3.31 The committee further recommends that the Office of the Privacy Commissioner examine the issue of consent in the online context and develop guidelines on the appropriate use of privacy consent forms for online services. 




Government Response



3.30 Noted. The ALRC recommended and the Government agreed that the OAIC be granted additional and improved powers to protect consumers in relation to privacy. The Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012 includes amendments to strengthen the Information Commissioner's powers to conduct investigations, resolve complaints and promote compliance. These amendments will contribute to more effective and stronger protection of the right to privacy. 


3.31 Agreed in principle. Implementation is a matter for the OAIC, taking account of available resources and priorities. 




Recommendation 3 



3.50 The committee recommends that the small business exemptions should be amended to ensure that small businesses which hold substantial quantities of personal information, or which transfer personal information offshore are subject to the requirements of the Privacy Act 1988. 


3.51 To achieve this end, the committee urges the Australian Privacy Commissioner to undertake a review of those categories of small business with significant personal data holdings, and to make recommendations to government about expanding the categories of small business operators prescribed in regulations as subject to the Privacy Act 1988. 


3.52 The committee further recommends that the second tranche of reforms to the Privacy Act 1988 amend the Act to provide that all Australian organisations which transfer personal information overseas, including small businesses, must ensure that the information will be protected in a manner at least equivalent to the protections provided under Australia's privacy framework. 




Government Responses



3.50 Noted. The Australian Law Reform Commission Report (ALRC) 108, For Your Information: Australian Privacy Law and Practice recommended (R39-1) that the Act be amended to remove the small business exemption. 


The Government will take the recommendation into account when it considering the ALRC's recommendation to remove the small business exemption. 


3.51 Noted. The Government will consider this recommendation in conjunction with its deliberations on recommendation 3.50 above. 


3.52 Noted. The Government will consider this recommendation in conjunction with its deliberations on recommendations 3.50 and 3.51 above. 


The Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012 creates the Australian Privacy Principles, a single set of privacy principles applying to both Commonwealth agencies and private sector organisations. Australian Privacy Principle (APP) 8 and new section 16C will provide a framework for the regulation of cross-border disclosures of personal information. Before a cross-border disclosure can occur, the draft APP 8 imposes minimum obligations on an organisation to take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances (for example, by imposing contractual obligations) to ensure that the overseas recipient does not breach the draft APPs. 


In addition, an organisation will remain accountable for the acts and practices of the overseas recipient, unless an exemption applies. 




Recommendation 4 



3.86 The Committee recommends that the OPC in consultation with web browser developers, ISPs and the advertising industry, should, in accordance with proposed amendments to the Privacy Act, develop and impose a code which includes a 'Do Not Track' model following consultation with stakeholders. 




Government Response 



Noted. As part of its stage one response to the ALRC recommendations, the Government announced that it supports the development of binding and mandatory codes. Schedule 3 of the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012 contains the new provisions on privacy codes. It will be a matter for the Commissioner to consider whether a code is necessary.




Recommendation 5 



3.96 The committee recommends that item 19(3) (g)(ii) of the exposure draft of amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 be amended to provide that an organisation has an Australian link if it collects information from Australia, thereby ensuring that information collected from Australia in the online context is protected by the Privacy Act 1988. 




Government Response 



Noted. The Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012 inserts the term 'Australian link' and lists additional connections with Australia which would be a sufficient link, see items 2-8 of Schedule 4 of the Bill. 




Recommendation 6 



3.109 The committee recommends that the government amend the Privacy Act 1988 to require all Australian organisations that transfer personal information offshore are fully accountable for protecting the privacy of that information. 


3.110 The committee further recommends that the government consider the enforceability of these provisions and, if necessary, strengthen the powers of the Australian Privacy Commissioner to enforce offshore data transfer provisions.  




Government Response 



Noted. See response to recommendation 3.52. 




Recommendation 7 



3.116 The committee recommends that the Australian government continue to work internationally, and particularly within our region, to develop strong privacy protections for Australians in the online context. 




Government Response 



Accepted. The Australian Government has been and will be continuing to work with appropriate international bodies including in particular regional bodies to further privacy protections. 


The Government actively participates in the work of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and Asian Pacific Economic Council (APEC) on international privacy issues. Australia has played a leading role in the development of the APEC Cross-Border Enforcement Arrangement (CPEA), which allows participating privacy regulators to share information and provide assistance in relation to privacy matters that have a cross-border aspect. The APEC CPEA commenced in July 2010 and the privacy regulators of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Hong Kong China, and the United States are currently participants. 


The OAIC continues to foster strong ties with other privacy authorities in the region via the Asia Pacific Privacy Authorities group. 




Recommendation 8 



3.122 The committee recommends that the government accept the ALRC's recommendation to legislate a cause of action for serious invasion of privacy. 




Government Response 



Noted. In July 2011, following publication of the Committee's report, the Government announced that it will bring forward consideration of those Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) Report 108, For Your Information: Australian Privacy Law and Practice, recommendations which relate to a statutory cause of action for serious invasion of privacy (chapter 74 of the ALRC Report). In September 2011, the Minister for Privacy and Freedom of Information Policy, the Hon Brendan O'Connor, MP, released an issues paper as part of a community consultation to inform the Government's consideration of whether a cause of action should be legislated and, if so, how the elements of such a cause of action should be structured. The paper considers the ALRC's recommendations, relevant recommendations made by the New South Wales and Victorian law reform commissions, the current policy context and the legal position in Australian and other jurisdictions. 


The Government will consider submissions received as part of the consultation process before determining whether to legislate for a Commonwealth cause of action and, if so, how legislation for such a cause of action should be drafted. 


The Government will take the Committee's Recommendation 8 into account in making this determination. 




Recommendation 9 



4.74 The committee recommends that before pursuing any mandatory data retention proposal, the government must: 


undertake an extensive analysis of the costs, benefits and risks of such a scheme; 


justify the collection and retention of personal data by demonstrating the necessity of that data to law enforcement activities; 


quantify and justify the expense to Internet Service Providers of data collection and storage by demonstrating the utility of the data retained to law enforcement; 


assure Australians that data retained under any such scheme will be subject to appropriate accountability and monitoring mechanisms, and will be stored securely; and 


consult with a range of stakeholders. 




Government Response 



Agreed in principle. .The Government is committed to an open, transparent and consultative approach and acknowledges the public's interest in these issues. 


The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is considering a range of measures that will allow law enforcement and intelligence agencies to meet the challenges of rapidly changing technology and the global security environment – including data retention.


The Government has not made a decision about whether or not Australia should have a data retention regime and the Government will consider the Committee's views before making any decisions.


Any proposal must strike an appropriate balance between community expectations regarding individual privacy and the investigation and prosecution of unlawful behaviour, as well as the provision of competitive commercial telecommunications services.




Government Response to Recommendations by the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Immigration Detention Network.





November 2012







Preamble




The Australian Government welcomes the opportunity to respond to the report of the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Immigration Detention Network. The report was presented on 30 March 2012.


The Government has accepted (fully, in principle or partially) 26 of the 31 majority report recommendations made by the Committee. The Australian Government has progressed many of the recommendations. These include:


the development of new infrastructure and improved security at immigration detention facilities, as well as strengthened contract management and improved quality and availability of training for staff. These measures were outlined in detail in the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship's report to parliament on 20 September 2012 on the implementation of the Hawke Williams Review. 


the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, in concert with its Detention Service Provider and Detention Health Service Provider, has reviewed psychological support programs in detention facilities, seeing a significant decrease in the incidents of attempted and actual self-harm in immigration detention facilities. 


the Attorney General has also recently announced the appointment of an independent reviewer to conduct primary and periodic reviews of adverse security assessments for those persons found to be owed protection but facing prolonged immigration detention due to visa ineligibility.


Since the release of the Committee's report a number of significant policy and legislative reforms related to Irregular Maritime Arrivals (IMAs) have taken place. On 28 June 2012, the Prime Minister announced the establishment of an independent expert panel to examine approaches to deterring asylum seekers from embarking on dangerous boat journeys to Australia. The Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers was led by Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston AC AFC (Ret'd), who was joined by Paris Aristotle AM and Professor Michael L'Estrange AO. 


The Expert Panel made 22 recommendations, including measures to implement regional processing to safeguard Australian borders, avert loss of life at sea and offer consistency in affording protection to those in need. The Government endorsed, in principle, all 22 recommendations of the Expert Panel's report. 


The Australian Government believes in strong policies and decisive action to prevent loss of life through dangerous irregular maritime passages and ensuring there is no advantage for those who seek to arrive in Australia by such means. The Government has simultaneously increased the opportunities for offshore resettlement in Australia by increasing the Humanitarian Program to a total of 20,000 places each year, making Australia the second highest humanitarian intake country in the world.


The Joint Select Committee on Australia's Immigration Detention Network conducted its inquiry and reported prior to these significant policy changes. As such, references to IMAs contained within the Committee's report, its recommendations and the Government's response pertain to IMAs who arrived in Australia prior to 13 August 2012. 


The Government is grateful for the work the Committee has undertaken in respect to this important issue and for all those who contributed with their submissions and evidence to the Committee.


The Government's response to the recommendations made by the Committee follows.

Accepted





The Government has a comprehensive health framework and service delivery strategy for people in immigration detention
. 
The provision of health services, in particular mental health services, is subject to regular review and improvement.





The Psychological Support Program policy (PSP policy) for the prevention of self-harm in immigration detention was developed by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) in consultation with the Detention Health Advisory Group (DeHAG). 





DIAC, its Detention Service Provider (Serco), and Detention Health Service Provider, International Health and Medical Services, (IHMS) have aligned all policies and procedures related to the implementation of the PSP policy and Serco

In addition the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) is progressing a review of medication management in immigration detention facilities
. 
This review will be undertaken by a suitably qualified and experienced organisation
. 
The recommendations of the review will be used to inform DIAC in future policy and procedural development, and contractual management in 
matters relating to medication management, including secondary dispensing of medication.





Recommendation 14

24 hour a day basis at all non-metropolitan detention facilities. 





Not Accepted





All people in immigration detention are provided access to health care at a standard generally comparable to the health care available to the Australian community and consistent with the duty of care owed to people in immigration detention
. 
Health care services are provided by qualified health professionals and take into account the diverse and potentially complex health care needs of people in immigration detention.





The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) acknowledges that it is appropriate to provide 24 hour onsite medical staffing at certain non-metropolitan detention facilities
. 





At present the Detention Health Service Provider, International Health and Medical Services, (IHMS) provides onsite services 24 hours a day at Christmas Island, Curtin, Scherger, Wickham Point and Yongah Hill Immigration Detention Centres
. 





DIAC is considering, on a case by case basis, whether it is appropriate to provide 24 hour medical staffing at other non-metropolitan facilities

Recommendation 16





The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship work with International Health and Medical Services to pilot regular mental health outreach services in detention facilities.





Accepted in Principle





Mental health care and support services for people in immigration detention are provided by general practitioners, mental health nurses, psychologists, counsellors and psychiatrists. This care is provided or co-ordinated by the Detention Health Services Provider, International Health and Medical Services (IHMS). 





Since the implementation of the Bridging visa program enabling Irregular Maritime Arrivals who meet identity, health, character and security requirements to live in the community while their claims for protection are being processed, the self-harm rates for the population in detention have significantly reduced.





The Department of Immigration and Citizenship will consult with its service providers about the feasibility of IHMS providing mental health outreach services in detention facilities once the review of Psychological Support Program policy is completed (see recommendation 7 for further details). 





Recommendation 17





The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship develop a transport capability to transfer detainees with non-acute injuries to remote hospitals.





Accepted





A number of Immigration Detention Facilities (IDFs) are located in remote communities.


The Government is committed to ensuring that health care is delivered to people in immigration detention in a manner that minimises the impact on local health resources.





The Detention Health Service Provider, International Health and Medical Services (IHMS), is contracted to provide a comprehensive range of health services to those in immigration 
detention. These services include primary and mental health services.





Local ambulance services are only used for critical injuries or as a last resort when no other transport resources are available
. 
IHMS is responsible for determining whether an injury or medical condition is critical or non-critical.





A range of regional-specific arrangements to address transport arrangements for clients in immigration detention are in place or are being negotiated; for example, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship is negotiating with the Northern Territory Government to provide additional resources to ambulance services, so that ambulance service provision to IDFs will have minimal impact on the local community
. 





Other strategies implemented or under consideration at various facilities across the network include the Detention Services Provider (Serco) having a dedicated vehicle for non-emergency hospital transports and the extension of IHMS clinic hours.





Reforms to the existing network





Recommendation 1





The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship continue to robustly contract manage Serco
'
s obligation to provide appropriate activities for detainees.





Accepted



The Government recognises the importance of providing a program of meaningful activities for clients in immigration detention. 


The Detention Service Provider (Serco) is contracted to develop, manage and deliver structured and unstructured programs and activities (Programs and Activities) designed to provide educational and recreational opportunities, as well as meaningful activities that enhance the mental health and wellbeing of individuals in immigration detention.


Clients in immigration detention have access to a wide range of services and activities including access to the internet, libraries, religious activities, sports facilities, excursions and educational classes.


Since the Serco contract was first executed, there has been significant change in the immigration detention environment including a significant increase in the number of irregular maritime arrivals as a proportion of the total population in immigration detention and a more diverse client composition that includes families, unaccompanied minors and a range of status resolution pathways. The range of types of accommodation and detention facilities across Australia has also increased.


The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) is working with Serco to improve the quality and appropriateness of Programs and Activities delivered in the current immigration detention environment.


At the beginning of 2012, Serco appointed a national senior manager focused on introducing more meaningful Programs and Activities. DIAC has also established a Programs and Activities Framework to provide further guidance to its service providers on the development of an enhanced Programs & Activities operating model.


The programs and activities delivered at each facility are monitored against contractual requirements on a monthly basis.




Recommendation 2





The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship consider other accommodation or recreation options for detainees when the amenity of a facility is compromised due to construction or maintenance projects.





Accepted 



The expansion of the immigration detention network during 2011 and 2012 has enabled more flexibility in the use of facilities and placement of clients across the network. 


The Department of Immigration and Citizenship works closely with contractors and service providers to manage the impacts of construction and maintenance work at immigration detention facilities where this temporarily reduces the amenity of a facility.


For example, the redevelopment of Villawood Immigration Detention Centre will be completed in stages. While the detention centre will remain operational during the redevelopment, the managing contractor has prepared a staging plan to support the security, amenity and safety of the centre for the life of the project.


In addition, the Detention Services Contract requires Serco to develop, manage and deliver both structured and 'unstructured' programs and activities, including 'supervised external excursions'.



When the amenity of a facility is compromised due to construction or maintenance projects, a flexible schedule that allows for a higher proportion of 'unstructured' activities and 'supervised external excursions' will be utilised.




Recommendation 12





The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship require Serco local managers to apply a consistent practice and procedure protocol to visits across the network, in accordance with the information provided on the department website.





Accepted





The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) is working with the Detention Service Provider (Serco) to apply consistent practice and procedure protocols to visits across the network.





DIAC has requested that Serco senior management issue reminders to local site managers regarding the importance of a consistent approach and strict adherence to visitor protocols, as outlined on DIAC
'
s website.





In addition, DIAC is undertaking an internal Quality Assurance Review of the process
. 
The objectives of the review include:



establishing whether procedures and practices in managing visits are efficient, effective and consistent across all immigration detention facilities


establishing whether DIAC's and Serco's procedural advice and training provide adequate support to staff managing visits processes 


improving service delivery.


The review is scheduled to be finalised by end of November 2012.




Recommendation 13





The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship continue to improve visitor facilities across the network.





Accepted



The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) has recently completed upgrades to the visitor areas of the Melbourne Immigration Transit Centre, Sydney Immigration Residential Housing facility and Villawood Immigration Detention Centre (VIDC). A new visitor area is currently being developed at the Curtin Immigration Detention Centre.


Visitor areas have been incorporated in the design of both Wickham Point and Yongah Hill. As part of the VIDC redevelopment, an indoor/outdoor visits area forms part of the works and will be completed in July 2013.


As acknowledged in the Committee's report, DIAC is working to improve visitor amenities at immigration detention facilities and has already implemented much of this work.




Children in detention





Recommendation 19





The Committee recommends that relevant legislation be amended to replace the Minister for Immigration as the legal guardian of unaccompanied minors in the immigration detention system.





Not Accepted



The Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act 1946 (IGOC Act) provides that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (the Minister) is the guardian of certain unaccompanied non-citizen minors who arrive in Australia with the intention of becoming permanent residents. This includes, but is not limited to, unaccompanied minors within the immigration detention system. 


The Minister's guardianship responsibilities are delegated to officers within state and territory child welfare agencies and/or certain Departmental officers.


As part of deliberations on addressing the perceived conflict of interest between the Minister's responsibilities as guardian under the IGOC Act and his other powers and duties under the Migration Act 1958, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) has engaged the services and expertise of a consultant who has extensive experience in the field of children's issues. DIAC is currently taking advice on options and proposals to use the IGOC Act in a more effective way to further the best interests of children within its scope. 


The government is committed to ensuring the needs of unaccompanied minors are met, and is focusing on reviewing and updating existing programs, policies and procedures that directly impact upon the wellbeing of these children. 


Key initiatives being progressed by DIAC to improve the day-to-day wellbeing and experience of minors include:


delivering on the government's commitment to moving unaccompanied minors not subject to the new legislative amendments for regional transfer arrangements into community-based accommodation as a matter of priority – as at COB 1 July 2012, the Minister had approved 4112 clients for residence determination including 1918 children (823 unaccompanied minors), since the announcement to expand the community detention program on 18 October 2010;


the development and implementation of the Refugee Youth Support Pilot, to test new models of settlement services for older unaccompanied minors that recognises their ability, in most cases, to quickly transition to independent living, with a view to implementing more tailored settlement service models for unaccompanied minors within the next 12 months;


the development of a more consistent national approach to the care of unaccompanied minors who have been granted protection visas. This is a joint initiative with the Community and Disability Services Ministers' Advisory Council. A sub-committee of this advisory council has been created to facilitate discussion specifically on guardianship issues, and work towards improved national consistency of guardianship policies and procedures for unaccompanied minors. Membership includes representation from each state and territory child welfare agency, DIAC and the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services, and Indigenous Affairs;


amendments to the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Regulations 2001 to strengthen day-to-day care arrangements by custodians;


the review and update of various policy and procedure manuals and training materials, including the Community Detention Operational Framework, to ensure clear and appropriate guidance on guardianship issues; and


the development of a revised framework on programs and activities for immigration detention facilities which would enhance health and wellbeing of minors. The Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act 1946 (IGOC Act) provides that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship is the guardian of certain unaccompanied non-citizen minors who arrive in Australia with the intention of becoming permanent residents; this includes unaccompanied minors within the immigration detention system. 




Recommendation 20





The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship develop and implement a uniform code for child protection for all children seeking asylum across the immigration system.





Accepted in Principle



The Australian Government recognises that children are a vulnerable group and has policies, procedures and programs in place to address this.


The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) requires that its employees and service providers immediately refer any suspicion or allegation relating to child welfare covered by mandatory reporting laws to the relevant state or territory welfare authority. 


There is currently no single national framework setting out the requirements for working with children checks or police checks, as each state and territory has their own requirements and procedures. However, as part of the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children, the Commonwealth and states and territories are working towards enhancing national consistency in working with children checks. DIAC delivers services to clients across Australia and it is desirable to have a nationally consistent approach to screening of DIAC personnel. To this end, and in anticipation of more uniform working with children screening processes across Australia, DIAC is currently developing a policy requiring appropriate nationally consistent checks for all DIAC personnel who work with children in vulnerable circumstances.


The Privacy Act 1988 governs DIAC's ability to provide government agencies with personal information to facilitate a child's care and protection outside of mandatory reporting laws. In some instances, state law binds the Commonwealth. This allows for the lawful disclosure of personal information to a state or territory child protection agency on a case by case basis, however, this is not consistent across all states and territories. 


To broaden the circumstances in which we can lawfully share relevant public information with state and territory child protection agencies, DIAC is developing a Public Interest Determination proposal for consideration by the Information Commissioner. If agreed to, DIAC could disclose information to certain state and territory governments to facilitate a child's care and protection in certain circumstances, such as if there is a threat to their life, health or welfare.


DIAC is currently exploring the best way to facilitate the sharing of this information in the event that the Public Interest Determination is agreed by the Information Commissioner. Options may include:


becoming a party to the Information Sharing Protocol between the Commonwealth and the eight State and Territory Child Protection Agencies, or 


signing protocols with each State and Territory Child Protection Agency.




Recommendation 21





The Committee further recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship adopt Memoranda of Understanding with children
'
s commissions or commissioners in all states and territories as soon as possible.





Accepted in Principle



As state and territory child welfare agencies are responsible for investigating concerns about child welfare, it would be more appropriate for protocols to be established with those agencies rather than with children's commissioners. This approach is consistent with the advice provided to the JSC by the Australian Children's Commissioners and Guardians.


The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) is currently exploring ways to improve its ability to work more cooperatively with state and territory child protection agencies, outside mandatory reporting requirements.


The Privacy Act 1988 governs DIAC's ability to provide government agencies with personal information to facilitate a child's care and protection outside of mandatory reporting laws. In some instances, state law does bind the Commonwealth, allowing for the lawful disclosure of personal information to a state or territory child protection agency on a case by case basis, however, this is not consistent across all states and territories.


To broaden the circumstances in which we can lawfully share relevant information with state and territory child protection agencies, DIAC is developing a Public Interest Determination proposal for consideration by the Information Commissioner which, if agreed, would enable DIAC to disclose information to state and territory child welfare agencies to facilitate a child's care and protection in certain circumstances, such as if there is a threat to their life, health or welfare.


DIAC is currently exploring the most effective mechanism to outline agreed protocols with state and territory governments on the sharing of information for child protection matters, in the event that the Public Interest Determination is agreed by the Information Commissioner. DIAC is consulting with states and territories on this issue as part of the sub-committee on unaccompanied humanitarian minors established under the Community and Disability Services Ministers' Advisory Council. 


Possible options under consideration include:


Becoming a party to the Information Sharing Protocol between the Commonwealth and the eight State and Territory Child Protection Agencies, which has formally established processes to facilitate the sharing of information to assist child protection agencies where there are concerns about a child's welfare; and/or


Signing separate protocols with each State and Territory Child Protection Agency.




Reforms to detention policy





Recommendation 18



The Committee recommends that, as a matter of policy, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship accommodate detainees in metropolitan detention facilities wherever possible, in particular children and families, and those detainees with special needs or with complex medical conditions.




Accepted in principle



Decisions regarding placement of people across the immigration detention network are made by the Department of Immigration and Citizenships (DIAC) in consultation with the Detention Service Provider (Serco) and the Detention Health Service Provider (IHMS). 


Placement decisions take into account individual client circumstances, such as family composition, age and gender, immigration status, individual security risks and ongoing health issues, as well as broader operational requirements such as accommodation availability and the security and good order of the facility.


While recent expansion of the immigration detention network has resulted in an increase in accommodation options in metropolitan locations, at this time, there is insufficient accommodation across these sites to enable all clients to be located at a metropolitan facility.


Regardless of where a client is placed within the network, all people have access to a broad range of health, support and services.


The immigration detention network will continue to be used in a flexible way to manage changes in the client composition. DIAC has designated some sites to assist with the management of clients that have particular care needs, such as children and people who require ongoing access to specialist health care or have physical disabilities. 




Recommendation 22



The Committee recommends that the Australian Government take further steps to adhere to its commitment of only detaining asylum seekers as a last resort and for the shortest practicable time, and subject to an assessment of non-compliance and risk factors, as enunciated by the New Directions policy.




Accepted



Government policy is that all unauthorised arrivals are subject to mandatory detention for the management of any health, identity or security risks to the community. This is in contrast to those who arrive in Australia lawfully and have been assessed during the visa application process in relation to matters such as identity, security, bona fides and health. 


Ongoing Department of Immigration and Citizenship, and Commonwealth Ombudsman reviews consider the appropriateness of a person's detention, their detention arrangements and other matters relevant to their ongoing detention and case resolution.


Significant reforms in the use of community placement options for irregular maritime arrivals (IMAs) whose immigration status has not been resolved have been introduced. This includes the expanded use of community detention announced jointly by the Prime Minister and Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (the Minister) in October 2010 and expanded use of Bridging E visas announced by the Minister in November 2011. This is to progressively allow people who satisfy health, identity and security requirements to be considered on a case by case basis for release from detention while their protection claims are assessed. 




Recommendation 23



The Committee further recommends that asylum seekers who pass initial identity, health, character and security checks be immediately granted a bridging visa or moved to community detention while a determination of their refugee status is completed, and that all reasonable steps be taken to limit detention to a maximum of 90 days.




Partially Accepted



To support the integrity of Australia's immigration program, all unauthorised arrivals will be subject to mandatory detention for the management of any health, identity or security risks to the community.


The Government is committed to minimising the length of time a person is subject to immigration detention. The period of time a person is detained is dependent on assessment of risk factors and varies according to individual circumstances. Immigration detention is subject to regular review but is not time limited.


Significant reforms in the use of community placement options for irregular maritime arrivals (IMAs) whose immigration status has not been resolved have been introduced. This includes the expanded use of community detention announced jointly by the Prime Minister and Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in October 2010 and expanded use of Bridging E visas announced by the Minister in November 2011. This is to progressively allow people who satisfy health, identity and security requirements to be considered on a case by case basis for release from detention while their protection claims are assessed.


Expanded community-based detention arrangements (formally known as residence determination) for IMAs has also enabled significant numbers of unaccompanied minors and vulnerable family groups to be relocated from immigration detention facilities to community-based accommodation.


The Department of Immigration and Citizenship is continuing to work on moving significant numbers of children and vulnerable family groups out of immigration detention facilities and into community-based accommodation.


The Government has not prescribed timeframes for the transfer of IMAs to community-based accommodation as placement is at the discretion of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, and will only occur once a client has satisfied health, identity and security requirements. However, the Government is committed to moving children into the community as soon as possible.



IMAs who are not eligible for community placement because they present risks to the community in terms of identity, security or character concerns will remain in facility-based detention.




Recommendation 24



The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship be required to publish on a quarterly basis the reasons for the continued detention of any person detained for more than 90 days, without compromising the privacy of the individuals. 




Not Accepted



The Immigration Detention Statistics Summary, published by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) on a monthly basis, provides a breakdown of the length of time people are held in immigration detention facilities.


Reasons why people are required to remain in immigration detention beyond 90 days vary depending on a wide range of individual circumstances. For privacy reasons it would be inappropriate to publish this information. 


Detention that is indefinite or otherwise arbitrary is not acceptable and the length and conditions of detention, including the type of accommodation and services provided, are subject to regular review, including by the Commonwealth Ombudsman.




Recommendation 29



The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship consider publishing criteria for determining whether asylum seekers are placed in community detention or on bridging visas.




Not Accepted



Under the Migration Act 1958 (the Act) the only powers that can be used to allow an Irregular Maritime Arrival (IMA) to live in the community (residence determination) or to grant an IMA a Bridging visa are non-compellable powers that can only be exercised by the Minister of Immigration and Citizenship (the Minister) personally, if the Minister thinks it is in the public interest to do so. As such, there are no set criteria as it is for the Minister to decide what is in the public interest.


The Department of Immigration and Citizenship's (DIAC) case managers recommend suitable placement options for clients in immigration detention on a case by case basis. These are referred to the Minister for his consideration, however the Minister is not bound to accept these referrals. 




Recommendation 30



The Committee recommends that the Australian Government and the


Department of Immigration and Citizenship seek briefing on control orders in use by the criminal justice system and explore the practicalities of employing similar measures for refugees and asylum seekers who are in indefinite detention or cannot be repatriated.




Accepted in principle



Where persons found to be owed protections are not eligible for a visa due to an adverse security assessment, the Government will continue to explore the possibility of third country resettlement for the individual.


The Government has been briefed on the control order regime under the Criminal Code Act 1995.


Control orders are only available where a person has trained with a terrorist organisation listed under the Criminal Code or where a control order would substantially assist in preventing a terrorist act. The conditions attached to the control order must each be necessary to protect the community from a terrorist act. These are high legal thresholds, and it is not expected that Criminal Code control orders would be readily available.


The Government is responsible for the protection of national security, and any options that might involve release of persons with adverse security assessments into the community raise complex issues that would need to be carefully considered.




Reforms to processing of protection claims and security assessments





Recommendation 25



The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship consider revising and enhancing its system of quality control to oversee those Refugee Status and Assessment and Independent Merits Review processes still underway.




Accepted



The Government is committed to ensuring rigorous decision making for refugee status determinations so that sound, defensible decisions are made in accordance with relevant law, Australia's international obligations and government policy.


As of 24 March 2012 all primary refugee processing occurs through a single onshore Protection visa (PV) process. This process applies to Irregular Maritime Arrivals (IMAs) arriving on or after 24 March 2012 and before 13 August 2012, and to all those IMAs who had not had a primary interview before 24 March 2012. 


The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) has had in place a formal Quality Assurance (QA) framework for primary refugee decision making since September 2010. The purpose of this framework is to identify opportunities to improve the quality of primary refugee status decision making, based on the findings from a methodical and structured arm's length review of finalised decisions. 


This framework has been used to assess the quality of decisions within the Refugee Status Assessment (RSA) and Protection Obligations Evaluation (POE) processes, and for the current single onshore PV process. There are no longer any RSA processes underway.


Between September 2010 and December 2011, six QA reviews were undertaken. This includes two RSA QA reviews, one POE QA review and three PV QA reviews.


These reviews assessed the consideration of the key components in determining refugee status, including:


the use of country of origin information to support findings


the identification of the correct Convention ground/s


the correct consideration of the key components within the Refugee Convention, such as 'persecution' and 'well-founded fear'


the assessment of credibility. 


Findings from these reviews have indicated steady improvements across most of the quality measures. They have also provided an evidence base for continued investment in remedial action, including targeted training, strengthened supervisor arrangements and strengthened procedures.


DIAC will continue to refine and strengthen its QA framework and its supporting tools to ensure that QA and QC findings are accurate and to enable continuous improvement.




Recommendation 26





The Committee recommends that the Australian Government move to place all asylum seekers who are found to be refugees, and who do not trigger any concerns with the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation following initial security checks, and subject to an assessment of


non-compliance and risk factors, into community detention while any necessary in-depth security assessments are conducted.





Partially Accepted



The Government has not prescribed timeframes for the transfer of IMAs to community-based accommodation as placement is at the discretion of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, and will only occur once a client has satisfied health, identity and security requirements.


The period of time a person is detained is dependent on assessment of risk factors and varies according to individual circumstances. IMAs who are not eligible for community placement because they present risks to the community in terms of identity, security or character concerns will remain in facility-based detention.




Recommendation 27





The Committee recommends that the Australian Government and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation establish and implement periodic, internal reviews of adverse Australian Security Intelligence Organisation refugee security assessments commencing as soon as possible.





Accepted



The Government has announced that it will establish a mechanism for periodic and primary review of adverse security assessments furnished to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship in relation to all persons found to be owed protection who remain in prolonged immigration detention. The Independent Reviewer of Adverse Security Assessments will provide regular 12 month periodic review of adverse security assessments for people owed protection who remain in immigration detention.


The Government notes that periodic review of Australia Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) security assessments would, ordinarily, be an unusual requirement. A security assessment is ASIO's security related advice to a Commonwealth Agency on an individual at the time it is furnished. The security advice can include a recommendation that the Agency take or refrain from taking specific prescribed administration action on security grounds (for example, in relation to the grant of a protection visa). It is open to ASIO to furnish a further security assessment where security-related changes in the person's circumstances are assessed by ASIO to support the provision of further security advice. It would not ordinarily be appropriate to periodically review security assessments (being advice given at a particular time). However, in circumstances where the practical outcome of an adverse security assessment is prolonged immigration detention (due to visa ineligibility), periodic review will provide a basis for the regular review of the security grounds underpinning detention.


Other factors that have a bearing on the person's ongoing detention will also be kept under review.


This includes the circumstances that form the basis of the protection obligations and options for third country re-settlement.




Recommendation 28





The Committee recommends that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act be amended to allow the Security Appeals Division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to review the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation security assessments of refugees and asylum seekers.





Not Accepted



The Government agrees with establishing a review mechanism for persons found to be owed protection who receive adverse security assessments, but rather than extending the Administrative Appeal Tribunal's jurisdiction, the Government has established an alternative review mechanism. The Government has appointed an independent reviewer to conduct efficient and cost effective reviews of adverse security assessments furnished to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship in relation to all persons found to be owed protection who remain in prolonged immigration detention. Implementation of Hawke–Williams Recommendations




Recommendation 3





The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship conduct robust auditing of Serco staffing ratios and training, in line with the recommendations in the Comcare report and the Hawke-Williams review.





Accepted



The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) ensures that the performance of the Detention Service Provider (Serco) is rigorously monitored. Monthly performance reviews are conducted and Serco is subject to penalties or sanctions where it does not meet the standards set out in the Detention Services Contract.




Staffing



Serco staff ratios for immigration detention centres and other facilities are not mandated. However, the Detention Services Contract requires that Serco ensures that personnel levels at facilities are adequate to deliver the required services.


DIAC and Serco work together to plan and manage staff capability, consistent with changes to client and centre risk profiles and service delivery demands. 




Training



Serco must ensure that all its personnel are trained and qualified in accordance with the Detention Services Contract and related state and territory law.


Serco is required to maintain a national training database with records of training undertaken by its staff. Using this information as a basis, Serco provides quarterly reports to DIAC and retains, at each immigration detention site, details of training undertaken by rostered staff. Further work is underway to enhance record keeping in this area.


Serco has advised that a complete audit of qualifications has been undertaken, and it is improving its performance in this area. DIAC commenced a review of qualification, certification and storage of Serco staff records in May 2012.




Recommendation 4




The Committee reiterates the recommendation made by the Commonwealth Ombudsman that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, conduct a review of the quality and management of incident reporting across immigration detention network, and also assess Serco
'
s capacity to monitor its own compliance with the reporting guidelines.




Accepted




The Department of Immigration and Citizenship completed a review of the quality, accuracy and timeliness of incident reporting and post-incident reviews, in relation to the Detention Service Provider (Serco's) contractual obligations, at the end of June 2012.




Recommendation 11





Consistent with the findings of the Hawke-Williams review, the Committee recommends that the government finalise a security protocol between Serco, the Australian Federal Police and local police in each state and territory.





Accepted



On behalf of the Government, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) is negotiating a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and state and territory law enforcement agencies for the provision of policing services to immigration detention facilities (IDFs).


The MoU formalises arrangements currently in place and also enables state and territory law enforcement agencies to build adequate capability and capacity to respond to incidents at IDFs without impacting on the provision of policing services to the local community.


Individual state and territory specific annexures will sit under the MoU. These annexures enable the jurisdictions in a position to sign onto the agreement, in advance of others, to do so. It also allows the agreements to be tailored to the specific requirements of each jurisdiction.


The Detention Service Provider (Serco) is not a party to the MoU. However, its roles and responsibilities when responding to an incident are clearly articulated within an Implementation Protocol which is attached to the MoU. Serco has been closely consulted on this protocol. 




Recommendation 31





The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship continue to work towards implementing all of the recommendations made by the Hawke-Williams review, and that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship report to the Parliament no later than 20 September 2012 on progress in implementing the review recommendations.





Accepted



The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) has worked to implement the recommendations made by the Independent Review into the Incidents at the Christmas Island and Villawood Immigration Detention Centres as a matter of priority. The majority of the recommendations have been implemented and, in many instances, DIAC has gone beyond its stated commitments in order to comprehensively address the broader issues raised by the Review and to facilitate improvements across the detention network.


The implementation of these measures has resulted in significant improvements in the management of clients, infrastructure and service providers in the immigration detention network. DIAC has developed new infrastructure and enhanced security at existing facilities, significantly developed its critical incident management response capabilities, improved the quality and availability of training to staff, strengthened contract management and put in place broader incident prevention strategies.



The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship reported to the Parliament on the progress made implementing the Review recommendations on 20 September 2012.




Coalition Members and Senators Dissenting Report Recommendations





Coalition Recommendation 1





Restore the Coalition
'
s proven border protection regime Coalition Members and Senators recommend that the Government restore the proven measures of the Howard Government, abolished by the Rudd and Gillard Governments, to once again deter illegal boat arrivals to Australia, including, but not restricted to the following measures:





Restoration of the Temporary Protection Visa policy for IMAs 





Re-establishment of offshore processing on Nauru for all new IMAs by reopening the taxpayer funded processing centre on Nauru; and





Restoration of the policy to return boats seeking to illegally enter Australian waters, where it is safe to do so.





Not Accepted





Following the parliamentary impasse on the 
Migration Legislation Amendment (The Bali Process)


Bill 2012
, the Prime Minister announced on 28 June 2012, the establishment of an independent expert panel to examine approaches to deterring asylum seekers from embarking on dangerous boat journeys to Australia. The Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers was led by Air Chief Marshal


Angus Houston AC AFC (Ret
'
d), who was joined by Paris Aristotle AM and Professor Michael L
'
Estrange AO. 





The Expert Panel made 22 recommendations, including that a number of principles should shape Australian policy making on asylum issues
. 
The key principle is the implementation of a strategic, comprehensive and integrated policy approach that establishes short, medium, and long-term priorities for managing asylum and mixed migration flows across the region. The Expert Panel also clearly articulated that there are no quick or simple solutions to the policy dilemmas surrounding asylum issues
. 





The Australian Government endorsed, in principle, all 22 recommendations of the Expert Panel
'
s report.





In accordance with recommendation 7 of the Expert Panel
'
s report, the Government introduced legislation to support the transfer of people to regional processing centres, which received Royal Assent on 17 August 2012. The Government is now working with the governments of Nauru and Papua New Guinea to establish regional processing centres in those countries (in line with recommendations 8 and 9 of the Expert Panel
'
s report).





The Expert Panel also recommended that the Government 
""
continue to develop its vitally important cooperation with Malaysia on asylum issues
""
 and that the Malaysia Arrangement should 
""
be built on further, rather than being discarded or neglected
""
. Accordingly, the Government remains committed to the Malaysia Arrangement as it provides a genuinely effective approach to deterring people from taking dangerous boat journeys, while also providing durable solutions to genuine refugees who have been in Malaysia for many years
. 





The Expert Panel noted that it is currently not possible to effectively, lawfully or safely turn back irregular vessels carrying asylum seekers to Australia. The Panel
'
s report also noted that public statements by a number of senior Indonesian Government officials indicate that Indonesia
'
s reaction to a turn
-
back policy is likely to be negative. The Government will not turn back boats on the high seas at this time as it is neither safe nor viable. 




The Expert Panel did not recommend reintroducing Temporary Protection Visas. 





Coalition Recommendation 2





Coalition Members and Senators recommend that the Australian Government finalise the memorandum of understanding between DIAC, the AFP and state/territory police forces and reach a binding agreement that clearly stipulates who is responsible for policing and responding to incidents at Australian Immigration Detention Centres.





Accepted



On behalf of the Government, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship is negotiating a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and state and territory law enforcement agencies for the provision of policing services to immigration detention facilities.


See the response to recommendation 11 for further details.


Coalition Recommendation 3




Coalition Members and Senators recommend that the AFP and State/Territory police are funded adequately in order to carry out their regular operational policing responsibilities along with policing the immigration detention centres and responding to incidents.





Accepted





The Department of Immigration and Citizenship is working closely with the Australian Federal Police and individual state and territory law enforcement agencies to put in place Memorandums of Understanding with regard to the provision of policing services to immigration detention facilities
. 
As part of these agreements, provisions have been (where signed) or will be (negotiations are ongoing) included to ensure state and territory enforcement agencies are appropriately funded so the delivery of such services does not impact on regular police operations.



See the response to recommendation 11 for further details.




Coalition Recommendation 4





Coalition Members and Senators recommend that the Australian Government ensure that security infrastructure, including CCTV cameras, security fences and other essential security elements be operational, ready and be of a high standard of functionality and that DIAC, with assistance from Serco, is to undertake a review of infrastructure (including security infrastructure) across the broader immigration detention network.





Accepted



The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) and the Detention Service Provider (Serco) continually monitor the security infrastructure of immigration detention centres across the network to ensure that infrastructure is functional and fit for purpose. 


DIAC ensures that appropriate security is in place and consistent with the security risk of the clients accommodated at the facility. Physical infrastructure upgrades and security improvement works are being implemented at a number of sites across the immigration detention network.


In addition to modifications to the physical security infrastructure, a number of changes have been made to enhance security through operational arrangements across the detention network. This includes more regular checks of the security infrastructure and closer monitoring of client risks identified through internal intelligence activities.




Coalition Recommendation 5





Coalition Members and Senators recommend that the Australian Government seek advice on amendments and addition to the regulations under the Migration Act to clarify the responsibilities and powers of persons who operate detention centres around the limits on their obligations and powers in relation to use of force, to ensure the good order and control of immigration detention facilities.





Accepted



The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship is seeking advice to determine whether there is a need to amend the Migration Act 1958 and regulations to allow the use of reasonable force to maintain the good order of an immigration detention facility where reasonable belief exists regarding a direct threat to the physical safety of an officer, a detainee or a third party.


The Department of Immigration and Citizenship is also well advanced in the negotiation of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Australian Federal Police and state and territory law enforcement agencies for the provision of policing services to immigration detention facilities.


The Detention Service Provider (Serco) is not a party to the MoU. However, its roles and responsibilities when responding to an incident are clearly articulated within an Implementation Protocol attached to the MoU.




Coalition Recommendation 6





Coalition Members and Senators recommend that a minimum quota of 11,000 places of the 13,750 permanent places for the Refugee and Humanitarian program be reserved for offshore 
applicants, in parallel with the introduction of Temporary Protection Visas for all IMAs.





Not Accepted



On 23 August 2012, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship announced that in response to the recommendations of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers, that the Humanitarian Program would be increased immediately to 20 000 places. The expanded Program will continue to provide places for both people resettled from overseas and those already in Australia who have sought protection. 


The expanded Program provides 6250 additional places (a 45 per cent increase) and is the biggest boost to Australia's refugee intake in 30 years.




Recommendations by Senator Hanson-Young for the Australian Greens





Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 1





Migration Act to be amended to ensure that a time limit on detention, preferably 30 days, is adhered to, over which time initial health, identity and security checks can be conducted to ensure there is no risk to the community.





Not Accepted



The Government is committed to treating asylum seekers and refugees humanely and fairly while managing risks to the Australian community. Immigration detention of all unauthorised people arriving at the border is mandatory for the purpose of determining any health, identity or security risk they may present.


While the Government expects the Department of Immigration and Citizenship to resolve all matters associated with determining a person's immigration status as quickly as possible, it does not support the introduction of a mandatory timeframe for the release of individuals from immigration detention.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 2





Detention beyond the legislated time limit must be justified before a court and subject to periodic review by the court from that point, with the onus on the Department of Immigration to make the application and show why extended detention is necessary for that individual.





Not Accepted



The Government's intention is that immigration detention be for the shortest period possible while appropriately managing risks to the Australian community.


Ongoing reviews by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the Commonwealth Ombudsman consider the appropriateness of the person's detention, their detention arrangement and other matters relevant to their ongoing detention and case resolution.


A person in immigration detention may seek merits or judicial review of most visa decisions that result in them becoming unlawful and liable for detention. They may also seek judicial review on the lawfulness of their detention with the Federal or High Courts.


Given the availability of merits and judicial review as outlined above and the broader use of residence determination (community detention) arrangements and Bridging visas transitioning irregular maritime arrivals into the community, the Government does not support periodic review of immigration detention by the courts.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 3





Remote and isolated detention centres should be decommissioned.





Not Accepted



The expansion of the immigration detention network in 2011 and 2012 has provided the Government with a range of flexible options to accommodate people required to be taken into immigration detention to manage community or program risks. The Government continually monitors immigration detention accommodation requirements and makes adjustments as required. 




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 4





The best interests of the child should be enshrined in the Migration Act as the paramount in decisions regarding the accommodation of all children.





Not Accepted



Consistent with Australia's obligations as a party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989, the best interests of the child are a primary consideration in the Government's engagement with children. This includes consideration of the child's individual circumstances and the welfare of the child, as well as other factors, such as maintaining family unity and access to education. As such, the Government does not regard the recommended changes to the Migration Act 1958 (Migration Act) as necessary.


In accordance with section 4AA of the Migration Act, and the Key Immigration Detention Values announced by the Government in July 2008, children are not held in immigration detention centres. Outside of community-based detention arrangements, minors are accommodated at low-security sites, such as immigration transit accommodation and immigration residential housing, or other alternative places of detention, which includes commercial accommodation such as motels. 




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 5





Migration Act to be amended to remove any mandatory detention of children.





Not Accepted



The Government firmly believes that the best place children can be supported during immigration processing is in the community and high priority is given to moving unaccompanied minors, children and their families into community-based accommodation wherever possible.


There will, however, always be a period of time after their unauthorised arrival in Australia when children and their parents and carers will be detained while identity, health and security checks are undertaken. There will also be a small number of children who may not be able to be placed in the community due to particular risks associated with their parents or carers. Children, including unaccompanied minors, are accommodated in alternate places of immigration detention and not in immigration detention centres. Children and young people in immigration detention are processed as a matter of priority to resolve their immigration status as quickly as possible.


The Government considers that this measured approach strikes a balance between operating a migration program with integrity while protecting the welfare of children.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 6





Migration Act to be amended to place time limits on children and their families being accommodated in low security family appropriate facilities prior to being moved into the community.





Not Accepted



The transfer of unaccompanied minors and children with families from held immigration detention to community detention or a Bridging visa is a Government priority. 


Before a child or family can be transferred from a detention facility into the community, mandatory health, identity and security checks must be completed, suitable housing be sourced, and in the case of unaccompanied minors, appropriate carer arrangements must be put in place.


The Department of Immigration and Citizenship continues to transfer significant numbers of children and vulnerable family groups who arrived as Irregular Maritime Arrivals before 13 August 2012 out of immigration detention facilities and into community-based accommodation as soon as they have completed mandatory health, identity and security checks.


While the Government expects that eligible children will be transferred into a community option as quickly as possible, it does not support the introduction of a mandatory timeframe for the placement of children and their families in community-based accommodation.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 7





Children should not be subject to ASIO security checks beyond the standard security checks used at airports (i.e. checks against the Central Movement Alert List).





Not Accepted



The Government's responsibility is to ensure that Australia's security is not compromised. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) rarely conducts security assessments on minors, but this option must remain open where security concerns are identified. Where asylum seekers arrive without documentation it may be difficult to establish conclusively whether a person is a minor. It is also important to recognise that minors may occasionally be involved in activities of security concern and make provision for such situations.


ASIO has a range of policies and procedures in place to address the particular circumstance of dealing with minors, including additional authorisation and internal oversight. External oversight is maintained by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 8





All asylum seeker children of school age (early childhood, primary and secondary) must be given access to local schooling.





Not Accepted



The Government is committed to ensuring that children accommodated in immigration detention facilities and under community-based detention arrangements have access to education in line with community standards and relevant State and Territory laws. 


The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) arranges for children housed in alternate places of detention to have access to education facilities either through education services provided by its Detention Service Provider (Serco) or where agreed with a state or territory government education authority through public education in the local community. 


Where clients are placed into community detention, DIAC has arrangements in place to enrol children in local schools. Children in community detention arrangements who are four years of age (below compulsory school age) may participate in an early childhood education program. For those asylum-seeker children who are not in detention, schooling is a matter for the relevant State or Territory government.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 9





Children should only be housed in facilities where all service providers and officers who interact with them have obtained a Working with Children check.





Accepted



The Government requires the Detention Service Provider (Serco) to meet state and territory child protection laws including working with children checks and mandatory reporting requirements. Serco also works proactively with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) to maintain a child safe environment. 


DIAC ensures that child protection provisions for all external contracts are accountable through reporting and auditing mechanisms. As a minimum, all new contracts with service providers must include a clause that meets the child protection legislative requirements in the state or territory in which they operate. 


There is currently no single national framework setting out the requirements for working with children checks or police checks, as each state and territory has their own requirements and procedures. However, as part of the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children, the Commonwealth and states and territories are working towards enhancing national consistency in working with children checks. DIAC delivers services to clients across Australia and it is desirable to have a nationally consistent approach to screening of DIAC personnel. To this end, and in anticipation of more uniform working with children screening processes across Australia, DIAC is currently developing a policy requiring appropriate nationally consistent checks for all DIAC personnel who work with children in vulnerable circumstances.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 10





IAAAS funding to be expanded to cover independent psychological and psychiatric reports.





Not Accepted



The Immigration Advice and Application Assistance Scheme (IAAAS) provides publicly funded, free independent advice and assistance to asylum seekers, including Irregular Maritime Arrivals, for the processing of their refugee claims. 


Under the IAAAS Deed of Agreement, IAAAS providers receive funding based on the category of the service provided. IAAAS providers have the discretion to seek independent psychological and psychiatric reports if they determine this would assist the client's application. However, any costs associated with the provision of these reports must be absorbed within the existing funding. The Government does not support expanding the funding arrangements.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 11





Relevant legislation to be amended to ensure that detainees have access to a fair and independent review of a negative ASIO security assessments, with appropriate disclosure of the grounds of the adverse security findings regardless of whether judicial or merits review, and with flexible options for protecting national security on a case-by-case basis.





Partially Accepted



The Government agrees with establishing a review mechanism for persons found to be owed protection who receive adverse security assessments, but rather than extending the Administrative Appeal Tribunal's jurisdiction, the Government has established an alternative review mechanism. The Government has appointed an independent reviewer to conduct efficient and cost effective reviews of adverse security assessments furnished to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship in relation to all persons found to be owed protection who remain in prolonged immigration detention.


When an eligible person makes a request for independent review, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation will provide an unclassified written summary of reasons for the decision to issue an adverse security assessment to the Independent Reviewer on the basis that it will be provided to the eligible person. The reasons will include information that can be provided to the eligible person to the extent able without prejudicing the interests of security.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 12





Appointment of a special advocate to conduct reviews of negative ASIO assessments where there is concern maintaining confidentiality of sensitive material.





Partially Accepted



The Government agrees with establishing a review mechanism for persons found to be owed protection who receive adverse security assessments, and has appointed an independent reviewer to conduct efficient and cost effective reviews of adverse security assessments furnished to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship in relation to all persons found to be owed protection who remain in prolonged immigration detention. This mechanism will take into account the need to afford appropriate procedural fairness, while also protecting sensitive national security information, and applicants will be entitled to legal representation. The Government does not consider it necessary for special advocates to conduct the review of negative Australian Security Intelligence Organisation assessments.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 13





Legal assistance should be funded at all stages of resolution of people
'
s immigration status, including increased resources for Legal Aid Commissions and IAAAS agents for merits or judicial review.





Not Accepted



Under the National Partnership Agreement on Legal Assistance Services, migration, where assistance is not available from services funded by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, is a Commonwealth legal aid service priority. Eligibility criteria apply to grants of legal aid, and include merits and means tests. The Government continues to monitor the migration litigation workload. 




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 14





Where an interview is to be conducted between the Department of Immigration and a minor that will have ramifications on visa assessment, there must be a legal advocate present or an accredited Independent Third Person present.





Accepted



The Government already provides this type of support to minors through the Immigration Advice and Application Assistance Scheme (IAAAS) and the presence of independent observers.




Immigration Advice and Application Assistance Scheme



The IAAAS provides publicly funded, free independent advice and assistance to asylum seekers, including Irregular Maritime Arrivals (IMAs), for the processing of their refugee claims. 


IAAAS service providers are registered migration agents or officers of Legal Aid Commissions with experience in protection visa legislative, policy and procedural requirements. They are assigned to asylum seekers prior to the commencement of the assessment of their claims. 


Under the terms of the contractual arrangements between the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) and the IAAAS service providers, the service providers have a responsibility to help their clients with the completion and submission of visa or protection obligations determination applications. This includes accompanying their clients to departmental interviews, liaising with DIAC, providing advice on immigration matters, explaining outcomes of applications and providing information and advice on further options available in the event of a refusal decision. 


When IAAAS service providers are providing assistance to minors, DIAC has issued a general instruction that the service provider should act in the best interest of the child. 


IAAAS assistance is also available at the merits review stage, but is not available to those seeking judicial review or ministerial intervention. 


In the case of IMAs in immigration detention in remote locations, DIAC also funds travel for the IAAAS service provider to attend an initial meeting and interview with their clients soon after referral, and ensures appropriate interpreters are available to support all interactions between the IAAAS service provider and their client.




Legal Assistance for Judicial Review



While the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship does not personally provide legal assistance for judicial review to unaccompanied minors for whom he is guardian, they receive information to assist them to seek legal assistance, including accessing Legal Aid Services.




Independent observers



DIAC engages independent observers to attend formal interviews and, at DIAC's discretion, informal meetings and discussions between unaccompanied minors and DIAC and/or other agencies, where concern exists regarding the adult relative's understanding of processes and capability of acting in the best interest of the minor with regards to their physical and emotional wellbeing.


DIAC gives consideration to the ongoing presence of an independent observer for a person who has recently turned 18, particularly where there are concerns regarding the person's level of maturity or level of comprehension of the process. 


The role of the independent observer is to act in the best interest of a minor and ensure that DIAC's and other agencies' treatment of a minor during certain immigration processes is fair, appropriate and reasonable.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 15





People on community detention or bridging visas must be able to make use of public provision of health services and access public referral services.





Partially Accepted



Unlawful non-citizens in community detention (CD) have access to health services commensurate with the Australian community and those living in the community on a Bridging visa with the permission to work, have access to Medicare services.


The health needs of clients in CD are co-ordinated by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship's (DIAC) contracted health services provider, International Health and Medical Services (IHMS), through a network of community-based providers.


Health services in CD include:


IHMS cards to facilitate clients' access to IHMS-approved GPs, specialists and pharmacists in the community; and


access to a range of health services that includes GPs, specialists, allied professionals and pharmacists.


IMAs granted Bridging visas with permission to work have access to Medicare.


The government recognises that some people who are resolving their immigration status in the community while on a Bridging visa and have vulnerabilities that impede resolution of their status may require assistance to address those vulnerabilities. This assistance may be provided through the Community Assistance Support program or Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme. These programs facilitate access to basic medical services equivalent to those provided under Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 16





Families and unaccompanied minors who are placed on bridging visas should be automatically also placed on the Community Assistance Support program.





Not Accepted



The Department of Immigration and Citizenship's (DIAC) case management service assists clients who hold Bridging visas to understand their immigration position and work towards gaining a timely resolution of their immigration status. Case managers assess whether a client has support needs and are eligible for the Community Assistance Support (CAS) program, and will refer a client to CAS if necessary. 


The CAS program provides access to community-based services that provide health and wellbeing support. In the event that a family is placed in the community on a Bridging visa, their needs would be assessed by their case manager and a decision made as to whether they should be referred into CAS.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 17





All asylum seekers on bridging visas should be provided with Commonwealth certified photo identification.





Accepted



The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) has commenced work on the development of a secure ""Evidence of Immigration Status (EIS)"" card for all humanitarian entrants and protection visa applicants who are granted a Bridging visa. 


The EIS will standardise the documentation provided to these clients, strengthen the bond between the card and the card holder and prevent misuse through enhanced security features and use of biometric data. The cards will contain security features that are commensurate with standards articulated in the whole-of-government National Identity Security Strategy. 



The Secure Card Project is prioritised for implementation in April 2013.




Senator Hanson-Young Recommendation 18





All people on bridging visas should have work rights.





Partially Accepted



A Bridging visa is granted to a person to allow them to remain in the community while they resolve their immigration status.


In many cases the appropriate resolution of status for a Bridging visa holder will be departure from Australia. In such circumstances, providing permission to work may encourage individuals to resist departure or encourage frivolous applications for substantive visas, even those which do not themselves confer the permission to work, in the expectation of delivering work rights while they await an outcome. Granting of work rights may also encourage people on substantive visas without work rights to overstay in the hope of being granted a Bridging visa with work rights.


Nonetheless, it is already possible for Bridging visa holders who have compelling reasons to be granted work rights. For example, the Prime Minister and Minister for Immigration and Citizenship jointly announced in November 2011, the expanded use of Bridging E visas with work rights for Irregular Maritime Arrivals.

I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.



The speech read as follows—


The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill 2012 is the third tranche of legislation implementing the Government’s MySuper and governance reforms as part of Stronger Super.  


This Bill amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, the Superannuation Guarantee Administration Act 1992  the Corporations Act 2001 and the Fair Work Act 2009 to implement the remaining measures relating to MySuper, as well as introduce data collection and publication powers for APRA and disclosure requirements for trustees that were announced as part of Stronger Super.  


MySuper is a key part of the Government’s Stronger Super reform package.


Stronger Super also includes reforms to:


make the process of everyday transactions in the super system easier, cheaper and faster through the SuperStream package of measures;


improve the governance and integrity of the superannuation system;


improve integrity and increase community confidence in the self-managed superannuation fund sector.  


MySuper will provide a simple, cost-effective default product that all Australians can rely on.  


MySuper will be limited to a common set of features to make it easier for members, employers and other stakeholders to compare performance across MySuper products, placing downward pressure on fees. 


The Bill comprises seven schedules.


Schedule 1 has new fee rules for superannuation funds that mean conflicted remuneration, such as commissions, cannot be charged in relation to MySuper products, that ban entry fees and limit exit fees, switching fees and buy/sell spreads to cost recovery in all superannuation funds and imposes parameters that must complied with when a trustee agrees to a performance-based fee with an investment manager in relation to a MySuper product.


These rules ensure that members of MySuper products do not pay unnecessary fees, that a trustee does not enter into performance fee arrangements that are not in the member’s best members and limits certain fees to ensure that they do not unfairly inhibit a member from making active choices.


Schedule 2 covers the insurance arrangements for MySuper products.  Trustees will be required to provide members of a MySuper product with life and TPD insurance on an opt-out basis.  


This provides an important safety net to members in MySuper that may not actively consider their insurance needs.


Schedule 3 implements new data collection and publication powers for APRA in relation to superannuation and imposes new disclosure obligations on trustees including publishing their full portfolio holdings and a product dashboard on their website.


Transparency of key performance information is crucial to a competitive and efficient superannuation system.  For this reason, APRA will have new data collection and publication powers in relation to superannuation.


Members are entitled to information about their investments, therefore, superannuation funds will be required to disclose their full portfolio holdings and a product dashboard to provide key information to members at a glance.


The Government will consider broadening this requirement to other managed investments as part of its response to the parliamentary inquiry into the Trio collapse. 


Schedule 4 makes consequential amendments to the Fair Work Act to ensure that only a fund that offers a MySuper product may be nominated in a modern Award or enterprise agreement.


This will ensure that employees that have their contributions directed to a fund nominated in a modern award or an enterprise agreement will benefit from having their contributions placed in a MySuper product if they do not wish to choose another superannuation product.


Schedule 5 exempts defined benefit funds and defined benefit arrangements from the requirements of the MySuper regime.  This will allow defined benefit funds to continue to be used as a default fund by employers.


Defined benefit members are entitled to benefits that are not altered by the charging of fees or the investment strategy adopted.  Therefore, the MySuper regime is not designed to apply to defined benefit arrangements.


Schedule 6 requires trustees of superannuation funds to transfer the accrued default amounts of members to a MySuper product by 1 July 2017.


Moving existing balances to MySuper will ensure that members are able to obtain the benefits of MySuper, in particular a ban on commissions, for their existing superannuation balance as well as for future contributions. 


I am aware that there are some concerns with the definition of the amounts that must be transferred to MySuper.  


However, the Government’s approach is consistent with the recommendations of the Cooper Review and will allow many funds to simply convert their existing default investment options to a MySuper product.


Treasury estimate that the definition in the Bill could result in $90 billion more being moved to MySuper than the approach suggested by stakeholders.  Based on the assumptions of the Cooper review, this translates to approximately $100 million per annum in fees being saved.


Further, all members will be notified before a transfer occurs and will have the right to opt-out of the transfer.  Therefore, no member is forced to transfer their balance to MySuper if they do not want to.  Trustees will have up to four years to communicate with members about their options.


Schedule 7 introduces new authorisation requirements for eligible rollover funds.


This will ensure that APRA is able to assess that eligible rollover funds are meeting their intended objective of reconnecting members with their lost superannuation and are promoting the financial interests of members.


Full details of the Bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2012-11-29,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (17:45):  The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill 2012 is another case study on how this government can seriously mishandle something that is actually a pretty good idea in principle. The concept of legislating basic consumer protection requirements that are important for superannuation products for people who have not made active choices in relation to superannuation arrangements is appropriate. The coalition have supported it in principle for some time. But of course with matters superannuation the devil is always in the detail. If you do not get your set-up right, it can have pretty devastating and significant consequences and significant implications for Australians who are saving for their retirement.


The Cooper review recommended the creation of a legislated default superannuation product, which the government has called MySuper. So far, so good. We have been critical in the past of the disjointed nature in which the government has pursued this pretty significant reform. Rather than introduce one package in one go so that we can assess the merits of this particular change as a whole package, we have had tranche after tranche after tranche dealing with various bits. Some of the bits in this tranche are pretty significant, certainly in the way the bill was initially introduced.


We are talking here of a bill which is more than 100 pages long and it will make some pretty fundamental and, in parts, controversial changes to Australia's superannuation retirement system. The Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation introduced a bill initially, which was in terrible shape and which included provisions which would have had some terribly devastating consequences for people in superannuation funds across Australia. For example, more than one million Australians would have been exposed to an automatic transfer of their superannuation funds—about $43 billion worth of superannuation savings—out of their chosen fund, into the government's legislated MySuper default fund product, without being asked for their prior approval.


That is of course entirely inappropriate. No government should be able to shift people's money out of their chosen superannuation fund into a legislated MySuper default fund without, in particular, seeking people's prior approval, given some of the costly adverse consequences that can flow from that. 


Just to start at the end, yesterday in the House of Representatives Minister Shorten completely and totally backed down from the most controversial change in this legislation, which the coalition criticised from the outset, which was the proposal to force super fund trustees to shift people's superannuation savings, including out of funds where they had exercised active choice, into legislated MySuper default fund products without seeking people's prior approval. He totally backed down. He moved a comprehensive amendment which protected the interests of those Australians, an amendment which had been sought by the coalition as a condition for us not opposing this legislation. 


But why did Minister Shorten get it so fundamentally wrong? Minister Shorten got it so fundamentally wrong for a range of reasons. Firstly, there is his general ideological blind spot, which means that he does not see straight when it comes to superannuation. He takes advice from one segment of the superannuation market when he puts these things together initially and then, when things come apart, he is forced to fix things up as he goes.


But let me talk through the lack of process here, because we have the Minister for Finance and Deregulation in the chamber here. One of the areas of responsibility that Minister Wong has relates to the Office of Best Practice Regulation. One reason why Minister Shorten gets things wrong, whether it is with FoFA, with MySuper or with a range of other things, is that he does not follow proper process. 


I will give you one example: whenever there is a significant regulatory change that is unlikely to pass the government's procedural requirements around regulatory impact assessments, what does he do? He seeks an exemption from the regulatory impact assessment process. Whenever there is a piece of legislation that imposes inappropriate excessive red tape, inappropriate excessive costs, inappropriate and excessive adverse consequences for people across Australia, which should be scrutinised through a proper regulatory impact assessment and a proper cost-benefit analysis, what does Minister Shorten do? He writes to the Prime Minister: 'Can you please give me an exemption from having to submit this piece of legislation through the process that we promised the Australian people we would go through'—and this bit is not written—'because, essentially, I don't think this legislation would pass that sort of scrutiny.'


Minister Shorten introduces flawed legislation. If he had gone through proper consultation with appropriate and representative organisations—not just his friends in the union-dominated industry super funds movement but across the board—and if he had sought proper advice in an unbiased fashion, then he would have been able to pick up some of those flaws much earlier. 


This whole MySuper process has been going on for years. But then Minister Shorten introduced the third tranche of this legislation back in October. Initially, he did not want to have any parliamentary inquiry into it. Initially, he said, 'There is no need for an inquiry.' When we wanted to refer it to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services he did not want that to happen. When it did happen then, all of a sudden, the Labor members on that committee did not want to have a hearing. They wanted to have it all done within a week.


We had to suggest to them that, if there was not a proper hearing, we would report that to the parliament and seek the support of the crossbenchers to judge the merits of this legislation as a result—and that changed their mind. In the end they rolled over on that. In the end the PJC had a half-day hearing where we were able to hear from very important witnesses like the Financial Services Council and others for just 30 minutes each. There were half a dozen people wanting to ask questions about a bill that is making substantial changes to people's superannuation arrangements, with significant consequences for the way their retirement savings develop into the future, and we had 30 minutes per witness in a half-day hearing. It was completely and inappropriately rushed.


It gets worse. This is all on the public record. Labor members of the committee in their majority report said, 'Just pass the bill.' It came down to coalition members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services to identify the many and serious flaws that needed fixing. Yesterday, at the last possible minute, the government rolled over and made the sorts of changes that we were after. This was a significant policy victory for us on behalf of Australians who are planning for their retirement and were at risk of having their savings transferred automatically and without their prior approval to a government legislated MySuper account.


This bill, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill, requires that trustees transfer so-called accrued default amounts to a MySuper product. These are supposed to be retirement savings where a member has not exercised choice, but the bill as originally drafted went much further than that. It would have changed the investment strategy of many Australians by forcing the transfer of potentially large amounts of money from funds where individuals had made a clear and active choice about their superannuation to a MySuper default product without the need for prior approval from the individual concerned.


Yesterday in the House of Representatives, the coalition secured comprehensive amendments from the government to resolve this and other issues. Why didn't Labor members on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services see the overwhelming evidence that there were serious flaws in this legislation? Why didn't Senator Thistlethwaite look at the evidence that was before us when we went through this inquiry? Why didn't government members see what we all could see and what the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation finally had to concede—that what the government was proposing was entirely inappropriate?


Quite frankly, if an individual Australian has made any sort of choice in relation to their super fund arrangements, it is none of the government's business to force transfer of their superannuation savings into any other account without seeking people's prior approval. The only exception to that that the parliament has agreed to in the past is in relation to very small amount accounts—accounts of less than $1,000—where, of course, the issue of fees and so on arises and where there is a public benefit in merging people's accounts in order to minimise the level of fees. But, as a general rule, if in the past somebody has been contributing, year in, year out, with their superannuation contributions paid by their employers into a superannuation fund that they have chosen specifically, it is none of the government's business to interfere with that.


In our view, the truth of the matter is that Bill Shorten has shown once again that he is not on top of his portfolio. Maybe he has too much on his plate. He is the minister for unions and the minister for union dominated super funds. Then, of course, he is the minister who has to run the occasional defence for the Prime Minister and who has to do a whole series of other political things as he continues to climb that Labor ladder of opportunity. He fought against having any inquiry into this bill when the coalition tried to have it referred to the corporations and financial services committee. Despite the rushed inquiry, coalition members on the PJC identified serious flaws which the government now has had to acknowledge and act upon with significant last minute amendments. Bill Shorten should have done his homework from the start. Labor members of the parliamentary joint committee should have recognised that the evidence about massive flaws in Mr Shorten's initial MySuper bill was overwhelming. Minister Shorten had seven weeks from the time the committee reported to draft his amendments. Instead, he has waited until the second last day of sitting for the year to start consulting with industry about an actual government amendment. So there was quite a flurry of activity yesterday to get the amendment right. Why did it take so long? This process has been going on for years. At the last minute, having rejected the need for an inquiry, he has completely and utterly rolled over and fully accepted all of the coalition's sensible and very constructive recommendations to fix this bill, as set out in our dissenting inquiry report.


This is no way to run a portfolio, especially a portfolio that deals with the retirement savings of Australians. Without the changes secured by the coalition, many Australians with superannuation in affected accounts would have faced costly adverse consequences, including being exposed to transaction costs and fees as assets had to be sold and repurchased in the new fund as the forced transfer was happening, potentially being placed into a fund with lower returns or higher fees, potentially being placed into a fund with a higher risk investment profile, and being exposed to the risk of losing life and/or total and permanent disability insurance.


The coalition succeeded yesterday in forcing the government to amend this bill and so the bill that is before the Senate now is the amended bill, as amended by the House of Representatives, so that a member who has previously exercised choice cannot be automatically transferred into a MySuper product by having previous contributions defined as an accrued default amount. The coalition has also achieved amendments to the legislation to avoid a potentially serious constitutional issue.


The bill as drafted did have the potential to break existing contractual arrangements and there was potential for legal challenge for breaching section 51 of the Constitution, the section that deals with the acquisition of property on just terms. Whilst the government has seen sense at the very last minute, this mess could have been avoided by proper process and proper consideration before the legislation was put before the parliament. It again shows, as I said at the beginning, that Bill Shorten's approach to running his portfolio is rather shambolic and disorganised, and that is why he has to keep fixing things on the run.


There is, of course, another problem with this bill. The government is introducing this MySuper default product but says at the same time—and it was said yesterday by the government in the debate about the changes to the Fair Work Act—that these products are not good enough as default products. I see Senator Thistlethwaite over there looking a bit intrigued and concerned about the fact that somebody on the government side would have said that, but that is exactly what Senator Jacinta Collins said yesterday. She said that to allow employers to choose any MySuper product as a default product for their employees would actually expose those employees to the risk that the employer would not act in the best interests of the employees in the MySuper product of their choosing.


Our argument here is that we support the creation of this default fund product, legislated as we are progressing it here today. But we think any product that qualifies for registration as a MySuper default fund product, because it complies with all the consumer protection requirements the government thought were necessary and that have hence been included in this legislation, should be able to compete freely in the default fund market. There is no need for an additional level of red tape, for an additional level of government intervention on top of that.


If the government believe they got this legislation right, if the government believe that this legislation has in it all the consumer protection requirements that are necessary for a default fund product, then why are they scared of competition between any such product that qualifies for registration as such a default fund product? And of course the reason is very clear. It is because the process the government put in place when the Fair Work Act was first established is a process that inappropriately favours union dominated industry super funds. It is a widely discredited process through Fair Work Australia that is anti-competitive and closed-shop. It is a process that is littered with inherent conflicts, with conflicted parties who act at the same time as delegates for unions for employer bodies and as super fund trustees in the super funds listed on the modern awards.


Even the government, in the lead-up to the last election, had to concede that it was an inappropriate process, which is why they made a promise, in August 2010—and Senator Thistlethwaite, I encourage you to have a look at the Labor Party's superannuation policy in the last election—in the lead-up to the last election that they would change it. They recognised that the system, the way it was, was broken and inappropriate and that there was a need for an open, transparent and competitive process for selection of default funds on the modern awards and other relevant industrial instruments, and that they would do that. It took Minister Shorten forever, but eventually he got around to calling a Productivity Commission review. But of course, as the Productivity Commission was halfway through their process, he intervened and made sure that the Productivity Commission understood that free and open competition was not an option. He stopped them in their tracks after they recommended genuine competition in the interim report. He responded to the review before it had finally reported in order to prevent the opening up of default super fund arrangements to genuine competition.


That is why the coalition will move amendments again here today to ensure that any MySuper product can compete freely in the default super fund market. It is because, strangely, the coalition has more confidence in the MySuper product structure than the Labor Party seems to have. The Labor Party seems to think that Fair Work Australia has to do another check on the MySuper products that are registered under this legislation. It is just a ridiculous proposition, which is why we are moving our amendments.

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2012-11-29,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (18:05):  It is appropriate that one of the final bills that this Senate debates in the course of this year is a further addition to the government's reforms to superannuation. This bill, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill 2012, is the third tranche in a series of reforms aimed at strengthening our superannuation system, providing greater transparency, accountability, efficiency and ultimately productivity for members and funds throughout the country. Before this, the Senate approved the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (MySuper Core Provisions) Bill and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill. Each of these two bills includes elements to implement the Stronger Super arrangements, to implement a low-cost and simple superannuation product that will replace the existing default superannuation funds.


This bill introduces a number of very important reforms to superannuation, particularly in relation to the abolition of fees relating to commission payments and the establishment of the rules for intrafund advice and for collection of disclosure of information by APRA and greater information for members.


In respect of fees relating to commission payments, an applicant for a registered superannuation entity applying to offer a MySuper product must elect that they will not charge any member a fee regarding the MySuper product, that relates directly or indirectly to conflicted remuneration to a financial service licensee. Importantly, there is a second part of that election, and that requires the applicant to prohibit a registered superannuation entity licensee from paying premiums on insurance policies that have embedded commissions.


In respect of performance based fees this law sets five criteria that must be contained in the terms of an arrangement the fund has with an investment manager. Those criteria include that fees are appropriate to the investment to which they relate, measured by performance of a similar investment product; are determined on an after-cost or after-tax basis; and include disincentives for poor performance.


In respect of intrafund advice—this is advice which is dispensed to members for which the cost can be covered across the full membership of the fund—restrictions on the types of personal advice that superannuation trustees can charge across the membership are introduced. A trustee is not able to charge across membership for personal advice if the person has not acquired a beneficial interest in the fund or the advice relates to a product other than a pension fund or a cash management facility, or the advice relates to consolidation, or if the advice relates to ongoing personal advice.


Collective charging for advice is allowed if it is related to a pension fund, a related insurance product or a cash management facility. Built into these laws are regulations for further circumstances to be added with respect to intrafund advice. So, again, we are tightening up the criteria for the charging of intrafund advice so that members of superannuation funds are not burdened with unnecessary costs.


General fees can only be charged in respect of an advice fee, an activity fee and an insurance fee. But all must be charged on a cost-recovery basis. Entry fees, under this legislation, will be banned and certain buy-sell spreads, switching fees and exit fees can only be charged on a cost-recovery basis. The bill also, importantly, deals with insurance in relation to MySuper products, and it stipulates that the trustee must provide MySuper members with death and permanent incapacity insurance to a minimum level unless the member opts out or the fund permits a lower level of life insurance. 


One of the highlights and strengths of this bill is greater disclosure and collection powers for APRA with respect to information that relates to super fund members. Superannuation is a compulsory system of retirement savings, so it is entirely appropriate that superannuation licensees do everything that they reasonably can to ensure that there is complete transparency for financial product members in respect of the fund that they have an equitable interest in. To achieve this, APRA will be given additional powers to collect additional data from superannuation licensees. And APRA will be required to publish this data on a quarterly basis on their website and ensure that information relating to returns, fees and costs of all MySuper products is available to the public. 


The bill also introduces the notion of a product dashboard—an easy, simple to understand, publicly available portal that superannuation funds must provide to their members and members of the public. The information that will be required to be provided on the product dashboard will include the investment return target, the number of times the current target has been met in the last 10 years for the particular fund, the level of investment risk, the statement of liquidity of the fund and the average amount of fees and other costs. Funds will also have to disclose the remuneration of directions and executive officers of the fund. 


So, once again, we are improving the amount of information and the transparency associated with the management of the fund for members. The bill deals with the listing of particular MySuper funds in modern awards. Senator Cormann has made some comments about this and the fact that the opposition still cannot get over the fact that industry super funds offer better value for money, lower fees, better net investment returns and lower commissions for members.


This has been proven over many years, and when the coalition sought to introduce choice of superannuation fund legislation they believed that there would be an exodus from superannuation funds that were managed by industry bodies and those that involved joint management, but again they were wrong. In fact, people tended to move to industry funds because of their superior performance.


What the government has done with respect to modern awards in this bill is adopt the recommendations of the Productivity Commission. In conjunction with the reforms that have been passed by the Senate relating to the Fair Work Act, that will provide for default funds to be listed in awards that must be authorised to provide a MySuper product. 


The point that Senator Cormann fails to recognise and disclose to the Senate is the fact that every employee has the choice of which fund they pay their superannuation into. When anyone begins a job these days they get two forms—an employment declaration form relating to a tax file number and a choice of superannuation fund. Even when we begin as senators here we get a choice as to which superannuation fund we contribute. It is a choice all Australian employees have. Employees have the choice as to which fund they pay into; it just happens to be the fact that most employees choose to pay into industry based funds because of their superior performance. 


The bill also deals with defined benefit funds, and exempts certain employers from making contributions into MySuper funds if their employees are being looked after in terms of their contributions being made into a defined benefit fund. Importantly, the bill also deals with the process of transition from current default funds into the MySuper regime. These transitional provisions ensure that by 1 July 2017 all employees in default superannuation funds have made the transition into a lower cost, more competitive and efficient MySuper product. The amounts that are transferred are referred to as 'accrued default amounts'. The amounts that will be transferred as accrued default amounts will be amounts where a member has not exercised investment choice or amounts held in a default investment option for the fund.


As Senator Cormann has mentioned, the government has agreed in the House of Representatives to amendments to the original legislation that would exclude funds held in cash, in particular funds where the member has directed the fund to hold those funds in cash for whatever period. Of course a member can opt out of the transfer process in writing at any time. The provisions also deal with eligible rollover funds and their basis as a temporary repository for the interests of members who have lost connection with their superannuation accounts. Schedule 7 of the bill amends the SI(S) Act to require trustees to obtain authorisation from APRA to operate an eligible rollover fund.


That is a summary of the provisions of the bill. Again, they deliver on this government's commitment to make superannuation in this country simpler, more affordable, more efficient and easy to understand. It is part of the government's commitment to providing a stronger superannuation system; to ensuring that as our population ages, as it places more and more pressure on our social security system, we are growing the nest egg of retirement savings, but we are also doing that in a manner that is fair for employees and provides greater efficiency for members of superannuation funds and, indeed, the business community as a pool of investment funds. I commend this very important bill to the Senate, and I congratulate Minister Bill Shorten for his excellent stewardship of the government's MySuper reforms over the course of this year.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2012-11-29,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (18:17):  I was about to congratulate Senator Cormann for his ability to fix the legislation that was so poorly put together by Minister Shorten in the first place. We have, yet again, a piece of incompetent legislation. The only thing we can say about this legislation is that in the form it is now in, with the coalition's amendments to it accepted, it is a far better attempt at legislation than the unclaimed moneys legislation was.


But I would like firstly to look at a couple of the points that Senator Thistlethwaite made. As I pointed out, this bill in its original draft would have changed the investment strategy of many Australians by forcing the transfer of potentially very large amounts of money from funds where individuals had made a clear and active choice about their superannuation to a MySuper default product without the need for prior approval from the individual concerned. The coalition has now got some amendments to resolve this and other issues.


As for congratulating Minister Shorten, we need to keep in mind that this legislation, Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill, was originally introduced in September this year into the House of Representatives. It was only that Minister Shorten was forced to look at how bizarre some of his suggestions were, how anti-competitive they were and how they were quite likely to lead to constitutional challenges that forced him, finally, to have a look at the amendments that we were suggesting. We have a timetable on this legislation, the stronger superannuation legislation, of which this is the third tranche, which started with regulatory impact statements being done in September 2011. Long before any of the final versions of the legislation were available, some aspects of the legislation were quite deliberately exempted from the regulatory impact statement. The Office of Best Practice Regulation points out:


The Prime Minister granted exemptions from the requirements for regulatory impact analysis in relation to the ability of funds to offer tailored MySuper products to employees with more than 500 employees, and extension to the date by which trustees will be required to have transferred the balance of existing default funds into MySuper products.


So we have the regulatory impact statements in September 2011, long before original legislation of any type was available—particularly in relation to this third tranche. This bill was brought into the House of Representatives on 19 September 2012 and now, on the last day of sitting, we have bills being gagged so that Minister Shorten can get this piece of legislation through to please his friends in the industry funds.


I do not think any of that is a matter for congratulations. Nor is the fact that, as deputy chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, there was an attempt made for an inquiry not to be held into this legislation on the basis that we had already had lots of inquiries into Stronger Super. Every time a new piece of legislation with new requirements in it is brought to this house, I believe that the corporations and financial services committee, which has in the main had a long and proud reputation of examining legislation in a bipartisan way, should review it.


Certainly our review of this legislation, very brief as it was given the highly truncated reporting period that Minister Shorten allowed on the bill, found serious flaws, which finally the government has acknowledged and has now acted on with these five to midnight amendments. At least they are earlier than the 10 past midnight changes that need to occur with the unclaimed money bill. Minister Shorten should have done his homework from the start. This is a mess. 


I was somewhat displeased to hear Senator Thistlethwaite doing a free advertisement for industry funds and recreate the fable around the cheapness, efficiency et cetera of industry funds. He probably belled the cat in terms of the fact that this government would love to force everyone into industry funds. That would be their optimum way of proceeding, because that way there would be so much more money available for unions to conduct business however they like, not what is in the best interests of employees or employers—or in fact the economy of the country.


The mistake that was going to come through under the original 'accrued default amount' definition in this legislation was that all existing default fund accounts, as well as the balances of individuals who had previously exercised choice of fund but who remained in the default investment option of their chosen fund, would be swept up into the new default MySuper product. Minister Shorten and others initially claimed that this is because this is what the Cooper review has said. But the Financial Services Council submission to the very brief inquiry that the Corporations and Financial Services Committee held pointed out that in fact what the government was proposing had gone way past what was proposed in the Cooper review. I quote from the FSC submission:


Through the Cooper Review and the Stronger Super … consultation in 2011, it was not contemplated at any time that choice superannuation funds would be subject to default/MySuper transitional arrangements.


According to the Cooper Review:


The major difference in the choice architecture model is the clear distinction to be made between MySuper and choice products, as either may be offered by large APRA funds. The Panel's broad starting point in relation to the choice architecture model is that, as far as is reasonably possible, if the trustee of a large APRA fund does not wish for a product to comply with MySuper or ERF criteria, the product should continue to operate much as it currently does.


We are talking about APRA approved funds. The FSC submission continued:


A choice product trustee would be able to determine the extent to which it differs from a MySuper product in relation to the offer of investment choices, intra-fund advice or retirement products, among other features. This is appropriate and will allow the creation of a competitive choice sector. 


Well, the last thing this government wants is competition in this area or for people to have the ability to make their own choices about where their superannuation goes. It is just obscene the efforts that are being put into forcing as much of employees' superannuation funds as possible into the industry funds and therefore into the supporters of the Labor government. 


We only need to look at some of the current cases to suggest why this is not a good idea. For example, we have the CFMEU telling Cbus, CFMEU's superannuation vehicle, that if they do not stop investing in Grocon the CFMEU will go and find a different superannuation provider. Well! Every individual shareholder in Australia has the right to look at the ethics of the investment strategy of the body that they are involved in and choose to pull out their funds. But it is quite a different matter when a union attempts to blackmail an industry fund because of what they choose to invest in. It is quite fine for a shareholder to look at the ethical propositions put in terms of investment by a superannuation fund or any other body, but only to look at the ethical framework, not to start saying, 'If you invest in company A or company B we will pull our money out.' Of course, the CFMEU directing that all their members' funds come out and an individual shareholder pulling out of a company are quite different. 


It is one of the many, many reasons that we currently need far better legislation to look at industry funds and look at the way they are regulated—and to consider that in fact they should have the same need to be overseen as public boards. It is a really serious problem that we currently have in this area. It just adds to the concerns that are raised by other problems that have developed within the Health Services Union and the AWU in recent weeks that suggest that we really do need to have a full judicial inquiry into the way the unions and industry funds run their association at the present time. There is just too much room there for corruption and for lack of transparency. 


This government legislation, before it was amended, certainly was in no way assisting in developing transparency; it was only designed to assist the growth of industry funds and to do it—believe it or not—without even the approval of individuals being sought when their superannuation was moved out of one fund into another. It is beyond belief that the government thought they would get away with this. 


Some people have suggested that this is very rushed legislation on Minister Shorten's part. I think in fact it was quite a deliberate strategy that he hoped no-one would pick up. I am pleased to say that he was completely wrong in that and that there has been a lot of concern, particularly about the constitutionality of what he initially proposed in this area.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2012-11-29,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (19:00):  Madam Acting Deputy President Boyce, could I just take this opportunity before I start talking on the bill to wish you and all the other senators a very merry Christmas and all the best for next year. Could I also mention the staff, not only the staff who work so hard for the senators in this place but also the Senate staff, those who help with the operation of this establishment, who really work hard. It has been a great learning experience for me in my 4½ years, coming from the farm and small business and so on, always having the attitude of, 'Oh, public servants. They do nothing.' That was until I came to this place and saw them walk in at seven in the morning and walking out at 11 pm and midnight. They are also so professional in their work, and I would like to thank the Clerk and all associated staff for the wonderful work they do here in the Senate.


The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill 2012 is the third tranche of legislation implementing a recommendation of the Cooper review into Australia's superannuation system to introduce a new, low-cost superannuation product known as MySuper to replace existing default superannuation fund products. I will commend the Labor government for introducing superannuation many years ago, and, of course, following governments for maintaining it. I believe we are now heading towards $1.4 trillion put away in superannuation—a huge amount of money. Sadly, after the global financial crisis set in in 2007-08, with the crash of the stock market the value of that superannuation went down enormously.


Hopefully, with good times ahead, good government, and a return to success in the private sector we will see those shares return to some of their higher levels. No doubt by the time those who are very young, 20, 21 and 22, come to retire at the age of—who knows: 67, 70—they will have a good stack of money put away to get them through their retirement and relieve the burden from the taxpayer. We know now of the shortage of government money. We see the government debt. We see, sadly, lack of business confidence in Australia. This is largely a result of many of the things this government has done, but hopefully that business confidence will return. Even growth has been forecast for next year and the year after, according to Westpac's economists. Hopefully we will return to those days of growth where people could fulfil their life's dream of owning their own home, putting enough away in their super and retiring where they could be financially secure without relying on the fellow taxpayers of our nation.


It is quite alarming, I know, being in small business and employing people. Super does cost. Of course, when it was phased in, workers did sacrifice wage increases to get their super in line. I want to make a point here about the talk of raising super from nine to 12 per cent and, even as former Prime Minster Paul Keating suggests, to 15 per cent. The former Prime Minister is suggesting a two-phase superannuation system, with phase 1 there to support those of the ages from 60 to 80 in retirement and phase 2 going from 12 per cent to 15 per cent, where three per cent of that money will be put into a government backed longevity fund to help pay for the needs of the over-80s. I have some serious reservations about that.


People work and put their super together. Who is going to pay for it to rise to 15 per cent under former Prime Minister Keating's plan? You cannot make business pay. Already we are seeing too many businesses in Australia trying to compete against overseas businesses where the labour is very cheap—places like China and other parts of Asia, as well as Africa, where we have a high Australian dollar which has been brought by money pouring into our country and being invested in Treasury bonds to finance the $253 billion gross debt that this government has built up. We see money coming here as our Reserve Bank cash rate is still over three per cent, when many of the official cash rates around the world are zero or just a bit above. So investors see Australia as somewhere they can get a good return, hence the market of the Australian dollar. The sentiment has been bullish for many years now and we have seen the Australian dollar trading by parity, making it very hard for people in rural and regional Australia who rely on income from exports, whether it be the grains industries, the export beef market or even the dairy industry, which produces some nine billion litres of milk each year. In Australia we only consume around 4½ billion litres a year, so we rely heavily on exports and that high Australian dollar is hurting us.


The point I make is that when we are tinkering with super and talking about increases, we cannot make the businesses pay for it. I remember when I was in small business that I paid my employees' super but I did not have any myself. A lot of people in small business are like that. As they should, they pay award and often above award wages to their workers. But often the owner of the business gets the smallest slice of the cake. They do not receive wages from the business when times are tough and they do not have super. I came into this place at the age of 53 years old with $1,650 worth of super, which is not much when you get to the age of 53. I put $4,000 away in a super fund during the wool boom of the late eighties-early nineties. Then I could not contribute anymore, and that $4,000 just shrunk down with fees until I cashed it in and put the little bit left, $1,650, in with my AGEST super.


Getting back to this legislation. The bill, as originally drafted, would have changed the investment strategy of many Australians by forcing the transfer of potentially large amounts of money from funds where individuals have made a clear and active choice about their superannuation to a MySuper default product without the need for prior approval from the individual concerned. That is concerning.


However, on this occasion the coalition has scored a significant policy victory for Australians planning for their retirement who were at risk of having their savings transferred automatically, without their prior approval, to a government-legislated MySuper account—just automatically. The coalition has secured amendments from the government to resolve this and other issues.


Minister Bill Shorten wanted to rush this flawed legislation through in early October. But the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services held an inquiry and reported on 9 October. This is one of the huge criticisms I have with this government: rushing things. We look at the stimulus package, and the crazy $42 billion, where money was simply rushed out into the economy. We go back to the $900 handouts, which was to stimulate the economy. Sadly, much of that money went into poker machines or buying things like televisions and luxury items, most of which—in fact, I could say with confidence: all of those electrical items—were made overseas. It was a stimulus package for China; that is what the stimulus package was. And it was rushed, of course, through the school buildings program; with the absolute mess in New South Wales by the previous government managing that school buildings stimulus package. Small buildings, which I would say would be worth about $120,000, were being constructed at a cost of $330,000 and more.


There has been plenty of toing and froing over amendments in this legislation. That is what you get when a minister tries to rush legislation through. It was all too rushed. I ask the question: why rush in the MySuper? Is it about the super funds that the unions are involved with that seem to be very friendly to the Australian Labor Party? Is that what was behind the original rush of Minister Bill Shorten, when he attempted to bring this legislation in some time back?


The current process for the selection of default funds under modern awards, initiated by this government and run by Fair Work Australia, lacks transparency. It is littered with inherent conflicts and inappropriately favours union dominated industry super funds. And that is a great concern: the union dominated industry super funds. I was a member of a union once—in February 1978. We had a drought in 1977 in South Australia and I went out shearing to pay the bills. It was not long after a state election in South Australia when the then Premier Don Dunstan was re-elected, and his campaign was 'Unionism is not compulsory'. So we were shearing at Carriewerloo Station, 17 miles out of Port Augusta, from memory—in fact, the shearing shed where they made the film Sunday Too Far Away, with Jack Thompson, which I am sure many people have seen. When the rep came in he said to me, 'Have you got a union ticket, mate?' I said no. He said, 'Do you want me to take it out of your wages or do you want to pay me now?' I said, 'The Premier said unionism is not compulsory'. He said, 'Well, it's not compulsory—either buy a ticket or leave the shed; take your pick.'




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Sounds like an AWA!




Senator WILLIAMS:
  The Australian Workers Union, AWU.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  No, a workplace agreement.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  No, this was compulsory unionism under the Dunstan government. So, anyway, they took the price of a ticket out of my wages and ironically, next shed, they made me the union rep! This bloke came up to me and said, 'I haven't got a ticket; will you get me one?' I said, 'I wouldn't know where to get them, mate; get your own.' That was my 12 months in the Australian Workers Union. I saw how the union movement worked then: it was hold a gun at your head or leave the shearing shed—as simple as that. If you did not join the union, you had to leave your job. It was a terrible situation. Of course, the then Labor Premier Don Dunstan, now the late Don Dunstan—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  A great man!




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I won't take that interjection—I will get into an argument!




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Boyce
):  That is good, Senator Williams—don't!




Senator WILLIAMS:
  And of course he was wrong with his election campaign that unionism was not compulsory. I found from personal experience—which is all I have to offer this place at any time—that unionism was compulsory.


We talk about transparency. Remember the last election? This government would be honest, transparent, tell-all, true to the Australian people—I think that during the campaign we saw the real Ms Julia Gillard. We had seen a few Ms Julia Gillards as the weeks had gone on, and people like Mark Latham were doing a good job in regard to the coalition's campaign; others were leaking here, there and everywhere—and transparency was the big thing.


Union members must ask themselves a question these days: what do they get from their union? I wonder what the lady tonight working in the country hospital cleaning the toilets and the bathrooms, and a member of the Health Services Union, is getting for her union fees. These are the battlers, the essential ones who work in our hospitals. They must be absolutely disgusted with what has been revealed has happened to their funds—absolutely disgusted. And no doubt in the future, if it is not happening now, we will see a mass walk-out of the union movement because of the disgusting and dreadful way that their members are being treated. I won't go onto the Australian Workers Union—I was a member for 12 months, remember. I also remember a bloke telling me, 'You must resign when you are a financial member or they'll sue you.' I said, 'Sue away, you can't get blood out of a stone.'


But back to the legislation. Even Labor has had to finally recognise that, in its 2010 pre-election policy on superannuation, when they promised the introduction of an open, transparent and competitive process to select default funds under modern awards. I take a lot of credence out of what Senate committee reports do—a good part of this place is the Senate committee inquiries into legislation. This piece in the coalition's dissenting report struck me. I will read it out to you, Madam Acting Deputy President. This is from the dissenting report of the coalition senators into the inquiry into this legislation:


Only a half-day hearing was set aside—


That is how important this legislation is: have a half-a-day hearing for the Senate committee to inquire into it. 


with witnesses limited to just 30 minutes for each organisation—


If we talk about the rush, look at how you have rushed the Senate committee inquiry into this. Half a day for the hearing, 30 minutes for witnesses. 


meaning the full range of issues has not been publicly canvassed.


It is as simple as that.


Worse still, committee members have only had days in which to assess the very complex evidence presented and draft reports and recommendations.


Transparency? Honesty? Those are words we hear from the Prime Minister at election time. Rush it through with a half-day hearing and 30 minutes for witnesses. It looks to me as though the government did not want this legislation to be scrutinised. That is what I must conclude. Surely, why not a proper Senate committee investigation? This is a big new paradigm we were told we would get when the Greens and the Independents propped up the Labor government. Mr Oakeshott said, 'It's going to be ugly but it's going to be beautiful. It's going to be a wonderful government.' Yes, let's rush things through.


Today, the government gives us just 90 minutes to debate this legislation. There are 76 senators in this place who potentially might wish to speak on this bill. But no, the guillotine will drop in 90 minutes. The bill is 100 pages long, so we are giving 90 minutes to a bill a hundred pages long—that is not even a minute a page.




Senator Edwards:
  Even less: it is 45 minutes.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Forty-five. It has been reduced now. Back to that dissenting report, and I quote:


Given the significant implications of this legislation, including adverse financial consequences for a material number of individual super fund members, Coalition members and senators recommend that:


The government withdraw this bill pending further consultation across the superannuation industry to address the serious flaws identified in this rushed inquiry and to allow for the preparation of a full Regulatory Impact Statement for the whole bill actually before the parliament, which is compliant with the government's own best practice regulation requirements.


But no. It has been a rushed inquiry, half a day of hearings, 30 minutes to witnesses and rush, rush, rush. This was a mess from the start when Minister Shorten tried to rush it through some time back. Luckily, the coalition under the guidance of my colleague Senator Cormann have made some sensible alterations to this legislation, sensible amendments that will make a rushed program perhaps a little bit better.


In conclusion, superannuation is vital. As our population grows, with the baby boomers being the biggest sector of our population, if they cannot fund themselves in retirement it means more drain on the taxpayers—the working people of Australia. Those taxpayers already have enough drain on them because they have one hell of a debt to pay for now, with interest. The shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey says it could be up to $12 billion a year in interest only—$12,000 million must be found before one public servant is paid, before one Australian soldier receives any sort of entitlement, before one age pensioner receives $1. That is the financial stress we have been put under under this government. That is why we need people in the future to be self-sufficient in their retirement. Let us hope that the confidence to the private sector, to the stock market does return. I do feel sorry for those who have just gone into retirement claiming their super after the crash of the global financial crisis, brought about by ridiculous, stupid bank lending in the United States.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2012-11-29,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (19:19):  I am very pleased to contribute to this debate on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill 2012. Unfortunately, I will have to curtail my time because I know there are so many of my colleagues who want to make a contribution to what is a very particular piece of legislation, one that requires far more scrutiny than we are able to give it in the very constrained time that has been allowed by the government and the Greens political party.


It is good to see at least that the Greens are in the chamber for the debate. I say to Senator Ludlam that we are constrained in this debate, because you and your Labor Party mates have guillotined this and many other bills through the parliament. Senator, I am not sure whether you were here but in the Howard government's time when we, on about five occasions, time managed a bill we would then have hour-long contributions by the then Senator Brown, your former leader, and, I think, from Senator Ludlam about how awful and how undemocratic it was, and how the world was coming to an end, because the Howard government time managed two or three bills when those were essential for Australia.




Senator Ludlam:
  I was here.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  You were here? You were. Well, have a look at the hours spent on Work Choices. Have a look at the hours spent on the Regional Forestry Agreements bill. At any suggestion of curtailment you would have the Greens up one after the other telling the Senate how undemocratic, how awful the coalition was and yet here, in this year of the record number of guillotines, have you heard one peep from the Greens? Not one peep! In fact, that is not unusual because they were there providing the majority for the Labor Party. 


Why do Australians take no notice of the Labor Party? Because they are led by a Prime Minister—a leader of the Labor Party—who deliberately told untruths to the Australian public before the last election. Why are Australians no longer listening to the Greens?—if you need evidence of that have a look at even the ACT election—because they see the complete hypocrisy of the Greens political party. If the coalition does something, it is bad, evil, the end of the world, but if the Labor Party does exactly the same thing then it is okay and they will support it.




Senator Ludlam:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order, I wonder if you would care to draw Senator Macdonald's attention to the question that is actually before the chair.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Boyce
):  There is no point of order. Senator Macdonald is speaking to the bill. However, Senator Macdonald, I would ask you to direct some of your comments, please, to the actual bill itself and the content of the bill.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, thank you for that. When I was interrupted I was saying this bill is all about MySuper. One element of it is converting more superannuation when people do not know that it is happening to the union super fund. I have not noticed those from the Labor Party who have spoken declare conflicts of interest, I might say. I know at least one senator who was at the top end of town—he sat on the board of directors of these very big insurance companies. And I suspect there are many others. Perhaps during the course of the debate Labor senators will indicate which of them as union officials, for no other reason—none of them had any great expertise in the superannuation or insurance industry—than that they were union bosses, suddenly ended up in the boardrooms of some of the biggest financial companies in Australia. They were all getting quite substantial fees.


How do I know that? Because the wink-and-nod arrangement was that, if you were a union official who sat on the board of one of these super companies, the only reason you were there—it was not the quota in that instance—



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I can talk about quotas over there. You were only there because you were a union official. The rule was that, if you got $40,000, $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 or $150,000—I do not know what they got—as a director because you were a union official the money was to go into the union. But of course a couple of them—who can blame Mr Thomson—got a little greedy and did not follow the rules. The money they got, and I think in that case—I should not mention it because I am not sure of the facts; I thought it was over $100,000 but it might have been $80,000—




Senator Conroy:
  The one you need to speak to is Kathy Jackson—your heroine.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Macdonald, ignore the interjections.



Senator Conroy interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Stop the interjections, please, Senator Conroy.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Senator Conroy will have an opportunity later, and I hope he uses that. It seems to me that he is defending Mr Thomson. I do not know whether it is true or not. But Fair Work Australia, which Senator Conroy and his team set up and filled up with ex-union officials, even said Mr Thomson was using lowly paid member's money for brothels and free trips around the world. That is not from me—I would not make those allegations. Fair Work Australia, made up of union officials that Senator Conroy and his mates appointed have determined that, not me. And in the shades of that, this case that I am talking about went to court. The union sued this director of a company because he did not follow the arrangement to put the money into the kit.




Senator Conroy:
  Do you think he kept it in plastic bags in his backyard?




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  It got to an interesting stage in the court case, and then do you know what happened? It was settled. Would you believe that? It was settled.



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  So the full facts could not come out, there was not a full-scale court case, and we were never to know what the deal was, who got it. Senator Conroy, if I am wrong on this, please use your opportunity in the debate to tell me this court case that I relate did not happen. You might tell me how it ended up; I do not know, because it just sort of disappeared.


This bill in part of its operations has the impact of favouring the union super funds. I would like to know how many of my colleagues opposite were actually directors of these union super funds.




Senator Cormann:
  Mr Shorten was.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Mr Shorten was. I do not know that; I take your word, Senator Cormann. I am pretty certain he would have been. I wonder how much he got paid in a top-end-of-town job as a director of a very big insurance company.



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Senator Conroy, you can tell me whether he did the right thing and put his director's fees into whatever union he was representing at the time. I would be interested in that. I think it is relevant to this bill, because since this government has been in power there has been quite a number of pieces of legislation dealing with the superannuation industry and the insurance industry.


In fact, I know all of us, including Labor members, were approached by groups of financial advisors, people who deal in the superannuation industry—honest, God-fearing family men, many of them in small businesses in small country towns like the town where I live—who were offended that the Labor Party were saying they were all crooks. As they brought in this legislation that we are debating now, there was a slur cast on these people, who in many cases I know are pillars of the financial advice industry. They are good people. It was a good industry. They gave good and valuable advice. But the Labor Party, and one can only surmise why, were hell-bent on making the public wary of these small businessmen and women.


When you see legislation like this, when you see union officials and former senators sitting in the big end of town around the boardroom table getting big director's fees for their involvement in union super funds, you can only wonder about the rash of legislation before us.


I did want to start my contribution by laughing at Senator Thistlewaite's congratulations for Mr Shorten on this bill.


Anything funnier I do not think I have heard, though someone said Julia was honest and I found that pretty funny.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, you must use the correct title of the member.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Someone said the Prime Minister was honest and we all know that before the last election she showed anything but honesty.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, you need to be careful not reflect on the character of a person in the other house.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Perhaps I should relate the facts. Here is a leader of the Labor Party who promised hand on heart that there would be no carbon tax under a government that she led and then the first bit of legislation is a carbon tax. If she had not made that promise on the eve of the election, she knows as I know that she would never have been elected. In fact, the Labor Party would have been annihilated. We hear all the comments about how important global warming is, how importance it is that Australia does something and how necessary the carbon tax is. To Senator Conroy, if it is so necessary why did you promise before the last election not to bring it in? I would love to hear an answer to that, even by way of interjection. 


Mr Shorten is the architect of this bill, and Senator Thistlethwaite said he has done a great job on it. I only have a few minutes more to speak, unfortunately, but I could spend 20 minutes and then another 20 minutes saying how good Senator Mathias Cormann is. He is in the chamber, sitting at the end of the bench. He was the one who turned this awful piece of legislation into something that is mildly okay. I give credit and thanks to Senator Cormann here. 


This legislation was amended yesterday. I have a report here from all the Labor Party people, including Senator Thistlethwaite, who said the bill was great as it was. Were there any Greens on that committee? I am told there were. Senator Ludlam, I do not know who it was, but they said that the bill as it stood was a great bill and should be passed. Yet, just yesterday, Mr Shorten accepted Senator Cormann's amendment, the amendment in the coalition's dissenting report that the minister had been alerted to seven months ago.




Senator Cormann:
  Seven weeks.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Sorry, seven weeks ago. I was not on the committee, clearly. So the coalition alerted Mr Shorten to the flaw. Even if you accept the bill, the way it was presented was wrong. The coalition committee members pointed that out. Did the Labor Party or the Greens members on that committee understand or agree? No. 'Pass the bill as it is,' they said. Thankfully, the coalition put in a dissenting report and they persisted. To give credit where credit is due, Madam Acting Deputy President, I think, you were on that committee too. On our side, we have people who actually understand these things, follow them, have a bit of business experience and a very great understanding of the insurance and the superannuation industry. They were able to see through this while the Labor people all said: 'The minister said it is good. Yes, it's good. Put it in the report.' The majority report was supported by the Greens, who said that the bill should be passed as it is. Thanks to Senator Cormann, an evil bill, if I can call it that, has been made mildly okay.


We are going to move some amendments. I know that you, Madam Acting Deputy President, and Senator Cormann, amongst others, are very keen to progress those amendments. I hope you can speak quickly because at the rate we are going you are going to have about 30 seconds to move three amendments and explain them to the Senate and to people who might be listening to this as to why these are good amendments and should be adopted.


The Greens and the Labor Party have curtailed this debate. I will be voting for those amendments but, like most senators who will be voting on this, I would like to have them explained because I was not on the committee. I would like to question Senator Cormann when he moves the amendments to find out whether they are good amendments, though I am sure they are, but I would like to satisfy myself of that. I am not going to get that opportunity, am I? Of course not. Thanks to the Greens, who joined with the Labor Party, debate on this very, very important piece of legislation will be curtailed.


I am conscious time is running out. I know my colleagues are very keen to make a contribution. I have pages of material here I would like to contribute to the debate. If I do not do it during the second reading stage, I would like to do it in the committee stage of the bill. Senator Ludlam, will there be a committee stage? No. You and your party have ensured that there will no committee stage. The Greens show all their piousness—'Oh, this has to be looked through.' Not a lot of the senators today were here in the days when the Greens used to spend hours telling us how important committee stages were, how important the Senate was and how important full discussion and accountability was. Yet, when they have the ability to make a difference today, what do they do? They join with their mates in the Labor Party to curtail proper assessment of these important pieces of legislation.


I would to say a few more things, but I know my colleagues are very keen to speak, so I will leave it there and urge the Senate to support the amendments which I think are good, though I am never going to find out for sure. They will be moved by Senator Cormann to try to make this bill better.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,29,1,speech
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2012-11-29,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (19:36):  I rise to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill 2012. As Senator Macdonald has indicated, despite the fact that there is a list of coalition senators who would like to make a contribution on the record about this bill, they will not be able to because earlier the Labor Party in conjunction with their alliance partners, the Greens, voted to ensure that the bills we are debating today in the Senate will be subject to the guillotine. As such, at 8 pm tonight the guillotine will fall and no further debate will be had in the second reading stage on this bill.


This is, as the Senate would be aware, the second superannuation bill that we have dealt with today. The first was the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Unclaimed Money and Other Measures) Bill 2012 and again there were many senators on this side who wished to participate in the debate but were unable to because that bill was also guillotined. I listened to my colleague Senator Ian Macdonald's comments on that bill. It was an exceptionally eloquent speech. The one thing he said that really hit home in relation to that particular bill was this: by that legislation the Labor Party had sunk to a whole new depth. They were now legalising theft as a way of paying off their huge deficit in Australia. They have legalised the fact that they can steal Australian taxpayers' money, because they have no other way now of paying off the debt that they themselves have created.


Then we turn to this bill. This bill in its original form highlighted what is the fundamental ideological difference between the Australian Labor Party and their little alliance partners, the Greens, and those on this side of the chamber. As Liberals, our fundamental belief is that we believe in freedom of choice. We believe in the inalienable rights of freedom and of all peoples. Unlike those on the other side, we believe in a lean government that minimises interference in our daily lives and maximises individual and private-sector initiative. Unlike those on the other side, we believe in the individual. We believe on this side of the chamber in offering the individual an ability to make a choice that suits their own circumstances. 


The Labor Party's little alliance partners, the Greens, getting littler by the moment—in the ACT they were all but wiped out—are still able to be bought. We cannot forget that the Greens can always be bought. As I said earlier today when I addressed the Senate in relation to the fact that the Greens had clearly been bought on the guillotine motion, we all know that the Greens can be bought because the Greens were the political party that accepted what is now recorded in Australian political history, and that is saying something, as the largest political donation a political party in Australia has ever taken. You can only imagine when they got the phone call from Graeme Wood of wotif and he said, 'Guess what: $1.7 million is coming your way.' You can just imagine all their morals ran out the door. They did not run back to Hansard to see when they had stood up in this place and condemned the Australian Labor Party for taking donations, condemned the coalition for taking donations, because that is bad, apparently—very bad. But when you are the Greens and Mr Graeme Wood offers to buy you for $1.7 million, apparently that is okay.




Senator Bushby:
  That is a lot of money.




Senator CASH:
  It is not just a lot of money, and that is the point. History now records it as being the largest political donation ever taken—




Senator Ludlam:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I seek your advice on whether that was a fairly clear impugning of improper motives to the entire Greens Parliamentary team. If it was not, I would like some kind of ruling on how that was not. Accusing the parliamentary team in this place of being bought by donation is a very serious allegation and I call for your ruling on that.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Boyce
):  As far as I am aware, Senator Cash was referring to the Greens party organisation. I will take some advice on that. I have now spoken with the Clerk and, as far as I was understanding what Senator Cash were saying, she was referring to a broad organisation, not to the individuals actually elected into this place. But I would ask Senator Cash to ensure that she does not reflect on any of the individuals in this parliament.




Senator CASH:
  Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. As I was saying in response to the interjection from Senator David Bushby, a good friend of mine, it was not just a large amount of money—history now records it as the largest political donation ever given to a political party in Australia. So the next time the Australian Greens stand up in this place and seek to condemn a member of the coalition or seek to condemn a member of the Australian Labor Party in relation to the taking of donations, perhaps they need to reflect on the fact that it is they themselves that received $1.7 million from Mr Graeme Wood, the founder of wotif.


As I stated, the first superannuation bill that was discussed by the Senate earlier today, as Senator Ian Macdonald said, was the legalisation of theft. The Labor Party are now just blindly robbing the people of Australia in order to pay off their debt. What they do with this bill here is almost as bad, almost as evil. The bill as originally drafted would have changed the investment strategy of many Australians not by choice but by forcing the transfer of potentially large amounts of money from funds where individuals have made a clear and active choice—so I as an individual have made a choice in relation to where my superannuation is going to go—to a MySuper default product. What is worse is that the way the bill was drafted the Australian government did not have to tell me prior to forcing my superannuation into their fund, an industry fund, that they were doing it. The Labor government wanted to force an Australian citizen who has exercised choice in relation to their superannuation fund to have that money transferred into the MySuper default product, and they did not even have the guts to tell the individual that that is what they were going to do.




Senator Cormann:
  It's theft.




Senator CASH:
  I will take that interjection: it is basically theft; that is exactly right. This was also canvassed in the joint committee inquiry that looked into the bill, albeit on a very, very limited basis. The FFC's submission to the corporations and financial services committee inquiry made a strong argument that the government had clearly got it wrong—and not only that. The government initiated the Cooper review and even the Cooper review said, 'Good grief, you can't actually do this; you've gone way too far.' This is what the FFC submission said: 'Through the Cooper review and the Stronger Super Paul Costello consultation in 2011, it was not contemplated at anytime that choice superannuation funds would be subject to default MySuper transitional arrangements'—not 'was contemplated' but 'not contemplated'. But that does not stop the Australian Labor Party. The mere fact that a review has given certain recommendations does not stop the Australian Labor Party from doing the exact opposite of what the review has stated.


I stood up in this place only yesterday in relation to amendments to the Fair Work Act, where again the Australian Labor Party spent $1 million of taxpayers' money putting together a review—they handpicked their own panel and cherry pick their mates to sit on the panel to provide recommendations to them as to how they might improve the Fair Work Act. And yet, when push came to shove, where were the recommendations when the legislation came before the Senate yesterday? Oh, conveniently they just were not there because the Labor Party did not like what the review panel had come back with. It is the same with this. The Labor Party did not like what a review came back with, so they decided to do something entirely different.


One of the other interesting parts of this bill, had Senator Cormann not actually negotiated amendments with Minister Shorten, was this: the bill had potential implications for insurance within superannuation. Many Australians take out all types of insurance, but they do so on the basis of their own personal circumstances. This is what this legislation, had it not been amended by Senator Cormann, would have done: the MySuper death and total and permanent disability cover is likely to be less. This is coming from the party that talks about the better off overall test, remember. 'No Australian can ever be worse off.' But this is exactly what this legislation was going to do in relation to insurance. The cover is likely to be less than that currently enjoyed by a member of a choice default fund. Some people who have been covered within their chosen fund for a long time may not be able to qualify for life insurance—and, remember, the government is doing this to you without actually asking if they can do it to you—or they will only be able to qualify on inferior terms given the changes in their personal circumstances since the original cover was taken out in their existing fund.


Again, the Labor Party was trying to force upon on individual what they wanted the individual to have, regardless of the fact that the individual had exercised a personal choice. But, worse than that, they were doing it by pushing a piece of legislation through the parliament which stated that they would then be able to do that without seeking the individual's prior consent. It was rushed through a committee. Despite the fact that the bill was rushed through a committee, Senator Cormann has been talking to the industry now for over two years. If you can say one thing about Senator Cormann it is that he knows more about superannuation now than do most people in Australia and he certainly knows more about superannuation than does Minister Shorten. Senator Cormann was the one who identified the very serious faults in this bill. Do you know why we know they are serious? It is exactly as Senator MacDonald said. You have got a report that comes out that says the bill is fantastic. The Labor senators, given their instructions by Minister Shorten, say, 'No worries, the bill is fantastic.' The Greens obviously just fall into line; there is no two ways about that; they probably did not read the bill. But that is fine; they also say the bill looks good. But Senator Cormann and the coalition members of the committee put in a dissenting report highlighting certain issues.


It may have ended there, but yesterday you could almost be assured that the Labor Party were told there were serious problems with its bill and they had better go to Senator Cormann and work out a way they can accept this amendment and change this bill. One of the serious flaws of the bill was that it was potentially going to break existing contractual arrangements and face potential legal challenges for breaching section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. Well done to the Australian Labor Party! They were introducing a bill that may well have seen a legal challenge because it breached the Constitution. But the good news for the Australian people is that Minister Shorten has accepted Senator Cormann's amendments—




Senator Cormann:
  At the last minute!




Senator CASH:
  He only accepted them yesterday. That is why you know there was a problem with the bill: because the Australian Labor Party could not let the bill go through the other place in its existing form. They also could not tell us that they were going to accept the amendments a few days ago because that would have looked bad. But, at the very last minute, they clearly realised that this was a piece of unworkable legislation and, as such, what was a very, very bad bill was made slightly better. But that was not as a result of anything Minister Shorten, the Australian Labor Party or the Greens did; t was only through the due diligence of those of us on this side of the chamber.


As I commenced my remarks I said the guillotine will fall at 8 pm tonight. On that basis, whilst I have a lot more that I could say about this legislation and the fact that if it had not been amended by the coalition there would have been some extremely detrimental consequences for the people of Australia, I will end my remarks here so that another colleague of mine has a brief time to put some comments on the record.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,29,1,speech
"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2012-11-29,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (19:52):  I rise tonight to talk about the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill 2012 as my colleagues have done. I thank Senator Cash for drawing my attention to a number of other things to which I should refer, but in leaving some time for Senator Bushby tonight I will not revisit them. They are points which I did not know about and, if we were able to go into a committee session before this bill is ruthlessly guillotined tonight—as Senator Macdonald expressed his frustration about earlier—we would be able to flesh out these points so that all the 76 senators in this place were fully aware of what was going on in this important area for all Australians.


I referred to Senator Macdonald: I wish him all the best for his birthday today, and get that on the record. I congratulate him for his win in the Queensland Senate preselection, which will take him to another term here in this place. He will serve the Queensland people well, as he has done dutifully and faithfully for the last two decades.


It is no surprise that we yet again see another example of Labor bringing defective legislation to the debate on superannuation. It was only earlier today that we saw a number of bills go through; namely, the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill. Without the amendments of many of those in the chamber the government would not have been able to get that one right. In an effort to ensure that we did get that legislation right, everybody except the government banded together, got some reasonable outcomes for the wheat industry and were able to push forward in what would otherwise have been—to use a topical expression for this time of year—a very big mince pie.


This government continues to blunder in its inability to provide for the economic wellbeing of each Australian, which each Australian works so hard to achieve. How much does this government expect this country to face with continued financial decline? We are very lucky in this chamber, and they say that every government is only as good as its opposite number: Minister Shorten is blessed to have Senator Cormann on the other side keeping good governance in place—keeping good policy coming forward. It has been pointed out on numerous occasions during this debate that Senator Cormann has been able to remind Minister Shorten of what good policy is, and save him from what would be very embarrassing legislation.


Most significantly detrimental in this bill is the intention to take away an individual's choice in deciding how to handle their hard-earned savings. The effect of this bill, in introducing a new, low-cost superannuation process known as MySuper, is that without approval from an individual large amounts of money from an individual's choice of fund will be automatically transferred to a MySuper default product.


Earlier today we saw another Treasury bill that went through which takes the automatic transfer of inactive accounts from seven years down to one. Why is that? Why would the government want to transfer or co-opt the money on inactive accounts? It is because it cannot balance its budget. It is because it cannot deliver a surplus. It is a cruel hoax. It says it will deliver a surplus in 2013, and that is unlikely. As our colleague in the other place, the member for Longman, Wyatt Roy, said recently, Labor has never delivered a surplus in his lifetime. That is so true. It is a disgrace for the Labor Party.


My colleagues on this side today made clear how flawed this piece of legislation is, and I cannot stress enough the damaging consequences guaranteed to flow on to individuals and businesses. Without choice an individual is exposed to risks of transaction costs, lower returns, higher fees and, potentially, higher risk investment profiles. Again, we are seeing the negative impacts of poor Labor decision making. Labor continues to handle poorly the issue that is most important to Australians—their future security.


This government continues to focus on the concerns of everyday Australians, most notably their costs of living. This is people's own money. This is the nine per cent, soon to go to 12 per cent, that is their money, and it is going into accounts. Why is it that it gets transferred? 'We arbitrarily say that. We're from the government; we know what's good for you.' Labor has a list of failed management policies in the Australian economy, and it is by no means brief. One of the government's clear current economic embarrassments is its failure to produce that budget surplus. Now that the Labor has run up the four biggest deficits in Australia's history—following on from the Howard government's four biggest surpluses—it has spent $173 billion more than it has raised in revenue.


Prime Minister Gillard's recent announcement of her government reopening another 700 onshore detention beds, plus opening thousands more places for community release, is a clear admission that this government cannot stop the boats and has no viable solution to follow. What is the government's solution? Its solutions of Nauru and Manus Island are full. I raise this because it is another example of not being able to get it right. We on this side have had to go to those opposite and counsel them about how they need to amend this bill so that they can get a good policy—an early Christmas present that Senator Cormann has delivered to Minister Shorten!


And we are getting a little sick and tired of doing it. In the 30 seconds I have left remaining—and I am sorry, Senator Bushby, I have not been able to honour you with some time on this. There is obviously so much going on, that we have to get out of here. We will move on to the gambling bill shortly—it is only a national gambling bill. What are we allowed for that one? An hour to debate the bill, and we will not even get to the committee session. So, Mr Deputy President, I will sit down—

That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.



The speech read as follows—


The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill 2012 is the third tranche of legislation implementing the Government’s MySuper and governance reforms as part of Stronger Super.  


This Bill amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, the Superannuation Guarantee Administration Act 1992  the Corporations Act 2001 and the Fair Work Act 2009 to implement the remaining measures relating to MySuper, as well as introduce data collection and publication powers for APRA and disclosure requirements for trustees that were announced as part of Stronger Super.  


MySuper is a key part of the Government’s Stronger Super reform package.


Stronger Super also includes reforms to:


make the process of everyday transactions in the super system easier, cheaper and faster through the SuperStream package of measures;


improve the governance and integrity of the superannuation system;


improve integrity and increase community confidence in the self-managed superannuation fund sector.  


MySuper will provide a simple, cost-effective default product that all Australians can rely on.  


MySuper will be limited to a common set of features to make it easier for members, employers and other stakeholders to compare performance across MySuper products, placing downward pressure on fees. 


The Bill comprises seven schedules.


Schedule 1 has new fee rules for superannuation funds that mean conflicted remuneration, such as commissions, cannot be charged in relation to MySuper products, that ban entry fees and limit exit fees, switching fees and buy/sell spreads to cost recovery in all superannuation funds and imposes parameters that must complied with when a trustee agrees to a performance-based fee with an investment manager in relation to a MySuper product.


These rules ensure that members of MySuper products do not pay unnecessary fees, that a trustee does not enter into performance fee arrangements that are not in the member’s best members and limits certain fees to ensure that they do not unfairly inhibit a member from making active choices.


Schedule 2 covers the insurance arrangements for MySuper products.  Trustees will be required to provide members of a MySuper product with life and TPD insurance on an opt-out basis.  


This provides an important safety net to members in MySuper that may not actively consider their insurance needs.


Schedule 3 implements new data collection and publication powers for APRA in relation to superannuation and imposes new disclosure obligations on trustees including publishing their full portfolio holdings and a product dashboard on their website.


Transparency of key performance information is crucial to a competitive and efficient superannuation system.  For this reason, APRA will have new data collection and publication powers in relation to superannuation.


Members are entitled to information about their investments, therefore, superannuation funds will be required to disclose their full portfolio holdings and a product dashboard to provide key information to members at a glance.


The Government will consider broadening this requirement to other managed investments as part of its response to the parliamentary inquiry into the Trio collapse. 


Schedule 4 makes consequential amendments to the Fair Work Act to ensure that only a fund that offers a MySuper product may be nominated in a modern Award or enterprise agreement.


This will ensure that employees that have their contributions directed to a fund nominated in a modern award or an enterprise agreement will benefit from having their contributions placed in a MySuper product if they do not wish to choose another superannuation product.


Schedule 5 exempts defined benefit funds and defined benefit arrangements from the requirements of the MySuper regime.  This will allow defined benefit funds to continue to be used as a default fund by employers.


Defined benefit members are entitled to benefits that are not altered by the charging of fees or the investment strategy adopted.  Therefore, the MySuper regime is not designed to apply to defined benefit arrangements.


Schedule 6 requires trustees of superannuation funds to transfer the accrued default amounts of members to a MySuper product by 1 July 2017.


Moving existing balances to MySuper will ensure that members are able to obtain the benefits of MySuper, in particular a ban on commissions, for their existing superannuation balance as well as for future contributions. 


I am aware that there are some concerns with the definition of the amounts that must be transferred to MySuper.  


However, the Government’s approach is consistent with the recommendations of the Cooper Review and will allow many funds to simply convert their existing default investment options to a MySuper product.


Treasury estimate that the definition in the Bill could result in $90 billion more being moved to MySuper than the approach suggested by stakeholders.  Based on the assumptions of the Cooper review, this translates to approximately $100 million per annum in fees being saved.


Further, all members will be notified before a transfer occurs and will have the right to opt-out of the transfer.  Therefore, no member is forced to transfer their balance to MySuper if they do not want to.  Trustees will have up to four years to communicate with members about their options.


Schedule 7 introduces new authorisation requirements for eligible rollover funds.


This will ensure that APRA is able to assess that eligible rollover funds are meeting their intended objective of reconnecting members with their lost superannuation and are promoting the financial interests of members.


Full details of the Bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (17:45):  The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill 2012 is another case study on how this government can seriously mishandle something that is actually a pretty good idea in principle. The concept of legislating basic consumer protection requirements that are important for superannuation products for people who have not made active choices in relation to superannuation arrangements is appropriate. The coalition have supported it in principle for some time. But of course with matters superannuation the devil is always in the detail. If you do not get your set-up right, it can have pretty devastating and significant consequences and significant implications for Australians who are saving for their retirement.


The Cooper review recommended the creation of a legislated default superannuation product, which the government has called MySuper. So far, so good. We have been critical in the past of the disjointed nature in which the government has pursued this pretty significant reform. Rather than introduce one package in one go so that we can assess the merits of this particular change as a whole package, we have had tranche after tranche after tranche dealing with various bits. Some of the bits in this tranche are pretty significant, certainly in the way the bill was initially introduced.


We are talking here of a bill which is more than 100 pages long and it will make some pretty fundamental and, in parts, controversial changes to Australia's superannuation retirement system. The Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation introduced a bill initially, which was in terrible shape and which included provisions which would have had some terribly devastating consequences for people in superannuation funds across Australia. For example, more than one million Australians would have been exposed to an automatic transfer of their superannuation funds—about $43 billion worth of superannuation savings—out of their chosen fund, into the government's legislated MySuper default fund product, without being asked for their prior approval.


That is of course entirely inappropriate. No government should be able to shift people's money out of their chosen superannuation fund into a legislated MySuper default fund without, in particular, seeking people's prior approval, given some of the costly adverse consequences that can flow from that. 


Just to start at the end, yesterday in the House of Representatives Minister Shorten completely and totally backed down from the most controversial change in this legislation, which the coalition criticised from the outset, which was the proposal to force super fund trustees to shift people's superannuation savings, including out of funds where they had exercised active choice, into legislated MySuper default fund products without seeking people's prior approval. He totally backed down. He moved a comprehensive amendment which protected the interests of those Australians, an amendment which had been sought by the coalition as a condition for us not opposing this legislation. 


But why did Minister Shorten get it so fundamentally wrong? Minister Shorten got it so fundamentally wrong for a range of reasons. Firstly, there is his general ideological blind spot, which means that he does not see straight when it comes to superannuation. He takes advice from one segment of the superannuation market when he puts these things together initially and then, when things come apart, he is forced to fix things up as he goes.


But let me talk through the lack of process here, because we have the Minister for Finance and Deregulation in the chamber here. One of the areas of responsibility that Minister Wong has relates to the Office of Best Practice Regulation. One reason why Minister Shorten gets things wrong, whether it is with FoFA, with MySuper or with a range of other things, is that he does not follow proper process. 


I will give you one example: whenever there is a significant regulatory change that is unlikely to pass the government's procedural requirements around regulatory impact assessments, what does he do? He seeks an exemption from the regulatory impact assessment process. Whenever there is a piece of legislation that imposes inappropriate excessive red tape, inappropriate excessive costs, inappropriate and excessive adverse consequences for people across Australia, which should be scrutinised through a proper regulatory impact assessment and a proper cost-benefit analysis, what does Minister Shorten do? He writes to the Prime Minister: 'Can you please give me an exemption from having to submit this piece of legislation through the process that we promised the Australian people we would go through'—and this bit is not written—'because, essentially, I don't think this legislation would pass that sort of scrutiny.'


Minister Shorten introduces flawed legislation. If he had gone through proper consultation with appropriate and representative organisations—not just his friends in the union-dominated industry super funds movement but across the board—and if he had sought proper advice in an unbiased fashion, then he would have been able to pick up some of those flaws much earlier. 


This whole MySuper process has been going on for years. But then Minister Shorten introduced the third tranche of this legislation back in October. Initially, he did not want to have any parliamentary inquiry into it. Initially, he said, 'There is no need for an inquiry.' When we wanted to refer it to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services he did not want that to happen. When it did happen then, all of a sudden, the Labor members on that committee did not want to have a hearing. They wanted to have it all done within a week.


We had to suggest to them that, if there was not a proper hearing, we would report that to the parliament and seek the support of the crossbenchers to judge the merits of this legislation as a result—and that changed their mind. In the end they rolled over on that. In the end the PJC had a half-day hearing where we were able to hear from very important witnesses like the Financial Services Council and others for just 30 minutes each. There were half a dozen people wanting to ask questions about a bill that is making substantial changes to people's superannuation arrangements, with significant consequences for the way their retirement savings develop into the future, and we had 30 minutes per witness in a half-day hearing. It was completely and inappropriately rushed.


It gets worse. This is all on the public record. Labor members of the committee in their majority report said, 'Just pass the bill.' It came down to coalition members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services to identify the many and serious flaws that needed fixing. Yesterday, at the last possible minute, the government rolled over and made the sorts of changes that we were after. This was a significant policy victory for us on behalf of Australians who are planning for their retirement and were at risk of having their savings transferred automatically and without their prior approval to a government legislated MySuper account.


This bill, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill, requires that trustees transfer so-called accrued default amounts to a MySuper product. These are supposed to be retirement savings where a member has not exercised choice, but the bill as originally drafted went much further than that. It would have changed the investment strategy of many Australians by forcing the transfer of potentially large amounts of money from funds where individuals had made a clear and active choice about their superannuation to a MySuper default product without the need for prior approval from the individual concerned.


Yesterday in the House of Representatives, the coalition secured comprehensive amendments from the government to resolve this and other issues. Why didn't Labor members on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services see the overwhelming evidence that there were serious flaws in this legislation? Why didn't Senator Thistlethwaite look at the evidence that was before us when we went through this inquiry? Why didn't government members see what we all could see and what the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation finally had to concede—that what the government was proposing was entirely inappropriate?


Quite frankly, if an individual Australian has made any sort of choice in relation to their super fund arrangements, it is none of the government's business to force transfer of their superannuation savings into any other account without seeking people's prior approval. The only exception to that that the parliament has agreed to in the past is in relation to very small amount accounts—accounts of less than $1,000—where, of course, the issue of fees and so on arises and where there is a public benefit in merging people's accounts in order to minimise the level of fees. But, as a general rule, if in the past somebody has been contributing, year in, year out, with their superannuation contributions paid by their employers into a superannuation fund that they have chosen specifically, it is none of the government's business to interfere with that.


In our view, the truth of the matter is that Bill Shorten has shown once again that he is not on top of his portfolio. Maybe he has too much on his plate. He is the minister for unions and the minister for union dominated super funds. Then, of course, he is the minister who has to run the occasional defence for the Prime Minister and who has to do a whole series of other political things as he continues to climb that Labor ladder of opportunity. He fought against having any inquiry into this bill when the coalition tried to have it referred to the corporations and financial services committee. Despite the rushed inquiry, coalition members on the PJC identified serious flaws which the government now has had to acknowledge and act upon with significant last minute amendments. Bill Shorten should have done his homework from the start. Labor members of the parliamentary joint committee should have recognised that the evidence about massive flaws in Mr Shorten's initial MySuper bill was overwhelming. Minister Shorten had seven weeks from the time the committee reported to draft his amendments. Instead, he has waited until the second last day of sitting for the year to start consulting with industry about an actual government amendment. So there was quite a flurry of activity yesterday to get the amendment right. Why did it take so long? This process has been going on for years. At the last minute, having rejected the need for an inquiry, he has completely and utterly rolled over and fully accepted all of the coalition's sensible and very constructive recommendations to fix this bill, as set out in our dissenting inquiry report.


This is no way to run a portfolio, especially a portfolio that deals with the retirement savings of Australians. Without the changes secured by the coalition, many Australians with superannuation in affected accounts would have faced costly adverse consequences, including being exposed to transaction costs and fees as assets had to be sold and repurchased in the new fund as the forced transfer was happening, potentially being placed into a fund with lower returns or higher fees, potentially being placed into a fund with a higher risk investment profile, and being exposed to the risk of losing life and/or total and permanent disability insurance.


The coalition succeeded yesterday in forcing the government to amend this bill and so the bill that is before the Senate now is the amended bill, as amended by the House of Representatives, so that a member who has previously exercised choice cannot be automatically transferred into a MySuper product by having previous contributions defined as an accrued default amount. The coalition has also achieved amendments to the legislation to avoid a potentially serious constitutional issue.


The bill as drafted did have the potential to break existing contractual arrangements and there was potential for legal challenge for breaching section 51 of the Constitution, the section that deals with the acquisition of property on just terms. Whilst the government has seen sense at the very last minute, this mess could have been avoided by proper process and proper consideration before the legislation was put before the parliament. It again shows, as I said at the beginning, that Bill Shorten's approach to running his portfolio is rather shambolic and disorganised, and that is why he has to keep fixing things on the run.


There is, of course, another problem with this bill. The government is introducing this MySuper default product but says at the same time—and it was said yesterday by the government in the debate about the changes to the Fair Work Act—that these products are not good enough as default products. I see Senator Thistlethwaite over there looking a bit intrigued and concerned about the fact that somebody on the government side would have said that, but that is exactly what Senator Jacinta Collins said yesterday. She said that to allow employers to choose any MySuper product as a default product for their employees would actually expose those employees to the risk that the employer would not act in the best interests of the employees in the MySuper product of their choosing.


Our argument here is that we support the creation of this default fund product, legislated as we are progressing it here today. But we think any product that qualifies for registration as a MySuper default fund product, because it complies with all the consumer protection requirements the government thought were necessary and that have hence been included in this legislation, should be able to compete freely in the default fund market. There is no need for an additional level of red tape, for an additional level of government intervention on top of that.


If the government believe they got this legislation right, if the government believe that this legislation has in it all the consumer protection requirements that are necessary for a default fund product, then why are they scared of competition between any such product that qualifies for registration as such a default fund product? And of course the reason is very clear. It is because the process the government put in place when the Fair Work Act was first established is a process that inappropriately favours union dominated industry super funds. It is a widely discredited process through Fair Work Australia that is anti-competitive and closed-shop. It is a process that is littered with inherent conflicts, with conflicted parties who act at the same time as delegates for unions for employer bodies and as super fund trustees in the super funds listed on the modern awards.


Even the government, in the lead-up to the last election, had to concede that it was an inappropriate process, which is why they made a promise, in August 2010—and Senator Thistlethwaite, I encourage you to have a look at the Labor Party's superannuation policy in the last election—in the lead-up to the last election that they would change it. They recognised that the system, the way it was, was broken and inappropriate and that there was a need for an open, transparent and competitive process for selection of default funds on the modern awards and other relevant industrial instruments, and that they would do that. It took Minister Shorten forever, but eventually he got around to calling a Productivity Commission review. But of course, as the Productivity Commission was halfway through their process, he intervened and made sure that the Productivity Commission understood that free and open competition was not an option. He stopped them in their tracks after they recommended genuine competition in the interim report. He responded to the review before it had finally reported in order to prevent the opening up of default super fund arrangements to genuine competition.


That is why the coalition will move amendments again here today to ensure that any MySuper product can compete freely in the default super fund market. It is because, strangely, the coalition has more confidence in the MySuper product structure than the Labor Party seems to have. The Labor Party seems to think that Fair Work Australia has to do another check on the MySuper products that are registered under this legislation. It is just a ridiculous proposition, which is why we are moving our amendments.

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2012-11-29,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (18:05):  It is appropriate that one of the final bills that this Senate debates in the course of this year is a further addition to the government's reforms to superannuation. This bill, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill 2012, is the third tranche in a series of reforms aimed at strengthening our superannuation system, providing greater transparency, accountability, efficiency and ultimately productivity for members and funds throughout the country. Before this, the Senate approved the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (MySuper Core Provisions) Bill and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill. Each of these two bills includes elements to implement the Stronger Super arrangements, to implement a low-cost and simple superannuation product that will replace the existing default superannuation funds.


This bill introduces a number of very important reforms to superannuation, particularly in relation to the abolition of fees relating to commission payments and the establishment of the rules for intrafund advice and for collection of disclosure of information by APRA and greater information for members.


In respect of fees relating to commission payments, an applicant for a registered superannuation entity applying to offer a MySuper product must elect that they will not charge any member a fee regarding the MySuper product, that relates directly or indirectly to conflicted remuneration to a financial service licensee. Importantly, there is a second part of that election, and that requires the applicant to prohibit a registered superannuation entity licensee from paying premiums on insurance policies that have embedded commissions.


In respect of performance based fees this law sets five criteria that must be contained in the terms of an arrangement the fund has with an investment manager. Those criteria include that fees are appropriate to the investment to which they relate, measured by performance of a similar investment product; are determined on an after-cost or after-tax basis; and include disincentives for poor performance.


In respect of intrafund advice—this is advice which is dispensed to members for which the cost can be covered across the full membership of the fund—restrictions on the types of personal advice that superannuation trustees can charge across the membership are introduced. A trustee is not able to charge across membership for personal advice if the person has not acquired a beneficial interest in the fund or the advice relates to a product other than a pension fund or a cash management facility, or the advice relates to consolidation, or if the advice relates to ongoing personal advice.


Collective charging for advice is allowed if it is related to a pension fund, a related insurance product or a cash management facility. Built into these laws are regulations for further circumstances to be added with respect to intrafund advice. So, again, we are tightening up the criteria for the charging of intrafund advice so that members of superannuation funds are not burdened with unnecessary costs.


General fees can only be charged in respect of an advice fee, an activity fee and an insurance fee. But all must be charged on a cost-recovery basis. Entry fees, under this legislation, will be banned and certain buy-sell spreads, switching fees and exit fees can only be charged on a cost-recovery basis. The bill also, importantly, deals with insurance in relation to MySuper products, and it stipulates that the trustee must provide MySuper members with death and permanent incapacity insurance to a minimum level unless the member opts out or the fund permits a lower level of life insurance. 


One of the highlights and strengths of this bill is greater disclosure and collection powers for APRA with respect to information that relates to super fund members. Superannuation is a compulsory system of retirement savings, so it is entirely appropriate that superannuation licensees do everything that they reasonably can to ensure that there is complete transparency for financial product members in respect of the fund that they have an equitable interest in. To achieve this, APRA will be given additional powers to collect additional data from superannuation licensees. And APRA will be required to publish this data on a quarterly basis on their website and ensure that information relating to returns, fees and costs of all MySuper products is available to the public. 


The bill also introduces the notion of a product dashboard—an easy, simple to understand, publicly available portal that superannuation funds must provide to their members and members of the public. The information that will be required to be provided on the product dashboard will include the investment return target, the number of times the current target has been met in the last 10 years for the particular fund, the level of investment risk, the statement of liquidity of the fund and the average amount of fees and other costs. Funds will also have to disclose the remuneration of directions and executive officers of the fund. 


So, once again, we are improving the amount of information and the transparency associated with the management of the fund for members. The bill deals with the listing of particular MySuper funds in modern awards. Senator Cormann has made some comments about this and the fact that the opposition still cannot get over the fact that industry super funds offer better value for money, lower fees, better net investment returns and lower commissions for members.


This has been proven over many years, and when the coalition sought to introduce choice of superannuation fund legislation they believed that there would be an exodus from superannuation funds that were managed by industry bodies and those that involved joint management, but again they were wrong. In fact, people tended to move to industry funds because of their superior performance.


What the government has done with respect to modern awards in this bill is adopt the recommendations of the Productivity Commission. In conjunction with the reforms that have been passed by the Senate relating to the Fair Work Act, that will provide for default funds to be listed in awards that must be authorised to provide a MySuper product. 


The point that Senator Cormann fails to recognise and disclose to the Senate is the fact that every employee has the choice of which fund they pay their superannuation into. When anyone begins a job these days they get two forms—an employment declaration form relating to a tax file number and a choice of superannuation fund. Even when we begin as senators here we get a choice as to which superannuation fund we contribute. It is a choice all Australian employees have. Employees have the choice as to which fund they pay into; it just happens to be the fact that most employees choose to pay into industry based funds because of their superior performance. 


The bill also deals with defined benefit funds, and exempts certain employers from making contributions into MySuper funds if their employees are being looked after in terms of their contributions being made into a defined benefit fund. Importantly, the bill also deals with the process of transition from current default funds into the MySuper regime. These transitional provisions ensure that by 1 July 2017 all employees in default superannuation funds have made the transition into a lower cost, more competitive and efficient MySuper product. The amounts that are transferred are referred to as 'accrued default amounts'. The amounts that will be transferred as accrued default amounts will be amounts where a member has not exercised investment choice or amounts held in a default investment option for the fund.


As Senator Cormann has mentioned, the government has agreed in the House of Representatives to amendments to the original legislation that would exclude funds held in cash, in particular funds where the member has directed the fund to hold those funds in cash for whatever period. Of course a member can opt out of the transfer process in writing at any time. The provisions also deal with eligible rollover funds and their basis as a temporary repository for the interests of members who have lost connection with their superannuation accounts. Schedule 7 of the bill amends the SI(S) Act to require trustees to obtain authorisation from APRA to operate an eligible rollover fund.


That is a summary of the provisions of the bill. Again, they deliver on this government's commitment to make superannuation in this country simpler, more affordable, more efficient and easy to understand. It is part of the government's commitment to providing a stronger superannuation system; to ensuring that as our population ages, as it places more and more pressure on our social security system, we are growing the nest egg of retirement savings, but we are also doing that in a manner that is fair for employees and provides greater efficiency for members of superannuation funds and, indeed, the business community as a pool of investment funds. I commend this very important bill to the Senate, and I congratulate Minister Bill Shorten for his excellent stewardship of the government's MySuper reforms over the course of this year.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2012-11-29,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (18:17):  I was about to congratulate Senator Cormann for his ability to fix the legislation that was so poorly put together by Minister Shorten in the first place. We have, yet again, a piece of incompetent legislation. The only thing we can say about this legislation is that in the form it is now in, with the coalition's amendments to it accepted, it is a far better attempt at legislation than the unclaimed moneys legislation was.


But I would like firstly to look at a couple of the points that Senator Thistlethwaite made. As I pointed out, this bill in its original draft would have changed the investment strategy of many Australians by forcing the transfer of potentially very large amounts of money from funds where individuals had made a clear and active choice about their superannuation to a MySuper default product without the need for prior approval from the individual concerned. The coalition has now got some amendments to resolve this and other issues.


As for congratulating Minister Shorten, we need to keep in mind that this legislation, Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill, was originally introduced in September this year into the House of Representatives. It was only that Minister Shorten was forced to look at how bizarre some of his suggestions were, how anti-competitive they were and how they were quite likely to lead to constitutional challenges that forced him, finally, to have a look at the amendments that we were suggesting. We have a timetable on this legislation, the stronger superannuation legislation, of which this is the third tranche, which started with regulatory impact statements being done in September 2011. Long before any of the final versions of the legislation were available, some aspects of the legislation were quite deliberately exempted from the regulatory impact statement. The Office of Best Practice Regulation points out:


The Prime Minister granted exemptions from the requirements for regulatory impact analysis in relation to the ability of funds to offer tailored MySuper products to employees with more than 500 employees, and extension to the date by which trustees will be required to have transferred the balance of existing default funds into MySuper products.


So we have the regulatory impact statements in September 2011, long before original legislation of any type was available—particularly in relation to this third tranche. This bill was brought into the House of Representatives on 19 September 2012 and now, on the last day of sitting, we have bills being gagged so that Minister Shorten can get this piece of legislation through to please his friends in the industry funds.


I do not think any of that is a matter for congratulations. Nor is the fact that, as deputy chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, there was an attempt made for an inquiry not to be held into this legislation on the basis that we had already had lots of inquiries into Stronger Super. Every time a new piece of legislation with new requirements in it is brought to this house, I believe that the corporations and financial services committee, which has in the main had a long and proud reputation of examining legislation in a bipartisan way, should review it.


Certainly our review of this legislation, very brief as it was given the highly truncated reporting period that Minister Shorten allowed on the bill, found serious flaws, which finally the government has acknowledged and has now acted on with these five to midnight amendments. At least they are earlier than the 10 past midnight changes that need to occur with the unclaimed money bill. Minister Shorten should have done his homework from the start. This is a mess. 


I was somewhat displeased to hear Senator Thistlethwaite doing a free advertisement for industry funds and recreate the fable around the cheapness, efficiency et cetera of industry funds. He probably belled the cat in terms of the fact that this government would love to force everyone into industry funds. That would be their optimum way of proceeding, because that way there would be so much more money available for unions to conduct business however they like, not what is in the best interests of employees or employers—or in fact the economy of the country.


The mistake that was going to come through under the original 'accrued default amount' definition in this legislation was that all existing default fund accounts, as well as the balances of individuals who had previously exercised choice of fund but who remained in the default investment option of their chosen fund, would be swept up into the new default MySuper product. Minister Shorten and others initially claimed that this is because this is what the Cooper review has said. But the Financial Services Council submission to the very brief inquiry that the Corporations and Financial Services Committee held pointed out that in fact what the government was proposing had gone way past what was proposed in the Cooper review. I quote from the FSC submission:


Through the Cooper Review and the Stronger Super … consultation in 2011, it was not contemplated at any time that choice superannuation funds would be subject to default/MySuper transitional arrangements.


According to the Cooper Review:


The major difference in the choice architecture model is the clear distinction to be made between MySuper and choice products, as either may be offered by large APRA funds. The Panel's broad starting point in relation to the choice architecture model is that, as far as is reasonably possible, if the trustee of a large APRA fund does not wish for a product to comply with MySuper or ERF criteria, the product should continue to operate much as it currently does.


We are talking about APRA approved funds. The FSC submission continued:


A choice product trustee would be able to determine the extent to which it differs from a MySuper product in relation to the offer of investment choices, intra-fund advice or retirement products, among other features. This is appropriate and will allow the creation of a competitive choice sector. 


Well, the last thing this government wants is competition in this area or for people to have the ability to make their own choices about where their superannuation goes. It is just obscene the efforts that are being put into forcing as much of employees' superannuation funds as possible into the industry funds and therefore into the supporters of the Labor government. 


We only need to look at some of the current cases to suggest why this is not a good idea. For example, we have the CFMEU telling Cbus, CFMEU's superannuation vehicle, that if they do not stop investing in Grocon the CFMEU will go and find a different superannuation provider. Well! Every individual shareholder in Australia has the right to look at the ethics of the investment strategy of the body that they are involved in and choose to pull out their funds. But it is quite a different matter when a union attempts to blackmail an industry fund because of what they choose to invest in. It is quite fine for a shareholder to look at the ethical propositions put in terms of investment by a superannuation fund or any other body, but only to look at the ethical framework, not to start saying, 'If you invest in company A or company B we will pull our money out.' Of course, the CFMEU directing that all their members' funds come out and an individual shareholder pulling out of a company are quite different. 


It is one of the many, many reasons that we currently need far better legislation to look at industry funds and look at the way they are regulated—and to consider that in fact they should have the same need to be overseen as public boards. It is a really serious problem that we currently have in this area. It just adds to the concerns that are raised by other problems that have developed within the Health Services Union and the AWU in recent weeks that suggest that we really do need to have a full judicial inquiry into the way the unions and industry funds run their association at the present time. There is just too much room there for corruption and for lack of transparency. 


This government legislation, before it was amended, certainly was in no way assisting in developing transparency; it was only designed to assist the growth of industry funds and to do it—believe it or not—without even the approval of individuals being sought when their superannuation was moved out of one fund into another. It is beyond belief that the government thought they would get away with this. 


Some people have suggested that this is very rushed legislation on Minister Shorten's part. I think in fact it was quite a deliberate strategy that he hoped no-one would pick up. I am pleased to say that he was completely wrong in that and that there has been a lot of concern, particularly about the constitutionality of what he initially proposed in this area.

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (19:00):  Madam Acting Deputy President Boyce, could I just take this opportunity before I start talking on the bill to wish you and all the other senators a very merry Christmas and all the best for next year. Could I also mention the staff, not only the staff who work so hard for the senators in this place but also the Senate staff, those who help with the operation of this establishment, who really work hard. It has been a great learning experience for me in my 4½ years, coming from the farm and small business and so on, always having the attitude of, 'Oh, public servants. They do nothing.' That was until I came to this place and saw them walk in at seven in the morning and walking out at 11 pm and midnight. They are also so professional in their work, and I would like to thank the Clerk and all associated staff for the wonderful work they do here in the Senate.


The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill 2012 is the third tranche of legislation implementing a recommendation of the Cooper review into Australia's superannuation system to introduce a new, low-cost superannuation product known as MySuper to replace existing default superannuation fund products. I will commend the Labor government for introducing superannuation many years ago, and, of course, following governments for maintaining it. I believe we are now heading towards $1.4 trillion put away in superannuation—a huge amount of money. Sadly, after the global financial crisis set in in 2007-08, with the crash of the stock market the value of that superannuation went down enormously.


Hopefully, with good times ahead, good government, and a return to success in the private sector we will see those shares return to some of their higher levels. No doubt by the time those who are very young, 20, 21 and 22, come to retire at the age of—who knows: 67, 70—they will have a good stack of money put away to get them through their retirement and relieve the burden from the taxpayer. We know now of the shortage of government money. We see the government debt. We see, sadly, lack of business confidence in Australia. This is largely a result of many of the things this government has done, but hopefully that business confidence will return. Even growth has been forecast for next year and the year after, according to Westpac's economists. Hopefully we will return to those days of growth where people could fulfil their life's dream of owning their own home, putting enough away in their super and retiring where they could be financially secure without relying on the fellow taxpayers of our nation.


It is quite alarming, I know, being in small business and employing people. Super does cost. Of course, when it was phased in, workers did sacrifice wage increases to get their super in line. I want to make a point here about the talk of raising super from nine to 12 per cent and, even as former Prime Minster Paul Keating suggests, to 15 per cent. The former Prime Minister is suggesting a two-phase superannuation system, with phase 1 there to support those of the ages from 60 to 80 in retirement and phase 2 going from 12 per cent to 15 per cent, where three per cent of that money will be put into a government backed longevity fund to help pay for the needs of the over-80s. I have some serious reservations about that.


People work and put their super together. Who is going to pay for it to rise to 15 per cent under former Prime Minister Keating's plan? You cannot make business pay. Already we are seeing too many businesses in Australia trying to compete against overseas businesses where the labour is very cheap—places like China and other parts of Asia, as well as Africa, where we have a high Australian dollar which has been brought by money pouring into our country and being invested in Treasury bonds to finance the $253 billion gross debt that this government has built up. We see money coming here as our Reserve Bank cash rate is still over three per cent, when many of the official cash rates around the world are zero or just a bit above. So investors see Australia as somewhere they can get a good return, hence the market of the Australian dollar. The sentiment has been bullish for many years now and we have seen the Australian dollar trading by parity, making it very hard for people in rural and regional Australia who rely on income from exports, whether it be the grains industries, the export beef market or even the dairy industry, which produces some nine billion litres of milk each year. In Australia we only consume around 4½ billion litres a year, so we rely heavily on exports and that high Australian dollar is hurting us.


The point I make is that when we are tinkering with super and talking about increases, we cannot make the businesses pay for it. I remember when I was in small business that I paid my employees' super but I did not have any myself. A lot of people in small business are like that. As they should, they pay award and often above award wages to their workers. But often the owner of the business gets the smallest slice of the cake. They do not receive wages from the business when times are tough and they do not have super. I came into this place at the age of 53 years old with $1,650 worth of super, which is not much when you get to the age of 53. I put $4,000 away in a super fund during the wool boom of the late eighties-early nineties. Then I could not contribute anymore, and that $4,000 just shrunk down with fees until I cashed it in and put the little bit left, $1,650, in with my AGEST super.


Getting back to this legislation. The bill, as originally drafted, would have changed the investment strategy of many Australians by forcing the transfer of potentially large amounts of money from funds where individuals have made a clear and active choice about their superannuation to a MySuper default product without the need for prior approval from the individual concerned. That is concerning.


However, on this occasion the coalition has scored a significant policy victory for Australians planning for their retirement who were at risk of having their savings transferred automatically, without their prior approval, to a government-legislated MySuper account—just automatically. The coalition has secured amendments from the government to resolve this and other issues.


Minister Bill Shorten wanted to rush this flawed legislation through in early October. But the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services held an inquiry and reported on 9 October. This is one of the huge criticisms I have with this government: rushing things. We look at the stimulus package, and the crazy $42 billion, where money was simply rushed out into the economy. We go back to the $900 handouts, which was to stimulate the economy. Sadly, much of that money went into poker machines or buying things like televisions and luxury items, most of which—in fact, I could say with confidence: all of those electrical items—were made overseas. It was a stimulus package for China; that is what the stimulus package was. And it was rushed, of course, through the school buildings program; with the absolute mess in New South Wales by the previous government managing that school buildings stimulus package. Small buildings, which I would say would be worth about $120,000, were being constructed at a cost of $330,000 and more.


There has been plenty of toing and froing over amendments in this legislation. That is what you get when a minister tries to rush legislation through. It was all too rushed. I ask the question: why rush in the MySuper? Is it about the super funds that the unions are involved with that seem to be very friendly to the Australian Labor Party? Is that what was behind the original rush of Minister Bill Shorten, when he attempted to bring this legislation in some time back?


The current process for the selection of default funds under modern awards, initiated by this government and run by Fair Work Australia, lacks transparency. It is littered with inherent conflicts and inappropriately favours union dominated industry super funds. And that is a great concern: the union dominated industry super funds. I was a member of a union once—in February 1978. We had a drought in 1977 in South Australia and I went out shearing to pay the bills. It was not long after a state election in South Australia when the then Premier Don Dunstan was re-elected, and his campaign was 'Unionism is not compulsory'. So we were shearing at Carriewerloo Station, 17 miles out of Port Augusta, from memory—in fact, the shearing shed where they made the film Sunday Too Far Away, with Jack Thompson, which I am sure many people have seen. When the rep came in he said to me, 'Have you got a union ticket, mate?' I said no. He said, 'Do you want me to take it out of your wages or do you want to pay me now?' I said, 'The Premier said unionism is not compulsory'. He said, 'Well, it's not compulsory—either buy a ticket or leave the shed; take your pick.'




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Sounds like an AWA!




Senator WILLIAMS:
  The Australian Workers Union, AWU.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  No, a workplace agreement.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  No, this was compulsory unionism under the Dunstan government. So, anyway, they took the price of a ticket out of my wages and ironically, next shed, they made me the union rep! This bloke came up to me and said, 'I haven't got a ticket; will you get me one?' I said, 'I wouldn't know where to get them, mate; get your own.' That was my 12 months in the Australian Workers Union. I saw how the union movement worked then: it was hold a gun at your head or leave the shearing shed—as simple as that. If you did not join the union, you had to leave your job. It was a terrible situation. Of course, the then Labor Premier Don Dunstan, now the late Don Dunstan—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  A great man!




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I won't take that interjection—I will get into an argument!




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Boyce
):  That is good, Senator Williams—don't!




Senator WILLIAMS:
  And of course he was wrong with his election campaign that unionism was not compulsory. I found from personal experience—which is all I have to offer this place at any time—that unionism was compulsory.


We talk about transparency. Remember the last election? This government would be honest, transparent, tell-all, true to the Australian people—I think that during the campaign we saw the real Ms Julia Gillard. We had seen a few Ms Julia Gillards as the weeks had gone on, and people like Mark Latham were doing a good job in regard to the coalition's campaign; others were leaking here, there and everywhere—and transparency was the big thing.


Union members must ask themselves a question these days: what do they get from their union? I wonder what the lady tonight working in the country hospital cleaning the toilets and the bathrooms, and a member of the Health Services Union, is getting for her union fees. These are the battlers, the essential ones who work in our hospitals. They must be absolutely disgusted with what has been revealed has happened to their funds—absolutely disgusted. And no doubt in the future, if it is not happening now, we will see a mass walk-out of the union movement because of the disgusting and dreadful way that their members are being treated. I won't go onto the Australian Workers Union—I was a member for 12 months, remember. I also remember a bloke telling me, 'You must resign when you are a financial member or they'll sue you.' I said, 'Sue away, you can't get blood out of a stone.'


But back to the legislation. Even Labor has had to finally recognise that, in its 2010 pre-election policy on superannuation, when they promised the introduction of an open, transparent and competitive process to select default funds under modern awards. I take a lot of credence out of what Senate committee reports do—a good part of this place is the Senate committee inquiries into legislation. This piece in the coalition's dissenting report struck me. I will read it out to you, Madam Acting Deputy President. This is from the dissenting report of the coalition senators into the inquiry into this legislation:


Only a half-day hearing was set aside—


That is how important this legislation is: have a half-a-day hearing for the Senate committee to inquire into it. 


with witnesses limited to just 30 minutes for each organisation—


If we talk about the rush, look at how you have rushed the Senate committee inquiry into this. Half a day for the hearing, 30 minutes for witnesses. 


meaning the full range of issues has not been publicly canvassed.


It is as simple as that.


Worse still, committee members have only had days in which to assess the very complex evidence presented and draft reports and recommendations.


Transparency? Honesty? Those are words we hear from the Prime Minister at election time. Rush it through with a half-day hearing and 30 minutes for witnesses. It looks to me as though the government did not want this legislation to be scrutinised. That is what I must conclude. Surely, why not a proper Senate committee investigation? This is a big new paradigm we were told we would get when the Greens and the Independents propped up the Labor government. Mr Oakeshott said, 'It's going to be ugly but it's going to be beautiful. It's going to be a wonderful government.' Yes, let's rush things through.


Today, the government gives us just 90 minutes to debate this legislation. There are 76 senators in this place who potentially might wish to speak on this bill. But no, the guillotine will drop in 90 minutes. The bill is 100 pages long, so we are giving 90 minutes to a bill a hundred pages long—that is not even a minute a page.




Senator Edwards:
  Even less: it is 45 minutes.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Forty-five. It has been reduced now. Back to that dissenting report, and I quote:


Given the significant implications of this legislation, including adverse financial consequences for a material number of individual super fund members, Coalition members and senators recommend that:


The government withdraw this bill pending further consultation across the superannuation industry to address the serious flaws identified in this rushed inquiry and to allow for the preparation of a full Regulatory Impact Statement for the whole bill actually before the parliament, which is compliant with the government's own best practice regulation requirements.


But no. It has been a rushed inquiry, half a day of hearings, 30 minutes to witnesses and rush, rush, rush. This was a mess from the start when Minister Shorten tried to rush it through some time back. Luckily, the coalition under the guidance of my colleague Senator Cormann have made some sensible alterations to this legislation, sensible amendments that will make a rushed program perhaps a little bit better.


In conclusion, superannuation is vital. As our population grows, with the baby boomers being the biggest sector of our population, if they cannot fund themselves in retirement it means more drain on the taxpayers—the working people of Australia. Those taxpayers already have enough drain on them because they have one hell of a debt to pay for now, with interest. The shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey says it could be up to $12 billion a year in interest only—$12,000 million must be found before one public servant is paid, before one Australian soldier receives any sort of entitlement, before one age pensioner receives $1. That is the financial stress we have been put under under this government. That is why we need people in the future to be self-sufficient in their retirement. Let us hope that the confidence to the private sector, to the stock market does return. I do feel sorry for those who have just gone into retirement claiming their super after the crash of the global financial crisis, brought about by ridiculous, stupid bank lending in the United States.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2012-11-29,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (19:19):  I am very pleased to contribute to this debate on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill 2012. Unfortunately, I will have to curtail my time because I know there are so many of my colleagues who want to make a contribution to what is a very particular piece of legislation, one that requires far more scrutiny than we are able to give it in the very constrained time that has been allowed by the government and the Greens political party.


It is good to see at least that the Greens are in the chamber for the debate. I say to Senator Ludlam that we are constrained in this debate, because you and your Labor Party mates have guillotined this and many other bills through the parliament. Senator, I am not sure whether you were here but in the Howard government's time when we, on about five occasions, time managed a bill we would then have hour-long contributions by the then Senator Brown, your former leader, and, I think, from Senator Ludlam about how awful and how undemocratic it was, and how the world was coming to an end, because the Howard government time managed two or three bills when those were essential for Australia.




Senator Ludlam:
  I was here.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  You were here? You were. Well, have a look at the hours spent on Work Choices. Have a look at the hours spent on the Regional Forestry Agreements bill. At any suggestion of curtailment you would have the Greens up one after the other telling the Senate how undemocratic, how awful the coalition was and yet here, in this year of the record number of guillotines, have you heard one peep from the Greens? Not one peep! In fact, that is not unusual because they were there providing the majority for the Labor Party. 


Why do Australians take no notice of the Labor Party? Because they are led by a Prime Minister—a leader of the Labor Party—who deliberately told untruths to the Australian public before the last election. Why are Australians no longer listening to the Greens?—if you need evidence of that have a look at even the ACT election—because they see the complete hypocrisy of the Greens political party. If the coalition does something, it is bad, evil, the end of the world, but if the Labor Party does exactly the same thing then it is okay and they will support it.




Senator Ludlam:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order, I wonder if you would care to draw Senator Macdonald's attention to the question that is actually before the chair.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Boyce
):  There is no point of order. Senator Macdonald is speaking to the bill. However, Senator Macdonald, I would ask you to direct some of your comments, please, to the actual bill itself and the content of the bill.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, thank you for that. When I was interrupted I was saying this bill is all about MySuper. One element of it is converting more superannuation when people do not know that it is happening to the union super fund. I have not noticed those from the Labor Party who have spoken declare conflicts of interest, I might say. I know at least one senator who was at the top end of town—he sat on the board of directors of these very big insurance companies. And I suspect there are many others. Perhaps during the course of the debate Labor senators will indicate which of them as union officials, for no other reason—none of them had any great expertise in the superannuation or insurance industry—than that they were union bosses, suddenly ended up in the boardrooms of some of the biggest financial companies in Australia. They were all getting quite substantial fees.


How do I know that? Because the wink-and-nod arrangement was that, if you were a union official who sat on the board of one of these super companies, the only reason you were there—it was not the quota in that instance—



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I can talk about quotas over there. You were only there because you were a union official. The rule was that, if you got $40,000, $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 or $150,000—I do not know what they got—as a director because you were a union official the money was to go into the union. But of course a couple of them—who can blame Mr Thomson—got a little greedy and did not follow the rules. The money they got, and I think in that case—I should not mention it because I am not sure of the facts; I thought it was over $100,000 but it might have been $80,000—




Senator Conroy:
  The one you need to speak to is Kathy Jackson—your heroine.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Macdonald, ignore the interjections.



Senator Conroy interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Stop the interjections, please, Senator Conroy.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Senator Conroy will have an opportunity later, and I hope he uses that. It seems to me that he is defending Mr Thomson. I do not know whether it is true or not. But Fair Work Australia, which Senator Conroy and his team set up and filled up with ex-union officials, even said Mr Thomson was using lowly paid member's money for brothels and free trips around the world. That is not from me—I would not make those allegations. Fair Work Australia, made up of union officials that Senator Conroy and his mates appointed have determined that, not me. And in the shades of that, this case that I am talking about went to court. The union sued this director of a company because he did not follow the arrangement to put the money into the kit.




Senator Conroy:
  Do you think he kept it in plastic bags in his backyard?




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  It got to an interesting stage in the court case, and then do you know what happened? It was settled. Would you believe that? It was settled.



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  So the full facts could not come out, there was not a full-scale court case, and we were never to know what the deal was, who got it. Senator Conroy, if I am wrong on this, please use your opportunity in the debate to tell me this court case that I relate did not happen. You might tell me how it ended up; I do not know, because it just sort of disappeared.


This bill in part of its operations has the impact of favouring the union super funds. I would like to know how many of my colleagues opposite were actually directors of these union super funds.




Senator Cormann:
  Mr Shorten was.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Mr Shorten was. I do not know that; I take your word, Senator Cormann. I am pretty certain he would have been. I wonder how much he got paid in a top-end-of-town job as a director of a very big insurance company.



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Senator Conroy, you can tell me whether he did the right thing and put his director's fees into whatever union he was representing at the time. I would be interested in that. I think it is relevant to this bill, because since this government has been in power there has been quite a number of pieces of legislation dealing with the superannuation industry and the insurance industry.


In fact, I know all of us, including Labor members, were approached by groups of financial advisors, people who deal in the superannuation industry—honest, God-fearing family men, many of them in small businesses in small country towns like the town where I live—who were offended that the Labor Party were saying they were all crooks. As they brought in this legislation that we are debating now, there was a slur cast on these people, who in many cases I know are pillars of the financial advice industry. They are good people. It was a good industry. They gave good and valuable advice. But the Labor Party, and one can only surmise why, were hell-bent on making the public wary of these small businessmen and women.


When you see legislation like this, when you see union officials and former senators sitting in the big end of town around the boardroom table getting big director's fees for their involvement in union super funds, you can only wonder about the rash of legislation before us.


I did want to start my contribution by laughing at Senator Thistlewaite's congratulations for Mr Shorten on this bill.


Anything funnier I do not think I have heard, though someone said Julia was honest and I found that pretty funny.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, you must use the correct title of the member.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Someone said the Prime Minister was honest and we all know that before the last election she showed anything but honesty.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, you need to be careful not reflect on the character of a person in the other house.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Perhaps I should relate the facts. Here is a leader of the Labor Party who promised hand on heart that there would be no carbon tax under a government that she led and then the first bit of legislation is a carbon tax. If she had not made that promise on the eve of the election, she knows as I know that she would never have been elected. In fact, the Labor Party would have been annihilated. We hear all the comments about how important global warming is, how importance it is that Australia does something and how necessary the carbon tax is. To Senator Conroy, if it is so necessary why did you promise before the last election not to bring it in? I would love to hear an answer to that, even by way of interjection. 


Mr Shorten is the architect of this bill, and Senator Thistlethwaite said he has done a great job on it. I only have a few minutes more to speak, unfortunately, but I could spend 20 minutes and then another 20 minutes saying how good Senator Mathias Cormann is. He is in the chamber, sitting at the end of the bench. He was the one who turned this awful piece of legislation into something that is mildly okay. I give credit and thanks to Senator Cormann here. 


This legislation was amended yesterday. I have a report here from all the Labor Party people, including Senator Thistlethwaite, who said the bill was great as it was. Were there any Greens on that committee? I am told there were. Senator Ludlam, I do not know who it was, but they said that the bill as it stood was a great bill and should be passed. Yet, just yesterday, Mr Shorten accepted Senator Cormann's amendment, the amendment in the coalition's dissenting report that the minister had been alerted to seven months ago.




Senator Cormann:
  Seven weeks.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Sorry, seven weeks ago. I was not on the committee, clearly. So the coalition alerted Mr Shorten to the flaw. Even if you accept the bill, the way it was presented was wrong. The coalition committee members pointed that out. Did the Labor Party or the Greens members on that committee understand or agree? No. 'Pass the bill as it is,' they said. Thankfully, the coalition put in a dissenting report and they persisted. To give credit where credit is due, Madam Acting Deputy President, I think, you were on that committee too. On our side, we have people who actually understand these things, follow them, have a bit of business experience and a very great understanding of the insurance and the superannuation industry. They were able to see through this while the Labor people all said: 'The minister said it is good. Yes, it's good. Put it in the report.' The majority report was supported by the Greens, who said that the bill should be passed as it is. Thanks to Senator Cormann, an evil bill, if I can call it that, has been made mildly okay.


We are going to move some amendments. I know that you, Madam Acting Deputy President, and Senator Cormann, amongst others, are very keen to progress those amendments. I hope you can speak quickly because at the rate we are going you are going to have about 30 seconds to move three amendments and explain them to the Senate and to people who might be listening to this as to why these are good amendments and should be adopted.


The Greens and the Labor Party have curtailed this debate. I will be voting for those amendments but, like most senators who will be voting on this, I would like to have them explained because I was not on the committee. I would like to question Senator Cormann when he moves the amendments to find out whether they are good amendments, though I am sure they are, but I would like to satisfy myself of that. I am not going to get that opportunity, am I? Of course not. Thanks to the Greens, who joined with the Labor Party, debate on this very, very important piece of legislation will be curtailed.


I am conscious time is running out. I know my colleagues are very keen to make a contribution. I have pages of material here I would like to contribute to the debate. If I do not do it during the second reading stage, I would like to do it in the committee stage of the bill. Senator Ludlam, will there be a committee stage? No. You and your party have ensured that there will no committee stage. The Greens show all their piousness—'Oh, this has to be looked through.' Not a lot of the senators today were here in the days when the Greens used to spend hours telling us how important committee stages were, how important the Senate was and how important full discussion and accountability was. Yet, when they have the ability to make a difference today, what do they do? They join with their mates in the Labor Party to curtail proper assessment of these important pieces of legislation.


I would to say a few more things, but I know my colleagues are very keen to speak, so I will leave it there and urge the Senate to support the amendments which I think are good, though I am never going to find out for sure. They will be moved by Senator Cormann to try to make this bill better.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>First Reading</title>,BILLS,29,2,speech
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2012-11-29,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (19:36):  I rise to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill 2012. As Senator Macdonald has indicated, despite the fact that there is a list of coalition senators who would like to make a contribution on the record about this bill, they will not be able to because earlier the Labor Party in conjunction with their alliance partners, the Greens, voted to ensure that the bills we are debating today in the Senate will be subject to the guillotine. As such, at 8 pm tonight the guillotine will fall and no further debate will be had in the second reading stage on this bill.


This is, as the Senate would be aware, the second superannuation bill that we have dealt with today. The first was the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Unclaimed Money and Other Measures) Bill 2012 and again there were many senators on this side who wished to participate in the debate but were unable to because that bill was also guillotined. I listened to my colleague Senator Ian Macdonald's comments on that bill. It was an exceptionally eloquent speech. The one thing he said that really hit home in relation to that particular bill was this: by that legislation the Labor Party had sunk to a whole new depth. They were now legalising theft as a way of paying off their huge deficit in Australia. They have legalised the fact that they can steal Australian taxpayers' money, because they have no other way now of paying off the debt that they themselves have created.


Then we turn to this bill. This bill in its original form highlighted what is the fundamental ideological difference between the Australian Labor Party and their little alliance partners, the Greens, and those on this side of the chamber. As Liberals, our fundamental belief is that we believe in freedom of choice. We believe in the inalienable rights of freedom and of all peoples. Unlike those on the other side, we believe in a lean government that minimises interference in our daily lives and maximises individual and private-sector initiative. Unlike those on the other side, we believe in the individual. We believe on this side of the chamber in offering the individual an ability to make a choice that suits their own circumstances. 


The Labor Party's little alliance partners, the Greens, getting littler by the moment—in the ACT they were all but wiped out—are still able to be bought. We cannot forget that the Greens can always be bought. As I said earlier today when I addressed the Senate in relation to the fact that the Greens had clearly been bought on the guillotine motion, we all know that the Greens can be bought because the Greens were the political party that accepted what is now recorded in Australian political history, and that is saying something, as the largest political donation a political party in Australia has ever taken. You can only imagine when they got the phone call from Graeme Wood of wotif and he said, 'Guess what: $1.7 million is coming your way.' You can just imagine all their morals ran out the door. They did not run back to Hansard to see when they had stood up in this place and condemned the Australian Labor Party for taking donations, condemned the coalition for taking donations, because that is bad, apparently—very bad. But when you are the Greens and Mr Graeme Wood offers to buy you for $1.7 million, apparently that is okay.




Senator Bushby:
  That is a lot of money.




Senator CASH:
  It is not just a lot of money, and that is the point. History now records it as being the largest political donation ever taken—




Senator Ludlam:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I seek your advice on whether that was a fairly clear impugning of improper motives to the entire Greens Parliamentary team. If it was not, I would like some kind of ruling on how that was not. Accusing the parliamentary team in this place of being bought by donation is a very serious allegation and I call for your ruling on that.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Boyce
):  As far as I am aware, Senator Cash was referring to the Greens party organisation. I will take some advice on that. I have now spoken with the Clerk and, as far as I was understanding what Senator Cash were saying, she was referring to a broad organisation, not to the individuals actually elected into this place. But I would ask Senator Cash to ensure that she does not reflect on any of the individuals in this parliament.




Senator CASH:
  Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. As I was saying in response to the interjection from Senator David Bushby, a good friend of mine, it was not just a large amount of money—history now records it as the largest political donation ever given to a political party in Australia. So the next time the Australian Greens stand up in this place and seek to condemn a member of the coalition or seek to condemn a member of the Australian Labor Party in relation to the taking of donations, perhaps they need to reflect on the fact that it is they themselves that received $1.7 million from Mr Graeme Wood, the founder of wotif.


As I stated, the first superannuation bill that was discussed by the Senate earlier today, as Senator Ian Macdonald said, was the legalisation of theft. The Labor Party are now just blindly robbing the people of Australia in order to pay off their debt. What they do with this bill here is almost as bad, almost as evil. The bill as originally drafted would have changed the investment strategy of many Australians not by choice but by forcing the transfer of potentially large amounts of money from funds where individuals have made a clear and active choice—so I as an individual have made a choice in relation to where my superannuation is going to go—to a MySuper default product. What is worse is that the way the bill was drafted the Australian government did not have to tell me prior to forcing my superannuation into their fund, an industry fund, that they were doing it. The Labor government wanted to force an Australian citizen who has exercised choice in relation to their superannuation fund to have that money transferred into the MySuper default product, and they did not even have the guts to tell the individual that that is what they were going to do.




Senator Cormann:
  It's theft.




Senator CASH:
  I will take that interjection: it is basically theft; that is exactly right. This was also canvassed in the joint committee inquiry that looked into the bill, albeit on a very, very limited basis. The FFC's submission to the corporations and financial services committee inquiry made a strong argument that the government had clearly got it wrong—and not only that. The government initiated the Cooper review and even the Cooper review said, 'Good grief, you can't actually do this; you've gone way too far.' This is what the FFC submission said: 'Through the Cooper review and the Stronger Super Paul Costello consultation in 2011, it was not contemplated at anytime that choice superannuation funds would be subject to default MySuper transitional arrangements'—not 'was contemplated' but 'not contemplated'. But that does not stop the Australian Labor Party. The mere fact that a review has given certain recommendations does not stop the Australian Labor Party from doing the exact opposite of what the review has stated.


I stood up in this place only yesterday in relation to amendments to the Fair Work Act, where again the Australian Labor Party spent $1 million of taxpayers' money putting together a review—they handpicked their own panel and cherry pick their mates to sit on the panel to provide recommendations to them as to how they might improve the Fair Work Act. And yet, when push came to shove, where were the recommendations when the legislation came before the Senate yesterday? Oh, conveniently they just were not there because the Labor Party did not like what the review panel had come back with. It is the same with this. The Labor Party did not like what a review came back with, so they decided to do something entirely different.


One of the other interesting parts of this bill, had Senator Cormann not actually negotiated amendments with Minister Shorten, was this: the bill had potential implications for insurance within superannuation. Many Australians take out all types of insurance, but they do so on the basis of their own personal circumstances. This is what this legislation, had it not been amended by Senator Cormann, would have done: the MySuper death and total and permanent disability cover is likely to be less. This is coming from the party that talks about the better off overall test, remember. 'No Australian can ever be worse off.' But this is exactly what this legislation was going to do in relation to insurance. The cover is likely to be less than that currently enjoyed by a member of a choice default fund. Some people who have been covered within their chosen fund for a long time may not be able to qualify for life insurance—and, remember, the government is doing this to you without actually asking if they can do it to you—or they will only be able to qualify on inferior terms given the changes in their personal circumstances since the original cover was taken out in their existing fund.


Again, the Labor Party was trying to force upon on individual what they wanted the individual to have, regardless of the fact that the individual had exercised a personal choice. But, worse than that, they were doing it by pushing a piece of legislation through the parliament which stated that they would then be able to do that without seeking the individual's prior consent. It was rushed through a committee. Despite the fact that the bill was rushed through a committee, Senator Cormann has been talking to the industry now for over two years. If you can say one thing about Senator Cormann it is that he knows more about superannuation now than do most people in Australia and he certainly knows more about superannuation than does Minister Shorten. Senator Cormann was the one who identified the very serious faults in this bill. Do you know why we know they are serious? It is exactly as Senator MacDonald said. You have got a report that comes out that says the bill is fantastic. The Labor senators, given their instructions by Minister Shorten, say, 'No worries, the bill is fantastic.' The Greens obviously just fall into line; there is no two ways about that; they probably did not read the bill. But that is fine; they also say the bill looks good. But Senator Cormann and the coalition members of the committee put in a dissenting report highlighting certain issues.


It may have ended there, but yesterday you could almost be assured that the Labor Party were told there were serious problems with its bill and they had better go to Senator Cormann and work out a way they can accept this amendment and change this bill. One of the serious flaws of the bill was that it was potentially going to break existing contractual arrangements and face potential legal challenges for breaching section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. Well done to the Australian Labor Party! They were introducing a bill that may well have seen a legal challenge because it breached the Constitution. But the good news for the Australian people is that Minister Shorten has accepted Senator Cormann's amendments—




Senator Cormann:
  At the last minute!




Senator CASH:
  He only accepted them yesterday. That is why you know there was a problem with the bill: because the Australian Labor Party could not let the bill go through the other place in its existing form. They also could not tell us that they were going to accept the amendments a few days ago because that would have looked bad. But, at the very last minute, they clearly realised that this was a piece of unworkable legislation and, as such, what was a very, very bad bill was made slightly better. But that was not as a result of anything Minister Shorten, the Australian Labor Party or the Greens did; t was only through the due diligence of those of us on this side of the chamber.


As I commenced my remarks I said the guillotine will fall at 8 pm tonight. On that basis, whilst I have a lot more that I could say about this legislation and the fact that if it had not been amended by the coalition there would have been some extremely detrimental consequences for the people of Australia, I will end my remarks here so that another colleague of mine has a brief time to put some comments on the record.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>First Reading</title>,BILLS,29,2,speech
"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2012-11-29,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (19:52):  I rise tonight to talk about the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill 2012 as my colleagues have done. I thank Senator Cash for drawing my attention to a number of other things to which I should refer, but in leaving some time for Senator Bushby tonight I will not revisit them. They are points which I did not know about and, if we were able to go into a committee session before this bill is ruthlessly guillotined tonight—as Senator Macdonald expressed his frustration about earlier—we would be able to flesh out these points so that all the 76 senators in this place were fully aware of what was going on in this important area for all Australians.


I referred to Senator Macdonald: I wish him all the best for his birthday today, and get that on the record. I congratulate him for his win in the Queensland Senate preselection, which will take him to another term here in this place. He will serve the Queensland people well, as he has done dutifully and faithfully for the last two decades.


It is no surprise that we yet again see another example of Labor bringing defective legislation to the debate on superannuation. It was only earlier today that we saw a number of bills go through; namely, the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill. Without the amendments of many of those in the chamber the government would not have been able to get that one right. In an effort to ensure that we did get that legislation right, everybody except the government banded together, got some reasonable outcomes for the wheat industry and were able to push forward in what would otherwise have been—to use a topical expression for this time of year—a very big mince pie.


This government continues to blunder in its inability to provide for the economic wellbeing of each Australian, which each Australian works so hard to achieve. How much does this government expect this country to face with continued financial decline? We are very lucky in this chamber, and they say that every government is only as good as its opposite number: Minister Shorten is blessed to have Senator Cormann on the other side keeping good governance in place—keeping good policy coming forward. It has been pointed out on numerous occasions during this debate that Senator Cormann has been able to remind Minister Shorten of what good policy is, and save him from what would be very embarrassing legislation.


Most significantly detrimental in this bill is the intention to take away an individual's choice in deciding how to handle their hard-earned savings. The effect of this bill, in introducing a new, low-cost superannuation process known as MySuper, is that without approval from an individual large amounts of money from an individual's choice of fund will be automatically transferred to a MySuper default product.


Earlier today we saw another Treasury bill that went through which takes the automatic transfer of inactive accounts from seven years down to one. Why is that? Why would the government want to transfer or co-opt the money on inactive accounts? It is because it cannot balance its budget. It is because it cannot deliver a surplus. It is a cruel hoax. It says it will deliver a surplus in 2013, and that is unlikely. As our colleague in the other place, the member for Longman, Wyatt Roy, said recently, Labor has never delivered a surplus in his lifetime. That is so true. It is a disgrace for the Labor Party.


My colleagues on this side today made clear how flawed this piece of legislation is, and I cannot stress enough the damaging consequences guaranteed to flow on to individuals and businesses. Without choice an individual is exposed to risks of transaction costs, lower returns, higher fees and, potentially, higher risk investment profiles. Again, we are seeing the negative impacts of poor Labor decision making. Labor continues to handle poorly the issue that is most important to Australians—their future security.


This government continues to focus on the concerns of everyday Australians, most notably their costs of living. This is people's own money. This is the nine per cent, soon to go to 12 per cent, that is their money, and it is going into accounts. Why is it that it gets transferred? 'We arbitrarily say that. We're from the government; we know what's good for you.' Labor has a list of failed management policies in the Australian economy, and it is by no means brief. One of the government's clear current economic embarrassments is its failure to produce that budget surplus. Now that the Labor has run up the four biggest deficits in Australia's history—following on from the Howard government's four biggest surpluses—it has spent $173 billion more than it has raised in revenue.


Prime Minister Gillard's recent announcement of her government reopening another 700 onshore detention beds, plus opening thousands more places for community release, is a clear admission that this government cannot stop the boats and has no viable solution to follow. What is the government's solution? Its solutions of Nauru and Manus Island are full. I raise this because it is another example of not being able to get it right. We on this side have had to go to those opposite and counsel them about how they need to amend this bill so that they can get a good policy—an early Christmas present that Senator Cormann has delivered to Minister Shorten!


And we are getting a little sick and tired of doing it. In the 30 seconds I have left remaining—and I am sorry, Senator Bushby, I have not been able to honour you with some time on this. There is obviously so much going on, that we have to get out of here. We will move on to the gambling bill shortly—it is only a national gambling bill. What are we allowed for that one? An hour to debate the bill, and we will not even get to the committee session. So, Mr Deputy President, I will sit down— 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! The time allocated for consideration of this bill has expired. The question now is that this bill be read a second time.


Question agreed to.


Bill read a second time.



The PRESIDENT:  The question now is that amendments (1) to (3) on sheet 7323, circulated by the opposition, be agreed to:


(1) Schedule 4, item 5, page 54 (line 22), omit ""for defined benefit members"".


(2) Schedule 4, item 5, page 54 (before line 23), before subsection 149A(1), insert:


(1A) A modern award must include a term that permits an employer covered by the award to make contributions, for the benefit of an employee covered by the award who is a default fund employee, to any superannuation fund that offers a MySuper product.


   Note: An employer may make contributions under this term even if the superannuation fund to which the contributions are made is not specified in the modern award.


(3) Schedule 4, item 6, page 55 (line 20), omit ""section 149A"", substitute ""subsection 149A(1)"".

The PRESIDENT
 (23:01):  I take this opportunity on the last sitting day for 2012 with the conclusion of a very busy parliamentary year to acknowledge and express my person gratitude to the following. Firstly, I thank the Clerk of the Senate, Rosemary Laing, for her outstanding professionalism and commitment to this very important institution in our democracy, the Australian Senate; the Deputy Clerk, Richard Pye; and all the senior officers of the Department of the Senate for their ongoing support and advice. I thank all senators, and I would like to make special note of the Deputy President and Chair of Committees, Senator Stephen Parry. I wish to once again acknowledge the excellent working relationship that we have established since the start of the Senate term, and I must say that I would be lost without the support that he has given. The mutual respect there is a wonderful thing indeed.


To the temporary chairs of committees, I thank them. I also wish to thank the Usher of the Black Rod, Brian Hallett; the Director of Senate Services, John Baczynski; Assistant Director Glenn Krause; and the staff of the Black Rod's Office. As I do every year, I make a special mention of, and I thank, Ian and Peter at the transport office, who continue to look after our transport needs so efficiently. And I extend my thanks to COMCAR drivers. I also wish to acknowledge the staff of the Clerk's Office, the Table Office, the Procedure Office and the Committee Office, and thank them for their hard work, dedication, patience and forbearance.


I thank the chamber support staff, in particular the chamber attendants and the mail attendants, and the staff of the Senate IT in 2020, who have assisted me on more than one occasion in getting the information and communication technology which we are provided with to work. I also thank the Secretary of the Department of Parliamentary Services, Carol Mills, and her staff, most of whom work in the background providing the essential services that enable the parliament to function. In particular, I thank the ground staff and gardeners who make Parliament House such a showpiece for the nation and those who work in Security and in the Protective Services at Parliament House. I also thank the Health and Recreation Centre staff; the staff of HRG, who make our travel arrangements; the cleaners, who keep this place so immaculately clean and tidy; the staff of IHG and Aussies, who provide the coffee and food to all building occupants and visitors; the Parliamentary Library and Research Service under the direction of the Parliamentary Librarian, Dianne Heriot; and the International and Community Relations Office for their dedicated work with outgoing and incoming delegations and in managing our Interparliamentary Relations and International Parliamentary Assistance Program.


The Parliamentary Education Office do an extraordinary and very important job teaching young Australians about our parliament. In 2012 they taught more than 91,000 young Australians from 1,605 schools. I would like to thank the former Speaker of the House of Representatives and his staff, as well as the Clerk, Bernard Wright, and officers of the Department of the House of Representatives. I welcome the election of the new Speaker, Anna Burke, and the Deputy Speaker, Bruce Scott, and I look forward to working with them again in the new year.


I am especially grateful to the staff from my office here at Parliament House, as well as to my electorate staff in Queensland. I acknowledge and thank all the other people I have not mentioned personally who work in Parliament House and in electorate offices right around Australia. I extend from what I have written before me, to say that I note the dedication of the staff right across the senators and members in this place. Their dedication to their work is second to none, and I think sometimes that is overlooked in the work that goes on in Parliament House.


In conclusion, I extend my best wishes to all colleagues and staff for the upcoming festive season and I look forward to seeing everyone back here in 2013. I thank the Senate.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (23:06):  I have a deal with Senator Abetz, which I hope he honours, that we keep our remarks very short at this late hour and do not go through the performance that occurs in the House of Representatives every year, which seems to go on forever. I think we have again led in procedure in this chamber.


On behalf of the government, I do want to thank all the staff and senators for their contributions and their commitment to our parliamentary democracy. I particularly want to acknowledge the Senate and other parliamentary staff. Their unfailing commitment to public service and capacity to remain polite in dealing with senators and their staff under the most extreme provocation is a great credit to their professionalism, and we all are very well served by the parliamentary staff.


I thank senators and their staff for their cooperation throughout the year. On a personal note, I thank in particular the women in charge on my side of the parliament: Senator Anne McEwen, the Government Whip, and Senator Jacinta Collins, the Manager of Government Business in the Senate. I do not pretend to run the show; I always acknowledge who is in charge. I appreciate the way they have so efficiently conducted the government's business.


To all, it is a great pleasure to be finishing in November. We traditionally used to sit much, much later in the year. I think in my first year here we dealt with the native title legislation—I nodded off during Christmas lunch; I was awoken by a sound rap across the back of the head by someone who exerts influence in the home environment—but we seem to have been much more civilised about our sitting hours and our program this year. I think we have made some improvements there.


I do wish all senators and their staff a good break, with the capacity to reconnect with their families and their constituents and to recharge their batteries before coming back next year in February. I make the point that, unlike what most people see on the evening news, the vast majority of interactions between senators and their staff and other players in this parliament are positive and cooperative. Generally people act with decency and politeness towards each other. That is something that is not seen as much as it should be, but I think we all know that it exists. But it is also true to say that this year has been a particularly rough year in the way politics has been conducted in this country.


I do not say that with any political commentary other than to say we would all do much better if we treated each other with more respect on all occasions. I think we are all guilty of failing the standards that might be desirable. It is worth us all reflecting on, because I think the Australian public find some of the conduct distasteful and not what they expect of us. I make the point that I think most of the interactions we have amongst ourselves, across the chambers and between the parties are positive and constructive. As I say, it is not something that is generally seen.


I wish all senators and their staff a good break. I hope they get a chance to discover some normality in their lives before returning as the fly-in fly-out workforce that characterises our work. On behalf of the government, thanks everyone for their cooperation and I wish senators and staff all the best for the Christmas-New Year period.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (23:10): As the Senate considers adjourning for the Christmas break, it is appropriate to reflect on what we are actually celebrating. Christmas is an integral part of our nation's heritage and ethos, built as it is on the Christian ethic of forgiveness, reconciliation and goodwill. The Christmas break is a time for spiritual, physical and personal renewal.


On behalf of my colleagues in the coalition, I thank all staff who make this place operate as smoothly as it does. I also thank somebody who has not been mentioned, and that is the Reverend Peter Rose, who is the parliamentary Christian fellowship chaplain, for the work that he does amongst all the parliamentarians.


I thank especially my colleagues for the privilege they have given me to allow me to serve them as their leader. I also thank my deputy leader, George Brandis, for the fantastic work that he does; the Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, and our Nationals colleagues; the whip, Helen Kroger; Mitch Fifield, the Manager of Opposition Business; and all my colleagues.


On behalf of the coalition, I also thank our families and close, significant others. We are the volunteers; they are the conscripts, and they often have to put up with a lot as a result of our behaviours, our decisions or what other colleagues might say about us from time to time. We could not do our jobs without their support. On behalf of the coalition, I say thank you to political spouses and children.


It has been an immense privilege to serve under the leadership of Tony Abbott for the past 12 months. In short, on behalf of the coalition, I wish all senators, Senate staff and our individual staff a blessed Christmas, and God bless.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (23:12):  I rise this evening to join Senator Evans and Senator Abetz on behalf of the Greens in saying to everybody here that I hope they have a happy, healthy and safe Christmas and holiday period and have an opportunity to enjoy some time with friends and family. That is what we are looking forward to, I am sure.


I want to take this opportunity to thank my fellow senators and, in particular, Senator Siewert, who doubles as our whip and manager of business. She does an extraordinarily good job, although I have urged her to try and see if she can account the numbers to get a few more numbers from time to time! Nevertheless, she does very well, but we rarely get past 11. We try very hard and we are encouraging her in this pursuit.


I also want to thank our whips clerk and deputy whips clerk, Emma Bull and Alice Ruxton. They work extremely hard to try to negotiate the smooth running of the Senate in the management of business and try to get good outcomes. They help us to stay sane in the management of the way the Senate works.


I want to also thank the Senate staff and the attendants in particular, and of course the Comcar drivers, Ian and Peter, who are organising the transport.


I also thank Hansard—they do a fantastic job for us. The wonderful thing about all of the Senate staff—the attendants, Hansard, Comcar, 2020 and the Clerk's Office—is it is always courteous, it is always helpful and it is always pleasant. We have a stressful life in this job, and it is so good to come in here where everybody is treated in exactly the same way. People go out of their way to try to make sure that we have what we need and to facilitate that at all times. I am, on behalf of all the Greens, really appreciative of the efforts that everyone makes to make this parliament as good as it can be, from the Clerks right through to the attendants, Hansard, Comcar and so on.


I especially thank the gardeners. Gardening is a passion of mine, and one of the joys of being able to work in a beautiful building like this is to be able to look through so much glass around the place into beautiful nooks and crannies in the gardens. It certainly lifts your spirits. There is a beautiful courtyard just near here which, in the Spring, has the most amazing display of azaleas and rhododendrons, camellias and flowering cherries. For two or three weeks of the year it is magnificent. It is a classic example of a thing of beauty being a joy for ever. As I look around the gardens and watch the changing of the seasons I acknowledge and appreciate the efforts of the gardeners, which are maybe not articulated often. I appreciate what they do in bringing joy to our lives in the way that they keep the building and in enabling us to have those moments of sheer enjoyment.


Thanks to everyone, and I hope you all have a really wonderful Christmas break. I look forward to seeing you all in what will be a very big year for every one of us.

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (23:16):  It is always the art form of the valedictory speech to find someone that the other person has not thanked, and by thanking them to trump them. So I would like to thank the security people, who I think have done a splendid job. No-one has been assassinated this year, and it is not from want of trying. I also thank the maintenance men.


In all seriousness, starting with you, Mr President, thank you very much. I concur with the remarks of Senator Evans that if the Australian public only knew that in the vast majority of times when we are off this political football field we all get along in quite a civil manner. The Australian people should be aware of the fact that, once we walk out the door, people treat people with dignity. This is the political football paddock and out there is civvy street, and we know the difference between the two.


I thank the attendants for the wonderful work they have done. I thank Ian and Peter at the shuttle for allowing my car to stay when they should have told it to go. I thank my colleagues Senator Abetz and Senator Brandis—you have done a spectacular job. I have already acknowledged Senator Evans, who has occupied his post with dignity. I thank Senator Milne for the work she has done as leader of her party. I thank Senator Xenophon, Senator Madigan and the whips, Wacka, Helen, Ann and Rachel, who keep us all in line—the polar attraction of dignity. I thank the deputies—one just walked in: where were you? We will talk about that later on. I also acknowledge people that Senator Abetz has acknowledged—people we never see, such as the Reverend Peter Rose, for the marvellous work he does behind the scenes for those who are under the pump a bit and need someone to have a yarn to. In my own particular way, as someone who lives so remotely, I thank squadron 34: so often when I cannot get home the professionalism of that group is absolutely impeccable, and if it were not for them there would be times when I would not see my family for months.


Thanks to everybody else, and to the most important group in this parliament that we do not see: the families who put up with this rather peculiar and chaotic life that we life. I do not know how they do it. To my—and everybody else's—ever-suffering family, whatever form they are in, thank you very much. To everybody, merry Christmas and God bless.

  Well, it is a brave presumption! Away from the sound and fury of this place, there is a common decency that pervades this place in the way we treat each other. I think we have a fundamental respect for each other, whatever differences we have, and that is something that the public does not see. I think it will be a hell of a year next year, with an election coming up, but I would like to think that that basic civility, that basic decency that we show to each other will continue.


I also thank Hansard. They make us look and sound much better than we actually do, at least in the printed form. I also want to thank my team. I do not have a party machine behind me and I have my party room meetings in front of the mirror each morning while I am having a shave, but I am very grateful to my very hardworking team—all of them and, in particular, Hannah, Sally and Skye, who have been in Canberra this week. I could not do it without them. I think behind any good politician there are some very surprised advisers and staff.

"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2012-11-29,"



Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (23:21):  I rise this evening to inform the Senate of a matter that I have been involved in for some time as a result of my participation on the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. It is in relation to the East China Sea and, in particular, the Diaoyutai Islands. Through my capacity on that committee I have had the opportunity to have ambassadors before the committee and to question them on the results of and, in particular, how that dispute is being handled.


The Diaoyutai, or Senkaku, Islands have a long history which dates back to the Ming Dynasty, from 1368 to 1644, when the islands were discovered by the Chinese. The islands consist of five uninhabited islands located in the East China Sea north-west of Taiwan. Over time, the islands have proved to be a popular fishing spot for fishermen from Taiwan and a favourable place for shelter during storms. In addition, medical herbs were gathered there.


Lately, controversies in the East China Sea about the Diaoyutai Islands have seen the government of the Republic of China, Taiwan, reiterate that the Diaoyutais are an island group that belongs to Taiwan and are therefore an inherent part of the territory of the Republic of China. As I understand it, the Republic of China's consistent position has been that the Diaoyutais were returned to the Republic of China, along with Taiwan, based on the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, the Japanese Instrument of Surrender, the Treaty of San Francisco and the Treaty of Peace between the Republic of China and Japan.


Notwithstanding, the Republic of China understands that all parties concerned hold conflicting standpoints and that this is the cause of longstanding disputes and the recent rise of tensions in the region. With respect to the Diaoyutai issue, the government of the Republic of China has consistently affirmed its position of:


… safeguarding sovereignty, shelving disputes, pursuing peace and reciprocity, and promoting joint exploration and development.


With the Diaoyutai Islands being located in the East China Sea, they are an important air and sea transportation hub in the Western Pacific and therefore have clear significance for security and peace in the Asia-Pacific region and in the world as a whole.


For an Australian government, the maintenance of peace, stability and prosperity in our region is of vital interest. This government is committed to seizing the opportunities for Australia as the world's economic and strategic power shifts towards our region. This commitment was expressed recently in the government's Australia in the Asian century white paper.North Asia is particularly important to us because China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan are all among our top trading partners. Australians naturally welcome any initiatives that could reduce tensions in the region and promote the peaceful resolution of disputes. Taiwan's President, Dr Ma Ying-jeou, has set out some valued principles in this regard in his East China Sea Peace Initiative, including refraining from antagonistic actions, shelving controversies and not abandoning dialogue; resolving disputes through peaceful means and in accordance with international law; and exploring ways to cooperate on exploring and developing resources in the East China Sea.


As a matter of foreign policy and principle, Australia does not take sides in complex territorial disputes between countries that are our friends.The Australian federal government hopes goodwill and common sense will prevail in the East China Sea in reaching an amicable settlement. Having built strong relationships with the Taiwanese people here in Australia and abroad, I am confident this is possible. On that note I must say, Mr President, that particularly in Brisbane, as you would possibly know, we hold the greatest diaspora of Taiwanese people in this country, in particular around the Sunnybank region and in the seat of Moreton, where the member for Moreton, Mr Graham Perrett, does an amazing job in his communication and dialogue with the Taiwanese communities in that seat.


I also wish to thank the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Australia and, in particular, Ambassador Katharine Chang, Steve Chang and Wen Cheng Sung, along with Anthony Lin, both from the Brisbane office, for their friendship and education about that wonderful country, Taiwan. Having listened to them before I was fortunate enough to have the chance to visit that country recently as part of a delegation of five from the Senate—Senator Thistlethwaite, Senator Gallacher, Senator Brandis, Senator Ryan and me—I must say that their stories about the opportunities and the business ventures Taiwan has to offer are amazing. You don't really appreciate it until you travel to a country and see what those sorts of initiatives and business enterprises can deliver firsthand; it is only when you see it through your own eyes that you see what an amazing country it is. We travelled from the north to the south and saw a steel manufacturing plant beyond my wildest possible imagination. We also saw the coal fired power station very close to the steel plant. The plant receives coal from Australia—one of our greatest exports to that particular country. It was amazing to see the technology and the efficiencies that they have as a country in terms of the relationship they have with their employees. It is one of the opportunities I recognised firsthand.


In the very few days we had there, I went into a nuclear power station for the first time ever and saw firsthand its operation. I do not have a position either way on nuclear power, but it certainly enlightened me as to the beneficial nature of that type of power, and the efficiency was amazing: 2c per kilowatt hour is delivered out of that power station up there in the north of Taiwan.


So I just want to acknowledge those people in particular.


I want to thank the other senators on that delegation. It was certainly helpful to have the likes of Senator Thistlethwaite, who speaks reasonable Mandarin, to communicate with a number of the ministers and officials over there. It certainly made our opportunity for communication with those people a lot easier. I still am amazed by the fact that they are such a warm and friendly, amazing people with whom I am honoured to have an association—and, certainly, through my role as a senator for Queensland, I will continue my involvement with the Taiwanese communities out in the southern suburbs of Brisbane. Quite often I will get involved in activities with them, raising money for tragic events that happen around the world. I went to a fundraiser with them once where we raised thousands of dollars for the tsunami victims in Japan. Their hearts go out as a group, as a community, to anyone in the world. This is the type of people that we are fortunate to have in our country—whom I refer to as Australians; they migrated here over many years. As I reflected on recently in this speech, we have the greatest diaspora of Taiwanese people in Brisbane and it is an absolute honour and a privilege to have them as part of our community in Australia.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2012-11-29,"



Senator Abetz
  asked the Minister for Human Services, upon notice, on 30 October 2012:


With reference to questions asked during the 2012-13 Supplementary budget estimates hearing of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee held on 18 October 2012, relating to the arrangement between Telstra and the Government: 


(1) Did the request for tender specifically ask for proposals relating to free rate mobile calls. 


(2) Did the agreement with Telstra require Telstra to free rate calls from mobiles; if so, why. 


(3) Was a consideration paid by the Government to Telstra to achieve the outcome of free rate calls from mobiles, and was this service part of the overall consideration. 


(4) Were other mobile telecommunication providers asked to put forward proposals to provide free calls from mobile phones to the designated 1-800 numbers; if not, how does the Government determine whether it has achieved value for money. 


(5) Was any price comparison performed across mobile telecommunication providers to determine whether encouraging low-income and disadvantaged Australians who are clients of the department to use Telstra services would result in an increase in their average phone bills; if not, why not. 


(6) Does the Government believe that it has a duty of care to its clients in this regard.


(7) Did the Government take into account the fact that Telstra increased the costs of calls to services on 1-300 numbers from fixed phones, from 30 cents to 35 cents, as of 1 October 2012. 


(8) Did the Government undertake any analysis on the average savings low-income or Government beneficiary users may make on mobile calls to key services that are free under this deal, as opposed to the increased costs they may bear from the prices Telstra charges for calling other key services. 


(9) Was any cost benefit analysis performed; if so, what did it show. 


(10) Did Telstra agree to free rate phone calls to the Kids Helpline; if not, why not. 


(11) Did the Government consider it to be an important consideration whether or not clients could access the Kids Helpline as a free rate call from Telstra mobile phones. 


(12) Did other mobile telecommunication providers offer a free rating for the Kids Helpline. 


(13) Has the Government received any correspondence from any Commissioner for Children expressing concern that Telstra would not free rate calls to this telephone service; if so, can a copy of the correspondence from the relevant Commissioner or Commissioners and the Government response be provided.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2012-11-29,"



Senator Kim Carr:
  The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:


(1) No.


(2) During the negotiation phase of the tender process the Department of Human Services (the Department) explored opportunities for Telstra to provide additional benefits to support rural and remote and disadvantaged citizens.


The final contract agreement reflected the outcomes of the negotiations that were agreed between the parties. The contract agreement provides for free mobile calls from Telstra mobile phones for five selected inbound numbers operated by the Department. 


(3) No. There is no additional cost to the Department as Telstra waives the per minute call charges for Telstra mobile phone customers. 


(4) No. During the negotiations with Telstra, Telstra advised they would provide free calls from Telstra mobile phones to the designated 1-800 numbers as part of their offer.


(5) No. The Department does not have access to information relating to arrangements made between individuals and their telecommunication providers on their mobile call plans. These arrangements would vary depending on the individual's circumstances and requirements and would make any comparison difficult. 


(6) The Department believes that the individual is best placed to determine their own arrangements for mobile phone plans and their provider of choice. 


(7) No. 


(8) No.


(9) Standard cost benefits analysis was conducted in line with Commonwealth Procurement practices to determine value for money. The outcome of the cost benefit analysis conducted as part of the procurement exercise is reflected in Telstra being selected as the successful tenderer.


(10) No. This service is not operated by the Department. The Department is unable to comment. 


(11) No. Refer to the response to question ten above.


(12) No. This service is not operated by the Department. The Department is unable to comment.


(13) Neither the Minister for Human Services nor the Department has received any correspondence from any Commissioner for Children.
