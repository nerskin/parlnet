Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (09:31):  I rise to speak in support of the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018. People are not entitled to welfare. It is charity. It's the gift of taxpayers, and most taxpayers would like their gift of welfare to be provided in kind rather than in cash. So, while calling the cashless debit card a trial is wearing a little thin, I continue to be comfortable with the continuation of the expansion of the cashless debit card. But let me propose another expansion. Let's provide remuneration to parliamentarians through the cashless debit card, and let's work on their incentives by adjusting their remuneration according to how well they look after the government's finances. All parliamentarians who vote for increasing government spending can compensate us by accepting a hit to their remuneration. A single downward adjustment to their debit card balance would do it. Attempting to shepherd the unemployed into employment through programs such as the cashless debit card is laudable, but the ballooning budget deficit is only part of the government's financial problem. So let's extend the cashless debit card to the parliamentarians who've got us into this financial hole so they can put their money where their mouth is.

"Steele-John, Sen Jordon",AG,2018-08-23,"



Senator STEELE-JOHN
 (Western Australia) (09:33):  I speak this morning on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018, once again dismayed to hear the discriminatory and absolutely factless rhetoric around those who access and utilise their right to access the social safety net that we are once again descending to. We don't seem to be able to have a conversation about the nature of our social safety net, about the realities of being vulnerable in modern-day Australia, about the true nature of poverty in this country, without indulging ourselves in the most disgraceful rhetoric. If I hear once more in this place that the best form of welfare is a job by those who have sat in this place and not worked any semblance, in the last 30 years, of what the vast majority of the Australian public would consider to be an everyday regular job then I will puke.


We are so disconnected in this place. With the average income of those who sit here, the privilege from which we so often descend to take up these places and the absence in our everyday life of interactions with the realities faced by the vast majority of the Australian people, we do not know or experience—and we block our ears when people come before us and tell us about—the realities of life. This bubble in which we exist and this profound sense of unreality by which we are surrounded, combined I am sure with a wilful ignorance, are the only factors which can explain a legislature's desire to enact such a destructive, corrosive and fundamentally baseless policy as the cashless welfare card.


My esteemed colleague Senator Rachel Siewert has on more occasions than I can remember elucidated to this house in great detail each individual element which is so flawed and wrong about this proposed scheme, and yet it has fallen on deaf ears. It has been ignored, because fundamentally those in the government who propose this way forward do not care. They do not believe that poverty, vulnerability and economic struggle are the result of systems failing. They subscribe to the absurd belief that poverty is the result of moral failing and that success and living in wealth and comfort are the result of moral virtue. This is the world view to which this government subscribes, and it has the cheek, the audacity and the bloody-minded ignorance to suggest over and over again that the most vulnerable, those who are most struggling, must pull themselves up by their bootstraps and that if they cannot then that is their own fault. I notice at this moment that the honourable Father of the Senate, Senator Macdonald, is exiting the chamber.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Steele-John, it's not appropriate to reference whether senators are in or out of the chamber. You don't have any idea of the commitments or otherwise of other senators. I'd ask you to withdraw that.




Senator STEELE-JOHN:
  Apologies. I withdraw that. I would note that certain members of the government have on many occasions advocated the continuation of—and set forth why they believe it is right that they should receive—previous parliamentary remuneration schemes that are quite generous in nature and, in the same breath, turn around and support schemes such as this.


My state of WA has been subjected to this experiment, this act of social engineering, that is the cashless welfare card. I observe that it is not, however, communities of great wealth in WA where this scheme is being trialled. It was not to Peppermint Grove that the government turned to trial this scheme. It was not even to metropolitan WA. No, they turned to rural communities. It just shows, once again, the disdain that the government has for communities who are struggling.


Make no mistake—this House can be under no illusion that the trial sites that have been set forward are the end. This is not an aberration; this is the beginning. This is what conservatives in this place would like to see our social safety net become. They look at the entrenched disadvantage and look at the intergenerational poverty, as seen in places such as the United States, and they think it right. They think it preferable. There they see a society where members of their establishment are not held back and don't have their wealth diverted for those as unworthy as people struggling. It is a disgraceful ideology. As somebody who comes proudly from an area of WA that experiences these things in reality, I do not speak against this bill today in the absence of lived experience of what it is like to experience poverty and fear and to not know what the next day will bring.


This chamber, this building, has been consumed for the last week with the most disgraceful forms of self-interested, self-obsessed naval-gazing. The nation is united in disgust with this legislature, with this parliament and with this government. We have seen a decade of an endless process of repetition and of replacement, of polls ruling political discussion and of weak-willed cowardice on behalf of leader after leader and minister after minister. This is all while extolling the urgent need to return to the business of government. What a joke that is. What a joke that is on mornings like today, when the business of government—if we bothered to return to it—would be the implementation of a scheme for which there is no evidential basis, the brainchild of a witless billionaire who manages to get the ear of Liberal policymakers because he makes quite sizeable donations. What a farce. What an absolute joke.


I cannot believe that the business of the Australian legislature is currently occupied, again, with the consideration of a scheme that is the brainchild of one of the wealthiest billionaires in this country, because he believes—unique among all other voices in this space—that he has the solution to entrenched poverty in this country. I cannot believe that a government which so often ridicules members of my party for pursuing policies, which they themselves characterise as idealistic and without an evidence base, pursues a policy approach, embodied in this idea—something which has been tried and tested over and over again and proven to be utterly useless. But not only that: not only didn't it work; it wreaked havoc in the lives of those were subjected to it.


The reality is that it is well-known exactly what things must be done to alleviate poverty in Australia: we must raise Newstart; we must ensure a living wage; and we must strengthen our social safety net and give it the people and skills that are needed to help people in times of crisis. It is the right of every Australian to know that we, as a society, have collectively agreed that poverty is unacceptable, that homelessness is unacceptable and that the hunger of children is not something which we are willing to walk past. It is their right, it is their human right, to access services for the prevention of those societal ills without being made to feel like criminals.


I wonder how long it is since any member of this government was forced to interact with Centrelink services. I do wonder. I wonder if you have experienced the shame, the fear and the self-loathing that is induced by having to admit that you need help. And why do people feel these things? They feel them because this government and previous governments—and the Labor Party is not innocent in this: though they may vote against this bill today, they have participated over the last 20 years quite happily in the demonisation of vulnerable people. They have, when it has suited them electorally, given credence to the idea that the best form of welfare is a job.


I'd like to remind both sides of this chamber that there are hundreds of thousands more people in this country who are out of work than there are jobs for them to go into. This is not a question of moral failing; this is a question of mathematics. Yet, you would condemn these people, both of you, either actively or passively, to a feeling of shame and of failure, the likes of which we, in here, probably cannot comprehend simply because it will win you some votes in Western Sydney, simply because it will swing a crucial seat in Queensland, simply because it will stem the losses in Victoria or maybe it will make you competitive in WA. And, God, don't we get a good headline if we go on about dole bludgers in this country. The Daily Telegraph will love us. The Australianwillgive us a go, and it might just be what's in it to win.


How cold, how cruel this place becomes when it talks about these issues. One side says, 'Let's bash 'em over the head,' and the other side says, 'Maybe not so hard' or 'Maybe we'll keep things exactly the same as they are.' And every single day thousands of people go to sleep on the streets of this nation. Every single day thousands of people go without food—kids go to school hungry. But, God knows, if you're a charity, if you're an NGO, one side will cut your funding and the other side won't guarantee your funding beyond the next bloody election cycle. But if you've got Great Barrier Reef Foundation in your name, well then, hundreds of millions of dollars fall from the bloody sky. What an absolute disgrace. I thank the chamber for its time.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-08-23,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (09:51):  I rise today to add my support to the previous comments already made so eloquently by my colleagues here in this place on the Greens' crossbench, which is, of course, led by Senator Siewert, who has been a tireless advocate against these nasty initiatives that force some of the country's most vulnerable people into further poverty. The Greens have opposed the cashless debit card since its inception. We've submitted dissenting reports on the various pieces of legislation, including the debt card trial in 2015. We expressed deep concerns regarding compulsory income management and recommended that the bill not pass. We have always been opposed to the introduction of this scheme. The idea that it be expanded is just abhorrent. 


We subsequently submitted dissenting a report on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017, highlighting that the flaws of the so-called independent evaluation of the first two trial sites, undertaken by ORIMA, that was being relied on as the justification for the expansion of the card to the Goldfields, Bundaberg and Hervey Bay regions. That was just a flawed process—flawed data and flawed justification—and the Greens said so at the time. The 2017 bill did not pass the Senate in its original form allowing only the Goldfields area trial to commence, which is why we are here again today debating whether or not this card should be expanded. We are absolutely opposed to the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018. We are very concerned that some of the most vulnerable Australians are used as whipping bags for a nasty government agenda.


As I stand here today, we've just heard that the Prime Minister has lost the support of key members of his front bench in exchange for the nasty politics and agenda of Mr Peter Dutton. I think it is an incredibly dark day for the nation that we are about to see a sitting Prime Minister rolled to put in place somebody whose politics are ugly, nasty and have a history of pushing down the most vulnerable and being race baiting. This is a man who walked out of the apology to the stolen generation. This is a man who gloats over the imprisonment of young children on Nauru. This is a man who does not believe in the biggest threat to the world right now—that, of course, is global warming and climate change. He is singing and dancing to the tune of Mr Tony Abbott—a prime minister who was roundly opposed by the Australian people only a short number of months after being elected Prime Minister because of these nasty policies, such as those we are debating in this place today. 


The Greens will oppose this bill all the way through and all the way down the line. We will oppose it, whether it is under this government or under a Dutton government. This bill is absolutely appalling. I can't say strongly enough how opposed to this piece of legislation and this nasty politics the Greens are.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-08-23,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:04):  This attempt to expand the cashless debit card trial is mendacious, cruel and deeply unnecessary. So much of this legislation is objectionable, but the idea that this is a trial is, perhaps, the greatest untruth embedded in the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018. The Liberals, with little to no opposition, want to expand this card to every person on a social support payment. Make no mistake. That is what is at stake here. Of course, a genuine trial would mean that you test something in order that you can examine the evidence. Well, the evidence is in. These cards and this program do not work—unless, of course, the government's aim is to demean and further isolate and to further impoverish some of the most vulnerable members of our community. I have to say, if that's the government's aim—to demean and to further impoverish some of the most vulnerable members of the Australian community—they have been stunningly successful. 


I want to pay tribute to the work done in this area, the power of work done in this area, by my colleague Senator Siewert. She has been an absolutely tireless advocate against this program. Time after time, she's pointed out the flaws in these so-called trials, the flaws in the design of the program and the counterproductive nature of these proposals. This card, this program, is born out of a political party that has nothing but loathing and contempt for people who are struggling financially. And it is born out of a party that has an arrogant need to inflict pain and so-called discipline on people who are struggling to make ends meet. 


I genuinely believe that members of the Liberal Party in this place—having rarely, if ever, experienced the kind of financial hardship experienced by the people who are recipients of unemployment benefits and other social services in Australia, the people that this program will impact on directly—simply cannot conceive of the financial pain and the resultant psychological stress and suffering that those people are going through. Through the robo-debt saga, through a chronic failure to properly resource call logs inside the Department of Social Services, we have seen again and again the Liberal Party failing to understand how difficult it is to make ends meet. 


As I said in my inaugural speech to this parliament, I spent time in my very young years on unemployment benefits. I've spent time unable to find a job. I've spent time where you actually have to make a decision about whether you're going to put a decent feed on the table or whether you're going to pay the power bills or the rent. These are terrible decisions to have to make. I genuinely think that if the Liberal Party senators in this place had any real lived experience of what that is like they would not be proceeding with this proposal, because they would understand that it further demeans people who are impacted by the cashless debit card. It further demeans people who are amongst those people in this country who are struggling under the most financial hardship. 


I want to compare the Liberals' contempt for those on Newstart with their own self-regard. This was laid bare in a recent article in the Fairfax papers under the headline 'It would take a 'miracle' to save Malcolm Turnbull'. There was the following quote:


""A lot of our people are facing the fact that they are in the last six months of their political careers""—



(Quorum formed)



As I was saying, Mr Acting Deputy President Whish-Wilson, before your attention was drawn to the state of the chamber, I want to compare the Liberals' contempt for those on Newstart with their own rampant self-regard. This was laid bare in a recent article in Fairfax. Under the headline, 'It would take a 'miracle' to save Malcolm Turnbull,' there was the following quote:


""A lot of our people are facing that fact that they are in the last six months of their political careers,"" says one worried backbencher. ""They've got houses, school bills, cars that they've set up for themselves on the basis that they're earning $200,000 plus. What do they do if they're suddenly out of work?""


Well, pardon me if I don't shed a single tear for someone who is on $200,000-plus who might find themselves out of work because it turns out that their political party is so out of touch with the struggles that so many Australians are facing. Does that backbencher mean that unemployment is difficult? Well, hallelujah! Finally, a ray of light breaks through those serried ranks of entitled Liberal MPs who have no idea whatsoever what it's like to be on Struggle Street in Australia. Are they saying that being thrown out of work can upset their life plans? Well, hallelujah! Is this the dawn of a great new understanding from the Liberal Party that it's actually pretty tough out there in the real world? Is the Liberal Party backbencher saying that sometimes you can have your employment terminated before you've had the capacity to make plans for the future? Well, hallelujah! Are we finally seeing some level of acceptance from the Liberal Party that it can be bloody tough out there when you lose your job, that it can be tough on people's families, on their kids, and that choices about whether to pay the school levies or the rent or the power bills or put a decent feed on the table for your family can be difficult, agonising choices? Imagine if the Liberal Party showed one per cent of the sympathy for people on Newstart that they are showing for their own backbenchers on $200,000-plus a year. Just imagine the difference that we would see. But, instead of sympathy, what we get out of the Liberals is contempt for people on Newstart. They've consistently demonstrated that fact, time after time. Throughout the trial period for the cashless debit card that contempt was shown again and again.


As members would be aware, the Australian Greens put in a dissenting report to the inquiry into this legislation, which, in its conclusion, stated starkly that the Australian Greens recommend that the bill not be passed. That report made it very clear that the Australian Greens do not support the majority report on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017 and that we reject the committee view contained in the majority report that the research indicates fewer incidents of antisocial behaviour. This so-called research is not based on reliable sources of evidence. Not only has the research been widely criticised by numerous social scientists and academics for not adhering to academic standards; it's been criticised for having major flaws in its methodology and in the way it was reported. And it's worth pointing out that the committee also heard, at the inquiry hearings and through written submissions from people on the ground, evidence that contradicted the findings of the so-called research.


We also made it clear in our dissenting report that we reject the view enshrined in the majority report that extensive consultation was undertaken with the Kimberley and Ceduna trial sites as well as the proposed new sites of the Goldfields and Hinkler. The evidence presented to the committee showed that the consultation process was fundamentally flawed, and it's the view of the Greens, as informed by the tireless and outstanding work of Senator Siewert, that the government's lack of consultation with the community members who would be subject to the card shows starkly that the proposal ought not be supported and demonstrates a fundamental lack of respect for people receiving income support. As I said previously in this contribution, it's no surprise that a process run under the auspices of a Liberal government and a Liberal minister demonstrated a fundamental lack of respect for people receiving income support.


I want to be very clear about the Greens position here. We retain concerns about the operation of the cashless debit card and we have very significant and meaningful concerns about the impact of the cashless debit card on people who are being forced to participate in the program. We're not satisfied with the view of the government and the majority of the committee that the department's continued consultation will ensure that the proposed new sites are prepared to implement the card and able to provide the appropriate services, because the previous consultation processes, which were sporadic at best, were so poor, and the implementation of support services was equally sporadic. We also have significant concerns that this bill limits human rights, and we've seen those concerns raised through the committee process and also through the process of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights.


We've made it very clear in our dissenting report that we reject the majority view of the committee that the cashless debit card has had a positive impact on the trial sites. That is simply not true, and the so-called independent evaluations that the majority committee report is relying on as justification for recommending a further implementation of the cashless debit card have been widely rejected by researchers and social policy experts. In fact, it is the view of the Australian Greens that those claims and those justifications simply do not stand up to scrutiny.


As I said, this proposal has been evaluated by the Joint Standing Committee on Human Rights, which I have the honour to be a member of. The report, which is report No. 8 of 2018, makes clear that concerns had been raised as to whether the measures contained in this legislation are rationally connected—that is, effective to achieve—and proportionate to the objective of the legislation. It is right that those concerns be raised. To be clear: the Greens do not believe that the measures contained in this proposal have a rational connection to the objective of the proposal, and we certainly do not believe that the measures contained in this proposal are proportionate to the objective.


I mentioned the ORIMA Research report. That report states:



… with the exception of drug driving offense and apprehensions under the Public Intoxication Act (PIA) in Ceduna, crime statistics showed no improvement since the commencement of the trial.



The ORIMA report also notes:


… 32 per cent of participants on average reported that the trial had made their lives worse …


So a third of the people who were directly impacted by this proposal said it had made their lives worse. I thought governments were about making people's lives better—well, not in this case. The report goes on to say:




... 33 per cent of participants had experienced adverse complications and limitations from the trial, including difficulties transferring money to children that are away at boarding school and being unable to make small transactions at fundamentally cash-based settings (such as canteens) …





Report No. 8 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights also found at 2.23:





Of particular concern, as has been discussed in previous reports, is that the


cashless debit card trial would be imposed without an assessment of individuals
'


suitability for the scheme. 





It also raised at 2.24:





As the cashless debit card trial applies to anyone below the age of 35 residing


in the trial location who receives the specified social security payments, there are


serious doubts as to whether the measures are the least rights restrictive way of


achieving the objective.
 … this concern is heightened insofar as the trial applies not only to persons whose usual place of residence 
'
is or becomes
'
 within the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area, but also applies to a person whose usual place of residence 
was


within the area.





There were other critiques in that report from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights that I won
'
t have time to go through during this contribution, but I do want to go to some of the committee
'
s responses to this proposal.





The committee raised its opinion that 
the measures 
contained in this legislation 
'
may not be compatible with the right to social security,


the rights to privacy and family, and the right to equality and non-discrimination
'
. The committee also found:





The preceding analysis in relation to the Social Services Legislation


Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018 applies in relation to


the determinations. That is, broadly, that concerns remain as to whether the


cashless debit card trial is effective to achieve its stated objectives and is a


proportionate limitation on human rights.



This is the key here. For members who may not be familiar with the way that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights operates, it assesses legislation and legislative instruments against a whole range of human rights conventions and protocols that Australia is a signatory to. Part of that assessment is forming a judgement as to whether a particular piece of legislation or a particular instrument is rationally connected to those covenants, protocols and conventions that the Australian government has signed up to in the international human rights framework; whether the legislation or instruments are effective to achieve their stated objectives; and, importantly, whether or not they are a proportionate limitation on human rights—that is, is it the least rights-restrictive way of achieving the objective of the legislation or the instrument?


Finally in relation to that report, it finds:


… the determinations may not be compatible with the right to social security, the rights to privacy and family, and the right to equality and nondiscrimination.


That is a very strong finding from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, and it's one that ought to resonate in the minds of all senators as they consider their position on this legislation.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-08-23,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:27):  I just wanted to, as a Queensland senator, make a very brief contribution. I have a meeting of the Privileges Committee starting shortly, so my contribution will be very short.




Senator Farrell:
  Tell us where you're really going!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I'm going to a meeting of the Privileges Committee, chaired by your colleague Senator Collins, at 10:30. As a Queensland senator, I do want to express my support for the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018. I know the local member in the area is very keen to see this bill introduced for constituents in his area. I've heard all of the fine words from particularly the Greens political party. They always amuse me!


Senator McKim talks as if only parliamentarians on this side of the chamber get a salary. He forgets, always, to mention that he gets a salary of some $200,000. It's $200,000 for Senator McKim. Not long ago, he was a minister, heaven forbid, in the Tasmanian government. He would have been receiving $350,000 a year. His leader, Senator Di Natale, what's he on as the leader of a tiny political party? He gets an extra $50,000 or so. That's almost $300,000. Whenever Senator McKim talks about these things he gives the impression to anyone who might be foolish enough to listen to Senator McKim that it is only government members who get paid for being here and the Greens come and do it as a matter of charity. That is when he, as a parliamentarian for most of his life, would have been on almost $300,000 a year. Senator McKim, please spare us the hypocrisy and humbug when you speak.


Senator McKim also suggests the Liberals are always from wealthy families and born with a silver spoon in their mouth. I don't know Senator McKim's background, but I challenge him to say that, as a 14-year-old child, he was out picking beans and tobacco to earn a few dollars, as I did. I'm sure he didn't do that. As a schoolkid, I was out there picking tobacco—not an easy task in those days—and picking beans.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Senator Macdonald, resume your seat. Senator McKim, on a point of order?




Senator McKim:
  On relevance: I make the point that in my first speech I did talk about my fruit-picking experience.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  On relevance, Senator Macdonald is directly addressing your contribution to this debate. It is relevant to the debate.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Senator McKim always likes to give it out, but he never wants anyone to be heard when they have a view different to his. I was out there as a 14- and 15-year-old picking beans and, as I say, it's not an easy task, down on your knees. As a kid, of course, I guess it was much easier than it would be for me now. Picking tobacco was pretty tough work, because you ended up with tobacco leaf stains all over you.


Unlike Senator McKim, I didn't have parents who could send me to private schools or to universities, and I've got wherever I've got through hard work. Again, as I say, I don't know Senator McKim's background, but I suspect he went to university, thanks to the taxpayer—it didn't cost him a cent, I would suggest. Whereas, in my day, I didn't get a Commonwealth scholarship; I wasn't quite that bright. My parents couldn't afford to send me to university, nor could they send me to a private school, as I suspect Senator McKim went to. I know a lot of his colleagues in the Greens political party went to private schools, as I think did most of the Labor senators as well. Good luck to them; I don't hold that against them, but I just get a bit annoyed when you get people like the Greens accusing Liberals of being born with silver spoons in their mouths when, for many of us who share my background, that's simply not the case. We've achieved whatever we've achieved by hard work, and that's why I sometimes wonder that people who do receive government welfare from other taxpayers are not able to get the work that is available.


At every place I go to around remote Australia, particularly remote Queensland, the only people I run into at service stations, at stores out in the middle of nowhere and at pubs around various towns are Irish, English or German backpackers. I often wonder where the Australians are who claim they can't get work, and it seems very easy for these foreign backpackers to get work—admittedly, it's in places like Normanton or Croydon. On the way to the cape a few years ago—it's very, very remote territory up there—some of the service stations had plenty of work, but it was all being filled by foreign backpackers because Australians, apparently, don't want those jobs.


This proposal for this cashless credit card is not taking away anything. It's not reducing the value of the contribution that the taxpayers are giving to people who need assistance and need welfare. It's just that a certain proportion of it can only be spent on the necessities of life. I cannot understand why anyone objects to that. As for this being a breach of human rights, that's something that I, and I must say most of my constituents in Queensland, cannot understand. How can that be a human right? They are getting a certain value, and they'll continue to get a certain value.


As Senator Leyonhjelm, quite rightly, said, receiving welfare from the government is not a human right; that is something that every other Australian chooses to do to help people who cannot help themselves. That's one of the tenets of the Liberal Party and something we've always been very firm and concentrated on, that our society should help those who cannot help themselves. We do that in many ways, and I'm proud to be in a government that has, not just now but all through history, provided assistance for those who could not help themselves. I repeat, for the benefit of Senator Steele-John and, I think, Senator Hinch, that the best form of welfare is a job. There are jobs available. I don't know the circumstances of individual people. I know there are some people who can't take those jobs, and they are being looked after by every other taxpayer in Australia, as they should be. That's a basic tenet of the Liberal Party.


This cashless debit card gives the recipients the same amount of money. I heard people from the other side saying: 'It makes them second-class citizens. People look down on them for handing across a debit card that has the bulk of their contribution from other taxpayers on it.' People who suggest that are simply being disingenuous. These days, almost everybody pays for everything by tapping a credit card, even a cup of coffee. If you go around the coffee carts even in this building, and certainly around Australia, people buy even something as cheap as a cup of coffee by a tap of their credit card. I'm not sure what the embarrassment of handing across a card is. As I say, everybody does it, and I suspect that those who promote that sort of argument would be the sort of people who buy a cup of coffee, tap their credit card and walk away. I'm sure others around them don't say, 'Aren't they a second-class citizen because they've tapped their credit card?' The arguments being promoted against this bill are simply ludicrous, as was the speech we heard from the previous speaker.


As a Queenslander and as a representative of the area where this further trial is going to be in place, I think it's a good idea. I know the local member of parliament thinks it's a good idea, and, for that reason, I'll certainly be supporting the bill.

Senator BURSTON
 (New South Wales) (10:37):  My contribution will be brief today. I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018. This bill amends the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 to expand the cashless debit card arrangements to provide for a further trial in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area to run until 30 June 2020. It will specify the class of trial participants for the area and increase the total number of trial participants overall to 15,000. It also provides an exemption from the restrictive trade practices provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 for merchants that implement product-level blocking systems, firstly, to identify that a cashless debit card is being used for payment, and, if any restricted products are being purchased, decline the transaction, and secondly, to limit the use of the restricted portion of the payment to prevent that portion being used to obtain cash-like products which could be used to obtain alcohol—or drugs, for that matter—or be used for gambling.


Let me be clear: I fully support this bill to expand the trial sites for the cashless debit card. The more information we can gain from on-the-ground use of this program the more we can evaluate its effectiveness. It's my understanding that the cashless debit card does not change the amount of money people receive from Centrelink; it only changes the way in which people receive and spend their fortnightly payments. Those on the cashless debit card receive 20 per cent of their welfare payment in their usual bank account and 80 per cent of their welfare payment on the cashless debit card.


There is already evidence from the current trial sites of the cashless welfare card being successful. I know others have quoted the Mayor of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, John Bowler, but I'll repeat what he said. He said that, while the cashless debit card trial in the Goldfields only started this year, all indications were positive, with police reporting to a liquor accord meeting last week that the level of anti-social behaviour on the streets was clearly down over the last couple of months and that bottle shop retailers also reported to the meeting that disturbances around their premises were considerably less.


I recall a number of senators on the opposite side quoting Andrew Forrest last week and thanking him for his input regarding the marine park disallowance debate. I ask those same senators to heed his advice on this bill. Mr Forrest has championed this program as a means of tackling substance abuse and gambling in predominantly Indigenous communities, and savaged those who voted down the expansion of the scheme earlier this year. He said after the vote:


The feel-good merchants who vote against the cashless debit card, who have never visited a vulnerable community of white people who can't get off welfare, or the indigenous people who have never had a crack … those people who think the only way to improve a person's life is to throw more money and have no idea that they're throwing it through them to a drug dealer, those soft, goodhearted persecutors of vulnerable Australians, those people keep vulnerable Australians and indigenous Australians down …


I implore the Senate to support this bill to expand the trial for this cashless debit card.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2018-08-23,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:40):  I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018. This legislation sums up everything that is wrong with our current government. It's basically an attack on poor people. It's trying to make life harder for poor people. It's telling poor people that it is their fault that they are poor. Why should we be surprised? This government has such a track record of absolutely putting the screws on people who have the misfortune to not have much money, while at the same time supporting the very wealthy in our community and the large corporations. We saw only yesterday their attempt to get big tax cuts to the big end of town through. Fortunately, enough members in this place saw that was not what we needed to be doing in Australia today. We saw $144 billion of cuts to income tax, rather than seeing that there is a need to spend that amount of money, those hundreds of billions of dollars, on services to give everybody in Australia the opportunity to live a good quality life.


The other key thing is that it is very clear from the reviews of the trials that have been done so far that this approach doesn't work. Not only is this crackdown going to make life more difficult for poor people but it is also ineffective at achieving the outcomes that the government wants to achieve. The evidence we already have today is that this approach—quarantining people's money to deal with issues such as substance abuse, gambling and other behaviours which we genuinely want to address in our community—doesn't work. There is so much evidence across the board that there are other ways to address issues like substance abuse and gambling, but you have to ask some questions and dig deeper to see why people have drug and gambling problems. It's not because they get to spend their money whichever way they want; it's because they are quite reasonably struggling to survive in life without education, support, housing and money, or due to family violence issues. When you're in those sorts of circumstances, life's pretty tough and stressful. You are often trying to see the way out. There is then the temptation to abuse drugs or to throw what money you have into gambling, hoping it might actually give you something that will enable you to improve your life. They are the measures that people feel they have to resort to in order to deal with those pressures.


There are other ways of going about dealing with these pressures—rather than absolutely attacking poor people, actually giving them the opportunities, giving them high-quality health care and education and, in particular, increasing the rates of benefits so that people have actually got the ability to live. We should increase Newstart payments, youth allowance and other welfare payments so that people don't feel that life is just one eternal struggle of trying to just hold it together. If we did that, people would then be able to get their lives back on track, engage in education and know that they're not going to be thrown out because they can't pay the rent on their house.


These are the sorts of things that, as a society, we can afford. We are a rich country. We know that, rather than giving massive tax cuts to the big end of town, we can afford to support everybody in our community and to give them the opportunities to live a good life. But no. Just because of, basically, the fundamental approach of this government of saying, 'Those who have should get more, and we should just grind those who are struggling into the ground,' we have these very appalling punitive measures being imposed upon people.


So then we say, as I referred to: does this approach work? Does this populist attack on poor people—this populist appeal saying, 'Oh, well, you've just got dole bludgers, so you've just got to stop them spending their money'—work? Is there the evidence to say that it works? It's very clear that there isn't. That goes to my second main point: the community would think that governments should be making their decisions based on evidence and that, where there is evidence to support a course of action, we should be following that evidence. It's very clear that the evidence from the trials so far, where the cashless welfare card has been used, is that it doesn't work. It's not just random Greens or random members of the community who are saying it doesn't work. It's not just people pulling things out of the air to say it doesn't work. It's one of the institutions that we depend upon to conduct good-quality, objective research. That's the Australian National Audit Office, who of course have done a report on the implementation and performance of the cashless debit card trial. You would think that, if the Audit Office have done a report on the trial as it's gone so far, you would listen to what they have to say. You would think that, in the interests of good governance and evidence-based decision-making, you would pay attention to what they're saying before proceeding to roll out this measure.


The summary of the audit report which I have here lays out what the Audit Office aimed to do in their report. They say:


The Cashless Debit Card Trial (CDCT or the trial) aimed to: test whether social harm caused by alcohol, gambling and drug misuse can be reduced by placing a portion (up to 80 per cent) of a participant's income support payment onto a card that cannot be used to buy alcohol or gambling products or to withdraw cash; and inform the development of a lower cost welfare quarantining solution to replace current income management arrangements.


They say:


The CDCT was selected for audit to identify whether the Department of Social Services (Social Services) was well placed to inform any further roll-out of the CDC with a robust evidence base. Further, the audit aimed to provide assurance that Social Services had established a solid foundation to implement the trial including: consultation and communication with the communities involved; governance arrangements; the management of risks; and robust procurement arrangements.


So what did they find in their conclusions? They found:


The Department of Social Services … approach to monitoring and evaluation was inadequate. As a consequence, it is difficult to conclude whether there had been a reduction in social harm and whether the card was a lower cost welfare quarantining approach.


So you would think, with that overarching conclusion, now is not the time to extend, massively extend, this trial to another major part of Australia. You would think, before you go any further, given that you've got trial sites that are already underway, you would go back and do more monitoring and evaluation until you knew that you had a robust evidence base from the areas where the cashless debit card is already in use. That would be the evidence based thing to do. But, no, instead we've got this government, on the basis of populism, attacking poor people, saying they're going to go on and roll this trial out to thousands and thousands of more people—young people, poor people, people on Newstart, people on youth allowance. Rather than listening to the most credible agency that looked at the effectiveness of the card, they're saying: 'No. We're just going to continue to roll it out somewhere else.' 


The ANAO further concluded:


… it—


Social Services—


did not actively monitor risks identified in risk plans and there were deficiencies in elements of the procurement processes.


They said:


Arrangements to monitor and evaluate the trial were in place although key activities were not undertaken or fully effective, and the level of unrestricted cash available in the community was not effectively monitored … and … they did not cover some operational aspects of the trial such as efficiency, including cost. There was a lack of robustness in data collection and the department's evaluation did not make use of all available administrative data to measure the impact of the trial including any change in social harm.


It is extremely concerning that the ANAO are saying that Social Services did not make use of all available data. You might be forgiven for thinking that Social Services had some preconceived ideas, in terms of its conclusions as to the effectiveness of the trial, and that it wanted to show that the trial was effective, even though it wasn't. Again, I go back to the issue of good governance. The people of Australia want to see good governance. They want to see decisions being made on the basis of evidence. For Social Services to undermine and not use the evidence that's available is extremely disturbing. It's an appalling way to run major parts of our social policy. 


The ANAO continued:


Aspects of the proposed wider roll-out of the CDC—


the cashless debit card—


were informed by learnings from the trial, but the trial was not designed to test the scalability of the CDC and there was no plan in place to undertake further evaluation.


And yet here we are being asked to vote and support a bill that would expand the use of the cashless debit card in a major way to thousands and thousands of more people in another part of the country. This is not the way that we should be doing government here. 


This is a very comprehensive report, and there are many areas that were identified for improvement. Some of the findings included: some identified risks were not actively managed; aspects of the procurement process to engage the card provider and evaluator were not robust; the department didn't document the value-for-money assessment; and, in terms of monitoring and analysing the card, Social Services didn't complete all the activities identified in the strategy, including the cost-benefit analysis. So, not only did it not use the data to determine whether the card worked, given it didn't do that cost-benefit analysis either, one could presume that maybe the trial wasn't an effective way of trying to achieve what it was trying to achieve, and that it's not only attacking poor people for being poor, but it's a really expensive way to attack poor people for being poor—and it's being done just to suit the populist agenda, to appeal to people who have this belief that all the problems of Australia could be solved if we had fewer people on welfare. And yet we know that the reason that people are on welfare, the reason that people are on unemployment benefits in areas of regional Australia, is not because they are dole bludgers or because they are sitting back and not wanting to work; it's because the work isn't available.


We also know that there are so many other ways in which we could be providing work. Again, there is so much good work that the government could be funding and putting the billions of dollars into, instead of giving— (Quorum formed) As I was saying, the issue is with people who don't want to be on welfare, who don't want to be guinea pigs in these trials, who want to have the freedom to spend money where they wish to. They don't want to be in this situation. And the reason they are there isn't that they are dole bludgers, that they don't want to work; it's because the work is not available. There are so many opportunities that government could be providing. They could be providing funding for these people to undertake work that is to the benefit of society, to the benefit of our community, as well as to the benefit of individual people. I'm thinking about things like rolling out Indigenous ranger programs across the country. You'd then have Indigenous people looking after country and looking after our natural environment. There's a massive amount of employment that could be provided through resources being put into that. And it's very cost effective, because it means that we're tackling some of the really key natural resource problems that we face, such as pest animals and plants and dealing with erosion and land degradation. All of these things could be tackled by actually providing the resources to employ people to tackle these problems in our natural environment.


There are other employment opportunities that people are crying out for in regional communities—communities where, for example, they haven't got adequate health services. There are opportunities to support community health services, supporting the rollout of health services across regional Australia so that everybody has the opportunity to access high-quality health services. That means employing people to work in those services, to be there as nurses. It means employing more people in aged-care facilities. And then there are the opportunities in educational settings—employing more teachers' aides in schools, employing more people to be working with people with disabilities. There are things from across the whole of society where we know there is so much potential to spend money in employing people to do jobs with really good social and economic benefits. It would pay for itself over and over again and would give employment to the sorts of people who are being attacked, who are being pilloried, by being in this proposed trial that will be rolled out through the legislation we have before us today.


They are some of the findings of the Audit Office. So it's pretty clear that we should not be expanding this trial while these key questions of the Audit Office about the existing trial sites remain unaddressed. The Queensland Council of Social Service, who are deeply concerned about expanding the trial in the areas of Bundaberg and Hervey Bay in Queensland, where the rollout is proposed, did a comprehensive review of the cashless debit card trial and evaluation. Their findings are well worth noting. In summary, they said:


there is insufficient evidence of success to warrant any further expansion of the trial at this stage


there is a lack of clarity on the key goals and outcomes of the trial …


the evaluation methodology is questionable and the outcomes inconclusive. In addition, the two new sites represent a markedly different environment and Trial scope which has yet to be tested and evaluated


that operating in complexity requires testing of multiple options, preferably options that are supported by evidence and expert opinion …


Again, this comes down to the fact that the evidence goes against expanding the trial. Certainly, the evidence is not there to expand the trial. Just because Senator Macdonald happens to say, 'I think it should go ahead because I think it's a good idea,' that's not evidence. We need to have the evidence base to justify such a major expansion of the cashless debit card. In particular, they say:


The CDC Trial is currently the only option being considered to address these complex social issues and is not supported by the evidence of what works …


They go on to say:


community support has not been clearly evidenced …


So, again, not only doesn't it work, but the community actually don't want it. They want to see options that would really address some of the underlying social issues that people are concerned about—putting more money into drug rehabilitation, putting more money into drug counselling, putting more money into supporting young families who are struggling, and supporting families who are really having difficulties. Putting the resources into those support services is a much more effective way of dealing with the issues that we are facing in Australia, rather than these punitive measures designed to attack people. 


The final dot point of the Queensland Council of Social Service's review is:


accountability for public funds would recommend that there is clear articulation of costs and benefits of the trials prior to any further expansion.


That's pretty clear, and that's what the Greens are actually saying: we are an evidence based party. We say: put the evidence in front of us. And the evidence so far does not support the expansion of this trial. The evidence in front of us says there are other things and other measures that we should be using to address the issues that we're facing as a society. An expansion of the cashless debit card is certainly not that.

"Faruqi, Sen Mehreen",AG,2018-08-23,"



Senator FARUQI
 (New South Wales) (11:01):   I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018. The Australian Greens oppose this bill. The Greens have opposed the cashless debit card since its inception. The bill before us today intends to establish the Hervey Bay and Bundaberg trial site and, if this bill passes, this new trial site will continue on until 30 June 2020. In this trial, the cashless debit card would only be forced on those under 36 and receiving Newstart allowance, youth allowance or parenting payment. The bill also raises the cap on the number of trial participants across the board to 15,000. The bill also introduces provisions that allow merchants to block restricted goods at the point of sale, and expands the list of restricted products to include a cash-like product that could be used to obtain alcoholic beverages or for gambling.


The Greens have been opposed to this type of punitive legislation from the very beginning, because this is entirely about penalising and demonising people on welfare. Let's be clear: this is a particular attack on young people—young people who are already suffering from the policies of this government, because there is a real lack of employment and a real lack of opportunity and there is the increasing cost of living. And, as my colleague Senator Rice pointed out, there is a real lack of services, no matter what area you look into. 


We know that there is no evidence that this is even an effective scheme. The Ceduna and East Kimberley trial sites were examined by the Australian National Audit Office, and it is crystal clear there is no effective impact evaluation. The report said it was 'difficult to conclude' whether there had been a reduction in social harm such as alcoholism and violence, because 'there was a lack of robustness in the data collection'. The same goes for these expanded trial sites. 


But, amid the concerns about the trials and the scope of the process, the lack of evidence and the lack of data, we should not forget the terrible human impacts this kind of social policy has. Let me just share the words of a domestic violence survivor who was part of the cashless debit card trial. She said she would not have been able to escape her abusive marriage under this shameful scheme. This is the story of Jocelyn Wighton, from Ceduna, South Australia. We know that Ceduna is a remote town and has a cash based economy, and many household items are bought in second-hand shops, which do not always have the facilities for this card. Jocelyn said:


If I was on this card when I escaped from my husband, I would not have made it. I bought secondhand furniture down to the plates and knives and forks. You can't do that on the card.


This is what the cashless card does to people. It causes real people real harm.


The ABC also reported on the shame and stigma caused by the card in Western Australia, and I quote from that report:


Ms Asusaar is a single mother, and her family's income is reliant on Centrelink payments for her son's disability as well as for her role as his carer.


This year, she was enrolled in the latest trial of the cashless welfare card in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia.


She said:


We've had people who try to [put] stickers over part of the card, literally hiding it up their sleeve.


The article continues:


Sam Harding, a Kalgoorlie resident who receives the disability support pension, said she had endured multiple incidents of abuse in public associated with her card.


""I was doing some shopping and a transaction went through incorrectly … I think [the cashier] made about 10 to 15 attempts but it didn't work,"" Ms Harding said.


""People just started saying 'oh that's one of those … card people' … by the time I was ready to leave, I was in tears.


This is the real impact on the real people living in these towns and in communities. So I ask the Senate: is this really what we want to be forcing onto already vulnerable people, people who already don't have the services that everyone in Australia deserves?


When these deeply flawed trials were being developed in 2017 and again this year, my colleague Senator Rachel Siewert worked tirelessly in committees to prevent this gross violation of human rights from proceeding, and I really, deeply thank her for her work and wish to draw the chamber's attention to some key points the Greens made in our dissenting report on one of those committees. This is what we said then, and this is absolutely relevant now:


The Australian Greens reject the committee view … that extensive consultation was undertaken … The evidence presented to the committee showed that the consultation process was flawed. The Government's … consultation with the community members who would be subject to the card was almost non-existent and showed a fundamental lack of respect for people receiving income support. 


We said:


Unlike the view expressed in the majority report the Australian Greens are deeply concerned that this bill limits human rights. As outlined in many submissions to the inquiry the circumstances in the trial site are not so extreme or exceptional as to warrant an approach that infringes on the human rights of income support recipients and the Australian Greens reject the committee view that this approach is warranted and legitimate.


Our dissenting report also said:


The Australian Greens oppose Compulsory Income Management. It is a failed measure as can be seen in the final evaluation of the NT Intervention. 


To not have learnt from this sorry chapter in our history is also pretty saddening—a chapter that enjoyed bipartisan support and whose impacts are still being felt in those communities. As we said:


Compulsory Income Management impacts negatively on individuals and the community and imposes significant costs on Government.


Evidence that was provided through submissions and through hearings to this inquiry did show the fundamental and very deep flaws in this approach. We all know that income management has proved to be a completely ineffective policy that totally disempowers and harms those that need our help the most. As we said:


Submissions to the inquiry by peak social service bodies and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations from across Australia expressed deep and fundamental concerns with Compulsory Income Management.


… Despite the history of its imposition, there is no clear evidence that compulsory income management works, or improves the lives of those it affects.


There have been and still are vocal and consistent concerns raised by those who will be subjected to this card in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area. A number of submissions were received from individuals who will be subjected to the card if this bill passes, and a number of these individuals also provided evidence at the hearings for the inquiry. I'm really concerned that their views have not been heard through those consultations, and they're definitely not reflected in the bill that we are debating today. Accordingly, Senator Siewert again highlighted some of their concerns, which I am going to talk about below.


Say No to the Cashless Welfare Card Australia/No Cashless Debit Card Hinkler Region group was concerned, among other things, about the lack of public consultation from the local member and the costs associated with the card, both monetary costs and costs for those subjected to the trial. They said in their submission:


The stigma attached to the card through the constant demonising of the people on social security, the media ""welfare bashing"" has already changed our local community language and the way people on social security are being treated.


They continue on to say:


This card will further divide our community, excluding so many people in so many ways, from community events, school events, charity events, cash economy, secondhand economy, but also the banking economy.


…   …   …


Just like the people on the card in other regions, our residents do not deserve to be treated as a sub class citizen with their human rights removed, their freedom removed, their ability to travel, decided for them …


Let's not forget that these are communities, as I said earlier, and these are people who are already suffering because they don't have the services; we haven't provided them with the services. I've lived on the Mid North Coast for many years. That is where my children grew up. I did see the impact of the lack of services that are available in regional areas, and it is much more so in the areas we are actually talking about.


The Department of Social Services, in the Auditor-General's report Implementation and performance of the cashless debit card trial, concluded a number of points that I would also like to highlight today to this chamber. The conclusion of that report says:


The Department of Social Services largely established appropriate arrangements to implement the Cashless Debit Card Trial, however, its approach to monitoring and evaluation was inadequate. As a consequence, it is difficult to conclude whether there had been a reduction in social harm and whether the card was a lower cost welfare quarantining approach.


Why would we keep pushing a policy that has been seen to have been a complete failure?


Social Services established appropriate arrangements for consultation, communicating with communities and for governance of the implementation of CDCT. … However, it did not actively monitor risks identified in risk plans and there were deficiencies in elements of the procurement processes.


The conclusion of the report goes on to say:


Arrangements to monitor and evaluate the trial were in place although key activities were not undertaken or fully effective, and the level of unrestricted cash available in the community was not effectively monitored. Social Services established relevant and mostly reliable key performance indicators, but they did not cover some operational aspects of the trial such as efficiency, including cost. There was a lack of robustness in data collection and the department's evaluation did not make use of all available administrative data to measure the impact of the trial including any change in social harm. Aspects of the proposed wider roll-out of the CDC were informed by learnings from the trial, but the trial was not designed to test the scalability of the CDC—


And here we are, increasing the number of people by the thousands. I just cannot understand how this policy should pass this chamber, should become concrete, when there are so many missing gaps and so many flaws that have been highlighted again and again by so many different groups.


Locals who will be subjected to this trial want to see the money spent more usefully. They want to see the money that would be spent on the trial go on to fund services such as for homelessness, for domestic violence shelters, for education pathways and for creating jobs for local young people. That's how we will get a vibrant economy that actually does work for everyone. That is the kind of social policy that we should be pursuing, not this disgusting, patronising and violating policy from the coalition.


And it is not just the citizens and the Greens who have concerns. A long list of expert submissions have opposed this bill and continue to oppose this bill. Since the last inquiry into the cashless debit card the Australian National Audit Office, or ANAO, has released its report The implementation and performance of the cashless debit card trial. And in its submission to the inquiry the Accountable Income Management Network gives a really blistering assessment that I think some opposite would benefit from hearing, if you haven't heard it already. The ANAO report on the CDC has explicitly condemned both ORIMA's evaluation process and its final report. The ANAO undertook an audit of the CDC trials to identify whether the Department of Social Services was appropriately informed and positioned to justify a further rollout of the CDC. The ANAO's report concluded that the department's approach to monitoring and evaluation was inadequate, as I said earlier. This report highlighted the same risks and the same issues that all the other reports have highlighted before.


So, how can the coalition go ahead with such a policy, which has the support of literally no-one and which is going to be harmful for the most vulnerable of people and which does not actually set up and use the massive amounts of wealth that we have in Australia to help and support people and get them out of poverty? This legislation is no good for anyone. The Greens vehemently oppose this bill.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2018-08-23,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (11:16):  The Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018 will allow for the expansion of the cashless debit card program to the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay areas. There's a fourth trial site under the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, and the trial will be extended to this site until 30 June 2020, providing sufficient time to implement the trial and for it to operate for at least 12 months. The bill updates the current limitations on the number of participants from 10,000 to 15,000, recognising the increase that would come from implementing the cashless debit card to this area. The bill also moves the provisions in the Social Security (Administration) (Trial of Cashless Welfare Arrangements) Determination 2018 into primary legislation, or, in uncontentious cases, such as the authorising community bodies, into a notifiable instrument. This will mean that for all four sites, including the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay sites, the trial parameters will be embedded in the legislation, providing greater legislative consistency across all sites and improving parliamentary oversight over the cashless debit card legislation.


These amendments specify trial participants for each site, including any exceptions and specifying wellbeing exemptions where being a participant in a cashless debit card trial is determined to pose a serious risk to an individual's mental, physical or emotional wellbeing. In the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay trial site, trial participants are defined as persons under 36 of age receiving Newstart, youth allowance, parenting payment, or single or parenting payment, partner. The selection of the cohort in this area has occurred in response to significant consultations with the impacted community, recognising the need for supporting interventions in the areas of youth unemployment, young families and intergenerational welfare dependency. In the current operating sites of Ceduna in South Australia and the East Kimberley and Goldfields regions of Western Australia, all persons living in the trial area and in receipt of a working-age income support payment are defined as trial participants, which is enshrined in the primary legislation. This aligns with the current arrangement at these sites but provides greater certainty for these communities around the trial arrangements.


For each site, amendments in the bill allow the secretary to make a determination that will vary the restricted percentages for a cashless debit card participant in the event of an unforeseen circumstances, such as a natural disaster or technical failure of the card or the account. The bill also allows the option to establish a community panel by notifiable instrument and clarifies who can be voluntary participants in the current trial sites. Persons living in Ceduna or the East Kimberley or the Goldfields trial sites who are receiving a trigger payment as defined in the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 or an aged pension and are not otherwise trial participants may volunteer to be part of the cashless debit card trial. However, persons in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay trial site who are outside the class of persons identified as a trial participant cannot volunteer. This will allow the opportunity to test the effectiveness of the program on a targeted cohort in the context of a larger urban population with high levels of welfare dependence. The Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area also has a different cultural composition with a much lower proportion of Indigenous Australians in this site compared to the three current trial areas.


The cashless debit card aims to reduce the devastating effects of alcohol, drugs, and gambling abuse. The card operates like an ordinary debit card with the primary difference being that it doesn't work at liquor stores or gambling houses, and it cannot be used to withdraw cash. Consequently, illicit products cannot be purchased with the card. To further this extent, the bill also introduces provisions that allow merchants to block restrictive goods, like cash-like products, at the point of sale, to keep in line with the intent of the program by preventing participants from circumventing the program to spend the welfare payments on alcohol, gambling and drugs. This bill will support additional card functionality at merchants in each of the trial sites and could allow trial participants to access additional merchants. It's important to note that the trial does not detract from the eligibility of a person to receive welfare payments nor reduce the amount of the person's social security entitlement.


The cashless debit card trial has been operating in Ceduna, South Australia, and the East Kimberley, Western Australia, for more than two years, and it was recently expanded to a third site—the Goldfields region in Western Australia in March 2018. Results from the evaluation of the cashless welfare card found that a benefit of the card is that it can increase motivation to find work. A final report evaluating the Ceduna and East Kimberley sites shows feedback from some card participants in 2017 which indicate almost a quarter of people on the card were spending several hours a week looking for work. This was an increase from 11 per cent in February 2017.


By limiting spending on alcohol, drugs and gambling, the cashless debit card can help stabilise people's lives, particularly young people, in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area, with the potential flow-on impacts of improving chances of finding employment or successfully completing education and training. The government has also announced a second evaluation of the cashless debit card across all three current trial sites to assess the ongoing effectiveness of the program. The second evaluation will use research methodologies informed by the University of Queensland and draw on the baseline measurements of social conditions in the Goldfields developed by the University of Adelaide. Findings for the second evaluation will be published in late 2019. The initial positive finds of the impact of the cashless debit card in Ceduna and the East Kimberley have been encouraging. The expansion to Bundaberg and Hervey Bay will help test the card and the technology that supports it in more diverse communities and settings. This will build on the evidence available to further evaluate the impacts and outcomes of the cashless debit card on all participants.


In drafting the bill, the government has carefully balanced community support for the cashless debit card at existing and proposed sites with the concerns raised in parliament around allowing additional time for the gathering of evidence to further evaluate impacts and outcomes. The government remains committed to the continuation of the cashless debit card to provide a strong social welfare safety net through reducing social harm in areas with high levels of welfare dependency and supporting vulnerable people, families and communities.


Just briefly—I'm pleased that Senator Faruqi is still in the chamber—can I just make some short comments on her contribution. In her maiden speech she indicated her interest in Indigenous affairs, and I thank the senator. I normally rely on Senator Siewert in these matters, but it's tremendous to have someone else with that interest. However, I can see early in the piece that some of our views will move. Senator Siewert knows my strongly-held views on this. I come from the Northern Territory where the effects of the first cashless debit card, which was the BasicsCard, was trialled. I can remember a Northern Territory with many communities simply awash with grog. I appreciate more services so that when people are getting bashed we just have to build more domestic violence services. I'm not suggesting any mischief in your approach. The approach we took was that alcohol was causing so much dysfunction to communities, tearing down a culture. If somebody else could have pointed to a way in which we could reduce the amount of alcohol consumed in communities—because I don't think the results of that consumption can be controlled—we would have been more than happy to listen to that. I've been in this place for a while since then and have been listening carefully to Senator Siewert and others, but there is no alternative. This isn't doing something because it is something to do. This is a very important matter. 


I understand that one of the groups in Ceduna that have been really, really badly affected—in fact, I understand that their small to medium-sized business has been completely interrupted and they've moved out of Ceduna—has been those people who are purveyors of methamphetamine. They have complained bitterly and effectively don't think there's really a market in town. The pubs, those people who run the poker machines, have said that this is absolutely outrageous: 'Look at the amount of money that we've lost through our pokies. We should have people from Ceduna here.' A lot of the poor people come into Ceduna and put all their money through the pokies. Those who run the pokies were adamant. They were saying, 'This is a terrible thing to happen to us.' But I don't share that business model and I think the cashless welfare card is an important tool. 


In the Territory, while people will say, 'No, no, you can't find a person in the Territory that will support the card,' let me tell you, it's a bit like the privacy of the booth: you can't get women to say too much publicly because the guerillas and thugs are out there to make sure that you don't speak up about domestic violence. 'You don't speak up about the cashless welfare card. We've decided, the community'—mostly men in the community—'that we don't want the cashless welfare card because it stops my life, my life of making sure that I'll go and gamble, I'll go and drink and I will take the money and I can take it in cash. But I can't now.' And, in the Territory, it's only 50 per cent, so 50 per cent of the money is still spent in whatever discretionary way we have. Some of the trial sites are indicating movement to 80-20. This is a debit card. Whatever you want to point to—second-hand shops, anywhere—you can buy what you want. The only thing you can't get is cash, and you can't go into a place that serves alcohol. They're normally separated, like in Woolies. They separate those places. 


I think these are very good initiatives. These initiatives have been at the behest of the leaders in the community. Of course, there'll be those who say, 'Oh, no, he's not the leader,' and, 'We don't really like her,' because they might differ. But fundamentally the leaders of the communities have been very supportive of this. In terms of meeting with the women's groups, if you said, 'Let's get rid of the BasicsCard—we'll just pay you all cash again,' there would be an outrage in the Northern Territory. The women would say, 'Please don't do this to us. Don't take us back to those bad old days.' I think that in and of itself is very much a voice worth listening to. 



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the bill be read a second time.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-08-23,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:35):  Well, what a shame that this place has, unfortunately, voted to pass the second reading, given—




Senator Bernardi:
  Is that a reflection?




Senator SIEWERT:
  No, I'm not reflecting; I'm just giving a personal opinion. There were some things said during the debate which, quite frankly—given that I'm not allowed to say somebody's lied in this place—did not exactly correlate with the truth. Claims that were made to say this card is working are just not true. I'm sorry, they are just not true. Go to the ANAO report. We were told that the card is working to reduce social harm. The ANAO report hasn't said the government can't claim that, but it's said that the trials have not shown a reduction in social harm. But what we have seen is senator after senator who supports this card come in here and propagate that myth—that this has reduced social harm—and it hasn't. The evidence isn't there. Some senators quoted the mayor of Kalgoorlie and pointed to media releases from the mayor that said there had been a reduction— 




Senator Georgiou:
  It's right there.




Senator SIEWERT:
  Yes, I've got a copy too. I've got a copy too, and guess what it says? Mr Bowler said that 'as well as the cashless welfare card, another factor in the reduction of antisocial behaviour was the increased police patrols in recent months in both CBDs'. For those that don't know Kalgoorlie, there's Kalgoorlie and Boulder. 


So here we have another example, just like we had in the East Kimberley, where the government is bringing in the card at the same time that there's another measure in place. In the East Kimberley it was the restrictions on alcohol sales. That was operating at the same time, and that came up in the evaluation. In Kalgoorlie, we had extra police patrols, just coincidentally at the same time as the cashless welfare card was introduced. Yes, it could be a coincidence; it could have been they were worried in case there were some additional concerns around the introduction of the card. But the fact is it happened. So you can't measure the impact of the cashless welfare card without comparing it to the impact of the extra police presence—the police operation is called Operation Fortitude. Yes, they say that there has been a reduction, they think, in antisocial behaviour, but police cannot comment on whether it is linked to the cashless welfare card. I've also heard other people quote that in the media. In other words, the police themselves cannot comment on whether it is because of the cashless welfare card or Operation Fortitude. So much for Mayor Bowler's opinion that it's just the cashless welfare card that has been responsible. I'd go as far as to say that of course Mr Bowler would back in the cashless welfare card, given that he was the one who was lobbying for it in the first place. So I don't think that media release is worth the paper it is written on. Maybe you should give credit to Operation Fortitude, or do you think that the police operation has been completely ineffective? 


Minister Scullion was in here not long ago making claims around the reduction in social harm. He cannot use the evidence to claim that. He wishes that, but the evidence is not there. He spoke about speaking to women and said that they overwhelmingly support the card. I'm glad he brought up the BasicsCard, because I've been talking about the intervention a lot. He talked about speaking to women in the Northern Territory and about their support for the BasicsCard. Well, the women he's been speaking to are obviously different to the women I have been speaking to—a lot—in the Northern Territory, who don't support the BasicsCard.


What's more, the BasicsCard has been operating in the Northern Territory for over 11 years, and the government keeps falsely quoting—I've said this repeatedly—that it's worked up there. Yet the evaluation of the cashless welfare card showed really, really clearly that it had met none of its objectives—none of its objectives. In fact, there's some evidence in the report to suggest that it has had the reverse effect on some behaviours in terms of further entrenching welfare dependency. It's met none of its objectives. In fact, we still, unfortunately, have a great deal of social harm up there, and I don't think that the government should constantly be going around saying, 'Oh, the BasicsCard's worked fantastically in the Northern Territory,' when we still have an escalating number of children going into out-of-home care.


The Northern Territory government in the past has refused to implement measures around alcohol control to the extent needed, because of pressure from the alcohol industry. I'm really pleased to see that the Northern Territory government has—I think it was yesterday—introduced a floor price on alcohol, on wine. Fantastic! Do you know how long the community has been asking for that measure? Since way before the intervention started. Yet, after all the years of the intervention, we're only seeing that action now. We had the banned drinker register come in. It started operating, but then the conservative government came in and got rid of the banned drinker register.


When the minister stands up there and says, 'We haven't heard Senator Siewert talk about any of those measures,' that is not the truth either. I have been in here week after week, month after month, year after year advocating the measures that should be taken. What do they do? They stick plainly to: 'It's got to be income management. It's got to be income management. It's got to be income management.' It hasn't worked! Now the government in the Northern Territory is taking some measures to restrict the flow, the supply, of alcohol. Expert after expert has also made that point: restrict the flow of alcohol.


Let me come back to the women that I've been talking to, not just in the Northern Territory but in the East Kimberley—the emails I've had from Ceduna but also, most recently, from Kalgoorlie, where the women talked to me about the shame they feel when they have to go into the supermarket. These are women that are on carer payments, for example, who feel this when they go into the supermarket. The minister stood there and said, 'It's just the same as any debit card.' It is not! Everybody in these communities knows what an Indue card looks like. If they don't to begin with, they certainly do when other people start pointing out they've got an Indue card and they're trying to use it, particularly if it fails for some reason and they can't complete their shopping.


The women also talked about having to queue up at the Indue office to try and access the card—just like I would have to do if I wanted to buy something on my credit card online! I would of course go and queue up at my bank to say, 'Could you please switch on this online site so I may buy the necessary medical equipment that I've been trying to buy on my'—so-called—'fantastic, works-like-everybody-else's card.' That's what I do every time I want to use my debit card or credit card. Of course I don't have to do that! I can quite happily use my credit card online whenever I want. You cannot do that automatically with the Indue card.


We had Senator Macdonald in here talking about the gift—sorry, I'm maligning Senator Macdonald; that particular comment, I think, was Senator Leyonhjelm's. He talked about 'the gift of income support'. No, there is a right to income support, and we have international obligations around social security. I'm so over the conservative side of politics talking about the taxpayers—

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2018-08-23,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (09:31):  I rise to speak in support of the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018. People are not entitled to welfare. It is charity. It's the gift of taxpayers, and most taxpayers would like their gift of welfare to be provided in kind rather than in cash. So, while calling the cashless debit card a trial is wearing a little thin, I continue to be comfortable with the continuation of the expansion of the cashless debit card. But let me propose another expansion. Let's provide remuneration to parliamentarians through the cashless debit card, and let's work on their incentives by adjusting their remuneration according to how well they look after the government's finances. All parliamentarians who vote for increasing government spending can compensate us by accepting a hit to their remuneration. A single downward adjustment to their debit card balance would do it. Attempting to shepherd the unemployed into employment through programs such as the cashless debit card is laudable, but the ballooning budget deficit is only part of the government's financial problem. So let's extend the cashless debit card to the parliamentarians who've got us into this financial hole so they can put their money where their mouth is.

"Steele-John, Sen Jordon",AG,2018-08-23,"



Senator STEELE-JOHN
 (Western Australia) (09:33):  I speak this morning on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018, once again dismayed to hear the discriminatory and absolutely factless rhetoric around those who access and utilise their right to access the social safety net that we are once again descending to. We don't seem to be able to have a conversation about the nature of our social safety net, about the realities of being vulnerable in modern-day Australia, about the true nature of poverty in this country, without indulging ourselves in the most disgraceful rhetoric. If I hear once more in this place that the best form of welfare is a job by those who have sat in this place and not worked any semblance, in the last 30 years, of what the vast majority of the Australian public would consider to be an everyday regular job then I will puke.


We are so disconnected in this place. With the average income of those who sit here, the privilege from which we so often descend to take up these places and the absence in our everyday life of interactions with the realities faced by the vast majority of the Australian people, we do not know or experience—and we block our ears when people come before us and tell us about—the realities of life. This bubble in which we exist and this profound sense of unreality by which we are surrounded, combined I am sure with a wilful ignorance, are the only factors which can explain a legislature's desire to enact such a destructive, corrosive and fundamentally baseless policy as the cashless welfare card.


My esteemed colleague Senator Rachel Siewert has on more occasions than I can remember elucidated to this house in great detail each individual element which is so flawed and wrong about this proposed scheme, and yet it has fallen on deaf ears. It has been ignored, because fundamentally those in the government who propose this way forward do not care. They do not believe that poverty, vulnerability and economic struggle are the result of systems failing. They subscribe to the absurd belief that poverty is the result of moral failing and that success and living in wealth and comfort are the result of moral virtue. This is the world view to which this government subscribes, and it has the cheek, the audacity and the bloody-minded ignorance to suggest over and over again that the most vulnerable, those who are most struggling, must pull themselves up by their bootstraps and that if they cannot then that is their own fault. I notice at this moment that the honourable Father of the Senate, Senator Macdonald, is exiting the chamber.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Steele-John, it's not appropriate to reference whether senators are in or out of the chamber. You don't have any idea of the commitments or otherwise of other senators. I'd ask you to withdraw that.




Senator STEELE-JOHN:
  Apologies. I withdraw that. I would note that certain members of the government have on many occasions advocated the continuation of—and set forth why they believe it is right that they should receive—previous parliamentary remuneration schemes that are quite generous in nature and, in the same breath, turn around and support schemes such as this.


My state of WA has been subjected to this experiment, this act of social engineering, that is the cashless welfare card. I observe that it is not, however, communities of great wealth in WA where this scheme is being trialled. It was not to Peppermint Grove that the government turned to trial this scheme. It was not even to metropolitan WA. No, they turned to rural communities. It just shows, once again, the disdain that the government has for communities who are struggling.


Make no mistake—this House can be under no illusion that the trial sites that have been set forward are the end. This is not an aberration; this is the beginning. This is what conservatives in this place would like to see our social safety net become. They look at the entrenched disadvantage and look at the intergenerational poverty, as seen in places such as the United States, and they think it right. They think it preferable. There they see a society where members of their establishment are not held back and don't have their wealth diverted for those as unworthy as people struggling. It is a disgraceful ideology. As somebody who comes proudly from an area of WA that experiences these things in reality, I do not speak against this bill today in the absence of lived experience of what it is like to experience poverty and fear and to not know what the next day will bring.


This chamber, this building, has been consumed for the last week with the most disgraceful forms of self-interested, self-obsessed naval-gazing. The nation is united in disgust with this legislature, with this parliament and with this government. We have seen a decade of an endless process of repetition and of replacement, of polls ruling political discussion and of weak-willed cowardice on behalf of leader after leader and minister after minister. This is all while extolling the urgent need to return to the business of government. What a joke that is. What a joke that is on mornings like today, when the business of government—if we bothered to return to it—would be the implementation of a scheme for which there is no evidential basis, the brainchild of a witless billionaire who manages to get the ear of Liberal policymakers because he makes quite sizeable donations. What a farce. What an absolute joke.


I cannot believe that the business of the Australian legislature is currently occupied, again, with the consideration of a scheme that is the brainchild of one of the wealthiest billionaires in this country, because he believes—unique among all other voices in this space—that he has the solution to entrenched poverty in this country. I cannot believe that a government which so often ridicules members of my party for pursuing policies, which they themselves characterise as idealistic and without an evidence base, pursues a policy approach, embodied in this idea—something which has been tried and tested over and over again and proven to be utterly useless. But not only that: not only didn't it work; it wreaked havoc in the lives of those were subjected to it.


The reality is that it is well-known exactly what things must be done to alleviate poverty in Australia: we must raise Newstart; we must ensure a living wage; and we must strengthen our social safety net and give it the people and skills that are needed to help people in times of crisis. It is the right of every Australian to know that we, as a society, have collectively agreed that poverty is unacceptable, that homelessness is unacceptable and that the hunger of children is not something which we are willing to walk past. It is their right, it is their human right, to access services for the prevention of those societal ills without being made to feel like criminals.


I wonder how long it is since any member of this government was forced to interact with Centrelink services. I do wonder. I wonder if you have experienced the shame, the fear and the self-loathing that is induced by having to admit that you need help. And why do people feel these things? They feel them because this government and previous governments—and the Labor Party is not innocent in this: though they may vote against this bill today, they have participated over the last 20 years quite happily in the demonisation of vulnerable people. They have, when it has suited them electorally, given credence to the idea that the best form of welfare is a job.


I'd like to remind both sides of this chamber that there are hundreds of thousands more people in this country who are out of work than there are jobs for them to go into. This is not a question of moral failing; this is a question of mathematics. Yet, you would condemn these people, both of you, either actively or passively, to a feeling of shame and of failure, the likes of which we, in here, probably cannot comprehend simply because it will win you some votes in Western Sydney, simply because it will swing a crucial seat in Queensland, simply because it will stem the losses in Victoria or maybe it will make you competitive in WA. And, God, don't we get a good headline if we go on about dole bludgers in this country. The Daily Telegraph will love us. The Australianwillgive us a go, and it might just be what's in it to win.


How cold, how cruel this place becomes when it talks about these issues. One side says, 'Let's bash 'em over the head,' and the other side says, 'Maybe not so hard' or 'Maybe we'll keep things exactly the same as they are.' And every single day thousands of people go to sleep on the streets of this nation. Every single day thousands of people go without food—kids go to school hungry. But, God knows, if you're a charity, if you're an NGO, one side will cut your funding and the other side won't guarantee your funding beyond the next bloody election cycle. But if you've got Great Barrier Reef Foundation in your name, well then, hundreds of millions of dollars fall from the bloody sky. What an absolute disgrace. I thank the chamber for its time.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-08-23,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (09:51):  I rise today to add my support to the previous comments already made so eloquently by my colleagues here in this place on the Greens' crossbench, which is, of course, led by Senator Siewert, who has been a tireless advocate against these nasty initiatives that force some of the country's most vulnerable people into further poverty. The Greens have opposed the cashless debit card since its inception. We've submitted dissenting reports on the various pieces of legislation, including the debt card trial in 2015. We expressed deep concerns regarding compulsory income management and recommended that the bill not pass. We have always been opposed to the introduction of this scheme. The idea that it be expanded is just abhorrent. 


We subsequently submitted dissenting a report on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017, highlighting that the flaws of the so-called independent evaluation of the first two trial sites, undertaken by ORIMA, that was being relied on as the justification for the expansion of the card to the Goldfields, Bundaberg and Hervey Bay regions. That was just a flawed process—flawed data and flawed justification—and the Greens said so at the time. The 2017 bill did not pass the Senate in its original form allowing only the Goldfields area trial to commence, which is why we are here again today debating whether or not this card should be expanded. We are absolutely opposed to the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018. We are very concerned that some of the most vulnerable Australians are used as whipping bags for a nasty government agenda.


As I stand here today, we've just heard that the Prime Minister has lost the support of key members of his front bench in exchange for the nasty politics and agenda of Mr Peter Dutton. I think it is an incredibly dark day for the nation that we are about to see a sitting Prime Minister rolled to put in place somebody whose politics are ugly, nasty and have a history of pushing down the most vulnerable and being race baiting. This is a man who walked out of the apology to the stolen generation. This is a man who gloats over the imprisonment of young children on Nauru. This is a man who does not believe in the biggest threat to the world right now—that, of course, is global warming and climate change. He is singing and dancing to the tune of Mr Tony Abbott—a prime minister who was roundly opposed by the Australian people only a short number of months after being elected Prime Minister because of these nasty policies, such as those we are debating in this place today. 


The Greens will oppose this bill all the way through and all the way down the line. We will oppose it, whether it is under this government or under a Dutton government. This bill is absolutely appalling. I can't say strongly enough how opposed to this piece of legislation and this nasty politics the Greens are.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-08-23,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:04):  This attempt to expand the cashless debit card trial is mendacious, cruel and deeply unnecessary. So much of this legislation is objectionable, but the idea that this is a trial is, perhaps, the greatest untruth embedded in the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018. The Liberals, with little to no opposition, want to expand this card to every person on a social support payment. Make no mistake. That is what is at stake here. Of course, a genuine trial would mean that you test something in order that you can examine the evidence. Well, the evidence is in. These cards and this program do not work—unless, of course, the government's aim is to demean and further isolate and to further impoverish some of the most vulnerable members of our community. I have to say, if that's the government's aim—to demean and to further impoverish some of the most vulnerable members of the Australian community—they have been stunningly successful. 


I want to pay tribute to the work done in this area, the power of work done in this area, by my colleague Senator Siewert. She has been an absolutely tireless advocate against this program. Time after time, she's pointed out the flaws in these so-called trials, the flaws in the design of the program and the counterproductive nature of these proposals. This card, this program, is born out of a political party that has nothing but loathing and contempt for people who are struggling financially. And it is born out of a party that has an arrogant need to inflict pain and so-called discipline on people who are struggling to make ends meet. 


I genuinely believe that members of the Liberal Party in this place—having rarely, if ever, experienced the kind of financial hardship experienced by the people who are recipients of unemployment benefits and other social services in Australia, the people that this program will impact on directly—simply cannot conceive of the financial pain and the resultant psychological stress and suffering that those people are going through. Through the robo-debt saga, through a chronic failure to properly resource call logs inside the Department of Social Services, we have seen again and again the Liberal Party failing to understand how difficult it is to make ends meet. 


As I said in my inaugural speech to this parliament, I spent time in my very young years on unemployment benefits. I've spent time unable to find a job. I've spent time where you actually have to make a decision about whether you're going to put a decent feed on the table or whether you're going to pay the power bills or the rent. These are terrible decisions to have to make. I genuinely think that if the Liberal Party senators in this place had any real lived experience of what that is like they would not be proceeding with this proposal, because they would understand that it further demeans people who are impacted by the cashless debit card. It further demeans people who are amongst those people in this country who are struggling under the most financial hardship. 


I want to compare the Liberals' contempt for those on Newstart with their own self-regard. This was laid bare in a recent article in the Fairfax papers under the headline 'It would take a 'miracle' to save Malcolm Turnbull'. There was the following quote:


""A lot of our people are facing the fact that they are in the last six months of their political careers""—



(Quorum formed)



As I was saying, Mr Acting Deputy President Whish-Wilson, before your attention was drawn to the state of the chamber, I want to compare the Liberals' contempt for those on Newstart with their own rampant self-regard. This was laid bare in a recent article in Fairfax. Under the headline, 'It would take a 'miracle' to save Malcolm Turnbull,' there was the following quote:


""A lot of our people are facing that fact that they are in the last six months of their political careers,"" says one worried backbencher. ""They've got houses, school bills, cars that they've set up for themselves on the basis that they're earning $200,000 plus. What do they do if they're suddenly out of work?""


Well, pardon me if I don't shed a single tear for someone who is on $200,000-plus who might find themselves out of work because it turns out that their political party is so out of touch with the struggles that so many Australians are facing. Does that backbencher mean that unemployment is difficult? Well, hallelujah! Finally, a ray of light breaks through those serried ranks of entitled Liberal MPs who have no idea whatsoever what it's like to be on Struggle Street in Australia. Are they saying that being thrown out of work can upset their life plans? Well, hallelujah! Is this the dawn of a great new understanding from the Liberal Party that it's actually pretty tough out there in the real world? Is the Liberal Party backbencher saying that sometimes you can have your employment terminated before you've had the capacity to make plans for the future? Well, hallelujah! Are we finally seeing some level of acceptance from the Liberal Party that it can be bloody tough out there when you lose your job, that it can be tough on people's families, on their kids, and that choices about whether to pay the school levies or the rent or the power bills or put a decent feed on the table for your family can be difficult, agonising choices? Imagine if the Liberal Party showed one per cent of the sympathy for people on Newstart that they are showing for their own backbenchers on $200,000-plus a year. Just imagine the difference that we would see. But, instead of sympathy, what we get out of the Liberals is contempt for people on Newstart. They've consistently demonstrated that fact, time after time. Throughout the trial period for the cashless debit card that contempt was shown again and again.


As members would be aware, the Australian Greens put in a dissenting report to the inquiry into this legislation, which, in its conclusion, stated starkly that the Australian Greens recommend that the bill not be passed. That report made it very clear that the Australian Greens do not support the majority report on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017 and that we reject the committee view contained in the majority report that the research indicates fewer incidents of antisocial behaviour. This so-called research is not based on reliable sources of evidence. Not only has the research been widely criticised by numerous social scientists and academics for not adhering to academic standards; it's been criticised for having major flaws in its methodology and in the way it was reported. And it's worth pointing out that the committee also heard, at the inquiry hearings and through written submissions from people on the ground, evidence that contradicted the findings of the so-called research.


We also made it clear in our dissenting report that we reject the view enshrined in the majority report that extensive consultation was undertaken with the Kimberley and Ceduna trial sites as well as the proposed new sites of the Goldfields and Hinkler. The evidence presented to the committee showed that the consultation process was fundamentally flawed, and it's the view of the Greens, as informed by the tireless and outstanding work of Senator Siewert, that the government's lack of consultation with the community members who would be subject to the card shows starkly that the proposal ought not be supported and demonstrates a fundamental lack of respect for people receiving income support. As I said previously in this contribution, it's no surprise that a process run under the auspices of a Liberal government and a Liberal minister demonstrated a fundamental lack of respect for people receiving income support.


I want to be very clear about the Greens position here. We retain concerns about the operation of the cashless debit card and we have very significant and meaningful concerns about the impact of the cashless debit card on people who are being forced to participate in the program. We're not satisfied with the view of the government and the majority of the committee that the department's continued consultation will ensure that the proposed new sites are prepared to implement the card and able to provide the appropriate services, because the previous consultation processes, which were sporadic at best, were so poor, and the implementation of support services was equally sporadic. We also have significant concerns that this bill limits human rights, and we've seen those concerns raised through the committee process and also through the process of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights.


We've made it very clear in our dissenting report that we reject the majority view of the committee that the cashless debit card has had a positive impact on the trial sites. That is simply not true, and the so-called independent evaluations that the majority committee report is relying on as justification for recommending a further implementation of the cashless debit card have been widely rejected by researchers and social policy experts. In fact, it is the view of the Australian Greens that those claims and those justifications simply do not stand up to scrutiny.


As I said, this proposal has been evaluated by the Joint Standing Committee on Human Rights, which I have the honour to be a member of. The report, which is report No. 8 of 2018, makes clear that concerns had been raised as to whether the measures contained in this legislation are rationally connected—that is, effective to achieve—and proportionate to the objective of the legislation. It is right that those concerns be raised. To be clear: the Greens do not believe that the measures contained in this proposal have a rational connection to the objective of the proposal, and we certainly do not believe that the measures contained in this proposal are proportionate to the objective.


I mentioned the ORIMA Research report. That report states:



… with the exception of drug driving offense and apprehensions under the Public Intoxication Act (PIA) in Ceduna, crime statistics showed no improvement since the commencement of the trial.



The ORIMA report also notes:


… 32 per cent of participants on average reported that the trial had made their lives worse …


So a third of the people who were directly impacted by this proposal said it had made their lives worse. I thought governments were about making people's lives better—well, not in this case. The report goes on to say:




... 33 per cent of participants had experienced adverse complications and limitations from the trial, including difficulties transferring money to children that are away at boarding school and being unable to make small transactions at fundamentally cash-based settings (such as canteens) …





Report No. 8 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights also found at 2.23:





Of particular concern, as has been discussed in previous reports, is that the


cashless debit card trial would be imposed without an assessment of individuals
'


suitability for the scheme. 





It also raised at 2.24:





As the cashless debit card trial applies to anyone below the age of 35 residing


in the trial location who receives the specified social security payments, there are


serious doubts as to whether the measures are the least rights restrictive way of


achieving the objective.
 … this concern is heightened insofar as the trial applies not only to persons whose usual place of residence 
'
is or becomes
'
 within the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area, but also applies to a person whose usual place of residence 
was


within the area.





There were other critiques in that report from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights that I won
'
t have time to go through during this contribution, but I do want to go to some of the committee
'
s responses to this proposal.





The committee raised its opinion that 
the measures 
contained in this legislation 
'
may not be compatible with the right to social security,


the rights to privacy and family, and the right to equality and non-discrimination
'
. The committee also found:





The preceding analysis in relation to the Social Services Legislation


Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018 applies in relation to


the determinations. That is, broadly, that concerns remain as to whether the


cashless debit card trial is effective to achieve its stated objectives and is a


proportionate limitation on human rights.



This is the key here. For members who may not be familiar with the way that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights operates, it assesses legislation and legislative instruments against a whole range of human rights conventions and protocols that Australia is a signatory to. Part of that assessment is forming a judgement as to whether a particular piece of legislation or a particular instrument is rationally connected to those covenants, protocols and conventions that the Australian government has signed up to in the international human rights framework; whether the legislation or instruments are effective to achieve their stated objectives; and, importantly, whether or not they are a proportionate limitation on human rights—that is, is it the least rights-restrictive way of achieving the objective of the legislation or the instrument?


Finally in relation to that report, it finds:


… the determinations may not be compatible with the right to social security, the rights to privacy and family, and the right to equality and nondiscrimination.


That is a very strong finding from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, and it's one that ought to resonate in the minds of all senators as they consider their position on this legislation.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-08-23,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:27):  I just wanted to, as a Queensland senator, make a very brief contribution. I have a meeting of the Privileges Committee starting shortly, so my contribution will be very short.




Senator Farrell:
  Tell us where you're really going!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I'm going to a meeting of the Privileges Committee, chaired by your colleague Senator Collins, at 10:30. As a Queensland senator, I do want to express my support for the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018. I know the local member in the area is very keen to see this bill introduced for constituents in his area. I've heard all of the fine words from particularly the Greens political party. They always amuse me!


Senator McKim talks as if only parliamentarians on this side of the chamber get a salary. He forgets, always, to mention that he gets a salary of some $200,000. It's $200,000 for Senator McKim. Not long ago, he was a minister, heaven forbid, in the Tasmanian government. He would have been receiving $350,000 a year. His leader, Senator Di Natale, what's he on as the leader of a tiny political party? He gets an extra $50,000 or so. That's almost $300,000. Whenever Senator McKim talks about these things he gives the impression to anyone who might be foolish enough to listen to Senator McKim that it is only government members who get paid for being here and the Greens come and do it as a matter of charity. That is when he, as a parliamentarian for most of his life, would have been on almost $300,000 a year. Senator McKim, please spare us the hypocrisy and humbug when you speak.


Senator McKim also suggests the Liberals are always from wealthy families and born with a silver spoon in their mouth. I don't know Senator McKim's background, but I challenge him to say that, as a 14-year-old child, he was out picking beans and tobacco to earn a few dollars, as I did. I'm sure he didn't do that. As a schoolkid, I was out there picking tobacco—not an easy task in those days—and picking beans.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Senator Macdonald, resume your seat. Senator McKim, on a point of order?




Senator McKim:
  On relevance: I make the point that in my first speech I did talk about my fruit-picking experience.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  On relevance, Senator Macdonald is directly addressing your contribution to this debate. It is relevant to the debate.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Senator McKim always likes to give it out, but he never wants anyone to be heard when they have a view different to his. I was out there as a 14- and 15-year-old picking beans and, as I say, it's not an easy task, down on your knees. As a kid, of course, I guess it was much easier than it would be for me now. Picking tobacco was pretty tough work, because you ended up with tobacco leaf stains all over you.


Unlike Senator McKim, I didn't have parents who could send me to private schools or to universities, and I've got wherever I've got through hard work. Again, as I say, I don't know Senator McKim's background, but I suspect he went to university, thanks to the taxpayer—it didn't cost him a cent, I would suggest. Whereas, in my day, I didn't get a Commonwealth scholarship; I wasn't quite that bright. My parents couldn't afford to send me to university, nor could they send me to a private school, as I suspect Senator McKim went to. I know a lot of his colleagues in the Greens political party went to private schools, as I think did most of the Labor senators as well. Good luck to them; I don't hold that against them, but I just get a bit annoyed when you get people like the Greens accusing Liberals of being born with silver spoons in their mouths when, for many of us who share my background, that's simply not the case. We've achieved whatever we've achieved by hard work, and that's why I sometimes wonder that people who do receive government welfare from other taxpayers are not able to get the work that is available.


At every place I go to around remote Australia, particularly remote Queensland, the only people I run into at service stations, at stores out in the middle of nowhere and at pubs around various towns are Irish, English or German backpackers. I often wonder where the Australians are who claim they can't get work, and it seems very easy for these foreign backpackers to get work—admittedly, it's in places like Normanton or Croydon. On the way to the cape a few years ago—it's very, very remote territory up there—some of the service stations had plenty of work, but it was all being filled by foreign backpackers because Australians, apparently, don't want those jobs.


This proposal for this cashless credit card is not taking away anything. It's not reducing the value of the contribution that the taxpayers are giving to people who need assistance and need welfare. It's just that a certain proportion of it can only be spent on the necessities of life. I cannot understand why anyone objects to that. As for this being a breach of human rights, that's something that I, and I must say most of my constituents in Queensland, cannot understand. How can that be a human right? They are getting a certain value, and they'll continue to get a certain value.


As Senator Leyonhjelm, quite rightly, said, receiving welfare from the government is not a human right; that is something that every other Australian chooses to do to help people who cannot help themselves. That's one of the tenets of the Liberal Party and something we've always been very firm and concentrated on, that our society should help those who cannot help themselves. We do that in many ways, and I'm proud to be in a government that has, not just now but all through history, provided assistance for those who could not help themselves. I repeat, for the benefit of Senator Steele-John and, I think, Senator Hinch, that the best form of welfare is a job. There are jobs available. I don't know the circumstances of individual people. I know there are some people who can't take those jobs, and they are being looked after by every other taxpayer in Australia, as they should be. That's a basic tenet of the Liberal Party.


This cashless debit card gives the recipients the same amount of money. I heard people from the other side saying: 'It makes them second-class citizens. People look down on them for handing across a debit card that has the bulk of their contribution from other taxpayers on it.' People who suggest that are simply being disingenuous. These days, almost everybody pays for everything by tapping a credit card, even a cup of coffee. If you go around the coffee carts even in this building, and certainly around Australia, people buy even something as cheap as a cup of coffee by a tap of their credit card. I'm not sure what the embarrassment of handing across a card is. As I say, everybody does it, and I suspect that those who promote that sort of argument would be the sort of people who buy a cup of coffee, tap their credit card and walk away. I'm sure others around them don't say, 'Aren't they a second-class citizen because they've tapped their credit card?' The arguments being promoted against this bill are simply ludicrous, as was the speech we heard from the previous speaker.


As a Queenslander and as a representative of the area where this further trial is going to be in place, I think it's a good idea. I know the local member of parliament thinks it's a good idea, and, for that reason, I'll certainly be supporting the bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Burston, Sen Brian",UAP,2018-08-23,"



Senator BURSTON
 (New South Wales) (10:37):  My contribution will be brief today. I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018. This bill amends the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 to expand the cashless debit card arrangements to provide for a further trial in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area to run until 30 June 2020. It will specify the class of trial participants for the area and increase the total number of trial participants overall to 15,000. It also provides an exemption from the restrictive trade practices provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 for merchants that implement product-level blocking systems, firstly, to identify that a cashless debit card is being used for payment, and, if any restricted products are being purchased, decline the transaction, and secondly, to limit the use of the restricted portion of the payment to prevent that portion being used to obtain cash-like products which could be used to obtain alcohol—or drugs, for that matter—or be used for gambling.


Let me be clear: I fully support this bill to expand the trial sites for the cashless debit card. The more information we can gain from on-the-ground use of this program the more we can evaluate its effectiveness. It's my understanding that the cashless debit card does not change the amount of money people receive from Centrelink; it only changes the way in which people receive and spend their fortnightly payments. Those on the cashless debit card receive 20 per cent of their welfare payment in their usual bank account and 80 per cent of their welfare payment on the cashless debit card.


There is already evidence from the current trial sites of the cashless welfare card being successful. I know others have quoted the Mayor of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, John Bowler, but I'll repeat what he said. He said that, while the cashless debit card trial in the Goldfields only started this year, all indications were positive, with police reporting to a liquor accord meeting last week that the level of anti-social behaviour on the streets was clearly down over the last couple of months and that bottle shop retailers also reported to the meeting that disturbances around their premises were considerably less.


I recall a number of senators on the opposite side quoting Andrew Forrest last week and thanking him for his input regarding the marine park disallowance debate. I ask those same senators to heed his advice on this bill. Mr Forrest has championed this program as a means of tackling substance abuse and gambling in predominantly Indigenous communities, and savaged those who voted down the expansion of the scheme earlier this year. He said after the vote:


The feel-good merchants who vote against the cashless debit card, who have never visited a vulnerable community of white people who can't get off welfare, or the indigenous people who have never had a crack … those people who think the only way to improve a person's life is to throw more money and have no idea that they're throwing it through them to a drug dealer, those soft, goodhearted persecutors of vulnerable Australians, those people keep vulnerable Australians and indigenous Australians down …


I implore the Senate to support this bill to expand the trial for this cashless debit card.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2018-08-23,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:40):  I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018. This legislation sums up everything that is wrong with our current government. It's basically an attack on poor people. It's trying to make life harder for poor people. It's telling poor people that it is their fault that they are poor. Why should we be surprised? This government has such a track record of absolutely putting the screws on people who have the misfortune to not have much money, while at the same time supporting the very wealthy in our community and the large corporations. We saw only yesterday their attempt to get big tax cuts to the big end of town through. Fortunately, enough members in this place saw that was not what we needed to be doing in Australia today. We saw $144 billion of cuts to income tax, rather than seeing that there is a need to spend that amount of money, those hundreds of billions of dollars, on services to give everybody in Australia the opportunity to live a good quality life.


The other key thing is that it is very clear from the reviews of the trials that have been done so far that this approach doesn't work. Not only is this crackdown going to make life more difficult for poor people but it is also ineffective at achieving the outcomes that the government wants to achieve. The evidence we already have today is that this approach—quarantining people's money to deal with issues such as substance abuse, gambling and other behaviours which we genuinely want to address in our community—doesn't work. There is so much evidence across the board that there are other ways to address issues like substance abuse and gambling, but you have to ask some questions and dig deeper to see why people have drug and gambling problems. It's not because they get to spend their money whichever way they want; it's because they are quite reasonably struggling to survive in life without education, support, housing and money, or due to family violence issues. When you're in those sorts of circumstances, life's pretty tough and stressful. You are often trying to see the way out. There is then the temptation to abuse drugs or to throw what money you have into gambling, hoping it might actually give you something that will enable you to improve your life. They are the measures that people feel they have to resort to in order to deal with those pressures.


There are other ways of going about dealing with these pressures—rather than absolutely attacking poor people, actually giving them the opportunities, giving them high-quality health care and education and, in particular, increasing the rates of benefits so that people have actually got the ability to live. We should increase Newstart payments, youth allowance and other welfare payments so that people don't feel that life is just one eternal struggle of trying to just hold it together. If we did that, people would then be able to get their lives back on track, engage in education and know that they're not going to be thrown out because they can't pay the rent on their house.


These are the sorts of things that, as a society, we can afford. We are a rich country. We know that, rather than giving massive tax cuts to the big end of town, we can afford to support everybody in our community and to give them the opportunities to live a good life. But no. Just because of, basically, the fundamental approach of this government of saying, 'Those who have should get more, and we should just grind those who are struggling into the ground,' we have these very appalling punitive measures being imposed upon people.


So then we say, as I referred to: does this approach work? Does this populist attack on poor people—this populist appeal saying, 'Oh, well, you've just got dole bludgers, so you've just got to stop them spending their money'—work? Is there the evidence to say that it works? It's very clear that there isn't. That goes to my second main point: the community would think that governments should be making their decisions based on evidence and that, where there is evidence to support a course of action, we should be following that evidence. It's very clear that the evidence from the trials so far, where the cashless welfare card has been used, is that it doesn't work. It's not just random Greens or random members of the community who are saying it doesn't work. It's not just people pulling things out of the air to say it doesn't work. It's one of the institutions that we depend upon to conduct good-quality, objective research. That's the Australian National Audit Office, who of course have done a report on the implementation and performance of the cashless debit card trial. You would think that, if the Audit Office have done a report on the trial as it's gone so far, you would listen to what they have to say. You would think that, in the interests of good governance and evidence-based decision-making, you would pay attention to what they're saying before proceeding to roll out this measure.


The summary of the audit report which I have here lays out what the Audit Office aimed to do in their report. They say:


The Cashless Debit Card Trial (CDCT or the trial) aimed to: test whether social harm caused by alcohol, gambling and drug misuse can be reduced by placing a portion (up to 80 per cent) of a participant's income support payment onto a card that cannot be used to buy alcohol or gambling products or to withdraw cash; and inform the development of a lower cost welfare quarantining solution to replace current income management arrangements.


They say:


The CDCT was selected for audit to identify whether the Department of Social Services (Social Services) was well placed to inform any further roll-out of the CDC with a robust evidence base. Further, the audit aimed to provide assurance that Social Services had established a solid foundation to implement the trial including: consultation and communication with the communities involved; governance arrangements; the management of risks; and robust procurement arrangements.


So what did they find in their conclusions? They found:


The Department of Social Services … approach to monitoring and evaluation was inadequate. As a consequence, it is difficult to conclude whether there had been a reduction in social harm and whether the card was a lower cost welfare quarantining approach.


So you would think, with that overarching conclusion, now is not the time to extend, massively extend, this trial to another major part of Australia. You would think, before you go any further, given that you've got trial sites that are already underway, you would go back and do more monitoring and evaluation until you knew that you had a robust evidence base from the areas where the cashless debit card is already in use. That would be the evidence based thing to do. But, no, instead we've got this government, on the basis of populism, attacking poor people, saying they're going to go on and roll this trial out to thousands and thousands of more people—young people, poor people, people on Newstart, people on youth allowance. Rather than listening to the most credible agency that looked at the effectiveness of the card, they're saying: 'No. We're just going to continue to roll it out somewhere else.' 


The ANAO further concluded:


… it—


Social Services—


did not actively monitor risks identified in risk plans and there were deficiencies in elements of the procurement processes.


They said:


Arrangements to monitor and evaluate the trial were in place although key activities were not undertaken or fully effective, and the level of unrestricted cash available in the community was not effectively monitored … and … they did not cover some operational aspects of the trial such as efficiency, including cost. There was a lack of robustness in data collection and the department's evaluation did not make use of all available administrative data to measure the impact of the trial including any change in social harm.


It is extremely concerning that the ANAO are saying that Social Services did not make use of all available data. You might be forgiven for thinking that Social Services had some preconceived ideas, in terms of its conclusions as to the effectiveness of the trial, and that it wanted to show that the trial was effective, even though it wasn't. Again, I go back to the issue of good governance. The people of Australia want to see good governance. They want to see decisions being made on the basis of evidence. For Social Services to undermine and not use the evidence that's available is extremely disturbing. It's an appalling way to run major parts of our social policy. 


The ANAO continued:


Aspects of the proposed wider roll-out of the CDC—


the cashless debit card—


were informed by learnings from the trial, but the trial was not designed to test the scalability of the CDC and there was no plan in place to undertake further evaluation.


And yet here we are being asked to vote and support a bill that would expand the use of the cashless debit card in a major way to thousands and thousands of more people in another part of the country. This is not the way that we should be doing government here. 


This is a very comprehensive report, and there are many areas that were identified for improvement. Some of the findings included: some identified risks were not actively managed; aspects of the procurement process to engage the card provider and evaluator were not robust; the department didn't document the value-for-money assessment; and, in terms of monitoring and analysing the card, Social Services didn't complete all the activities identified in the strategy, including the cost-benefit analysis. So, not only did it not use the data to determine whether the card worked, given it didn't do that cost-benefit analysis either, one could presume that maybe the trial wasn't an effective way of trying to achieve what it was trying to achieve, and that it's not only attacking poor people for being poor, but it's a really expensive way to attack poor people for being poor—and it's being done just to suit the populist agenda, to appeal to people who have this belief that all the problems of Australia could be solved if we had fewer people on welfare. And yet we know that the reason that people are on welfare, the reason that people are on unemployment benefits in areas of regional Australia, is not because they are dole bludgers or because they are sitting back and not wanting to work; it's because the work isn't available.


We also know that there are so many other ways in which we could be providing work. Again, there is so much good work that the government could be funding and putting the billions of dollars into, instead of giving— (Quorum formed) As I was saying, the issue is with people who don't want to be on welfare, who don't want to be guinea pigs in these trials, who want to have the freedom to spend money where they wish to. They don't want to be in this situation. And the reason they are there isn't that they are dole bludgers, that they don't want to work; it's because the work is not available. There are so many opportunities that government could be providing. They could be providing funding for these people to undertake work that is to the benefit of society, to the benefit of our community, as well as to the benefit of individual people. I'm thinking about things like rolling out Indigenous ranger programs across the country. You'd then have Indigenous people looking after country and looking after our natural environment. There's a massive amount of employment that could be provided through resources being put into that. And it's very cost effective, because it means that we're tackling some of the really key natural resource problems that we face, such as pest animals and plants and dealing with erosion and land degradation. All of these things could be tackled by actually providing the resources to employ people to tackle these problems in our natural environment.


There are other employment opportunities that people are crying out for in regional communities—communities where, for example, they haven't got adequate health services. There are opportunities to support community health services, supporting the rollout of health services across regional Australia so that everybody has the opportunity to access high-quality health services. That means employing people to work in those services, to be there as nurses. It means employing more people in aged-care facilities. And then there are the opportunities in educational settings—employing more teachers' aides in schools, employing more people to be working with people with disabilities. There are things from across the whole of society where we know there is so much potential to spend money in employing people to do jobs with really good social and economic benefits. It would pay for itself over and over again and would give employment to the sorts of people who are being attacked, who are being pilloried, by being in this proposed trial that will be rolled out through the legislation we have before us today.


They are some of the findings of the Audit Office. So it's pretty clear that we should not be expanding this trial while these key questions of the Audit Office about the existing trial sites remain unaddressed. The Queensland Council of Social Service, who are deeply concerned about expanding the trial in the areas of Bundaberg and Hervey Bay in Queensland, where the rollout is proposed, did a comprehensive review of the cashless debit card trial and evaluation. Their findings are well worth noting. In summary, they said:


there is insufficient evidence of success to warrant any further expansion of the trial at this stage


there is a lack of clarity on the key goals and outcomes of the trial …


the evaluation methodology is questionable and the outcomes inconclusive. In addition, the two new sites represent a markedly different environment and Trial scope which has yet to be tested and evaluated


that operating in complexity requires testing of multiple options, preferably options that are supported by evidence and expert opinion …


Again, this comes down to the fact that the evidence goes against expanding the trial. Certainly, the evidence is not there to expand the trial. Just because Senator Macdonald happens to say, 'I think it should go ahead because I think it's a good idea,' that's not evidence. We need to have the evidence base to justify such a major expansion of the cashless debit card. In particular, they say:


The CDC Trial is currently the only option being considered to address these complex social issues and is not supported by the evidence of what works …


They go on to say:


community support has not been clearly evidenced …


So, again, not only doesn't it work, but the community actually don't want it. They want to see options that would really address some of the underlying social issues that people are concerned about—putting more money into drug rehabilitation, putting more money into drug counselling, putting more money into supporting young families who are struggling, and supporting families who are really having difficulties. Putting the resources into those support services is a much more effective way of dealing with the issues that we are facing in Australia, rather than these punitive measures designed to attack people. 


The final dot point of the Queensland Council of Social Service's review is:


accountability for public funds would recommend that there is clear articulation of costs and benefits of the trials prior to any further expansion.


That's pretty clear, and that's what the Greens are actually saying: we are an evidence based party. We say: put the evidence in front of us. And the evidence so far does not support the expansion of this trial. The evidence in front of us says there are other things and other measures that we should be using to address the issues that we're facing as a society. An expansion of the cashless debit card is certainly not that.

"Faruqi, Sen Mehreen",AG,2018-08-23,"



Senator FARUQI
 (New South Wales) (11:01):   I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018. The Australian Greens oppose this bill. The Greens have opposed the cashless debit card since its inception. The bill before us today intends to establish the Hervey Bay and Bundaberg trial site and, if this bill passes, this new trial site will continue on until 30 June 2020. In this trial, the cashless debit card would only be forced on those under 36 and receiving Newstart allowance, youth allowance or parenting payment. The bill also raises the cap on the number of trial participants across the board to 15,000. The bill also introduces provisions that allow merchants to block restricted goods at the point of sale, and expands the list of restricted products to include a cash-like product that could be used to obtain alcoholic beverages or for gambling.


The Greens have been opposed to this type of punitive legislation from the very beginning, because this is entirely about penalising and demonising people on welfare. Let's be clear: this is a particular attack on young people—young people who are already suffering from the policies of this government, because there is a real lack of employment and a real lack of opportunity and there is the increasing cost of living. And, as my colleague Senator Rice pointed out, there is a real lack of services, no matter what area you look into. 


We know that there is no evidence that this is even an effective scheme. The Ceduna and East Kimberley trial sites were examined by the Australian National Audit Office, and it is crystal clear there is no effective impact evaluation. The report said it was 'difficult to conclude' whether there had been a reduction in social harm such as alcoholism and violence, because 'there was a lack of robustness in the data collection'. The same goes for these expanded trial sites. 


But, amid the concerns about the trials and the scope of the process, the lack of evidence and the lack of data, we should not forget the terrible human impacts this kind of social policy has. Let me just share the words of a domestic violence survivor who was part of the cashless debit card trial. She said she would not have been able to escape her abusive marriage under this shameful scheme. This is the story of Jocelyn Wighton, from Ceduna, South Australia. We know that Ceduna is a remote town and has a cash based economy, and many household items are bought in second-hand shops, which do not always have the facilities for this card. Jocelyn said:


If I was on this card when I escaped from my husband, I would not have made it. I bought secondhand furniture down to the plates and knives and forks. You can't do that on the card.


This is what the cashless card does to people. It causes real people real harm.


The ABC also reported on the shame and stigma caused by the card in Western Australia, and I quote from that report:


Ms Asusaar is a single mother, and her family's income is reliant on Centrelink payments for her son's disability as well as for her role as his carer.


This year, she was enrolled in the latest trial of the cashless welfare card in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia.


She said:


We've had people who try to [put] stickers over part of the card, literally hiding it up their sleeve.


The article continues:


Sam Harding, a Kalgoorlie resident who receives the disability support pension, said she had endured multiple incidents of abuse in public associated with her card.


""I was doing some shopping and a transaction went through incorrectly … I think [the cashier] made about 10 to 15 attempts but it didn't work,"" Ms Harding said.


""People just started saying 'oh that's one of those … card people' … by the time I was ready to leave, I was in tears.


This is the real impact on the real people living in these towns and in communities. So I ask the Senate: is this really what we want to be forcing onto already vulnerable people, people who already don't have the services that everyone in Australia deserves?


When these deeply flawed trials were being developed in 2017 and again this year, my colleague Senator Rachel Siewert worked tirelessly in committees to prevent this gross violation of human rights from proceeding, and I really, deeply thank her for her work and wish to draw the chamber's attention to some key points the Greens made in our dissenting report on one of those committees. This is what we said then, and this is absolutely relevant now:


The Australian Greens reject the committee view … that extensive consultation was undertaken … The evidence presented to the committee showed that the consultation process was flawed. The Government's … consultation with the community members who would be subject to the card was almost non-existent and showed a fundamental lack of respect for people receiving income support. 


We said:


Unlike the view expressed in the majority report the Australian Greens are deeply concerned that this bill limits human rights. As outlined in many submissions to the inquiry the circumstances in the trial site are not so extreme or exceptional as to warrant an approach that infringes on the human rights of income support recipients and the Australian Greens reject the committee view that this approach is warranted and legitimate.


Our dissenting report also said:


The Australian Greens oppose Compulsory Income Management. It is a failed measure as can be seen in the final evaluation of the NT Intervention. 


To not have learnt from this sorry chapter in our history is also pretty saddening—a chapter that enjoyed bipartisan support and whose impacts are still being felt in those communities. As we said:


Compulsory Income Management impacts negatively on individuals and the community and imposes significant costs on Government.


Evidence that was provided through submissions and through hearings to this inquiry did show the fundamental and very deep flaws in this approach. We all know that income management has proved to be a completely ineffective policy that totally disempowers and harms those that need our help the most. As we said:


Submissions to the inquiry by peak social service bodies and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations from across Australia expressed deep and fundamental concerns with Compulsory Income Management.


… Despite the history of its imposition, there is no clear evidence that compulsory income management works, or improves the lives of those it affects.


There have been and still are vocal and consistent concerns raised by those who will be subjected to this card in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area. A number of submissions were received from individuals who will be subjected to the card if this bill passes, and a number of these individuals also provided evidence at the hearings for the inquiry. I'm really concerned that their views have not been heard through those consultations, and they're definitely not reflected in the bill that we are debating today. Accordingly, Senator Siewert again highlighted some of their concerns, which I am going to talk about below.


Say No to the Cashless Welfare Card Australia/No Cashless Debit Card Hinkler Region group was concerned, among other things, about the lack of public consultation from the local member and the costs associated with the card, both monetary costs and costs for those subjected to the trial. They said in their submission:


The stigma attached to the card through the constant demonising of the people on social security, the media ""welfare bashing"" has already changed our local community language and the way people on social security are being treated.


They continue on to say:


This card will further divide our community, excluding so many people in so many ways, from community events, school events, charity events, cash economy, secondhand economy, but also the banking economy.


…   …   …


Just like the people on the card in other regions, our residents do not deserve to be treated as a sub class citizen with their human rights removed, their freedom removed, their ability to travel, decided for them …


Let's not forget that these are communities, as I said earlier, and these are people who are already suffering because they don't have the services; we haven't provided them with the services. I've lived on the Mid North Coast for many years. That is where my children grew up. I did see the impact of the lack of services that are available in regional areas, and it is much more so in the areas we are actually talking about.


The Department of Social Services, in the Auditor-General's report Implementation and performance of the cashless debit card trial, concluded a number of points that I would also like to highlight today to this chamber. The conclusion of that report says:


The Department of Social Services largely established appropriate arrangements to implement the Cashless Debit Card Trial, however, its approach to monitoring and evaluation was inadequate. As a consequence, it is difficult to conclude whether there had been a reduction in social harm and whether the card was a lower cost welfare quarantining approach.


Why would we keep pushing a policy that has been seen to have been a complete failure?


Social Services established appropriate arrangements for consultation, communicating with communities and for governance of the implementation of CDCT. … However, it did not actively monitor risks identified in risk plans and there were deficiencies in elements of the procurement processes.


The conclusion of the report goes on to say:


Arrangements to monitor and evaluate the trial were in place although key activities were not undertaken or fully effective, and the level of unrestricted cash available in the community was not effectively monitored. Social Services established relevant and mostly reliable key performance indicators, but they did not cover some operational aspects of the trial such as efficiency, including cost. There was a lack of robustness in data collection and the department's evaluation did not make use of all available administrative data to measure the impact of the trial including any change in social harm. Aspects of the proposed wider roll-out of the CDC were informed by learnings from the trial, but the trial was not designed to test the scalability of the CDC—


And here we are, increasing the number of people by the thousands. I just cannot understand how this policy should pass this chamber, should become concrete, when there are so many missing gaps and so many flaws that have been highlighted again and again by so many different groups.


Locals who will be subjected to this trial want to see the money spent more usefully. They want to see the money that would be spent on the trial go on to fund services such as for homelessness, for domestic violence shelters, for education pathways and for creating jobs for local young people. That's how we will get a vibrant economy that actually does work for everyone. That is the kind of social policy that we should be pursuing, not this disgusting, patronising and violating policy from the coalition.


And it is not just the citizens and the Greens who have concerns. A long list of expert submissions have opposed this bill and continue to oppose this bill. Since the last inquiry into the cashless debit card the Australian National Audit Office, or ANAO, has released its report The implementation and performance of the cashless debit card trial. And in its submission to the inquiry the Accountable Income Management Network gives a really blistering assessment that I think some opposite would benefit from hearing, if you haven't heard it already. The ANAO report on the CDC has explicitly condemned both ORIMA's evaluation process and its final report. The ANAO undertook an audit of the CDC trials to identify whether the Department of Social Services was appropriately informed and positioned to justify a further rollout of the CDC. The ANAO's report concluded that the department's approach to monitoring and evaluation was inadequate, as I said earlier. This report highlighted the same risks and the same issues that all the other reports have highlighted before.


So, how can the coalition go ahead with such a policy, which has the support of literally no-one and which is going to be harmful for the most vulnerable of people and which does not actually set up and use the massive amounts of wealth that we have in Australia to help and support people and get them out of poverty? This legislation is no good for anyone. The Greens vehemently oppose this bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2018-08-23,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (11:16):  The Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018 will allow for the expansion of the cashless debit card program to the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay areas. There's a fourth trial site under the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, and the trial will be extended to this site until 30 June 2020, providing sufficient time to implement the trial and for it to operate for at least 12 months. The bill updates the current limitations on the number of participants from 10,000 to 15,000, recognising the increase that would come from implementing the cashless debit card to this area. The bill also moves the provisions in the Social Security (Administration) (Trial of Cashless Welfare Arrangements) Determination 2018 into primary legislation, or, in uncontentious cases, such as the authorising community bodies, into a notifiable instrument. This will mean that for all four sites, including the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay sites, the trial parameters will be embedded in the legislation, providing greater legislative consistency across all sites and improving parliamentary oversight over the cashless debit card legislation.


These amendments specify trial participants for each site, including any exceptions and specifying wellbeing exemptions where being a participant in a cashless debit card trial is determined to pose a serious risk to an individual's mental, physical or emotional wellbeing. In the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay trial site, trial participants are defined as persons under 36 of age receiving Newstart, youth allowance, parenting payment, or single or parenting payment, partner. The selection of the cohort in this area has occurred in response to significant consultations with the impacted community, recognising the need for supporting interventions in the areas of youth unemployment, young families and intergenerational welfare dependency. In the current operating sites of Ceduna in South Australia and the East Kimberley and Goldfields regions of Western Australia, all persons living in the trial area and in receipt of a working-age income support payment are defined as trial participants, which is enshrined in the primary legislation. This aligns with the current arrangement at these sites but provides greater certainty for these communities around the trial arrangements.


For each site, amendments in the bill allow the secretary to make a determination that will vary the restricted percentages for a cashless debit card participant in the event of an unforeseen circumstances, such as a natural disaster or technical failure of the card or the account. The bill also allows the option to establish a community panel by notifiable instrument and clarifies who can be voluntary participants in the current trial sites. Persons living in Ceduna or the East Kimberley or the Goldfields trial sites who are receiving a trigger payment as defined in the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 or an aged pension and are not otherwise trial participants may volunteer to be part of the cashless debit card trial. However, persons in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay trial site who are outside the class of persons identified as a trial participant cannot volunteer. This will allow the opportunity to test the effectiveness of the program on a targeted cohort in the context of a larger urban population with high levels of welfare dependence. The Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area also has a different cultural composition with a much lower proportion of Indigenous Australians in this site compared to the three current trial areas.


The cashless debit card aims to reduce the devastating effects of alcohol, drugs, and gambling abuse. The card operates like an ordinary debit card with the primary difference being that it doesn't work at liquor stores or gambling houses, and it cannot be used to withdraw cash. Consequently, illicit products cannot be purchased with the card. To further this extent, the bill also introduces provisions that allow merchants to block restrictive goods, like cash-like products, at the point of sale, to keep in line with the intent of the program by preventing participants from circumventing the program to spend the welfare payments on alcohol, gambling and drugs. This bill will support additional card functionality at merchants in each of the trial sites and could allow trial participants to access additional merchants. It's important to note that the trial does not detract from the eligibility of a person to receive welfare payments nor reduce the amount of the person's social security entitlement.


The cashless debit card trial has been operating in Ceduna, South Australia, and the East Kimberley, Western Australia, for more than two years, and it was recently expanded to a third site—the Goldfields region in Western Australia in March 2018. Results from the evaluation of the cashless welfare card found that a benefit of the card is that it can increase motivation to find work. A final report evaluating the Ceduna and East Kimberley sites shows feedback from some card participants in 2017 which indicate almost a quarter of people on the card were spending several hours a week looking for work. This was an increase from 11 per cent in February 2017.


By limiting spending on alcohol, drugs and gambling, the cashless debit card can help stabilise people's lives, particularly young people, in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area, with the potential flow-on impacts of improving chances of finding employment or successfully completing education and training. The government has also announced a second evaluation of the cashless debit card across all three current trial sites to assess the ongoing effectiveness of the program. The second evaluation will use research methodologies informed by the University of Queensland and draw on the baseline measurements of social conditions in the Goldfields developed by the University of Adelaide. Findings for the second evaluation will be published in late 2019. The initial positive finds of the impact of the cashless debit card in Ceduna and the East Kimberley have been encouraging. The expansion to Bundaberg and Hervey Bay will help test the card and the technology that supports it in more diverse communities and settings. This will build on the evidence available to further evaluate the impacts and outcomes of the cashless debit card on all participants.


In drafting the bill, the government has carefully balanced community support for the cashless debit card at existing and proposed sites with the concerns raised in parliament around allowing additional time for the gathering of evidence to further evaluate impacts and outcomes. The government remains committed to the continuation of the cashless debit card to provide a strong social welfare safety net through reducing social harm in areas with high levels of welfare dependency and supporting vulnerable people, families and communities.


Just briefly—I'm pleased that Senator Faruqi is still in the chamber—can I just make some short comments on her contribution. In her maiden speech she indicated her interest in Indigenous affairs, and I thank the senator. I normally rely on Senator Siewert in these matters, but it's tremendous to have someone else with that interest. However, I can see early in the piece that some of our views will move. Senator Siewert knows my strongly-held views on this. I come from the Northern Territory where the effects of the first cashless debit card, which was the BasicsCard, was trialled. I can remember a Northern Territory with many communities simply awash with grog. I appreciate more services so that when people are getting bashed we just have to build more domestic violence services. I'm not suggesting any mischief in your approach. The approach we took was that alcohol was causing so much dysfunction to communities, tearing down a culture. If somebody else could have pointed to a way in which we could reduce the amount of alcohol consumed in communities—because I don't think the results of that consumption can be controlled—we would have been more than happy to listen to that. I've been in this place for a while since then and have been listening carefully to Senator Siewert and others, but there is no alternative. This isn't doing something because it is something to do. This is a very important matter. 


I understand that one of the groups in Ceduna that have been really, really badly affected—in fact, I understand that their small to medium-sized business has been completely interrupted and they've moved out of Ceduna—has been those people who are purveyors of methamphetamine. They have complained bitterly and effectively don't think there's really a market in town. The pubs, those people who run the poker machines, have said that this is absolutely outrageous: 'Look at the amount of money that we've lost through our pokies. We should have people from Ceduna here.' A lot of the poor people come into Ceduna and put all their money through the pokies. Those who run the pokies were adamant. They were saying, 'This is a terrible thing to happen to us.' But I don't share that business model and I think the cashless welfare card is an important tool. 


In the Territory, while people will say, 'No, no, you can't find a person in the Territory that will support the card,' let me tell you, it's a bit like the privacy of the booth: you can't get women to say too much publicly because the guerillas and thugs are out there to make sure that you don't speak up about domestic violence. 'You don't speak up about the cashless welfare card. We've decided, the community'—mostly men in the community—'that we don't want the cashless welfare card because it stops my life, my life of making sure that I'll go and gamble, I'll go and drink and I will take the money and I can take it in cash. But I can't now.' And, in the Territory, it's only 50 per cent, so 50 per cent of the money is still spent in whatever discretionary way we have. Some of the trial sites are indicating movement to 80-20. This is a debit card. Whatever you want to point to—second-hand shops, anywhere—you can buy what you want. The only thing you can't get is cash, and you can't go into a place that serves alcohol. They're normally separated, like in Woolies. They separate those places. 


I think these are very good initiatives. These initiatives have been at the behest of the leaders in the community. Of course, there'll be those who say, 'Oh, no, he's not the leader,' and, 'We don't really like her,' because they might differ. But fundamentally the leaders of the communities have been very supportive of this. In terms of meeting with the women's groups, if you said, 'Let's get rid of the BasicsCard—we'll just pay you all cash again,' there would be an outrage in the Northern Territory. The women would say, 'Please don't do this to us. Don't take us back to those bad old days.' I think that in and of itself is very much a voice worth listening to. 



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the bill be read a second time.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (12:05):  I present an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



Today I rise to speak to one of the most important priorities in my portfolio and to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities that I meet and engage with every day in this job. 


When I travel around remote Australia, I see people standing up and participating, building daily routine and establishing social norms. 


Communities are strong when adults are engaged in work or meaningful activities that contribute to the benefit of their community. 


Since its introduction in July 2015, the Community Development Program or CDP has improved employment and participation outcomes for remote job seekers. The CDP has supported remote job seekers into more than 26,200 jobs and on more than 8,800 occasions, they have stayed in a job for at least six months. 


The CDP turned around the failings of the Remote Jobs and Communities Program which had replaced the successful Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) and allowed the return of the misery of sit down money and engagement dropped to just 7 per cent. 


The CDP has worked because it ensures job seekers have real mutual obligation requirements and because communities are increasingly at the heart of the delivery of the program. 


Job seekers tell me that they feel a renewed sense of pride, as people feel they are improving themselves, building a future and contributing to their community.


While the CDP is successfully getting job seekers off welfare and into work, I recognise that there are areas of the system than can be improved.


We have listened to the outcomes of the Senate Inquiry process, including the submissions and public hearings, where many stakeholders took the opportunity to voice their views and concerns, including the Aboriginal Peak Organisations Northern Territory. We have also taken on board the Australian National Audit Office's performance audit outcomes.


My Department released a discussion paper in December 2017, receiving 40 public submissions which provided a range of constructive views and suggestions. I have personally visited around 200 communities since becoming Minister, and I have heard what people want. The messages I am hearing are clear and consistent.


People are asking for:


more jobs in remote Australia; 


access to real wages; 


reduced complexity in the income support system; and


simplified interactions with Centrelink.


I hear the consistent message that job seekers need to be engaged to ensure that there is a clear pathway to a job and that the misery of passive welfare does not return. 


Communities want to bring back the best parts of the old CDEP. Well, the community spoke and we listened.




Community Development Programme reforms



On 8 May 2018, the Government announced reforms to CDP as part of the 2018-19 Budget.


The key changes to the program, include:


Reducing income reporting requirements to Centrelink for job seekers who have a mutual obligation of less than 15 hours a week.


Improving the assessment process so barriers to employment are better identified and local health workers can provide the medical evidence needed to reduce the required participation.


Reducing required participation from up to 25 hours a week to up to 20 hours a week.


These changes will commence from February 2019 and will support local control and decision making through a more community based approach. We are strengthening community say in how CDP is delivered locally, by contracting with more Indigenous service providers and linking with local governance arrangements. 


12 months ago I stood before Indigenous organisations and made a commitment that the CDP would be locally delivered. I must say, there was a fair amount of doubt from those in attendance. But we have delivered, and from July this year, Indigenous organisations now have to be involved in the delivery of CDP. 


And importantly, the Government will also work with local communities to support 6,000 subsidised jobs across remote Australia. Providing access to real wages, and moving people off welfare and into work.


These will be jobs in community, identified by community and delivering for the community needs.


Housing managers, local government workers, community health support, teaching assistants, construction or aged care. 


These jobs will only be available to CDP participants and will grow the size and capacity of the remote labour market and support the development of more local businesses.


The subsidised jobs package is part of a pathway to employment and will provide real workplace experience for job seekers, while also paying real wages. Job seekers will also continue to access support from employers and CDP providers to help them stay in a job for the long term.


These jobs will provide meaningful employment, and participants will be subject to the same pay and conditions that would otherwise be attached to that position. Many participants who are placed in these jobs will continue to qualify for a reduced rate of their income support payments after the applicable income test is applied. 


Some of these participants may not have had a job before, or may have been unemployed for a long time, and may need additional support in making the transition into the workplace. 


We want these participants to succeed in making the pathway to meet their career goals and aspirations. Which is why we are removing them from all the other requirements that would usually apply under social security law.


This subsidised job program complements what is in the legislation before the Senate today but will be at the heart of the CDP going forward and the pathway to a job. 


Under the CDP going forward, there will be 6,000 remote job seekers being supported into a job at any time. 


This is an exciting change and one that allows communities to support more jobs for locals. To ensure Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are not only engaged in work, but also more engaged in the delivery of services in their community. 


The reforms build on the success of CDP to continue to drive employment in remote Australia by improving the skills and employability of job seekers, and increasing their participation through a greater range of work-like activities in their community.




The CDP Bill



The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Community Development Program) Bill 2018, will amend social security law to support the introduction of the Targeted Compliance Framework (TCF) in remote Australia, consistent with the arrangements across the rest of Australia.


Following the passage of this Bill, CDP participants will be subject to the TCF. This means that there will be one national job seeker compliance framework for all job seekers, both remote and non-remote. 


The TCF commenced across jobactive, Parents Next and Disability Employment Services 1 July 2018. It will commence for CDP from February 2019, subject to the passage of this Bill. 


CDP job seekers will see considerable changes in how they interact with providers and Centrelink. 


The new TCF has additional protections for vulnerable job seekers, reduces interactions with Centrelink and builds in more check points to ensure all job seekers are fully capable of meeting their requirements. There will be a greater role for local CDP providers to work with CDP participants in the application of the TCF and there will be less interaction with Centrelink compared with the current framework.


The reforms will see a significant reduction in the number of penalties applied to CDP job seekers. The introduction of the TCF will remove penalties for one-off breaches of mutual obligation requirements. Financial penalties will focus on those who are persistently and wilfully non‑compliant. 


To assist CDP participants in meeting their requirements, mutual obligation hours will be reduced from up to 25 hours per week, to up to 20 hours per week, depending on a job seeker's assessed work capacity. 


Alongside the application of the TCF, the reforms include a number of changes to increase the role of local health service providers to support participants in their communities. 


Changes include provision for local health workers to supply evidence for the Department of Human Services to use when deciding whether to reduce a participant's mutual obligation hours. 


The Bill also introduces specific exemptions for participants in subsidised employment, removing interactions with Centrelink and focusing on engagement with employers. Participants in subsidised employment will be exempt from activity test requirements and will not incur mutual obligation failures under the TCF. This seeks to emulate one of the positive aspects of the CDEP where participants were paid wages outside the income support system.


Entry into a subsidised job will be voluntary. Therefore, CDP participants who refuse an offer of subsidised employment will not incur a work refusal failure. This provides CDP participants with the freedom to determine whether the subsidised employment opportunity available suits their personal commitments, career aspirations, skills and experience. CDP participants will continue to have appropriate job search requirements as part of their mutual obligation requirements, as determined by their provider. 


Similarly, participants in subsidised employment will not be subject to a work refusal failure if they refuse an offer of suitable unsubsidised employment. 


Participants in subsidised employment will also not be subject to an unemployment failure if they voluntarily leave their position, or are dismissed due to misconduct. This approach provides participants with the opportunity to leave subsidised employment without penalty if, after commencement in the position, they determine the role is not suitable for them or their personal circumstances (for example, due to relocation or family violence). As each subsidised position is funded for two years, this will also free up the subsidised job opportunity for a job seeker who may be better suited to the role.


This Bill ensures the local community is at the heart of our remote employment services. 


It listens to local views and local priorities, it will be delivered by local community organisations and it will ensure local job seekers are engaged, better supported and provided a clear pathway to a job. 


Without this legislation, the Government will not be able to fully deliver the subsidised employment program as participants will still be subject to compliance under Social Security laws.


Without this legislation, CDP participants will continue to be subject to a different compliance model than the rest of Australia. 


This legislation ensures remote job seekers have the support they need to move along the pathway to work.




Conclusion



The package of reforms to the CDP are in direct response to feedback from communities and will increase support to vulnerable job seekers in remote Australia, while providing more pathways to jobs. Moving more people off welfare and into jobs and improving outcomes across remote Australia. 


I commend the Bill to the Senate.

That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill.


Leave granted.




Senator DI NATALE:
  I table an explanatory memorandum and I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—




The Australian Multicultural Bill 2018 (the bill) will enshrine the principles of diversity and multiculturalism in federal legislation. Enshrining the principles of multiculturalism in law is consistent with state legislation and ensures multilateral and ongoing support for multiculturalism.


The bill establishes a federal multicultural commission, to be named the Australian Multicultural Commission (the commission). The commission will provide a single coordination point for integrated responses to the government on issues associated with cultural diversity. 


The commission will also have responsibility for researching, reporting and making recommendations to the Minister on community issues relating to its objectives, as well as developing and maintaining partnerships between community organisations.


In addition to establishing the commission, the bill stipulates annual reporting requirements for Commonwealth entities. These include: 


summaries of actions undertaken by the entity during the reporting period to promote the achievement of Australia's multicultural policy; 


the use of interpreting and translating services by the entity during that period; and


communications in languages other than English made by the entity during that period.


Other reporting requirements would include the extent to which people from diverse backgrounds were represented during the period on boards and committees established by the entity, or for which the entity had responsibility. It would also include the collection of statistical data during the period to enable the development of policies, programs and practices that are sensitive and responsive to the multicultural character of Australia.


Independent research tells us that individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds face a series of structural barriers, both in the workplace and when accessing a range of services. This includes, but is not limited to: 


representation of culturally diverse individuals in positions of leadership;


language barriers when accessing essential services; and 


participating in programs and services which have been designed in a manner which is not culturally sensitive to the practices or needs of multicultural Australia.


The bill plays a role in addressing the structural barriers which multicultural communities face, while embedding the value of multiculturalism in federal legislation. Enshrining in legislation clear guiding principles, and the steps that Commonwealth entities must take to promote multiculturalism, will provide greater protection for these values, regardless of which political party is in Government.

 (South Australia) (12:12):  I, and also on behalf of Senators Polley, Hinch, Storer and Faruqi, move:


That the Senate:


(a) notes that:


   (i) a Nexus Research poll, on behalf of Humane Research Australia, found that most Australians oppose the use of animal testing for cosmetic products and ingredients, and support a national ban on the sale of cosmetics tested on animals,


   (ii) nearly 40 countries around the world have already banned cosmetics animal testing and the sale or import of newly animal-tested cosmetics, including the world's largest cosmetics markets in the European Union, Norway, Switzerland, Israel and India,


   (iii) there is strong cross-party support for a ban on cosmetics cruelty – the Australian Greens, the Australian Labor Party, the Centre Alliance, and Derryn Hinch's Justice Party have all committed to a complete ban on animal testing for cosmetics, and the Government announced its own commitment during the 2016 election, and the Australian public and animal protection campaigners, including #BeCrueltyFree Australia, welcomed these commitments,


   (iv) the ban, as currently proposed in the Industrial Chemicals Bill 2017 and draft Industrial Chemicals (General) Rules 2018, should be strengthened to ensure that the ban fully prohibits the use of new data on cosmetic ingredients which are derived from animal tests, and


   (v) the 2017-18 Budget stated that the Government would provide funding to implement its election commitment, and would 'ban the use of new data on cosmetic ingredients which are derived from animal tests from 1 July 2018'; and


(b) urges the Federal Government to implement its election and Budget commitments to ban cosmetic testing on animals, and to ensure that no newly animal-tested cosmetic ingredients are introduced to the Australian market after the ban comes into effect.

 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (12:13):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator RUSTON:
  The government does not support this motion. The government's industrial chemicals legislative package delivers on our election commitment to place a ban on the use of animal test data for cosmetics, in line with the European Union approach. We will continue to work constructively with the opposition and crossbench to see that these bills are passed. However, the government does not support any amendments to the primary legislation, which would take the measures beyond the EU model. The EU permanent representative to Australia has confirmed EU support for the bills as they currently stand. It is up to the Senate to now deal with the bills, and the government would urge all senators to support the measures in their current form.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (12:46):  Labor is supporting the Farm Household Support Amendment (Temporary Measures) Bill 2018 and the government amendment to its own bill. The bill will allow eligible farm household allowance recipients to receive a supplement payment of up to $12,000 and will increase the farm asset limit from $2.6 million to $5 million. These are temporary measures, because the government has finally decided to review the farm household allowance, something that Labor believes should have been done a long time ago.


The Senate should also note that Labor is disappointed that the Turnbull government rejected in the other chamber proposed Labor amendments to this bill which would have given struggling farmers the opportunity to receive the farm household allowance supplement payment as a $12,000 lump sum. To be clear: this amendment was put by Labor in the other chamber but rejected by the government. The reality is that many farmers won't have access to cash payments for up to 10 weeks. During this time, daily living expenses and debt will continue to accumulate. Farmers should be given the option of receiving the supplement payment as a lump sum. They need this money and they need it now.


The current drought has been severe in many parts of the country, and there are farming families who desperately need assistance with putting food on the table, paying school fees and other important daily living expenses. There's no logic or rationale behind this system of split payments on 1 September 2018 and 1 March 2019 that the government has constructed. Contrary to Mr Turnbull's comments to David Koch on Sunrise—that 'March is not that far away'—Labor is fully aware that farmers need cash assistance as soon as possible. Labor supported all the drought measures that the government has put forward and is not seeking to politicise assistance to our farmers; however, Labor remains concerned that the current government is more interested in looking after itself than in assisting our farmers.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (12:49):  One Nation will be supporting the Farm Household Support Amendment (Temporary Measures) Bill 2018, but I'd like to make a few comments. The purpose of the bill is to increase the number of farmers entitled to temporary fortnightly income support payments as well as provide assistance for their farm business. As the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, Minister Littleproud, said:


… the bill proposes to pay a supplement to all eligible farm household allowance recipients that is in addition to their fortnightly income support payments.


In his speech he went on to say:


Australian agriculture is a story of success, resilience and prosperity.


Am I missing something? Or maybe a lot of Australians are? There is success in some sectors, but over the years we've seen the destruction of many farming families who have actually been destroyed by drought and a lack of assistance by governments, not only this one but previous Labor governments as well—and I will add to that the government's reluctance to have a banking royal commission. Now we are in the process of that commission, we are finding the problems the farming sector has also had in its dealings with the banks—loss of properties, devastation, suicides and everything else that has happened.


And what about the permanent changes being made by foreign ownership? The problem is foreign ownership of key agricultural assets. Asian countries are not satisfied buying food from Australia; they want to own the means of production and turn our farmers into subcontractors. Since the 1990s overseas companies have been buying up food-production assets in the form of dairy cooperatives, egg farms, meat processing works, fish canneries, sugar mills and grain businesses with the result that much of our produce is being exported. There is no legislation to prevent shortages of Australian primary produce, for example, shortages of baby formula are common, and Coles has a limit of two cans of baby formula per customer. In 2016 Chinese interests bought 17,000 hectares of dairy production in Tasmania. They now lease two Qantas flights a week to take fresh milk directly to China. Foreign purchase of dairy farms in Australia has changed the industry. We now have significant foreign ownership of our dairy production, and the remaining smaller family-owned dairy farms are struggling and leaving the industry because of the low farm gate price being paid to processors.


The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, has found that supermarkets selling Homebrand milk for $1 a litre are not to blame for the low prices paid to dairy farmers, and the ACCC has called for a code of conduct to strengthen farmers' bargaining power and improve their share of profits. The ACCC has recommended a code of conduct be legislated for dairy farmers. I remember when I was in this parliament, in the other place, back in the late 1900s—1997 and 1998—the deregulation of the dairy industry had brought it to its knees. Farmers were suiciding. Both sides—both the coalition and the Labor Party—have been charged with holding the reins and have done nothing about it. That's why we see the demise. We're down to under 300 dairy farmers in Queensland, and we're importing about a million litres of milk from Victoria. We are going to be importing milk from New Zealand if we don't protect our farming sector.


We've seen the demise of the pork industry; we've seen the demise of the orange growers. This is because governments in this place have not done enough to look after them. At the last minute when our farmers are on their knees you actually want to throw them a pittance. That's all it is. It's an absolute pittance. Too much of what I see in this chamber is people getting up and talking about what is happening in other countries around the world. Here we have our farming sector which provides food for our tables and you are not doing anything about it, and then you stand up and criticise because the other side hasn't done enough. You both have to take responsibility for this, because both sides have not done enough to actually protect the farming sector.


We have the land. We don't have the water. What has either side done about allowing more dams to be built—the Bradfield water scheme, which will bring water down from the Ord River to water inland Australia? That will actually give people hope that we are not going to continue to go through drought year after year. When they're on their knees, you throw millions of dollars out there, but that money could be put into building more dams and pipelines to give us the water to grow the food that we need. But then again, if we do that, you'll probably just sell the water into foreign ownership anyway, so we won't own the water. That's exactly what you've done.


I'll talk about food security. We've allowed foreign ownership of too much of our farming land. Now they are actually sending most of the product to their own countries—not only the farming products but also the gas. We've lost to foreign ownership in gas, electricity, dairy products, milk powder and hay for fodder. We're going through a hard time here and we will not have enough feed for our own farmers, but we've got 1.2 million tonnes of feed in storehouses or already on its way to China, Japan and Korea. Are you worried about feeding their stock? The government should step in and say, 'We're not going to see that feed leave our country.' And that goes for all other products. If we have so much foreign ownership of farming land, which produces our food, we can do nothing to intervene and stop them exporting that food to their own people. We cannot stop it. We've allowed this to happen, and that's why Australians are so angry with both the major political parties—they're not dealing with the real issues that concern them. Australians do not want foreign ownership of our land. I'm sick of hearing about your excuses that they can't take it away. The fact is it's going from paddock to plate—paddock to plate. That means they own everything. They own the land, they own the trucks, they own the ports—as they do with Darwin Port—and they're moving in more and more to take up the assets that should be in the hands of the Australian people.


I want to offer congratulations to the Australian people, the hundreds of thousands of people, who have rallied around to donate to the farming sector. I'd like to congratulate those farmers who have given their feed—their crops, their hay—to help their counterparts in other states. They themselves have gone through extremely hard times and they know what it's like. That's why they're actually giving—not selling but giving—their hay to those struggling farmers. I take my hat off to them. That's what the Aussie spirit is all about. They are doing the job that the governments in this place should have done. It's been too little, too late.


I will support this bill. I do support the farming sector getting the helping hand that they need. But I'm warning this parliament and the government: start looking after our food producers, the farmers out there, because we're losing them. They're walking off the land, they're willing to sell it into foreign ownership, and you're allowing it to happen because you're not giving them any hope or any vision for the future. You've sold them out, and it's a shame on you.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (12:57):  This bill, the Farm Household Support Amendment (Temporary Measures) Bill 2018, demonstrates the government's responsiveness to the needs of farming communities in rural and regional Australia. The farm household allowance program provides additional support for farmers and their partners facing hardship, including drought. The government knows that some farmers are doing it tough and that's why, from 1 August 2018, we will increase the farm household allowance from three to four cumulative years. This bill proposes two temporary changes to the FHA program. We're increasing the net farm asset threshold to $5 million and we're providing a lump sum payment to all farmers and their partners on FHA. This is in addition to their fortnightly payments. The bill also pays a supplement, paid in two instalments, of up to $12,000 to a couple, where both recipients are on the farm household allowance, and up to $7,200 for single recipients.


The allowance is not about paying for feed and fodder; it's about putting food on the tables of our farming families and affording them the dignity to buy other essentials in life. In turn, this spending injects cash into local businesses, who are also doing it tough. When farmers stop spending, everybody feels it.


The government understands many farmers are experiencing tough times due to ongoing poor climatic conditions and it's not easy to ask for help. But FHA is more than just a social security payment. It provides an additional $1,500 to help develop a farm financial assessment; access to activity supplements of up to $4,000 for professional support, advice and training; access to a dedicated case officer; and assessment for allowances such as a healthcare card, pharmaceutical allowance, rent assistance, telephone allowance, an energy supplement and remote area allowance. The temporary measures provided for this in bill are designed to help our farmers in the short term while we undertake an independent review of FHA. The review will be completed in the first half of 2019 and it will provide further guidance on the design of FHA into the future.


This bill demonstrates the government's continued responsiveness to the needs of farm communities and rural communities and is part of our $1.8 billion package of assistance to our farmers who are currently suffering hardship. I thank the members for their contribution and I commend this bill to the house.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (13:12):  Labor will support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan Base Rate Entities) Bill 2017. This bill clarifies eligibility for the lower corporate tax rate for small and medium businesses. It is a legislative fix to an unintended outcome of the government's tax plan. Labor have clearly stated that we will deliver tax cuts for small and medium-sized businesses, but we will stop Mr Turnbull's tax handout for the big banks and properly fund schools and hospitals. Doubtless that project will continue no matter the outcome of the negotiations which are presently taking place in every back room of this building on the part of the coalition members and senators.


That said, in relation to this bill, clear rules on eligibility for the lower rate are important for all parties. However, we would be remiss not to note that the government has been forced to introduce legislative fixes such as this as a result of their own slapdash approach to policymaking. Bodies such as the Tax Institute and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, whilst welcoming the clarification, have recommended a postimplementation review of the legislation, possibly by Treasury or by the Board of Taxation. We hope that the government heeds their calls.


Support for this technical amendment has no further implications for Labor's position on the threshold at which a lower corporate tax rate applies. This is simply about giving clarity about the operation of tax laws as long as a two-tiered company tax rate system stands. Under the measure contained in this bill, if more than 80 per cent of a company's assessable income is income of a passive nature—for example, rents or dividends—it will not be eligible for the lower rate. Many of these entities are known as bucket companies associated with discretionary trusts.


This legislative patch-up is a result of the government's poor implementation of their intended $80 billion corporate tax giveaway. In fact, it is rather embarrassing that, with government debt soaring ever higher, the Turnbull government continued to pursue its plan to give big business that multibillion dollar tax cut for so long—and there is no assurance that they won't try it again under another leader or if they were to win the next election. 


Eligibility for lower tax thresholds was intended to be contingent on carrying on a business, with the receipt of passive investment income not having been regarded as enough for a taxpayer to be able to demonstrate that. The government claims that, during the phase-up of company revenue thresholds eligible for lower tax rates, there was no intention for passive companies to receive lower tax rates. Passive income entities would only be eligible for the same tax rate as other corporate entities if and when the corporate tax rate was uniform for all entities—the 2023-24 income tax year, if the second phase of the companies tax plan is passed.


Interestingly, the government are silent on why they exclude passive income entities during the intended phase-in of the tax cut but include them at full implementation. No policy case has been given, which is telling. Thankfully, the Australian public has a temporary reprieve from this ill-conceived plan. In July last year, despite months of tax practitioner consternation since 2016 about the test for carrying on a business, the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services finally commented on the issue of eligibility by describing concerns as premature. But, instead of fixing the issue, the government was so focused on ramming through half of its tax plan before the 2017 budget that detail was not a priority. Draft legislation to fix this mess finally arrived in September 2017. 


Despite these delays, Labor will support the legislation to provide clarity to business and tax practitioners this year in order to avoid the chaos that permeated last year's tax time. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (13:16):  Firstly, I thank those opposite for the contribution that they've made to this debate. The amendments in this bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan Base Rate Entities) Bill 2017, will clarify the eligibility criteria for the lower company tax rate under the enterprise tax plan. The bill will introduce a new bright-line test to exclude passive companies. Under this test, companies that generate more than 80 per cent of their income in passive forms will not have access to the lower company tax rate. This test will replace the test for carrying on a business. The new test will operate from the 2017-18 income year and will help companies identify their applicable tax rate. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (13:12):  Labor will support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan Base Rate Entities) Bill 2017. This bill clarifies eligibility for the lower corporate tax rate for small and medium businesses. It is a legislative fix to an unintended outcome of the government's tax plan. Labor have clearly stated that we will deliver tax cuts for small and medium-sized businesses, but we will stop Mr Turnbull's tax handout for the big banks and properly fund schools and hospitals. Doubtless that project will continue no matter the outcome of the negotiations which are presently taking place in every back room of this building on the part of the coalition members and senators.


That said, in relation to this bill, clear rules on eligibility for the lower rate are important for all parties. However, we would be remiss not to note that the government has been forced to introduce legislative fixes such as this as a result of their own slapdash approach to policymaking. Bodies such as the Tax Institute and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, whilst welcoming the clarification, have recommended a postimplementation review of the legislation, possibly by Treasury or by the Board of Taxation. We hope that the government heeds their calls.


Support for this technical amendment has no further implications for Labor's position on the threshold at which a lower corporate tax rate applies. This is simply about giving clarity about the operation of tax laws as long as a two-tiered company tax rate system stands. Under the measure contained in this bill, if more than 80 per cent of a company's assessable income is income of a passive nature—for example, rents or dividends—it will not be eligible for the lower rate. Many of these entities are known as bucket companies associated with discretionary trusts.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (14:32):  I seek leave to move a motion relating to the administration of the Commonwealth—namely:


That the Senate:


(a) has no confidence in the Government;


(b) notes that the Government can change its leader, but it can never unite its party; and


(c) calls on whoever is the Prime Minister to visit the Governor-General by no later than 5 pm today to call an election immediately, so the people can decide who runs this country.


Leave granted.




Senator WONG:
  I thank the Senate. It is very clear from question time today why we should suspend and why we should debate this motion and why we should express no confidence in this government. It is very clear from question time today that Australia does not have a functioning government. Australia does not have a functioning government. We have a rabble of self-interested people masquerading as the representatives of Australia. We have a Leader of the Government in the Senate who could not even answer the simple question of how many ministers there are. They don't even know how many ministers they have left in their cabinet and in their executive. We have a leader of the National Party up here who couldn't even say in whom he had confidence as Prime Minister. He just said 'whoever it might be that the Liberal Party choose'.


The fact is, Mr President and members of the Senate, we don't have a government; we have a rabble. We have a self-interested rabble. Just look at the benches opposite where we sit. We can see that they are disunited. But do you know the one thing on which they're united? They're united on one matter and one matter only: their complete inability to govern. It is the only thing that unites them: their complete inability to govern. We see Minister Cormann, or former minister Cormann—Senator Cormann—the former Leader of the Government in the Senate, who has resigned; Senator Cash, resigned; Senator Fifield, resigned; Senator Fierravanti-Wells, resigned; and assistant ministers Seselja and McGrath, for those who have heard of them, resigned. This is a government that is now so devoid of talent, so devoid of numbers and so devoid of unity that the most senior minister opposite is Senator Nigel Scullion. Really? Where are we?


But I do want to make this point about what we have seen this week. It has been an extraordinary spectacle. It has been an extraordinary spectacle of disunity, division, personal hatred, enmity and ill-discipline. It has been all of those things. But the most telling aspect of what we have seen on offer this week is this: when you ask the question 'Who matters to the Liberal Party?' you get one answer—themselves. The only people that they care about are themselves. They don't care about working Australians who are struggling with the cost of living; they don't care about pensioners who are trying to pay their electricity bill; they don't care about families who need to see a GP; they don't care about Australians in crowded emergency departments, or nurses run off their feet; they don't care about older Australians, and their families, waiting for home care packages; and they don't care about kids, kids who want a decent education—



Senator McKenzie interjecting—




Senator WONG:
  Interject all you like, Senator McKenzie. Every Australian can see what your priority has been this week. It is holding onto government—holding onto government at all costs. It has not been to govern for the Australian people, and that is what we are sent here to do. We are here to represent the Australian people, and you are governing for you and not for them. The only people who matter to the Liberal Party are themselves. 


People will remember the famous Menzies speech about the forgotten people that the Liberals always get doe eyed about. You know what? You've forgotten about every Australian but yourselves. You've forgotten everyone but yourselves. That's what we've seen this week, over and over again, with each act of ill-discipline, each act of internal hatred, each act of disunity, which have resulted in a government frontbench which has Barry O'Sullivan down the end. That's what a government that is entirely focused on itself has resulted in: a government incapable of delivering to the Australian people.


It's been a week where we've seen—actually, it started last Friday—a man who is Prime Minister in name only, and the clock is ticking, who capitulated on everything that he said was important. We've seen that over and over again. And then we have Mr Morrison, the man who wanted the corporate tax cuts in the first place; and Mr Dutton, the worst health minister the country has seen and the architect of the GP tax. This is what is on offer to the Australian people. And they can't even sort it out. 


One thing I would say is at least this lot in here have bothered to turn up, which is why we've actually got members of the press gallery here. At least we actually had a Senate team who did bother to turn up. Of course, it's because they don't have the numbers to adjourn as yet. In the House, the chamber of government, the government abandoned the chamber. They ran away. They ran away from the parliament because they couldn't field a frontbench and because the Prime Minister of the day had no confidence that he could survive the day—or that the government could survive the day. They didn't even bother to turn up. They are so irretrievably divided, they have no interest in governing and no ambition to govern. 


Well, I think Australians have had enough. Australians know that the parliament deserves better, but, most of all, Australians know the Australian people deserve better. The Australian people deserve better. The Australian people deserve a government focused on their needs and not on the selfish, self-obsessed, hatred-filled games we have witnessed minute by minute over this last week. 


What is abundantly clear is that those opposite, the Liberal Party of Australia—perhaps a party in name only—cannot provide the leadership that the Australian people deserve. And what I say to them is this: if you can't provide that leadership, instead of running away from parliament and turning up here with this huddle of ministers that you've been reduced to, you should resign. You should resign. You should resign, and you should call an election now. You should call an election so the people have a chance to elect a party who's actually interested in the people themselves and enable the country to be governed by a party that actually looks to the needs of the Australian people, a government that is a stable and united team that is focused on Australians and not on itself, and a government that is committed to delivering what the Australian people need and what the Australian people want: affordable and decent health care; education for all based on ability, not postcode or wealth; decent care for our elderly; decent wages; and proper penalty rates. It is absolutely clear that the only party that would be capable of delivering that government and governing for all Australians is the Australian Labor Party.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2018-08-23,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training and Manager of Government Business in the Senate) (14:40):  What matters most to the people of Australia is policies and outcomes, and this government, this Liberal-National Party government, has delivered good policies and strong outcomes in spades. We as a government stand proud of a strong record of achievement, and we will continue to deliver on behalf of Australian families, on behalf of Australian households and on behalf of Australian businesses.


We already went through in question time—but I am happy to remind the Senate—the significant achievements of this government, particularly in terms of working through the debt and deficit legacy left to us by the Australian Labor Party, to the point where the budget comes back to balance in the next financial year. That's what people expect a good Liberal-National Party government to do, despite the obstruction and the opposition of those opposite, who at every single step of the way, when a budget savings measure was proposed, voted against it. They blocked it. They tried to be the wreckers and the destroyers in terms of repairing the budget. And, notwithstanding all that they did to block the efforts to repair the budget, we are in a position now where because of the good work of an economic team, Mr Morrison, Senator Cormann and Mr Turnbull, and the work, indeed, of Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey prior to that—because of that teamwork over that period of time—the budget comes back to balance, delivering what Australians think a good Liberal and National government should do. We have delivered on that.


Australians believe a good Liberal-National government should, of course, as well focus on jobs and growth, and 'jobs and growth' is not just a slogan we took to the last election; it is a reality, an outcome—some of the strongest economic growth in the developed world, strong economic growth that has actually delivered real benefits for Australians in terms of jobs growth that has overwhelmingly been jobs growth of full-time employment. As well as acknowledging our economic team, I pay tribute to Senator Cash for her work in terms of jobs growth around Australia, for her work as the minister for jobs and the minister for employment in ensuring that we have jobs growth that has helped more Australians enjoy the dignity of work and enjoy the opportunity to get ahead.


But, what's more, those Australians who have now got a job because of what our government has delivered are going to get to keep more of their hard-earned income. That's the critical reform from this government. Because we've managed the economy strongly, because we've achieved strong economic growth, because we've achieved strong jobs growth, we have been able to bring the budget back to balance and still afford to legislate the most far-ranging tax cuts that Australia has seen—tax relief that will affect and benefit all Australian hardworking households and will ensure that Australians, in terms of the income tax they pay, will no longer be forced and pushed into a higher income tax bracket. Bracket creep has been a disease that has afflicted the Australian workplace for too long, and the coalition government has passed legislation to address bracket creep in a significant way.


But guess what? What do the Australian people face when it comes to bracket creep if there were to be a change of government to those opposite? A return to bracket creep, because the Labor Party plan to roll back tax cuts. They plan to roll back the tax cuts that this government has legislated. In rolling back those tax cuts, bracket creep will be back on the deck for hardworking Australians. As Australians work hard, as they seek to get ahead and as hardworking Australians right around the country go out and perhaps work an extra shift or an extra day, do you know one of the reasons they can do that? It's because of our childcare reforms.


This is a virtuous cycle for Australians. We've created more jobs, we've created the environment where wages are growing faster and we've created the circumstance where people can afford to work an extra shift or an extra day. It's because they no longer have to pay so much in relation to childcare costs. Because of our tax relief, they're also going to get to keep more of their hard-earned income. All of that is at threat because of those opposite. Those opposite promise to roll back the tax cuts for Australian households. They promise to roll back tax cuts for small businesses. They, of course, voted against our childcare reforms.


It's not just the Australian economy that will be at risk. We know from past history that, of course, the Labor Party can't be trusted in relation to our national security interests either. In relation to our national security interests, the Labor Party will no doubt, once again, team up with the Australian Greens, and then we will see a weakening of our border protection policies. We've seen that happen before. We know the track record. Do we remember Mr Rudd standing there before the 2007 election, promising that, in terms of economic management, he would be a careful and prudent manager? And yet he blew the budget wide open. He blew the budget wide open, and it has taken five years of hard work and toil to bring it back to balance.


Mr Rudd also promised that, when it came to national security and particularly to border protection, he would keep all of the Howard government's policies. But what happened? Mr Rudd was found to be telling untruths. He lied to the Australian people before that election. Once elected, the Labor Party systematically went about doing what the Australian Greens wanted them to, which was to dismantle those border protection policies. That will happen again. It will happen again as clearly as day follows night. We know that those in the left wing of the Labor Party opposite—and, indeed, some in the right, such as Senator Keneally—want to dismantle the border security policies that have saved thousands and thousands of Australian lives. That will be a live topic when the Labor Party national convention happens. No doubt, that once again it will take backroom deals to stop embarrassing debate in relation to their reforms and their policies.


The Labor Party can come in here and they can seek to try to make this a debate about politics, but this coalition government will ensure that we continue to focus on the things that will matter to the Australian people in terms of good policies and good outcomes. Our careful economic management has delivered a strong economy, record jobs growth, the opportunity for wages growth and the conditions for us to deliver tax relief also allows us to invest in the essential services that Australians rely upon. Despite the lies we hear from those opposite, there is a record and growing level of investment in Australia's health care and in Australia's education system. We do it in a way that balances the budget and invests more in terms of the health and education for Australians. Despite the lies of those opposite—and we remember the Medicare scare campaign at the last election—we have record GP bulk-billing rates. We have some 86.1 per cent in relation to bulk-billing rates.


Perhaps more importantly, we have listed—or amended—some 1,700 medicines on the PBS. The PBS is particularly important in terms of essential services for Australians. It's important because it gives them access to groundbreaking new drugs at an affordable rate. Do you know what a consequence of the last Labor government was? That, as the budget spiralled out of control under Labor, one of the steps they took was to stop listing PBS medicines. They denied Australians the opportunity to access those cheap, groundbreaking new drugs to help with their health care. That's what we saw last time around, when it all went horribly wrong with those opposite. What we saw last time around was that the Australian Labor Party, in losing control of the budget, took panicked measures such as stripping Australians of the right to new drugs that should have been listed on the PBS. This government, this Liberal and National Party government, has ensured that, when recommendations are made through the independent Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, they are acted on. They are acted on!


So what is at risk for Australians? What is a threat from those opposite? Jobs. From those opposite: higher taxes and weaker jobs growth. From those opposite: ultimately, our balanced budget will be destroyed. From those opposite: weaker border protection. We will ultimately see those opposite go down that track record again, whether it's the PBS or something else. But the next election, due next year, will no doubt be another occasion when we will also see the despicable lies of those opposite. We saw that in the last election campaign. Who could forget the way in which they rolled out the 'Mediscare' campaign. They took the Medicare logo and misused it. They took an approach of spreading lies and mistruths to scare vulnerable Australians, pensioners and others. That is what we saw from those opposite. We saw an approach in the last election campaign where they tried to win it based on scare tactics—scare tactics that were completely untrue, and scare tactics that were based on lies.

Opposition senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order!



Senator O'Neill interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator O'Neill.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  For us, it's about policies and outcomes. We have worked as a government to tackle difficult issues—difficult, challenging issues. People said that we'd never manage to legislate our income tax cuts, and we did. People said that we would never manage to legislate to reintroduce the ABCC or the Registered Organisations Commission, but we did. People said that we'd never legislate other key reforms the Labor Party and the Greens proposed—reforms in my portfolio area, such as child care—but we did. People said that we'd never manage to legislate to bring the budget back to balance, but we did, through perseverance and hard work. People said that fixing the GST problem was an intractable problem, yet it wasn't intractable, not at all. All it took was hard work from a dedicated team, who came up with a solution that was fair and reasonable to every Australian. I challenge everyone opposite from Western Australia to go back there and try to explain how it is that they never came up with a credible GST policy, yet this Liberal-National Party government did and is delivering it. And that is absolutely to the credit, in this place, of Senator Cormann, Senator Reynolds, Senator Brockman, Senator Smith and Senator Cash. Each and every one of them worked hard in a team to ensure that we delivered that reform.


We tackled other difficult issues, such as the question around same-sex marriage. People said that a plebiscite or a vote or giving Australians a say would never happen. It did happen. It did happen, and we saw a strong endorsement for change, and we saw this parliament then legislate that. Different people expressed their different opinions. That's what you expect on an important social reform like that. But this government provided the framework for that decision to be resolved and to ensure that it was resolved in a way to provide certainty for all Australians into the future.


When we go to an election next year, the Australian people have to make a choice about the next three years. And the choice that they will face is absolutely a choice between the Liberal and National parties, who have shown through our actions to date that we will back their interests. If Australians work hard, we will make sure they keep as much of their hard-earned money as they can. If they want to grow their business, we will make sure the circumstances are there to grow their business. If Australians want to ensure they can start a business, we've created small business tax policies that are more competitive than what those opposite have.


But it will be a choice. Every election is a choice, and I'm going to give the Labor Party one bit of credit. They have released policies for the next election: policies for more than $200 billion of higher and additional taxes. That choice will be whether Australians want to pay higher taxes on their wages. I look around the full public gallery today. I doubt there are terribly many people in the public gallery or elsewhere who want to be paying higher taxes on their take-home wages. The question will be whether Australian retirees want to see higher taxes on their hard-earned savings. Who'd have thought that Mr Shorten would come up with a tax policy that went after the savings of retirees? But there are retirees in the gallery today, and I'll bet they don't want to be paying higher taxes on their savings.


Of course, the Labor Party also has plans for higher taxes on Australian houses. People want to buy an investment property, get ahead and save a little bit for the future. The Labor Party still has a policy that will see higher taxes in relation to people doing that, and the result of that will be higher rents for many Australians and lower property prices—a devaluation of the major asset that many Australian households have.


Australian small businesses face the threat of higher taxes. So many Australians, more than 40 per cent of Australians, work in small businesses, and under the Labor Party they will be paying a higher tax rate in those small businesses than what has been legislated by this parliament, by this Liberal and National Party government. The result of that will be that those businesses have less money to invest, to grow, to create more jobs and to create higher wages.


Of course, in relation to electricity, this government has tackled again the difficult issue of electricity. Just this week, we have announced reforms that build upon the work we had already delivered as a government. We started out by making sure that we fixed issues around network transmission costs—no more gaming of the system by transmission networks and companies in terms of energy policy, but instead a clear, transparent system where they can't gold-plate infrastructure and slug people on their electricity bills for it.


We ensured, in relation to gas prices, that gas prices were brought down—again, something that many said couldn't be done. But this government made sure that it was clear to businesses who were doing the wrong thing by Australians that we would take whatever action was necessary to keep Australian gas here for Australian energy generation, to drive down Australian electricity prices.


We tackled the retail market and this week went even further in relation to the retail market. We have ensured that Australians will get, in terms of electricity bills, a fair default price. No longer will Australian pensioners find that, when they come out of an electricity contract, they have to go through the confusing or difficult choice of what electricity contract to go on. Instead, because of our policy change, pensioners will know and can have confidence that there will be a default price that is a fair and efficient price, and that they will not be able to be ripped off by those electricity companies. We can have confidence that they won't be ripped off by those electricity companies, because we've put strong penalties in place as well. We have said that, of course, what is required is a range of penalties, including the power to force divestment of assets if required—strong penalties to make sure there is clear action in that energy market. We have accepted and are acting on those ACCC recommendations, including ensuring that more generation capacity can be built.


So the choice for Australians could not be starker when it comes to next year's election: a choice between a low-taxing Liberal and National Party government and a high-taxing Labor government; a choice between a Liberal and National Party government where wages will be taxed at a lower rate and a Labor government where wages will be taxed at a higher rate; a choice between a Liberal and National Party government where small businesses will be taxed at a lower rate and a government where houses will be taxed at a higher rate; and a choice between a Liberal and National Party government where electricity bills will be lower and a Labor government where electricity bills will be higher. That is the choice that is on offer. People will not, in the end, risk their jobs, their wages, their homes, their retirement savings and the potential for lower electricity bills on that mob opposite. They will not risk our national security and the border protection of the country on that mob opposite. Because, in the end, Australians care not about the political stunt of this motion but about good policy and good outcomes. And the Liberal and National coalition government has delivered good policy and strong outcomes in spades, and hundreds of thousands—even millions—of Australians are better off as a result of our doing so.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2018-08-23,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (15:00):  I too look at the people in the gallery who have joined us today and the many millions of Australians who are watching what's going on in this parliament. What they're watching is a national embarrassment. It's a disgrace. It's utterly shameful.


We haven't had a stable government in this country for a decade now. I've got a 10-year-old boy, and he's seen half a dozen different prime ministers. We have politicians in this joint who are far more concerned about themselves and their own self-interest than about governing the country. While the Liberal Party have been tearing themselves apart, 100 per cent of New South Wales is in drought; the Great Barrier Reef is on the brink of collapse; there are floods in India; we've got a 12-year-old girl setting herself alight in Nauru; and we've got kids who are in a catatonic state because they've given up hope, locked away in those offshore hellholes. And what's the Liberal Party doing? They're focusing on vengeance and on payback. They're focusing on themselves.


We've got people who can't afford to pay their medical bills right now. We've got young people who are being priced out of an education. There are 100,000 people in this country who are homeless. There are women who fear going home tonight because one woman a week is killed at the hands of a violent partner. And what have we got? We've got this spectacle, this disgrace! You should be ashamed of yourselves. We have people across the country who are suffering, and look what you're doing. You are so focused on yourselves that you have forgotten what the country elected you to do, and that is to govern—for them, not for you. You don't deserve to govern; you deserve to be turfed out. That's what you deserve.


You walked away from climate change. You walked away from an energy policy. You ditched your economic plan. And why? Because those dinosaurs inside your party room held the Prime Minister to ransom, and he didn't have the guts to take them on. And what has he done instead? What has your party done? We now have the prospect of Peter Dutton or Scott Morrison as the next Prime Minister of this country. Things are pretty crook right now, but they're going to get a hell of a lot worse. I fear for those people in this country who have come from overseas, because we're going to have an election that focuses on race, that fans the flames of racism and division. That's what's coming right now. We're going to have an election campaign in which people are divided and neighbour is pitted against neighbour because you haven't got the guts to stand up and lead in this country.


People have a right to be angry. I understand why people feel angry. Of course they're angry. We haven't seen investment in infrastructure. Our roads are choking. We haven't got a waste policy. Energy prices are going up. Of course they're angry. Young people can't afford to buy their own home. We've got young people who can't afford to get an education. No wonder people are feeling crook. No wonder they want to turf this mob out. But, let me tell you: the answer is not your neighbour; it's not the person who's come from overseas; it's not the Italian or the Greek or the African; it's not someone who doesn't share your religion. It's this mob right here that you should look at who are doing the bidding of the big end of town and who are more interested in looking after their corporate mates than they are in looking after the people who elected them to this place.


And there was one person in this place who was more unhappy than those members sitting over there, and it was Senator Hanson. Do you know why Senator Hanson was unhappy? She was unhappy because she has seen a party adopt her policies rather than stand up to her. Rather than taking a stand against One Nation, the Liberal Party are becoming just like them: a bunch of anti-immigrant, climate deniers with no economic plan. You are a disgrace. You should hang your heads in shame. Make no mistake: we are going to take it right up to you mob in the next election. To all those people who are listening right now who feel scared—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Di Natale, I have shown a liberal approach in this debate, but comments should be directed to and through the chair, and members in the other place referred to by their appropriate titles.




Senator DI NATALE:
  Make no mistake: right now many people across this country are frightened and worried about what the next election has in store for them. That speech we heard from Fraser Anning last week is a taste of things to come. When we have a Prime Minister whipping up fear around African immigrants—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Williams, on a point of order.




Senator Williams:
  Mr President, you just made a point to Senator Di Natale to refer to those in the other place by their correct titles. I ask that he does the same here as well. Civility costs absolutely nothing.



The PRESIDENT:  Very true, Senator Williams. Senator Di Natale, you know the rules of debate. Please refer to people by their appropriate titles.




Senator DI NATALE:
  When we have the Prime Minister of this country whipping up fears around African immigrants and when we have the potential future Prime Minister of this country saying that bringing Lebanese Muslims into this country was a mistake and blaming refugees for both taking people's jobs and taking welfare, we know what's in store. The next election is going to be an ugly, calculated attempt at race-baiting to win over One Nation voters, who have a right to be angry at governments for letting them down, but the enemy is not their neighbour who has chosen Australia to make their home; the enemy is the political and economic system that has been bought by vested interests and big corporations, who make massive donations to both sides of politics so that they can get what they want—everybody else be damned! That's what we're facing. In a few months we'll be facing an election. I say to the people of Australia, to all of you in the gallery: the Greens are with you. We'll fight them every step of the way, and we will not let them win.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-08-23,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (15:07):  The eyes of Australia are watching this chamber at the moment. People in the gallery are watching, and I'm ashamed of what is going on at the moment. I feel that this censure motion put before the parliament by the Labor Party is nothing but political pointscoring. They say there's a dysfunctional government. I disagree. Even today on the floor of parliament we are still debating legislation going through this chamber. Yes, there are problems within the Liberal Party about the leadership, but people in glass houses should not throw stones. How long ago did the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd fiasco happen? Even just a couple of months ago, if the Labor Party had lost any of the 'Super Saturday' seats, it would have been facing a leadership challenge by Albanese, so don't throw stones. This is political pointscoring at its utmost. There's no reason for a censure motion.


To listen to Senator Di Natale and his comments—that was a political speech if ever I heard one. You're gearing up for the next election, as if it's just about to break down—my God, talk about fearmongering! All I've heard from the Greens in this place is fearmongering—the reef is dead, they want to shut down farming, they have no problems with vegetation management, the water is rising, we're all going to be flooded, the climate is completely out of control. Scientists say that, if you shut down everything—electricity, cars, traffic, industry—and turn the lights out, nothing will change whatsoever. That's fearmongering if ever I have heard anything.


As far as immigration goes, the Greens want to open the floodgates for unlimited numbers to come into this country, plus refugees, plus they want to give about $12 billion, if not more, away in foreign aid. They don't care; I rarely hear them talk about the people in this country, the struggling farmers or anyone else. All they're worried about are other people in other countries around the world. I suggest to them: get out of this place and seek a political future in another country. All they seem to talk about is people around the world. I will not apologise for wanting the represent the Australian people to ensure they have a decent standard of living and way of life. If common sense prevails on who is the government here to look at the policies that I have put forward, so be it.


The whole thing is that this is a censure motion, and I believe that the chamber should not be shut down. I'm going to call on my colleagues in this parliament: in all fairness, you have to say that legislation in this chamber is still working. The people of Australia expect us to do a job and to be working for them. I say: let's continue to work for them. This parliament shuts down tonight, so let it run its course. Don't shut it down and don't let the Labor political party pointscore with this censure motion; that's what it's about. The Liberal Party will sort out its leadership, but we are still working. We are here as elected senators in this place. We should keep working for the people, because that's what the people in the galleries expect of us—each and every one of them. They expect us to be here working for them. They're sick and tired of this rabble. Even across this chamber, you all sit there and all you can do is scream across the chamber. You are not—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Collins, on a point of order?




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  There seems to be some confusion about the motion that's before the Senate. It is a motion of no confidence, not a censure motion. It seems that Senator Hanson doesn't quite understand what a censure motion is, nor what a no confidence motion is or means to the program.



The PRESIDENT:  You've made your point, Senator Collins. It's on the record now.




Senator HANSON:
  I will take that back; I was wrong. It's not a censure motion but a motion of no confidence in the government. That's not the case. They are still working and, as long as they still are presenting the legislation here on the floor of the parliament, I will support that. I will not be supporting the Labor Party's vote of no confidence in the government at all. It's up to the people of this nation. When an election is called, the people will have their say at the ballot box, based on what this government has done and based on what your policies will be. On your past performances, you have got a lot to answer for. You're not perfect, that's for sure. Your policies have destroyed this country as well. The people have not forgotten. You cannot manage the economy; you have bad economic managers.


Yes, I don't always support the government either. You yourselves also say that the fact is you're not prepared to work for this country. That's because, when you actually have good policies, you are not prepared to back it on behalf of the people of this nation. You actually knock it back. Even on my private member's bill about immigration that I tried to put up here on Monday to debate, what did you do? You censured it; you stopped it. You stopped the debate. You actually would not allow me to discuss that so it could be put it up for the next election for the people of this country to have a say about immigration. You actually stopped it. The Labor Party, with the Greens, supported by Senator Anning's vote, stopped the debate for the people of this country to have a say on immigration. That's because you want to open up the floodgates.


Why don't you tell the people the truth about where your policies are heading? They are feeling the effects of high immigration in this country. They cannot deal with it. The Liberal Party have not dealt with it either. The big elephant in the room, which has such an impact on this country, is high immigration numbers, plus the rising cost of electricity. You sit here in this place, and you're all worried about your jobs—that's what it's all about. You are all worried about your jobs. Here we have the farming sector that is—



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator HANSON:
  You don't like it, do you? You don't like it when you cop the truth back.



The PRESIDENT:  Address your comments to the chair, Senator Hanson.




Senator HANSON:
  The farming sector is on its knees. Do you know who is coming to their aid? It's the Australian people, donating out of their own pockets, who are giving donations. It's even other farmers who have gone through tough times. They're donating feed and fodder to their fellow farmers, and what have both sides done? You haven't done enough. It's too little too late. The Australian people know what you have done. All you're doing is worrying in this place about your own futures. You're looking after your own backsides. You don't care about the people out there. I hardly ever see you fight and stand up for them.


But I tell you what. Guess what: you're got me for another four years at least, and I'm going to be in this parliament and, whoever is on this side of the chamber, I will damn well hold you to account for the Australian people, because you are not doing the right thing. Listen to what the people want. Lower the rising cost of electricity, look at immigration, stop foreign ownership of our land and the destruction of our industries and manufacturing, and get jobs for our youth. There's no future for the youth in this country. You've done nothing to address that. The Labor Party, again, is going on about apprenticeship schemes and having a go at me. At least I'm trying to do something for them. You've actually destroyed the TAFE colleges. You shut them down. You have done nothing about apprenticeships whatsoever.


I've got to give credit to the coalition on their ABCC bill. Senator Cash fought for that, and that has seen progress in this country, where there was union thuggery and bullying that went on, shutting down businesses. That has now increased in the country.


So I will be here for another four years, and I'll call for accountability in this parliament, and I'll call it for what it is. You know what? The people may not always agree with me, and I'm up-front and honest with them, but they know what I say. They expect the truth out of me, and they get the truth out of me, not like either side here. You only say what suits you. You will only say what suits you, to see where you can get your next vote from. So start to wake up and be representatives for the people in this parliament with truth and honesty.

"Hinch, Sen Derryn",DHJP,2018-08-23,"



Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (15:16):  I shall be brief. I'm old enough to remember the days when we all used to laugh at the Italians. We said how often they changed their government, how often they changed their leaders  and what a stupid country that was—how irresponsible and what a lousy case of democracy. Tomorrow, it would seem, an elected Prime Minister will not make it to his full term. An elected Prime Minister, I believe—seeing that the people of Australia elected him, whether it be Prime Minister Shorten or Prime Minister Turnbull—was elected by the people and should serve his or her full term in government. I'm sorry that that will not happen, because tomorrow, it would appear, we'll now have either a Prime Minister Dutton or a Prime Minister Morrison or a Prime Minister Pyne or a Prime Minister Bishop. They're all doing the numbers. I'm told they're all doing the numbers.


I will concede that I criticise this government and I vote against this government. I think what they did in the other place today was a bloody disgrace. They have shut down democracy and the workings of the place. I agree with Senator Cameron sometimes, with his 'rabble'. They're a rabble. They're a terrible rabble at times, and they are at the moment. We do not know who's going to be in the ministry tomorrow. We don't know who we're going to ask questions of. I'll concede a bit to Senator Hanson: the government obviously must still be doing some sort of work somewhere. I guess there's a chance we may have a Prime Minister Turnbull if they can't find the 43 signatures. I still say, though, that I believe a government is the government. It should not be up to us, Senator Wong. It should not be up to us to decide when they should go to the polls and when they should have an election.




Senator Kim Carr:
  Why not?




Senator HINCH:
  Because the people elected this government, Senator Carr, and the government should decide. Whoever the new Prime Minister is tomorrow, he or she should decide when we should have an election.




Senator Kim Carr:
  Which one? Which Prime Minister? Which one's going to decide?




Senator HINCH:
   I don't know. Through the chair, Senator Carr, I do not know. We don't know. But, when that Prime Minister is elected by the party room tomorrow, it is up to them to decide when they call an election. It is not for you to call an election and not for me. It is for them.




Senator Kim Carr:
  The people should decide.




Senator HINCH:
  Do you want to take the rest of my turn, Senator Carr?



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Hinch, please continue your remarks. Senator Carr, please!




Senator HINCH:
  Through the chair, let me say that I believe a government should have the right to call an election when they want to, even though they may be so unpopular that we want them to have an election. I'll be voting with the government on this one.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2018-08-23,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (15:19):  If the Australian people weren't alarmed enough, Senator Hinch has sent a shiver—a horror—through all of their spines by mentioning 'Prime Minister Pyne'. It conjures dread through the country to think not only has our political system become a bit of a laughing stock but that such thoughts could be taken seriously—or even with remote seriousness—in this place. 


I perfectly understand why Senator Wong has moved this motion of no confidence. If you look at the government's track record it has been dreadful to say the least. Not only have they refused to deal with some of the issues that need to be dealt with; they've messed around with people's superannuation, they've run a chaotic and dysfunctional government, and they've thrown everything up in the air and said, 'It's on the table', which basically means they've got no firm principles and no framework in which to discount even the most idiotic proposals. We've had a government that has been committed to emissions trading schemes. They've snuck them through. They've discussed a tax on car emissions and a tax on lawnmowers and two-stroke engines. We've got a year's worth of national electricity guarantee work that was abandoned under the face of a bit of a pressure. We've got money being sent off to bodies without enough scrutiny: $444 million to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. We've got hundreds of millions of dollars shipped off to the Clinton Foundation and the United Nations. There is the signing up to the Paris agreement. You can go through the litany of failures of this government. It's why I'm no longer part of the Liberal Party. That judgement was one that I made, because I couldn't go along with it. 


The base politics of moving a no confidence motion is very straightforward, and every failure on this side is repeated on the other side of the chamber. They've done worse: they've knifed two prime ministers; at the moment, the Liberal Party has only knifed one. They've got bigger emissions trading targets. They want to outsource more of Australian sovereignty to international organisations. They want, basically, an open border policy. We know they're going to tax and spend. They're going to tinker with and work harder against people's superannuation again. They're going to change capital gains tax. They're going to overturn negative gearing, which is a principle of business, and they cannot tell you whether they're going to apply it to commercial property, to share transactions or to residential property. We know that half of them have sold out to China, but we also know that that's happened on this side as well. 


What politics has become is shameful. It's a crisis. You can look around the place and you can ask the Australian people, and they speak with their votes: about 30 or 40 per cent of people now are voting outside the major parties. That is where the vote of no confidence is coming from. I regret that that has allowed some base opportunism to spring up—people in positions of influence wielding their power for their personal gratification and to aggrandise and big-note themselves rather than do something that is in the best interests of the country.


On that side, they say they want to spend $40 billion on education; on this side, it was $18 billion on education—all unfunded and all uncosted, and there are no educational outcomes available for it. What did the crossbench do? They said, '$18 billion isn't enough; let's put another $5 billion of borrowed money into it.' However you want to look at the decision-making that has been taking place in the last decade of parliament, it is no wonder the Australian people are losing faith and confidence in the body politic. 


We are all guilty of it, to a degree. We will all complain about the other team. But the people we are letting down are the Australian people. There are the mums and dads who are finding it difficult to pay their utility bills. Every problem in the electricity market is caused by government interference, government determinations and government regulations—every single one. Every time an Australian person can't afford to pay their electricity bills, we should be hanging our heads in shame. It is because of blind ideology, and this was as forecastable as anything. 


So was the crisis that is engulfing the Liberal Party now. The move against Tony Abbott, three or so years ago, was textbook—a textbook repetition of the same failures and the same damage that was done by the Labor Party in getting rid of Kevin Rudd. It doesn't matter whether Kevin Rudd was a dysfunctional human being or whether Tony Abbott was a good Prime Minister.



Senator Gallacher interjecting—




Senator BERNARDI:
  You know that's true, Senator Gallacher. In the end, the Australian people have come to expect that the person they elect to be their Prime Minister would at least see out a term. That has been the convention, and when you dump convention you dump the integrity of the system, and that is what we've done. The people on the Liberal side of the chamber who orchestrated and participated in that coup should be hanging their heads in shame. They thought, 'We can take Labor's policy and somehow make it turn out better.' Well, what they did was that they took Labor's policy, essentially took Labor's rejected candidate—because, let's remember, Mr Turnbull lined up there with Graham Richardson and others, seeking Labor preselection, and they said, 'No; we've got enough narcissists in our party already'—so he made his migration across to the coalition, where he has systemically sought to reshape it and change it in his image, which is not the traditional Liberal Party image.


I say to the Australian people: like it or lump it, this mob or that mob, the red team or the blue team, are going to be running a government of some sort after the next election. The choice for you is who is going to influence and shape the outcomes: who in this place can be trusted to put the Australian people's interests first rather than naked political opportunism first. You can only look around the crossbench and ask who has acted, in every vote, with principle—not with shameless self-aggrandisement or political opportunism or something to extract a boast about—who is seeking to improve legislation, voting on either side of the chamber according to the merits of it? I will say that I'm not the only who's endeavoured to do that; there are others in this chamber as well.


But we cannot let down the Australian people through these shameless acts of partisanship. The only ones who are being let down are the Australian people, who once had faith in this institution, who once had confidence that the people up here were actually going to act in their interests. It's time for that to happen again. The font of all wisdom and knowledge is not vested in this place. We have to think that the Australian people can make some determinations and decisions for themselves. That is the challenge for us: rather than getting government out of people's lives—because we haven't improved it at all in the past 10 years—we need to have a very light touch on their lives so that they can make these decisions themselves.


Quite frankly, as I'm not a personal fan of the Prime Minister, I do believe that ultimately these things should be handled at the ballot box for Prime Minister. It is an indictment on this place, as Senator Hinch said, that Italy looks like the paragon of political stability now. We haven't had a Prime Minister since John Howard who has actually lasted a full term after their election. That is a reflection on each and every one of us, people who have participated in the games to bring down successive prime ministers. I know we relish it when it's on the other side, but I look here from the crossbench and I say that it's a shame. It's a shame for all of us. It's a shame for the Australian people. I won't be supporting this no-confidence motion, because I do understand that it's base politics. And as I said in my opening remarks, whatever the errors of this side, they've only ever been reflected or compounded—sometimes even exceeded—by the errors of the other side. I'm not going to support a motion that has what I regard as political intent and is based around hypocrisy.



The PRESIDENT:  I understand that there have been discussions around the chamber about a speaking order, which I'm happy to comply with. I will go to Senator Scullion first.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:29):  In the short time I have, I will say that, no, I don't support the motion. But I would like to reflect on some of the opening remarks that have been made. I think it's an insight into the character of the Labor Party. You can recall Senator Wong—arrogant, derisive, sneering: 'What's Senator Scullion doing at this end? What's Nigel doing here?' I'm not really sure what sort of reflection that was—probably a personal reflection. But it's more likely, 'He's from the Territory,' or, 'He's from the bush—he shouldn't really be here.' They're the sorts of reflections. Or maybe it's, 'He's from the National Party.' Maybe that was the reflection.



The PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Scullion. Senator Collins on a point of order.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  The point of order is that the reflections that Senator Scullion is talking about are simply questions about why he's not sitting on National benches and why he was brought forward into Liberal benches, and questions about whether he has moved into the Liberal Party. There was no sneering or arrogance or rudeness in way he's suggested.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Collins, I've let you explain that point. That is a matter for debate—as long as people aren't making inappropriate reflections on one another. I'll call Senator Scullion to continue.




Senator SCULLION:
  I was standing, so I understand exactly what was said and the manner in which it was said. Perhaps it was that I'm not as important; I'm only the Minister for Indigenous Affairs. That's perhaps what it is. Penny was actually a minister of the day for finance—and we can all remember how that went. Senator Wong was left with a glory box: $20 billion in the bank, $6 billion in an education fund—




Senator McCarthy:
  A point of order, Mr President: could the minister refer to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate in the appropriate manner, please.



The PRESIDENT:  That is an appropriate point of order. I missed it if it was inappropriate. People should refer to each other by their titles.




Senator SCULLION:
  We had a $6 billion education infrastructure fund, another multibillion-dollar telecommunications fund, and nobody knew where it went—it's all gone. One of the great records of those opposite, driven by their leader, who drips scorn and derision on ordinary people—which is the dark heart of the Labor Party—is that they had a record debt. That was their race to debt—$240 billion in debt. And, let me tell you, at that trajectory, we would have reached a trillion dollars in debt. So I don't particularly like being lectured by those opposite about what sort of a hierarchical place we might have in life. 


In every single thing we hear from the other side, you'd reckon that regional and rural Australia didn't even exist. Look at the things we've done for drought relief and at our record investment in infrastructure. We now have 21st century communications. We have doctors and health professionals in the regions. We have the effects test. We have the country-of-origin labelling. We've had decentralisation. We're supporting agricultural industries with tax relief. We're backing the mining, resources and energy industries. We are governing this country. We are governing this country in a much better way than you would ever dream of. So, if there are any crocodile tears about dysfunction because someone's changing leaders and it's not a pretty sight, then those are just crocodile tears. To those people who ask, 'Who is the Prime Minister?' I can assure you it's not the member for Grayndler or Sydney or Blaxland or McMahon or Lindsay, and most importantly it won't be the member for Maribyrnong.

Senator STORER
 (South Australia) (15:33):  I won't be supporting this motion. I do not believe it's appropriate that the Senate pass judgement on the government in this manner. We are senators, and the Senate has convened and is working today, and the government has presented ministers to answer questions, and I think it is appropriate that we continue to do so. So, I do not believe that it's appropriate for the Senate to be calling the Prime Minister to act. There is a Prime Minister and there's a process going on. 


But this is a very embarrassing situation for Australia. It is no wonder that many voters are leaving major parties and voting for Independents and other crossbench parties. We've heard from some of them today, and many of the sentiments made in part by some of the crossbench ring very true. We have significant issues at stake to deal with in Australia, in particular with regard to energy policy, for example. It is one area where the people need trust, and certainly even business certainty, to move forward. There are no guarantees of affordability or where it's going in terms of environmental sustainability. There's certainly a need for the government to move forward. There is a Prime Minister in place. The government will look to change its leader. It's unfortunate that this is occurring, and it should not be. The Australian people vote on a three-yearly basis to choose a party and senators to represent them, and there should be appropriate processes such that the government can govern and lead. Australia does not want to see the continual knifing of leaders as has occurred over the last 10 years.


I echo many of the sentiments of the crossbench here today. I hope that the Australian people can have representation both in the lower house and also in a Senate that will approach legislation on its merits as befits this house of review and will do so with principles of integrity, fairness and sustainability and with an eye to the prosperity of the Australian people as a whole. Therefore, I am not calling for the government to go to an election. We have an election coming within the next year, and the Australian people, I think, wish to see the government take its course and make their judgement at that time, when they can choose representatives in the lower house and also, importantly, senators that will independently review legislation brought forward by the government of the day under reasonable and decent principles.

It's not as though we haven't seen this sort of thing happening on this side of the chamber, and they managed to steer their way through that. So I think it's a bit too early to tell.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2018-08-23,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:37):  I stand to support this vote of no confidence in this so-called government. What I have to say to Senator Scullion is: it's not about you. This is not about Senator Scullion. This is about getting a government that can actually deliver on the issues that the country desperately wants a government to deal with—health and education, getting a decent pay system and, for young kids here, climate change. The Arctic is on fire, and these people are just carving each other up.


There is so much that we need to do in this country to build a decent society for the future, and I have to say that cannot be done with some of the contributions that were made here. I just want to say to Senator Birmingham: I know that the Murdoch press are blaming you for where we are, and I think you've got some responsibility but not all the responsibility. What we've seen in this place over a period of time is an absolute obsession of the Liberals and the Nationals with each other. They don't care about what's happening in the rest of the country. They don't care that working people are losing their penalty rates. They don't care that working people have wage stagnation. They don't care that many families are struggling to put food on the table. They don't care that some pensioners can't afford to get an operation when it's needed. They don't care that the public health system is in trouble. They don't care that the education system is being built for the elite. This is about ordinary working Australians getting a government that works for them. 


That's why the Prime Minister—if he is the Prime Minister now; I'm not sure—should go to an election and let the public make the choice. The choice is clear, and you've seen it here today in these contributions. The choice is the extremists in the Liberal and National parties linking up with Senator Hanson. We are going to have huge problems with this government—absolutely huge problems. Senator Anning's speech here the other day was about trying to take votes off Senator Hanson, and what's been happening in the Liberal Party is the Liberal Party falling apart because they want to pitch to the worst elements in our society. That's where we are. 


What Labor cares about is getting a government that can actually work for Australians; a government that understands the key issues for Australian working families; a government that is not prepared to attack pensioners, as this government was prepared to do in 2014-15. If it had been up to this government, pensioners would have been about $80 a week worse off under that 2014-15 budget. And who's standing for the leadership of the Liberal Party? Peter Dutton, the former health minister under former Prime Minister Tony Abbott. And what was his contribution to society? A cut of $57 billion to the public health system. This is the guy who is standing up and saying, 'Vote for me to be the Prime Minister.'


The experiment by the Liberal Party has failed. The Liberal Party experiment was to put someone in as Prime Minister who was supposed to be a moderate, to stand up and appeal to the centre ground of Australia. The extremists, the far Right in the Liberal Party and National Party, were never going to let that happen. And, because Prime Minister Turnbull did not have the courage or the backbone to stand up to the far Right, who will line up with Senator Hanson, they just demanded more and more from him, and he gave up his values, he gave up his principles and he capitulated to this mob.


We must have an election, because we can't have Senator Hanson here, pushing division, in a position of power in a Liberal-National Party. Senator Hanson came from the Liberal Party. Senator Hanson should go back to where she came from; she should join the Liberal Party. She could be a minister in the Liberal Party. That's how poor the talent is in the Liberal Party: she could be a minister—maybe some time in the future. 


But what we need is a Labor government who looks after the public in this country, who wants kids to get a decent education, who wants people who are ill to get health care and who wants to make sure that workers can bargain and not have their wages stagnate. These are the issues that are important in this country. We must not allow the extremists like Senator Hanson and those that are trying to pull down—well, those who have pulled down this government, because this government's gone. This government's gone. We must go to an election and we must get a decent, stable government in this country, and that can only be with the Labor Party.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:44):  As mover and replier I'll make very few points. A number of crossbench senators made the statement that the people elected the government, and they used that as an explanation of why they don't wish to support the no-confidence motion. I say this to them: yes, the people elected this government, but that does not provide an unfettered right. That does not provide an unqualified right. It provides a responsibility. It gives a responsibility. What we have seen this week, what all of us have observed, is a party and a government that have walked away from that responsibility—a party and a government that have no regard for the heavy, weighty, and honourable responsibility that is conferred after winning an election. What we know is that their hatred for each other is greater than their love for this country. What we know this week is that enmity has triumphed over responsibility. The reality is that Australians have no confidence in this government, and neither should this parliament.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion moved by Senator Wong be agreed to.

Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (15:52):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Education and Training (Senator Birmingham) and the Minister for Indigenous Affairs (Senator Scullion) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.


Let me say from the outset: the members opposite were unable to explain to this Senate how many ministers there are in the—is it the Turnbull government? Just tell us. That's what you're there for. You're there to take questions on notice, to stand and defend what is meant to be the government of this country, to be able to say to this Senate that you know the answer to that question. And then we heard the Minister for Indigenous Affairs go through a rollcall of what was important about the coalition relationship, when even he could not even say who the Nationals would support, in terms of a Prime Minister for this country. The minister, Nigel Scullion, could not stand up and support the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull. The Nationals say they won't enter into the debate. We heard that in the minister's reply this afternoon—a reply that got shut down so many times, in fact, that we didn't really know where he was going most of the time.


It's also interesting to note that these events in Canberra are bringing back memories for many in the Northern Territory about the infamous midnight coup—the coup that wasn't—against then Chief Minister Adam Giles. Let me remind you of those events in February 2015. It was also a government in crisis, a government of rich conservative incompetents, a government whose self-interest and infighting failed the people of the Northern Territory and ultimately led to the near annihilation of the CLP. There are lessons to be learned about democracy in this country. To have the House adjourn, closed to the people of this country, is an absolute disgrace. To have democracy in this country mocked to the extent that the opportunity to question and debate is denied to the members of the other house—and, even more importantly, the Australian people—is an absolute disgrace. Australians have been affected this week; Australians expected pieces of legislation to be debated. We are talking about important bills in here, like one about the cashless debit card or one about CDP. There are 30,000 CDP participants who are wondering what is happening with their future and the breaches that are taking place. These issues matter.


But other events were taking place across the country. This week at the Lakemba Mosque in Sydney there was a gathering attended by some 30,000 Muslims. But the parliament and the people of Australia wouldn't know it, because it wasn't talked about. Many braved the cold winter morning to conduct a special rain prayer for the worst affected areas in this country. Prayers were conducted throughout the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. While instability, self-interest, self-indulgent conversations and backbiting were taking place here, Australians out there were reaching out to fellow Australians, to our farmers, to the regions of Australia suffering through drought. But you wouldn't know that huge story was taking place, because there was too much focus on what was going on in here—or, in fact, not going on in here: leading this country, governing, being responsible as elected members representing the people of Australia. There were 30,000 Australians Muslims out praying for rain for our suffering farmers, but you wouldn't know it. Compare that story to the one in here. (Time expired)

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2018-08-23,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (15:58):  I too rise to take note of what was discussed at question time today. First of all, yesterday here in this place I said I was deeply saddened and distressed by what had happened over the last 24 hours—now 48 hours—in my own party. I'm even more greatly distressed and disturbed by what has happened in my own party since I spoke in the chamber yesterday, particularly last night and this morning. Some of the behaviour I simply do not recognise and I think has no place in my party or in this chamber. Whatever happens over the next 24 hours, I cannot condone or support what has happened to some of my colleagues on this side in this chamber in this place.


The tragedy of the madness that has taken hold of a number of my colleagues is that this has been a very good government. A government is always more than a leader. The leader is only ever the sum of those he or she serves with. I would like to remind this chamber why, together, the executive and all Liberal parliamentarians have been such a good government.


We have cut taxes for 3.3 million small to medium enterprises and delivered tax relief for all working Australians. We have cracked down on multinational tax avoidance. We have delivered record jobs growth. Over one million Australians now have jobs—over 400,000 last year alone. We're getting Australians off welfare. We have the lowest level, for well over two decades I think, of working-age Australians on welfare. We're returning the budget to surplus a year earlier than we initially said we would do. We've delivered the biggest reforms to child care in this nation's history, which is now benefitting one million Australian families. We've delivered new export trade deals, which are now coming to fruition. We have more people exporting than ever right around the country, which is creating jobs right across the country. We've listed or amended 1,700 medicines on the PBS. We've guaranteed Medicare, with record funding and record GP bulk-billing rates of 86.1 per cent. Something I'm particularly proud of is that we are in the process of completely revitalising our Defence Force and the defence industries, with a $90 billion investment in our shipbuilding program alone. Personally, probably the thing I'm most proud of is that we've secured our borders again and no longer are people dying at sea. We have closed over 17 detention centres and we are holding secure our borders. We've delivered important workplace reforms to stop the corrupting payments between big businesses and unions. We are fully funding the NDIS and we are doing so many more things for this country.


I say to everybody in this place and to anybody who may be listening: I do not recognise my party at the moment. I do not recognise the values. I do not recognise the bullying and intimidation that has gone on. I hope that, whatever happens after midday tomorrow, we can find a way to get back together again, because it is not just the leader, the Prime Minister, but all of us in the team who have been such a successful government. We have delivered for this country and up until now we have been a united and very effective party.


In conclusion, whatever happens tomorrow, this is a sad day for my party and for our nation. I just hope that, whatever happens tomorrow, the behaviours we have seen and the bullying and intimidation, which I do not recognise as Liberal in any way, shape or form, are brought to account and we can find a better way, all of us in this chamber, to deal with each other, and, most importantly, to represent the people of Australia, because that is what we are here to do. We are not here to squabble with each other. We are here to serve the people of Australia. I feel ashamed that we are letting our nation down.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2018-08-23,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (16:03):  I have to be really clear here: it is a wonderful opportunity to attack this dysfunctional and embarrassing government that we have. But I'm not going to. I'll tell you why I'm not going to. There are a few things I want to say that I want the people of Australia to hear and really understand. There are some very good people on that side of the chamber—people whom I have a close relationship with but would never agree with on most things in politics—who are hurting, and hurting badly. For the other side—and I know, because I've read this book, seen this movie and lived this—this is a shocking time. The worst part about this for the other side, with the greatest respect, is that they will not recover from this, because there is so much hatred and backstabbing and sniping going on.


I want to spend just one minute—I really don't want to waste oxygen on this, but unfortunately I have to—on that appalling contribution from Senator Hanson, while our farmers are out there doing it darn tough. I know, because for 13 years I have been on the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee and for over 10 years I have chaired the committee, and I have worked with some of the best that the other side of parliament can put up, and some of the best on this side. Richard, my old mate from Tassie—I'm saying it as it is, fair dinkum—you are fair dinkum about farming people, as are Senators Williams and O'Sullivan, from the other side, and former senator Bill Heffernan. How can Senator Hanson slap the Labor Party and bring farmers into it? In her two years in this chamber, she has never once attended one single hearing of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee. She has never come to any of our regular meetings at 8 am on Wednesday mornings. She has never attended hearings of the references and legislation committees to contribute anything worthwhile on how she could help our farmers, whether they're battling through drought, through poor prices or through biosecurity issues. What a disgraceful episode from that senator! I don't wish to even mention her name in the time I have left or, in fact, in the rest of the time I'm here in the Senate, hopefully.


But let's go back to where we are at this stage. The saddest part here—I hate to say this there—is that there is not unity. A government was elected. A government was thrown out, and in came another government. I said to a few of my Nat and Liberal mates—and I will not mention who they are—up in Roma one day back in January 2015: 'My goodness me! The sniping has started on your Prime Minister. Didn't you see what it did to the Labor Party when we went through that shocking period?'


There are marginal seat holders out there, and I'd like to see the marginal seat holders lose their positions to Labor people through an election. Make no mistake about that. That's what we do. But we've seen how hardworking backbenchers who put their lives on hold for three years are treated the way they're treated, usually by ex-ministers—I don't have to mention the names of Mr Abbott and others—who are normally in safe seats or holding the No. 1 position on the Senate ticket and still have another four years to go. They spend two or three years undermining their mates.


So I have a different tack there. I say it from the heart: the best thing we can do, the best thing that can come out of this—unfortunately for some of the really good people on the other side—is an election. The Australian people do not deserve this. This is so embarrassing, and it's humbling to hear Senator Reynolds's contribution, because, Senator Reynolds, I know how you and a lot of your mates feel. The best thing that can be done now by whoever leads the dysfunctional coalition government in the next 24 hours or so is to call an election. That is the most humane thing they can do and the most decent thing they can do, because it will not be resolved. This will not be patched. There are friendships that will be destroyed for life. There is no going back. We've seen it and heard it, and it's personal. That is the best thing that can be done by the leader, the incoming Prime Minister, who will not have the full support of the party room. There'll be a lot of speeches, because those poor buggers over there will have to make those speeches to try to get the unity back. But they are going to have to do the decent thing: get in the Comcar, head to Yarralumla, approach the Governor-General, call an election and let the Australian people decide. This has been 10 years. I didn't think it could get worse after 2010. My God, it has!

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2018-08-23,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (16:08):  It is difficult to follow two speeches such as we've just heard in the chamber about the circumstances that we're in, and it's pretty clear to anyone that this is not the finest hour of the government. It is a very difficult time, and I know Senator Sterle feels that from the heart, because he lived that for six years between 2007 and 2013. It is difficult, but it has to be resolved. But just racing off to an election isn't the solution to where we sit today. Getting over what's occurred this week is going to take some effort. It's going to take a lot of hard work and a lot of goodwill by members on our side. If you look at the way that the Labor Party are operating at the moment, they've obviously had to deal with some significant internal issues post 2013, and we're going to have to do the same.


What the Australian people have been telling me this week—and I've said this a number of times publicly—is that they just want us to focus on them. We have to get past this, we have to deal with the issues that we're dealing with at the moment, but they clearly want us to focus on them. Quite frankly, I don't believe they want another election, certainly not on my patch, because we just had one. The Labor Party and the coalition went head-to-head and we fought a nil-all draw, effectively. I think 88 votes moved after that long, 11-week campaign. I don't think the Australian people want another election. They want us to get back to focusing on them and governing for them. I'm proud to say that this government, despite what we've seen this week, has a very good record in that space. It really does. We have achieved things that governments for two decades haven't been able to achieve, and through some of the ministers in this chamber. For example, the media reform that was passed by this parliament has eluded governments of all persuasions for 20 years. It's a credit to Senator Fifield that he was able to negotiate with the industry something that they could all support and that could then be passed through this parliament. So this is a government of achievement.


We were told that we wouldn't be able to do those things. We were told that the crossbenchers would be too difficult to deal with, that we wouldn't be able to get our legislation through this parliament. But we have. We've legislated for tax cuts for individuals, and we're proud of that. We've legislated for tax cuts for small business. We've also legislated for tax cuts for businesses with turnover up to $50 million. We know that if the other side are successful at the next election they will put taxes back up. We've legislated for tax to come down to 25 per cent for businesses with turnover up to $50 million. The Labor Party's policy, even though it's masked in tricky language, is to put that tax rate back up to 27½ per cent. So Australians know, and Australian business knows, that under the Labor Party they will pay more tax.


I can tell you that the nans and pops in my neck of the woods know that they could lose up to 30 per cent of their income, their total income, through the Labor Party's nan and pop tax proposal. They're going to use that money to pay for tax cuts for everyone else, but I don't know anybody who wants their nan and pop to lose up to 30 per cent of their income so that they can get a tax cut. And Labor are going to raise billions of dollars through that measure. They don't understand that somebody will lose up to 30 per cent of their income just so that someone else can get a tax cut. It's an outrageous policy. Even on our worst day—and, let's be fair, this hasn't been a cracker for us—I think we're better than the other side. So we will work our way through this and we will provide the opportunity for the Australian people to vote for us at the next election.

Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (16:13):  We just saw a bit of a Monty Python skit from those opposite with that performance. The reality of what we've seen today, in question time here and in question time being cancelled in the other place, is that this government is illegitimate. That's what was proved in question time today and that's why they cancelled question time in the House of Representatives. They know that the Australian people know the gig is up. We saw in question time how illegitimate they are. We've seen it through the course of this week in their actions in undermining the elected Prime Minister, and we'll see it in the way things are going to end tomorrow. The reality is that the Liberal Party have proved themselves incapable of being a party of government. No matter the personality issue or the policy issue, they are divided on every single one of them. On every significant policy issue that is of concern to the Australian people, the Liberal Party are divided. There is no leader within the Liberal Party who is actually capable of uniting their team and coming up with policy solutions for the Australian people.


One of the first things that was drummed into me when I first got involved in politics was that if you can't govern yourselves you can't govern your country. That is the Liberal Party this week: they can't govern themselves; they can't govern the country. On every policy issue, they are divided. No matter who becomes the leader after 12 noon tomorrow, they are hopelessly divided. Be it personality or be it policy, this is the Liberal Party in 2018.


What we saw from the slapstick performance from the Leader of the Government in the Senate today was that he could not tell the parliament which ministers had resigned. This is extraordinary: the Leader of the Government in the Senate could not tell the parliament which ministers had resigned. When we look at that, these are the ministers who have resigned; these are the portfolios: Finance, Health, Trade, Jobs, Communications, Human Services, Law Enforcement, and Multicultural Affairs, and we have an acting home affairs minister—not insignificant portfolios. The Leader of the Government in the Senate stood in this chamber today and could not tell us whether there were actual ministers for those portfolios. That's what he said. He came in and said, 'We've got people representing them as senators.' But do we have actual ministers for those portfolios?


They lost all pretence of being a government that actually represents the Australian people. They have been completely consumed by their internal differences, by their personality clashes and by their policy differences. They have given up any pretence that they are actually governing for the Australian people. When it comes to policy dysfunction, that's been on display throughout the course of the last couple of weeks. We know what happened with the National Energy Guarantee. For 12 months they were working on a policy that was solely focused not for the Australian people, not for Australian workers, not for Australian businesses but on getting an energy policy through their backbench, and they still couldn't achieve that after working on it for 12 months. They finally got defeated in relation to the corporate tax—the money they were going to hand out to big banks and big business. They finally lost.


So we end this week basically without a Prime Minister. We know there'll be a contest within the Liberal Party. But we also end this week as a country with no direction from this government. They don't actually have an energy policy at the moment; they can't tell us what it is. They don't actually have an economic plan; they can't tell us what it is. Think about those Australian people who are out there observing this today, and this is the government that is supposed to be representing their interests. For those people who can't afford to pay higher power bills because of the inaction of this government—and the government had five years to do something about that—the government has abandoned them. For those people out there looking for work and looking for a job, the government has abandoned them. For those people who live in regional areas and are concerned about funding the future of their kids through school, the government has abandoned them. On any significant policy area that matters to the Australian people, this government today has abandoned them. The only solution that is available to them, no matter who wins tomorrow, no matter who we end up with as leader—and with each hour that goes past there are more and more people putting their names forward—is to go and call an election. That is the only way this can be solved. The Liberal Party of Australia this week have proven themselves incapable of governing. They can't govern themselves and they absolutely can't govern the country.

I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speeches read as follows—



CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (PACIFIC AGREEMENT ON CLOSER ECONOMIC RELATIONS PLUS IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 2018


The Customs Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018 amends the Customs Act1901 to implement Australia's obligations under Chapter 3 of the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus (PACER Plus).


Australia and the Pacific island countries are longstanding partners, with common interests in economic progress and regional stability. Our partners in the region range from countries richly endowed with people and resources to small atolls with geographically isolated populations. 


PACER Plus reflects this diversity, as a comprehensive free trade agreement tailored to help Pacific island countries address their specific development challenges and better participate in global trade.


The Turnbull Coalition Government has the most ambitious trade agenda in Australia's history. PACER Plus, a unique trade agreement to drive economic prosperity and raise living standards in our region, will complement our trade agreements already in force which are delivering record export growth and creating more local jobs.


Creating more opportunities for Australian businesses in global markets is at the core of this government's economic plan. 


PACER Plus has been signed so far by Australia, the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. In addition to covering trade in goods and services, investment and movement of natural persons, PACER Plus also has a regional development focus.


As set out in Australia's 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper, the stability and economic progress of the Pacific island countries are of fundamental importance to Australia. Pacific island countries face a range of economic challenges which impact upon their development. These challenges include small markets, narrow production bases and high costs of business and trade. PACER Plus will better enable Pacific island countries to meet these challenges.


Implementing PACER Plus will create new trade rules that will mark a significant improvement on the trade rules that have been in place since the 1980s. 


This will improve the ability of exporters from the Pacific island countries that are Party to the Agreement to access both the Australian and New Zealand markets, which will in turn encourage development of export industries and job creation.


Implementing PACER Plus will also create opportunities for Australian businesses in a range of sectors. Over time the benefits of greater openness and transparency are expected to strengthen these opportunities.


The amendments to the Customs Act1901 contained in this Bill will implement the provisions of Chapter 3 of PACER Plus. Chapter 3 sets out rules of origin criteria and related documentary requirements for claiming preferential tariff entry for goods imported from Pacific island countries that accede to PACER Plus.


Under PACER Plus, preferential tariff treatment is available based on declarations regarding the origin of goods based on information provided by the importer, exporter, producer or their authorised representative. This will reduce the amount of red tape for importers of goods originating in Pacific island countries.


The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, under the chairmanship of the Member for Fadden, has finalised its report on the PACER Plus, recommending binding treaty action.


In recognition of our ongoing commitment to the development of Pacific island countries and the benefits to Australian businesses, we are introducing the implementing legislation at this time.


CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT (PACIFIC AGREEMENT ON CLOSER ECONOMIC RELATIONS PLUS IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 2018


The Customs Tariff Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018 is the second bill required to implement the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus (PACER Plus). This Bill contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act1995.


Under PACER Plus, Australia has committed to providing a 'Free' rate of customs duty for all eligible goods from the date the Agreement enters into force.


This Bill implements this commitment by ensuring that only those goods that are subject to an excise‑equivalent customs duty are specified in the new schedule of preferential customs duty rates. This is to ensure that these goods are treated consistently with equivalent goods produced in Australia.


The Bill also amends several items in Schedule 4, to ensure that the scope of these concessional items are maintained.


The amendments contained in this Bill complement the amendments to be made to the Customs Act1901 by the Customs Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018, which implements the agreement's rules of origin and related documentary requirements for claiming preferential tariff entry for goods imported from PACER Plus Parties other than New Zealand.


The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, under the chairmanship of the Member for Fadden, has finalised its report on PACER Plus, recommending binding treaty action.


In recognition of our ongoing commitment to the Pacific island countries and the benefits to Australian businesses, we are introducing the implementing legislation at this time.


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of the bills be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (16:25):  At the request of Senator Collins, I move:


That the Senate:


(a) notes Government policy inaction is driving up electricity prices, and abandoning the National Energy Guarantee, as the Government has done this week, is only the latest in a long line of government failure to deliver national energy policy;


(b) observes that the Government refuses to act, citing any and all excuse to delay, when everyone knows it is internal Coalition division and the weakness of the Prime Minister that are really to blame; and


(c) recognises that Australians deserve real leadership on energy, and it is clearer every day that they will not get it from this Coalition Government.


This motion is about energy policy in Australia, and what we've seen this week is disgraceful behaviour by a government which was elected by Australians to provide stable government and to provide Australians with hope. What we've seen over the last couple of weeks is nothing but disarray and rabble, and now we don't really even know who the Prime Minister is. At the heart of this is disagreement, as best we know, around energy policy. 


It was absolutely disgraceful to see what happened in our parliament today. We had the House of Representatives, the house of government, shut down by a Prime Minister so desperate to hold on to his own job, so desperate to not have a vote moved against him and so desperate to avoid questions from the opposition at question time. We saw democracy in the House of Representatives shut down today by a government too scared of the opposition and too scared of itself and by a Prime Minister so desperate that he put his own interests above the interests of Australians, who, in good faith, elected him and others in here to be leaders. I'm not even sure what the count is: Is it seven ministers who've resigned? Is it eight? Who knows how many ministers have resigned. Question time in here was a debacle. I think we had three government ministers left, and they had to rely on their junior partners to help them out at question time. Every Australian will be absolutely disgusted with the way this government has behaved in their name. And for what? Because they couldn't get themselves to agree on energy policy. 


What we are now seeing is that this Liberal Party is not the Liberal Party of Mr Menzies, who sought to govern for the middle centre of Australians; it's a Liberal Party in which a small minority of their backbenchers have absolutely pulled to the extreme Right. We see them cuddling up to people like Senator Hanson over and over again. We hear very little of the voice of moderation, which is still in the Liberal Party—it's pretty quiet at the moment, but it's still there. They've allowed themselves be to taken over by these far Right Tea Party supporters. We've seen that over and over again, firstly under Prime Minister Abbott and now under Prime Minister—well, is he the Prime Minister? who knows—Turnbull. 


Mr Turnbull himself has abandoned all the things he stood for. He once said he would cross the floor over energy policy. Where's that Mr Turnbull gone? Who is the real Mr Turnbull? I don't know and I'm sure Australian voters have no idea as well. He was absolutely committed to good energy policy in this country, and today, Thursday of the second sitting week, we don't have an energy policy anymore. We have nothing. Mr Turnbull, who may or may not be the Australian Prime Minister, as I speak, has abandoned all pretext of a genuine commitment to solving Australia's energy crisis. We do hear the government go on and on about energy prices, and yet when they absolutely had the opportunity to do something about energy prices, not only did they squib it but they wrecked themselves as a government. They have left this country with a government that simply is not there anymore. Eight ministers resigned. We have a Prime Minister who is absolutely under threat and who said in the media today that if there's a spill he won't run. We've got a government that is so inwardly focused that it's just ignoring what it should be doing—that is, providing good and stable government not only to those Australians who voted for the coalition but to all Australians. We've seen them absolutely abandon that today, in particular by shutting down the House of Representatives—simply closing up the shop.


It comes down to the fact that Mr Turnbull and others in his government are not focused on energy prices. They couldn't care less, really, about energy prices, because, despite them talking the talk, they have not been able to walk the walk. They are desperately clinging on to their jobs—in particular Mr Turnbull, who is maybe still the Prime Minister; who knows?—rather than focussing on the future prosperity of Australians. It is a disgrace, and they will be held accountable because Australia has a solid democracy—despite what we have seen here today: a conservative government shutting down the House of Representatives. They will be finished at the ballot box, as they should be. 


At every step of the way, Labor has been willing to work with the government to produce a genuine solution to the energy crisis. We have sucked up some pretty unpalatable proposals from those opposite. Those proposals wouldn't be what we would put in place if we were in government, but, in order to provide relief to Australians, we have been genuinely committed to trying to find a solution. Earlier this week, what did we see Mr Turnbull do? He tried to somehow say it was Labor's fault. He could not get all of his cabinet and members to vote on the energy policy, so he somehow said it was our fault. I don't know how Mr Turnbull—I'm sure he can count; he's certainly been counting this week in the party room—thought that if you delivered some of your government members and the others crossed the floor to join the Labor members that equalled a majority. That doesn't equal a majority. I think Mr Turnbull knows that, but nevertheless, there he was out in the media earlier in the week somehow trying to make it our responsibility. 


I have heard Mr Mark Butler, our opposition environment and energy spokesperson, say over and over again that Labor is ready and willing to work with the government. We were willing to negotiate on an emissions intensity scheme. We didn't like it, but we were willing to negotiate on it. We saw another failed Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, kill that off. Wherever we go in this murky, swirling mess of a former government, Mr Abbott seems to be at the heart of all of the issues. 


We were willing to work on chief scientist Dr Alan Finkel's clean energy target. How those opposite agonised over that! We had the report. We kept waiting, waiting, waiting and waiting, while, again, presumably, Mr Abbott, another failed Prime Minister, and others tore that apart page by page, shred by shred until it just disappeared up in smoke. Meanwhile, out in voter land, Australians that I talk to and voters that I speak to in the seat of Pearce, held by, for the moment, Mr Christian Porter, tell me that energy prices are a problem. Yet Mr Porter, a cabinet member, has just turned his back on those voters in Pearce. He's not willing to look after them at all. You'd think he would, because he doesn't hold the seat by too many votes. That margin is 3.6 per cent. That's all it's going take to change that seat to Labor—3.6 per cent—and he's turned his back on the voters in the seat of Pearce because he, too, is interested in his own job. I'm not sure who Mr Porter backed. We hear he initially backed Mr Turnbull, but I suspect that he, as a person with ambition, has gone somewhere else now. 


But now we have any number of candidates for Prime Minister. I thought they could count over there. The more candidates you have in the ring, the more you split the vote. I'm sure the bean counters on the other side would know that. Ms Bishop, I understand, has put her name up. Mr Dutton has put his name up, although allegedly there's a question over his eligibility to even be in this place. And there is Mr Morrison. So, at this point we have three people who want to be the Prime Minister. I'm not sure whether Mr Turnbull wants to be the Prime Minister. He said today in the media that he wants to be the Prime Minister only if there's no spill against him. So, I don't know: have you got three candidates? Have you got four candidates? What on earth is going on? We don't know, because the House of Representatives was shut down today by the government.


This is all because they couldn't reach agreement on an energy policy. I mean, how hard is that? We've heard Mr Turnbull talk about stable government. Well, from the day he took up occupation in the Lodge, I've not seen stable government. I can't even remember now—I think it was Mr Abbott, or maybe Mr Turnbull—but one of them said, 'Good government starts tomorrow.' Well, we've never seen good government from those opposite, because there are people within the Turnbull government seeking to wreck it, to pull it apart, because somehow they don't want Australians to have cheaper power.


We were willing to work with Mr Turnbull on the NEG—the NEG's been egged, as I say—the National Energy Guarantee. But, under pressure from those in the coalition party room who oppose renewables, and without even talking to Labor—even though Mr Turnbull has said over and over again, 'We need Labor on this'—Mr Turnbull decided to abandon that policy, to just junk it. It was there one minute, gone the next. We saw it start to unravel before the cabinet dinner last Sunday. It's a policy that just a few days ago he said was 'essential' to solving the energy crisis. How can we believe anything that's said? In Mr Turnbull we have a Prime Minister—maybe we do, maybe we don't—who earlier said that the NEG was essential to solving the energy crisis. Yet I think by Tuesday or Wednesday—I can't remember when it was, now—it was junked, off the table. 


You can't go from 'essential' one day to junked the next day. Where's the truth in that? Did he think it wasn't essential? That's what voters would conclude—that Mr Turnbull's heart was not in the National Energy Guarantee—because you cannot go from saying, 'This is essential' to junking it. The only way you do that is if somewhere in the middle of it your job becomes more important than the jobs, the livelihoods and the wellbeing of Australians. That's the only way you can move from a policy you described as 'essential' to junking it because at some point you say: 'Uh-oh: the backbenchers, led by Mr Abbott and others, are ganging up on me; they're threatening to cross the floor. I'd better toss this policy aside, because I'm really only interested in being the Prime Minister of this country.' There is no other conclusion that you can draw. That's the only way you get from 'essential' to a junked policy: because the self-interest of Mr Turnbull took over, and he decided that he was way more important than every other Australian voter and that he had to keep his job.


I've heard the pleas of business groups, of industry and experts. They've all been really clear: renewable energy is our future. Renewable energy is the only way forward for Australia's energy system. Renewable energy is the cheapest form of new energy. It will create thousands of jobs, and it will drive down pollution. And there's a very stark choice now for Australian voters. The only way we are going to get to a decent energy future is under a Labor government, because the Turnbull government has shown itself to be completely unable to deliver any energy policy—we've seen them junked and junked and junked. The only way to that future now is through Labor, because we have been consistent, despite the criticism we've copped from those opposite about renewables. Remember the photos in the paper—one question time, it was, in the House of Representatives—of Mr Morrison and others, passing a lump of coal to one another like it was a gift: 'This is our future. Coal is our future.' Remember that? I think it was Senator Cormann who said, 'Coal is good.' These people have no idea about renewable energy.


Just a day or two ago, I heard some of those who have forced Mr Turnbull into this position—where he has put his job as Prime Minister above the interests of all Australians—talking about wanting coal-fired power stations. They wanted Hazelwood brought back. This is not a government who's looking to the future. Well, it's not even a government; you're not a government if you close down the House of Representatives and deny democracy by denying the opposition the opportunity to ask questions at question time. That's not a government. That's just a desperate action by those who want to keep their jobs. 


We know that, under Mr Turnbull, the NEG's 26 per cent emissions target was already inadequate to fix this energy crisis. I saw the Leader of The Nationals on Sky TV trying to explain the NEG, trying to explain the 26 per cent, saying it was adequate and we would meet our Paris targets. It was like a Clark & Dawe sketch, actually. It must have been humiliating for him, because he wasn't on his game. He didn't know what was going on. He did not understand the policy. Yet it's his party, The Nationals, who are also heaping on pressure about coal-fired power stations as part of our future. It's also the Nats. But their own leader was unable to really explain what it all meant. He just looked like he was in a Clark & Dawe sketch.


Labor's plan to transition Australia has a target of 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030 at its core. Those opposite have criticised us for that, but we have stood by it and stood by it and stood by it. So the only energy policy there is at the moment is the one that Labor has had for quite a number of years. We believe that it will drive investment in renewable energy, including in firming technologies like batteries and pumped hydro. We believe it will create 30,000 new renewable energy jobs. We believe it will put downward pressure on power prices for households and businesses. We believe—we know—it will deliver real action to tackle climate change. 


Labor have tried over and over again to work with the government. But now we don't really have a government; we have a collection of individuals in disarray. But it is very clear that Mr Turnbull, if he is still Prime Minister as I speak, can't provide leadership because he is more interested in keeping his job today than in putting the interests of Australians facing high energy costs before his own interests. The choice is very clear. Labor is for renewables and lower prices, and the Liberals are for more coal and higher prices. Even that statement no longer really rings true, because we don't really have a government anymore. We have had a mass resignation of ministers. We have a cobbled-together group in the Senate. I do hope they're getting higher duties allowances, because they have massive workloads all divided up between them. All of them are there doing all of the work of the government in the Senate, just the three or four of them. Clearly, we have no government. We certainly are not clear on who the Prime Minister is. It is time to face the Australian electors through the ballot box to put to bed this unending spectacle of not being able to deliver an energy policy. Only Labor will drive down costs, and only Labor has renewables in mind. It's only Labor who has a plan.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-08-23,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (16:45):  It gives me great pleasure to stand here today to put on the record the very strong energy policy of this government. I acknowledge the kind words of the senator opposite about the work that has been done by those on this side today. We appreciate her kind words. Unfortunately, when it comes to energy policy, I come from the state of South Australia, and there is no state in Australia that has experienced the impact of reckless renewable policy, such as not considering renewable policy in terms of its transition, like South Australia.


I don't think there's anybody who has a problem with moving to a clean energy future. There are many, many wonderful innovations that have taken place in the Australian marketplace over recent years through an absolute, committed desire for us to have a clean energy future. Like when you want to change any substantial policy—such as going from one where we've been almost entirely reliant on fossil fuels for many, many years into a renewable energy future—there is a transition that needs to take place. Part of that transition sometimes is going to require certain mechanisms in the marketplace that will enable that transition to take place without having significant consequences and impacts on the people who rely every day on power.


The fundamental bottom line here has been that our hell-bent pursuit of renewables, without actually taking into consideration the need for dispatchability, saw South Australia suffer the inevitable consequences of this reckless ideology over the past couple of years. I suppose the only saving grace when our major blackout occurred in South Australia was that it didn't occur either in the absolute coldest days of winter or in the height of summer. It actually happened in September, so some small grace or intervention of God probably prevented what was a very, very serious issue and event in South Australia from being a whole heap worse than it actually was.


Some of our communities in South Australia were without power for four days. When you consider not just the economic impact but the inconvenience of that, we dodged an extraordinary bullet in terms of the energy services and the human impact. That could have been quite serious had we had an accident, because our telecommunications towers were down. We had no way of being able to communicate with an ambulance that was required to go out to an incident or to somebody who was in a serious or critical condition. We had no way of being able to communicate, because we rely so heavily on mobile phones these days, particularly in rural and regional areas. We were very, very lucky to have escaped, by the skin of our teeth, from something that could have been much, much worse than it was.


The absolute pursuit of an ideological renewable policy, without thinking about the transition and the necessity of storage and dispatchability through the transition process, has seen a number of things occur. Obviously, as I said, there is the reliability of the generation of the power that we have seen in South Australia. The fact is that, because we now have more than 50 per cent of our energy generated in South Australia through renewables, during very hot or high-demand periods, if the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing, we find ourselves in South Australia with no power. This is unacceptable in the 21st century in a First World country.


Only a few years ago, Australia would brag that we had entirely reliable power. You didn't have to have three gin and tonics before you opened your power bill. I have to say, these days, when the envelope turns up with the little blue square in the corner that says 'AGL', it puts the fear of God into most of us, because when you open that bill you know it's going to have an impact. I'm one of the lucky people in that I have a salary that allows me to be able to pay those bills, but there are a lot of people in our community who can't. What we have as a result of the recklessness of this pursuit of renewables without considering how we are going to get there is a community in Australia, particularly in my home state of South Australia, who can no longer rely on affordability and reliability of power. 


I like to think the power market or the power situation in Australia is a bit like a tripod. You've got three legs: you've got the leg of affordability, you've got the leg of reliability, and, I will admit and concede, we have an international obligation to make sure that we look after the planet into the future and leave it in at least as good a condition as we found it for the next generation and those that follow. But you can't have one leg without the others, because, for all of us who have ever seen a tripod with one of its legs cut off, you can be absolutely guaranteed it will fall over. That's exactly what we saw in South Australia. We saw a tripod that was completely reliant on standing on the leg of meeting some renewable energy target without considering the two other legs of affordability and reliability of power. 


We've now ended up in a situation in Australia where the people of Australia have become so impacted by the price and the cost of their energy that they are no longer focusing on the ideological pursuit of renewables; they're looking at being able to afford to pay their power bills. For this reason it is absolutely essential that we, as a government, focus on reducing people's power bills. I have heard the contributions from those opposite who, for some reason, seem to think that an increase in the amount of renewables is somehow going to decrease the price of power. I'm not quite sure which scientist you got to give you that piece of information, given that so far the pursuit of renewables has seen nothing but increases in the price of power. One would suggest that any move to increase the renewable energy targets in this country, based on absolutely empirical evidence and experience, would see the price of power go up. What we need to do is put a circuit breaker—pardon the pun—into energy policy. We have to focus on the people who are being impacted by higher prices for their energy. 


The Turnbull government have put a series of measures in place. We saw this government intervene in the gas market to make sure that there was sufficient gas available in the Australian market so that we would see a reduction in the price of energy, and that's exactly what happened. We're already starting to see a slight decrease in people's energy prices in Australia. But, equally, we had to look at a suite of other measures. There was a report from the ACCC, and they put forward a series of recommendations. It is a matter of public record that we were unable to get the full support of all of those on this side, in the coalition government, but equally, despite the fact that we had an energy policy that was going to deliver, we never at any time received support from the opposition to get the energy policy through and address all of the matters that were before us in terms of reliability and affordability, and working towards delivering an energy policy that would see our responsibility, in terms of emissions, being achieved.


I'd also like to put on the record that, whilst Australia has, over a very long time, had a very responsible approach towards energy policy, we are, to a large extent, a bit player in this market. So there has to be some support for the argument that we probably should be putting a bit of a break, perhaps, on our ideological pursuit of a renewable energy future, when the rest of the carbon emitting world is not pursuing that. We cannot drive Australia out of the world market by driving up energy prices to such an extent that we become totally and utterly overexposed in energy and non-competitive in the global marketplace.


We already saw those opposite throw out our corporate tax cuts that were going to allow our companies with over $50 million in turnover to be globally competitive. It is quite ironical that there seems to be a complete disconnect in the minds of those opposite when they come up with policy. They say that the fact that a company happens to be big means that it's somehow bad. I have to say bigger companies actually employ people. I don't know too many companies with turnovers over $50 million that don't have a significant workforce, and those people actually have jobs. They have pay packets that are paid by these companies so that they can live the lifestyle that we like to live in Australia. So you should not penalise our large companies and put them at a competitive disadvantage in the global marketplace simply because ideologically you don't want to support something that the government is putting forward.


The hypocrisy and the irony is that so much of the policy that was put forward by the coalition in relation to corporate tax cuts was actually the very same policy position that was espoused by those opposite in previous times. The Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, the shadow Treasurer and so many of those opposite have actually said that the best way to move the economy along, to stimulate the economy, to drive people's wages up and to make sure that there are more jobs available is to reduce the tax burden on our corporate sector so that they will have the money and the incentive to employ more people. But once again we saw that those opposite would rather blow up the bus. The government put through a sensible policy that was going to have a major impact on the Australian economy for the better. Those opposite would rather throw that out.


It is interesting also when you sit down and have a look at some companies in Australia who turn over more than $50 million. It's not just the big banks. There are an awful lot of companies that turn over more than $50 million. Take Qantas for an example. We all know where Qantas started. It started as a company in Longreach a long, long time ago, and look at what it is today. When you look at Qantas, they have 3,000 suppliers that supply them with all sorts of things to get their aircraft in the air and to look after the passengers once they're on board, whether it be the person that provides some of the food, the person who provides the cleaning products or the person who provides some of the maintenance activities. There are so many companies. Three thousand companies support Qantas getting its planes in the air, and those 3,000 businesses are largely small businesses. They're certainly all small and medium sized businesses, and every single one of those will be put at a disadvantage simply because those opposite would rather throw out a good policy than see the coalition government actually be able to deliver for the people of Australia. So once again this really is a case of: shame on you.


In terms of energy policy, we had the opportunity to work together to deliver good energy policy, but it was decided that we were going to have this ideological pursuit at renewables at all costs and that we would put false information out into the marketplace in support of this alternative policy of reducing emissions by 45 per cent and having a 50 per cent renewable energy target. If that is not putting a wrecking ball through our economy, I don't know what is.


We need to sit down as a parliament and decide that we need to pass policies that are in the best interests of the people of Australia. We should put politicking aside because of the people who stand to suffer from us not being able to move forward with sensible policies when it comes to energy, corporate tax cuts, managing the economy and keeping the budget in check. There are so many things that we could do and that the people of Australia elected us to this place to do that we aren't doing. If we sat down and put the people of Australia before our own petty political self-interest, I'm sure that we could make a huge amount of difference.


In concluding my remarks today on energy policy, I say: just spare a thought today for the hundreds and possibly thousands of farmers who have been impacted massively by the drought that is affecting much of Australia. These people have run the country for so many years. The agricultural sector has been the backbone of the Australian economy for so many years. Things come and things go, but the agricultural sector is still there. And we have been very keen in working with our agricultural sector to make sure that they are in the best possible place to be able to provide the economic benefits that they can generate for the rest of Australia. But they are under so much pressure at the moment because of drought and the impact of drought. Don't forget what the impact of their energy bills is on them at a time when they can least afford or cope with it. 


There are so many impacts of bad energy policy that are negative and so many good impacts of good energy policy. I would call on this chamber to not play politics with something as serious as the price and reliability of Australian power. Let's sensibly, systematically and methodically work our way towards being able to deliver a clean energy future that all Australians can afford, a clean energy future that's not going to mean that pensioners are too scared to turn their heating on in winter and that they have to crawl underneath a blanket to keep warm. Let's make sure that we don't expose the weak and vulnerable in our communities, who can't afford to turn their air conditioners on in summer, and make them swelter in their houses and put them at great risk because we don't have energy policy that is primarily focused on reducing the price of power. Let's not be so ideologically obsessed with talking about having to have renewables as the only source of power. Some amazing technologies have been delivered that can use clean coal. You should remain agnostic to the source of your energy. If you want to focus on emissions, that's just fine, but don't then demand that somehow you can also put in place a ruling about where the generation of those emissions is coming from. 


I think the Turnbull coalition government has got a very proud record when it comes to energy policy. Obviously, we would have liked to have seen energy policy passed in recent times so that we could have given certainty and comfort to the millions of Australians who are currently struggling under high energy bills. But, when those opposite come in here and spout the fact that a renewable energy target of 50 per cent is going to reduce energy bills, I'd like to say, 'Show us your evidence,' because, if history is anything to go by, the pursuit of even higher renewable energy targets and even higher emissions targets can only do one thing to the price of power—that is, make it go up.


In conclusion, during the six years of the Labor government, electricity prices doubled. We are doing everything we can possibly do to bring electricity prices down. I call on those opposite to work with us as a government to make sure that we continue to do so for the sake of all Australians.

",Senate,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Energy</title>,MOTIONS,29,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AG,2018-08-23,"



Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (17:03):  The Senate is debating a motion regarding electricity prices and the massive failure of this government to deliver not just on that policy but on any sort of policy when it comes to energy in general. On the government side of things on a day like today, I know somebody's got to roll up and go through the motions. So, to that extent, I have some sympathy for Senator Ruston in having drawn the short straw to try to defend the indefensible when it comes to the government in this week of all weeks. We might have forgotten by the time we got to Thursday, but the week started out with the disintegration of this government's so-called National Energy Guarantee, a policy they'd spent months and months pulling together. They'd had meetings with all the state and territory ministers, tonnes and tonnes of backbench consultation, continual refinements and changes—almost all of them driven by the climate-denying right-wing rump in the coalition that's become much, much larger than a rump in the most recent few days. 


I'd have to say, despite getting the short straw and soldiering bravely on, it's a bit much to hear accusations that, somehow or other, it's this side of the chamber that has a problem with an ideological approach to energy or a problem with politicking, when the ideological warriors and climate change deniers and Turnbull haters in the Liberal-National coalition have just shredded any credibility this government had left when it comes to energy policy. The ideological approach that has infected energy policy in this country, particularly in recent times, has been from those who insist on making energy prices higher by pushing more public money into coal, into fossil fuel, into outdated, last-century technology. I'd be quite happy to deliver a bunch of reports to Senator Ruston about the fact that the expansion of renewable energy clearly will drive down prices in the future. In fact, if you look at the modelling that people have done to try to justify some of the figures around the government's National Energy Guarantee—whichever version of it you want to look at—most of the cost savings you can derive from it are based on the inbuilt savings that were already going to happen because of the further expansion of renewable energy under renewable energy targets in existence around this country at the moment. Let's not forget: it was the Abbott government that basically tried to destroy the Renewable Energy Target completely, purely on ideological grounds. If you want to talk about an ideological and divisive approach to energy, I suggest it is any policy approach that has come from the likes of Tony Abbott—every time, all the time, regardless of the public interest. That is clearly what we've seen from the coalition.


I spoke at some length just yesterday in this place about this government's failures when it comes to energy prices—its failure to deliver any policy, its failure to do anything effective to reduce energy prices and its obvious failure to meet its obligations to reduce greenhouse emissions. Alongside that, I outlined the Greens policies that we've been putting forward for a number of years now, properly costed and independently assessed by the experts, who are saying renewable energy will deliver cheaper power, reduce emissions and deliver jobs. But it's a matter of political will and it's a matter of listening to the science and the economics of it. This government has been the rolled gold standard when it comes to massive failures on energy policy. Let's not forget, it's not just about this government's own internal failure to agree with itself on anything, let alone energy policy, but about the consequences it is having for people in the real world: the significant problems people are having with soaring energy costs, the significant problems small business is having with soaring electricity costs, the huge numbers of people who are having their power cut off because they can't afford to pay their electricity bill. It is a core obligation of government in the modern age to deliver reliable, affordable electricity, and it is something, when it comes to affordability and to emissions, that this government has failed on.


I feel it's necessary to say that lost opportunities when it comes to energy policy are not unique to this government. In fact, what we've seen going right back to the Hawke era, when Labor first embraced the neoliberal approach to economics, has been missed opportunity after missed opportunity to modernise electricity generation and fast-track our shift to a renewable energy future that is affordable and reliable. The Hawke government first talked in the late 1980s of acting to reduce climate emissions, acting to transform our energy generation into the future. But it failed to deliver, repeatedly. Of course, whilst there have been individual policies here and there that have helped somewhat, when you're looking at trying to transform things, rather than changing incremental bits here and there to look like you're moving things forward, all you can look at is an overall failure to deliver, from both Labor and the Liberals. It is impossible not to assume that that is in significant part because of the very large financial contributions the fossil fuel lobby continues to make to both the Labor Party and the Liberal and National parties. Alongside that we've seen a massive disinformation campaign from the fossil fuel lobby worldwide to try to muddy the waters and fund the sceptics and denialists that have basically led to all of those missed opportunities.


There is, of course, a significant exception to that—that is, the world-class carbon-pricing scheme that was adopted under the Gillard government. I give them credit for that, but the obvious point that needs to be made is it took the election of a member of the Australian Greens to the House of Representatives to put political pressure directly on the Labor government of the day and to feed that into the proper and thorough scientifically based, economically sound process that developed that world-class system and all the infrastructure around it. The Renewable Energy Agency still to this day is delivering positive outcomes for jobs, renewable energy expansion and cheaper electricity, particularly in regional areas. As I said in this place yesterday, there was also the problem of the obsession, particularly of the Liberal and National parties but to a significant degree the Labor Party as well at the state level, with privatising significant parts of our electricity sector and corporatising those parts that were still publicly owned.


I spoke yesterday about the massive gouging by energy companies when it comes to electricity bills. People are paying high electricity bills at a time when the retailers, not even the generators, are making massive profits and giving huge bonuses to their executives. This isn't an area where we should have profiteering; this is an area where we should be ensuring an essential service is delivered at the cheapest possible rate in an affordable way that is not going to cause wider flow-on damage to our economy, community, society and environment by failing to address greenhouse emissions at the same time.


These opportunities have been lost year after year, government after government, with the exception of that brief significant achievement during the Gillard era, and some bits like the Renewable Energy Target, which came in under the Howard government, so I'll give some credit there, despite Mr Abbott's attempt to wreck that. He wrecked the very effective carbon pricing regime just as it was about to kick into full swing, but he didn't manage to succeed in wrecking and destroying the Renewable Energy Agency. Ironically, now and then they try to point to some of the achievements of the Renewable Energy Agency and take credit for what it is still managing to achieve, even though it's something this Liberal-National government put every effort into destroying.


But significant components of those achievements, and the significant transformation we had there briefly until the Abbott wreckers moved in, came about when a member of the Australian Greens was elected to the House of Representatives. It's a simple example of the transformative effect you can get by electing more Greens to the House of Representatives and by shifting away from the two—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Labor!




Senator BARTLETT:
  From Labor and from Liberal, Senator Macdonald, the two parties who have failed in this area consistently over many decades. Part of the instability in the current government and the previous Labor government has been because their complete wedding to the neoliberal economic ideology poisoned their approach and meant they put the market before the community, time after time. With essential services you have to put people and the community first. As neoliberalism has become more and more discredited, and as free market fundamentalism has been shown to deliver more and more harm, suffering and inequality in our communities, they have been unable to agree internally on new approaches. We've seen that play out—alongside good, old-fashioned hatreds, which are part of the human condition and are not unique to any part of the political spectrum—and it's a key reason why we've seen such political instability from both of the traditional parties, the parties of the political establishment, over the last 10 years. And that has led to policy failures. 


So, this motion, which I support and acknowledge the validity of, nonetheless does need to be put in the wider context of the wider failure of our entire political system, going back many decades. This is just one example amongst many of how our political system is broken and how it needs transformative change—not just a bit of tinkering at the edges, a new person in the driver's seat or a slight change of management; it needs a complete overhaul. The motion does recognise that Australians deserve real leadership on energy and it is clear, every day, that they will not get it from this coalition government. The big question mark on this, and many other issues, is whether they will get it from a Labor government. The story, time and time again over many decades, is that the Labor Party will say one thing in opposition and do a different thing in government. An extra reason you need more people from other parties in the House of Representatives is to keep them honest. If Labor does get into government, I'd have to say they could not possibly do a worse job than the current mob. I think most Australians would agree with that after today, of all days. But just going from somebody terrible to somebody not quite so terrible is not really good enough, and it's part of the reason Australians are disillusioned with the political system in its entirety. 


We need to make the change as significant and transformative as possible, and part of the commitment and role of the Greens in doing that is to get major change. This motion talks about real leadership on energy. I would like to see that meaning leadership that takes us in a brand-new direction away from the failed neoliberal and market-first approach that we've seen from both Labor and Liberal over many years now. That's the sort of transformation we need, but, as a bottom line, the first clear thing we need is any sort of coherent energy policy at all from a government so that investment and business can have some certainty and those of us who want to push for better policies can have a framework within which to operate—rather than just trying to engage with incoherent chaos, which is all we are seeing from the Liberal-National Party at the moment. 


I don't think anyone holds terribly much hope that we'll see improvement regardless of who ends up in the Prime Minister's seat after tomorrow. Energy policy is just one of the many failings of this government, and its failure is not a political failure on its own; its failure is in how it has failed the community and how it has failed the public—those rising energy costs and the impact they are having on so many people. And there is the inability to recognise the new approach that could be taken, which quite a number of people—plenty of independent people outside the Greens, including a wide range of economists and energy experts—have all put forward. It has to be based on a clean-energy future and it has to be based on government recognising it has a significant role to play—not just trying to leave to it the market or a privatised or corporatised system. This needs to be significantly changed. That's the sort of leadership we need on energy.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2018-08-23,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:18):  Three years ago, the Prime Minister was greeted by laughter when he told the Liberal conference there are no factions in the Liberal party. In some ways, what he said then is true today: there are no longer merely factions; there are factions of subfactions and there is the kind of vicious, internecine conflict that would put the Bolsheviks to shame. I think Australians are genuinely embarrassed about the brawl that is playing out in the open, and they have a right to be angry—angry about the shameless, naked ambition and the disregard for the public that has been shown by many in the Liberals' party room. There has been a lot of drama, and it's exhausting. 


It feels a little bit strange to be having a debate late on Thursday afternoon about energy policy after all that has gone on. But that is exactly what we ought to be talking about and that is exactly what has brought us to this point, because it is climate change that defines the conflict in the Liberal Party and their inability to manage energy policy over the last five years. It is climate change that will continue to drive the coalition's inability to govern, and it is climate change that represents one of the most pressing policy challenges for our nation. Climate change lies at the heart of this whole thing, and that has been apparent for weeks. The government's failure to appreciate the seriousness of the climate change challenge underlies and underpins five years of policy failure in energy. It has been five years of total and absolute failure.


What has happened over the last couple of weeks is that all of that has bubbled to the surface. We can now actually see what has been going on. We can see who has been saying it, we can see who the deniers are and we can see that what they have been determined to do, year after year under Mr Abbott and under Mr Turnbull, is wreck any prospect of a meaningful response to climate change that deals coherently with the energy system. The discussion about the NEG in the coalition party room looks much less like a discussion or a negotiation and basically just looks like extortion. It has been absolutely extraordinary over the last couple of weeks. The member for Capricornia came out and explained to everybody that it was thanks to the rebels that the changes have been made. There was change after change to a policy that the Prime Minister himself had taken into COAG and had sought to negotiate with state premiers. Well, weren't they right? Why would they negotiate with this group of clowns? What a ludicrous failure to be able to deliver anything coherent whatsoever.


What became apparent over the last couple of weeks was that there was absolutely nothing the Prime Minister could do to appease the hard Right. There was nothing he could do. There are a lot of dissenters who actually have been unable to explain in any coherent way to the public what their objection to the current Prime Minister is in relation to energy. It is possible, knowing some of these people, that it's just a failure of comprehension. Most of them certainly seem unacquainted with the basic facts about the cost of new energy supply and the way that that might play out in the energy market over the coming years. The member for Hughes actually had to be corrected this morning on television, during a live interview, about what the coalition's energy policy is—or perhaps it might be better to say was.


You've got to suspect that nothing the Prime Minister could give them would stop them asking for more. He has given the deniers, the hard Right in their party, exactly what they demanded. Under the latest round of policy, there would not be a single new renewable project built for a decade. But it's not enough, is it? It's not enough for Mr Pasin, not enough for Mr Hastie, not enough for Mr Abbott and not enough for Mr Kelly—not enough at all. They don't want someone who has to put his principles aside in order to take no action on climate. They want someone whose principles demand that he take no action on climate change. They want a climate denier in the Lodge, and they will not stop until such a person is there. This is an absolute disgrace. It is an absolute betrayal of the interests of the Australian people.


These people are wreckers. They are ideologues of the worst kind. They are intent on sabotaging this country and its energy system because they insist on seeing climate change as part of the culture wars. They would prefer to fight on climate and battle on rather than deal with the facts and see climate change and energy policy as the serious policy challenge that it is. It is total economic vandalism. History will not look kindly on this government. It will not look kindly on this government and the boosters of this government outside the parliament. Their inability to provide a coherent response to climate change, integrated within energy policy, that will give the energy sector and the investors in that sector the certainty that they require to invest in the energy market is absolutely a dereliction of duty. It should disqualify this crowd from government for a generation.


There is evidence of climate change all around us. In New South Wales, 100 per cent of the state is in drought. We have bushfires raging in the middle of winter. The ice sheet in Greenland is breaking up. The overwhelming scientific consensus is that climate change is happening and that it is caused by mankind. Yet these people refuse to act.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator McALLISTER:
  Here in the chamber this evening, we've got Senator Macdonald, the failed preselection candidate from Queensland, who sits over there calling out over and over again—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Order!




Senator McALLISTER:
  He is calling out his refusal to believe that Australia has any obligations whatsoever in relation to climate change.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator McALLISTER:
  Here he is. He continues to interject, because Senator Macdonald is one of the many people in the coalition party room who prefer not to believe the science. They prefer not to believe that climate change is happening, and they continue to refuse to accept our international obligation to act collectively with every other serious participant in the international system. They refuse to accept that obligation, because they are isolationists of the worst kind. The only possible way that climate change can be dealt with is if every nation takes steps to reduce our emissions and decarbonise our economy. That is the raw logic of international emissions reduction. Those people who sit over there and say that we have no obligations and that it makes no difference are simply wrong. When Australia was a holdout under John Howard, it made a huge difference in the way that the international community considered climate change, and when Australia, under a Labor government, committed to Kyoto and to climate action, it was truly significant. I was at the convention in Bali when that happened, and I can tell you that it made a huge difference in the way that other nations approached this.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator McALLISTER:
  Australia is a non-trivial actor in the international system, Senator Macdonald. You can talk our significance down. You can scoff and mock.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I've given a lot of free rein at this stage today, Senator Macdonald, I have called you quietly to order three times. You have ignored me. I am now asking you to keep your comments to yourself and let Senator McAllister finish her contribution in silence.




Senator McALLISTER:
  Australia's contribution to climate change is significant, and our actions in the international community shape the way that the rest of the community responds to this. We are a middle power with a significant capacity to shape international decision-making. We are not the only decision-makers, but we live in a world where working together to deal with global problems is the only possible path forward. Those who would withdraw into isolationism ought to explain what other alternative mechanism they propose to deal with the consequences of human-driven climate change.


It is a problem that isn't going to go away for the coalition. I know that there are some members on the other side who recognise the necessity to act, but they are cowed into silence during the current debate. I notice that, whenever this issue comes up in this chamber, we don't hear from those members of the coalition who I know understand the significance of climate action. They sit quietly, because it has become socially and politically unacceptable in that crowd to deal with the realities of climate change. This is a huge problem, and the coalition will remain hopelessly riven along these lines. I can't see a situation where the climate deniers change their position. I don't know what the sensible people in that organisation are going to need to do to respond to that, and I don't know when they will respond.


But I can say this: there's no good outcome from the spill tomorrow, if one is indeed to occur. Who do people want? Do you want the Treasurer, who brought a lump of coal into parliament and laughed while he was handing it around; would you prefer the former Minister for Home Affairs, who walked out of the National Apology to the Stolen Generations; would you like the Deputy Prime Minister, who has aided and abetted former Prime Minister Abbott, and indeed Prime Minister Turnbull, through all that they have done; or would you prefer the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, who has sold out everything that he once believed in? The Prime Minister once said that he would never lead a party that didn't care as much about climate change as he did. Well, maybe that's true. The past few months have shown that he doesn't care about climate. He doesn't care about energy. He cares only about power and about himself.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-08-23,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:29):  For those few people who might be listening to this debate late on a Thursday afternoon, what you've just heard is another typical lying Labor speech—a speech that's full of lies and inaccuracies. It's like the motion we're debating, which is in three parts, and the three parts are just lies. The senator who just spoke was inaccurate in just about everything she said. She calls those of us who have a sensible, commonsense view on electricity and on the climate 'deniers', as if a denier is worse than a paedophile. As I have said to her and to anyone else any number of times in this chamber, I am not a denier. I accept that the climate is changing. It always has changed. Once upon a time, the earth was covered in snow. Once upon a time, the centre of Australia was a rainforest. Clearly those two things don't occur these days. So, of course, the climate is changing. It's always been changing. I don't deny that, yet Labor Party and Greens politicians time after time get up in this chamber and accuse me of being a denier, as if that is, as I said, worse than being a paedophile. Well, I am not a denier. I accept that the climate is changing, and I think everyone on this side of the chamber does.


Then the previous speaker said, 'Senator Macdonald doesn't believe the science, doesn't understand the science, won't take the advice of scientists.' Well, I'm sorry for the senator who spoke before: I am relying on science. In fact, I'm relying on Australia's Chief Scientist, who told me at estimates, when I asked him about it, that if you shut Australia down completely it would have 'virtually no impact on the changing climate of the world'. Yet the Labor Party and the Greens continue to run around, continue to lie to young children, continue to try to propagandise all of our young people at schools that Australia is causing climate change. Yet Australia emits less than 1.2 per cent of the world's carbon emissions. If carbon emissions are causing climate change, then what impact would cutting Australia's 1.2 per cent by 26 per cent, which the coalition is doing—or 40 per cent or 50 per cent or whatever it is that the Labor Party wants, or the 80 per cent that the Greens want, or even 100 per cent, which means you'd shut down every building, every factory, every office in Australia, and there'd be no cars; there'd be nothing in Australia—have on the changing climate of the world?


Don't ask me for the answer; ask the Chief Scientist. He will tell you, as he told me in estimates—and it's all there, recorded for everyone to read, and if you can't read you can watch the video exchange I had with the Chief Scientist. What impact would that have on the changing climate of the world? Virtually nothing. Yet the previous speaker from the Labor Party was trying to tell the Senate that I don't listen to science. Well, sorry, but I do. I listen to the Chief Scientist. Clearly she didn't—can I call her 'she', or have I got to call her 'they'? Clearly the previous speaker has not listened to the Chief Scientist, doesn't understand what it's all about, simply goes along with the propaganda and rhetoric that's churned out.


I'm pleased to say that there is some hope for the Labor Party, because, while most of them just follow the propaganda, I see that the CFMMEU have at last tried to bring some sense to the Labor Party when they warn the Queensland government that its ambitious 50 per cent renewable energy target is 'not realistic' and that Labor should instead back new clean coal power stations. That's the CFMMEU—not a union I usually instance in supporting any argument, although I do make the point that, when Michael O'Connor was head of the forestry section of the then CFMEU, he and I worked together against the Labor Party to save the forestry jobs of workers in Tasmania. I'm pleased that Mr O'Connor and his CFMMEU, as it is these days, is at last starting to stand up for mining workers and to realise that the party that the unions support, the Labor Party, doesn't care one iota about workers in the mining industry, about workers in my state of Queensland. I can understand why nobody from Queensland in the Labor Party cares about workers in the mining area, because all of their senators come from Brisbane. They wouldn't know what a mine looked like. They would barely know Central and North Queensland, where the mines are. Occasionally they blow in and out on a one-day trip, but they don't understand what it's all about. That's why they're so out of touch, even now, it seems, with the CFMMEU. 


I read somewhere that I think the AWU is starting to come around to my way of thinking—that emissions from Australia have no impact on the changing climate of the world, again, agreeing with the Chief Scientist, Dr Finkel. They are starting to realise that these are jobs of the workers that the unions are supposedly looking after. I'm pleased to see there is a light starting to burn in the unions, who allegedly look after the workers, and I'm pleased to see that light is starting to show through. It'll take a long time to get through to the thick brains of members of the Labor Party, but at least it's a start. And, because the unions completely control the Labor Party and all of the senators from the Labor Party in this chamber, I'm hopeful about the action and leadership taken by the CFMMEU and I believe the AWU—and I think the ETU is also starting to raise doubts about the policy that the latte set in the Labor Party have been running for the last decade or so. 


I keep asking any Labor Party senator, any Greens senator—no-one will ever answer my question—how anything we do in Australia, which emits 1.2 per cent of the world's carbon emissions, is going to make one iota of difference to the changing climate of the world. Criticise me all you like, but the Chief Scientist agrees with me that, no matter what we do in Australia, it will make not one iota of difference. Senator McAllister was saying, 'When John Howard started this, he started a movement, and every other country in the world stood up and said, ""Australia's doing this, so we'd better do something about it.""' I'm as proud an Australian as anyone, perhaps prouder than anyone else. I'm very, very proud of my country. I think we're a great country. We do wonderful things. Yet, sadly, when we attend international conventions, people struggle to work out whether we're Austria or Australia. So, to the senators who would say that, because Australia has done something in the emissions area, everybody else follows suit, that is laughable. Much as I'd like it to be the case, I'm afraid that's not the reality. 


I mentioned the lying speeches we've heard from the Greens and the Labor Party, which are completely devoid of any accuracy, any truthful statement. They are relevant for this particular motion that the Senate is debating, because the three elements of this motion are all in themselves lies. The first part of the motion says that the Senate notes that government policy inaction is driving up electricity prices. Well, hang on. Until recently, the states were entirely responsible for electricity prices—regrettably, most of them are Labor states—and prices kept going up and up, mainly because Labor states are mad keen on these expensive, subsidised renewable energy projects. They don't want coalmines; they don't want to look after the coalmining workers, so they've gone to these very expensive renewable energy schemes that have pushed up power prices. Of course, in my state of Queensland that suits the energy company, particularly the one up my way, because it's entirely owned by the Queensland state government. It makes huge profits and the Queensland Labor government love that because they can't run a budget. They're almost as bad as Wayne Swan—also regrettably a Queenslander—and the Labor Party federally. They can't run a budget. The Queensland Labor Party can't run a budget, and they rely on the dividends from Ergon Energy and the other electricity companies to try to keep their budget in some sort of order. And they do that with the Townsville Port Authority. Every other agency the Queensland government owns contributes their profits to try to help the Queensland government in some way get near to balancing their budget—not that they ever achieve that. So the first part of this thing is an outright and abject lie.


Then it says we're 'abandoning the National Energy Guarantee' and that's another lie. The National Energy Guarantee is coalition policy, and it's all about reducing prices and confirming, guaranteeing, reliability, which is something the Labor Party doesn't understand. The Labor Party ran South Australia for years and years and they ran out of electricity. That's how good they were at trying to keep even the lights on, let alone keep the prices down. So the coalition government does have a policy. It's not about emissions. Our Paris target—which I think is a farce but we have made it—is to 26 per cent, I think, which we've almost achieved without any legislation, so dropping the legislated carbon emissions target from our National Energy Guarantee is irrelevant. We've achieved that 26 per cent reduction without legislation, without the big stick, but by arranging incentives.


The second part of the motion:


… observes that the Government refuses to act, citing any and all excuse to delay, when everyone knows it is internal Coalition division and the weakness of the Prime Minister that are really to blame …


Again, none of that is factual or truthful. The government has acted, but the Labor Party won't help. The Greens won't help. They'll just sit in their corner and criticise and encourage prices to go up because they think it gives them a political advantage. That's all it's about—pure, raw, crass politics. The government has acted.


The motion goes on to say—the third lie; the third element of the motion which is simply incorrect:


… that Australians deserve real leadership on energy ... 


Again, what Australia has got from this government, for the very first time at federal level, is a clear position and real leadership on energy. This is something that wasn't originally a Commonwealth responsibility, but the Commonwealth—the federal government, the coalition government—took it over because the states were simply incapable of keeping the lights on and keeping power at affordable prices. So the Commonwealth has come in to try and make sure we have reliable supplies of electricity at reasonable prices. The initiative taken by the coalition in relation to making gas available within Australia was just one element of that policy, which has been so successful today. The coalition has spent a lot of time debating this and a lot of work has gone into getting a national energy policy. Whereas the Labor Party, in the six horrible years they were in government, did absolutely nothing. I might say—digressing slightly—that the Labor Party criticise us for shipbuilding failures in Australia. Labor were there for six years. They didn't build a ship. They didn't even build a canoe! They took no action towards a shipbuilding industry, whereas, under the coalition government, we will shortly have a thriving, sustainable and long-term shipbuilding industry. These are just some examples of the wonderful work coalition governments have done over decades to help Australia along. 


I'll return again to the speeches from the previous Labor speaker and the previous speaker from the Greens political party. They are fixated on carbon emissions. They know that going to renewable projects at this time, at this stage of the cycle, is enormously expensive. That's why electricity prices are so very high in Australia. They know it, but they can't bring themselves to accept the reality that that's one of the reasons why electricity prices have skyrocketed. The renewable energy guarantee was, I regret to say, an initiative of the Howard government, but it's one that everyone now accepts has been a failure. It hasn't brought the price of electricity down. It hasn't brought the price of renewable energy down. It has just made it more and more difficult for ordinary Australians to be able to turn on their lights. 


Labor Party and the Greens political party senators just go along with the rhetoric because it's easy to do. As they're sitting around drinking their latte coffees in the leafy suburbs of Melbourne and Sydney, it's easy to feel that they're doing something for the world when, in fact, if they had any brains—if they had just a smidgen of common sense—they could work out, like the Chief Scientist has confirmed, that nothing Australia does will have any impact on the changing climate of the world, particularly now America has pulled out of any international agreements. India were never in them. China allegedly is in them but only pays lip-service to them. China opens a new coal-fired power station every couple of weeks. So nothing we do in Australia will have any impact except to send Australian jobs overseas. The Labor Party have been pretty good at doing that over their terms in office. The demise of the car manufacturing industry—most industries in Australia—occurred under the Labor years. Their fixation with this ideological position on carbon emissions has meant that Australia has simply become uncompetitive. Factories have all moved overseas, and Australian jobs have gone with them. 


For all the rhetoric of the Labor Party, all the viciousness, all the anger in their speeches directed at me and others, they can't even look at the commonsense approach. Forget about the Chief Scientist; just have a look at yourselves. A bit of common sense—



An opposition senator interjecting—  




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  You know this. You understand as well as I do: nothing we do in Australia is going to make one iota of difference, so why are we whipping ourselves? Why are we flagellating ourselves just to get the approval of some United Nations committee?



An opposition senator interjecting—  




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Ask your workers about that. I know you know the answer. I know you've got to go along with Labor Party policy. But you, for one, would understand, because you have a bit of common sense. You can hear what the Chief Scientist says. You know that Labor and the Greens are bound together in this ideological bubble that means nothing. It gives them a warm inner feeling but doesn't do anything at all for the changing climate of the world—and it certainly does nothing for Australia's economy.

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2018-08-23,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (17:49):  Another terrific contribution from Senator Macdonald! We will miss him when he's gone, I can assure you of that. I often note that I'm a relatively new member of this chamber, but, with the number of new entrants we've had, sometimes it doesn't feel that way. I have only been here for two years, and I feel like I'm just getting going, but it could well be that this is the last speech I make in this chamber before an election is called, such is the level of instability—




Senator Farrell:
  What do you know?




Senator WATT:
  Well, I haven't looked at Twitter in the last 30 seconds. Things may have changed more! And, no doubt by the time I sit down after making this contribution, there will be five more contenders for the Liberal Party leadership. So, even though I've only been here two years, this could well be the last speech that I make during this term of government, such is the level of instability in this government. It actually isn't a laughing matter, because we all know that, with this government remaining completely directionless on energy policy and so many other issues since the day of the last election and even before that—since Mr Turnbull took over as Prime Minister—the losers have been the Australian people. There is no greater example of that than the issue that we're debating here today: the government's failure to deliver an energy policy which can keep power prices down for Australian households and businesses and can ensure a reliable supply of electricity to those households and businesses.


On the issue of energy, we've had five years of division and inaction on energy policy from, first, the Abbott government and then the Turnbull government and, no doubt, from whatever government might come next on the other side of politics, and the only losers have been the Australian people in the form of increasing power prices and decreasing power reliability. Over the last couple of years alone—and, probably, if I think about it hard, over the last 12 months—we've seen at least three different iterations of an energy policy from this government. First of all, they were going to have a clean energy target, and that got shot down by Tony Abbott and all the climate change deniers. Then they were going to have an emissions intensity scheme, and that got shot down by Tony Abbott and all of the climate change deniers. They finally limped along, trying to cobble together something called a National Energy Guarantee, which no-one really understood. Even the government didn't know what it would actually involve, And, piece by piece, Tony Abbott and all of the other climate change deniers in the coalition have chopped it away until it is actually just a shell. It is a phrase—'the National Energy Guarantee'—that means nothing, has no content and can do nothing to actually drive down power prices and increase power reliability.


At every stage of this debate over the last 12 to 18 months, as the government has put up different options around an energy policy—whether it be the clean energy target, the emissions intensity scheme or, now, the NEG—the Labor Party has actually resisted the opportunity to play politics. At every stage, the Labor Party has offered the hand of bipartisanship to this government in an attempt to put together a workable policy that can actually respond to what the Australian people want, which is lower electricity prices and a more reliable power supply.


As an observer of the Rudd-Gillard years and from talking to people who were here during that period of time, I can assure you that the Labor Party knows very well how politically damaging and risky the issue of energy policy and emissions reductions can be. We saw it when we were in government. We saw the problems that were caused when people tried to play politics with energy policy and emissions reductions, and that's why we have so consistently offered to work with the government to come up with an energy policy. It might not be exactly what we want. In every single one of these different schemes that the government has put up, there have been things that we would have preferred to see done differently, but we've consistently offered to work with the government and avoid taking the political route to shoot them down—even though it would have been easy to do so in every single case—in order to try to get to a policy that would help the Australian people. But every time we've offered that hand of bipartisanship to the government, they have been unable to put out a hand because they've got so many different hands out offering so many different options because they cannot come to an agreement on one policy that their entire party can get behind.


Every time they put up one option, Tony Abbott criticises it. Then they'll come up with another option, and the National Party criticises it—and so it goes. As I say, Labor is left waiting there every single time, looking for a willing partner in the government who's prepared to work together to come up with an energy policy. We're left standing on the sidelines, without a willing partner and without a capable partner who can actually come up with an energy policy that works. We've had five years of division, five years of inaction and five years of increasing power prices and decreasing power reliability, and that can be 100 per cent laid at the feet of this government and its incapacity to manage its own internal affairs and to put the interests of the Australian people above government members' own personal ambitions and need to settle scores and carry out vendettas over past leadership changes. Even today, they still can't decide what they want to see out of an energy policy. 


We know that, along with the disastrous results of the by-elections only a few weeks ago, particularly in Longman and Braddon, it is their inability to come up with an energy policy yet again that is driving the most recent leadership crisis. As usual, as we have seen every other time an energy policy has come up, Tony Abbott and his colleagues have been sniping at it from the sidelines, even though he said he was never going to snipe and never going to do whatever else he has done every single day of the week. Because of that, it's well beyond a leadership crisis; it's a crisis of government in this country. This government, if you can call it that, is, to quote my good friend Senator Cameron, 'an absolute rabble'. It is not a joke. It is actually a tragedy to see an Australian government so dysfunctional that it can't even work out a process to work out who its leader is going to be. 


If you were watching Senate question time today—you didn't have the opportunity to watch the House of Reps question time because the government chickened out and shut down the House of Representatives, so we enjoyed the fact that we had a pretty full gallery here to watch us in Senate question time for a change—and you looked over at the other side, you'd have seen the number of gaping holes in the government frontbench, with ministers missing and ministers walking out. It actually looked like a big piece of Swiss cheese: holes here, holes there, a little bit here, a little bit there. That is what this government has become. It is a piece of Swiss cheese that is barely hanging together because of the number of holes that have been made by ministers resigning and walking out on this government. It has got to the point now that, with the number of resignations by ministers in the Senate, there are not enough Turnbull backers on the government's backbench in the Senate to fill the number of vacancies that have been created. Even if Malcolm Turnbull was to survive as Prime Minister and wanted to promote a few people, pick a few people from his backbench and fill some of the vacancies that have been caused by these resignations, he doesn't have enough people to fill those spots. That demonstrates how little support there is for this Prime Minister in the Senate, and it demonstrates exactly how unworkable and dysfunctional this government has become. 


In essence, just like the famous Monty Python parrot, this government has ceased to be. There is not really a Prime Minister anymore. No-one really knows who the Prime Minister is and no-one actually believes that it's Malcolm Turnbull. So there's no Prime Minister. There's no cabinet. There's no ministry to speak of because they're disappearing like flies. There's actually no government because no-one knows who's running the government and they have no idea where they want to take the country, whether it be on energy policy or anything else. 


Now, the Labor side of politics did learn the lessons of the division that we saw during the Rudd-Gillard governments. We learnt the lessons and, as a result, for the last five years we have been incredibly united and stable and focused on coming up with policy ideas that will actually fix the problems that the average Australian faces—and wants their government to focus on rather than focusing on themselves, on getting ahead and on becoming the new leader of the country. 


As things stand—and I've been talking for nearly 10 minutes, so who knows what's happened in that time—we have four declared candidates for the leadership of the Liberal Party and the prime ministership of this country. The current Prime Minister, so to speak, Mr Turnbull, is still hanging in there, hoping that they won't come up with the number of names required for a petition. We've got Mr Morrison; he has put his name forward. We've got Mr Dutton, of course. We've got Ms Bishop there as well. I've even seen reports our old friend Mr Abbott might resurface and have another crack. I can tell you that all on the Labor side are very much looking forward to that! So we've got at least four declared candidates. But whoever it is, whoever takes on the leadership, it's going to be a disaster.

Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (18:00):  Document No. 7 on the Notice Paper is a report from the Clean Energy Regulator assessing the progress over 2017 in terms of meeting Australia's Renewable Energy Target for 2020. It's a pretty apt follow-on from the debate we've just had about energy policy. Perhaps the most obvious thing to say—which isn't in this report, which is apt—is that there is a gap in this report which matches the total gap in this government's policy when it comes to what happens after 2020 with renewable energy or any form of energy policy. There is no 2020 vision from this government. There is no vision at all when it comes to renewable energy, other than the vision of the climate change deniers in the coalition, who want to destroy the renewable energy industry and turn us backwards to job-destroying, economy-destroying, environment-destroying, price-increasing, taxpayer-money-sucking coal-fired power generation. 


The report does contain some useful information. It does show that, despite all of the efforts of this coalition government to hurt the renewable energy industry, to destroy investor confidence, to reduce the number of jobs that it generates, including in regional and rural areas, nonetheless the expansion of renewable energy continues in this country. According to this report, the large-scale Renewable Energy Target for 2020 is in sight. We've heard a bit of scorn from some of those in the coalition about the unworkable targets that other parties are putting forward. Let me say that the Greens target for renewable energy is a vision of 100 per cent renewable energy in the future, a future of clean energy for all of us, a future of reliable and affordable energy for all of us, and a future where we still hope we can avoid the harm—the economic, social and environmental harm—of runaway climate change that the climate deniers, the fossil fuel industry, lobbyists and donors are still so determined to inflict on this planet, on the community, hurting, most significantly, the poorest amongst us and the poorest communities around the globe. 


In amongst the bad news that this government keeps delivering, the harm that this government keeps delivering, some of it deliberately in the interests of its corporate mates, some of it just because they don't have any vision themselves about what to do anymore, there is some positive news—that is, the renewable energy industry continues to roll out. I've spoken a couple of times already this is week about what can be done and the vision that the Greens have—the costed, affordable and credible policies the Greens have already put forward at previous state and federal elections—to turbocharge the renewable energy industry in a way which will deliver jobs, which will deliver clean energy, and which will deliver affordable and reliable energy around the country. That's something that we'll continue to campaign on. It is a reminder that, even in amongst the destructive and incoherent approach of this government, progress is still possible and why it's so important to continue to push to lock in mechanisms that are immune to vandalism by some of the ideological warriors and the people who are unable to escape their connections to their corporate donors and the fossil fuel lobby. So I commend the report to the chamber as something for them to peruse, to look at where our Renewable Energy Target is going.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2018-08-23,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (18:10):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I chair the Select Committee on Red Tape, which was established in 2016 to inquiry into and report on the effect of red tape on the economy and community. It has previously presented interim reports on the sale, supply and taxation of alcohol, tobacco retailing, environmental assessment and approvals, pharmacy rules, health care and child care, and I now speak to the seventh interim report on the effect of red tape on occupational licensing in Australia.


In Australia, there are a large number of licensed occupations, from doctors to bartenders. Occupational licensing is a growth industry, despite the fact that almost everyone can find problems with it. With sometimes quite different approaches taken in the states and territories, it is also a source of frustration to those who work across state boundaries or those who move interstate. The Institute of Public Affairs described occupational licensing as a government-enabled cartel that inflates the wages and market share of licensed workers at the expense of non-licensed workers. I quote from their submission:


Occupational licensing creates a barrier to market entry. This reduces the number of people in licensed professions and increases the number of people in non-licensed professions. This drives up labour supply in the licensed professions, which pushes up wages, while it floods labour supply in unlicensed professions, which pushes down wages in those professions.


The IPA also questioned whether occupational licensing confers any benefits to the community. They referenced a report from the United States, which concluded that there is no evidence base for licensing improving the quality of public health or safety. They said:


Occupational licensing can actually reduce health and safety and quality outcomes by restricting competition. Less competitive markets contain businesses which are less responsive to the needs and preferences of consumers, and so they are less likely to deliver high-quality, low-cost products and services. Moreover, by raising prices occupational licensing reduces real income. This means that people economise on the use of licensed products and services, which can cause negative health outcomes.


The ACTU and Unions NSW said that occupational licensing is not red tape. In fact, they described it as a pejorative term but a crucial element in ensuring the quality of work undertaken in licensed industries and the safety of Australian workers and consumers. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that there are two main reasons for occupational licensing: to protect the safety of consumer and the public, and to ensure a sufficient and reliable level of service quality. A third reason is to signal that a person has the requisite training and skills to function competently and safely in an occupation.


Some argued for even greater regulation. For example, the Hair & Beauty Industry Association insisted that hairdressing and beauty is not a low-risk industry and claimed that the industry is crying out for regulation. The Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union submitted that individual workers who perform work for licensed builders should also be licensed, including carpenters, brick layers and stonemasons. United Voice called for licensing of workers in the aged-care sector, which they claimed would protect elderly people from elder abuse. But, equally, some referred to situations where occupational licensing achieves nothing. The Shopping Centre Council of Australia, for example, argued that this was the case with licensing of commercial real estate agents. They cited the example of Scentre Group, which owns Westfield shopping centres, which is required to have certain of its staff licensed as real estate agents. This is supposedly to protect that company, yet it's a $20 billion company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange with the sole purpose of the ownership and management of commercial property. They also noted that the compliance costs of this licensing are about $1.6 million and that 13,800 hours of staff productivity just in Western Australia alone. 


The Australian Tattooists Guild argued that licensing has had substantial adverse effects on the previously self-regulated tattoo industry. It said that, when the tattoo industry was self-regulated, the general public was protected from backyard operators due to their inability to gain any form of legitimacy within the trade. The state licensing regimes have added to bureaucracy and red tape, but they've also undermined the working existing structure of the profession. The guild said that, by licensing amateurs, the regimes have created a public health risk. 


The IPA expressed the view that the historical rationale for occupational licensing—consistency of equality and public safety—is less relevant and less necessary in the modern age. It noted that there are a range of options by which consumers can inform themselves of the quality and safety of a provider of service that mitigate the information asymmetry—that is, the difference in the knowledge of the provider and the knowledge of the lay consumer—in providing a good or service. Consumers in this day and age don't have to rely on centrally mandated licensing in order to check up on a provider, a shop, a cafe, or even a specialist or tradesman; they can revert to crowdsourced websites like Yelp, or Google reviews and the like. The IPA argued that, as an alternative to occupational licensing, policymakers should focus on enabling consumers to make more informed decision-making through the technological provision of 'more and better information'. A similar submission specifically suggested the online reputational platforms such as those used by Uber and Airbnb. 


Australian governments have, at times, sought to increase consistency between the states and territories with respect to occupational licensing; however, the committee notes that this ceased in 2013, with the abandonment of the National Occupational Licensing Scheme, because the states and territories were unable to agree on nationally uniform requirements. The IPA submission notes that the end result was 'complex, expansive and duplicative'. The National Electrical and Communications Association noted the difficulties encountered by businesses operating in more than one jurisdiction that were caused by licensing schemes. Small- to medium-sized businesses bear a disproportionate share of the compliance costs. 


The committee notes that, notwithstanding some progress in that direction, the full benefits of mutual recognition are a long way from being obtained. The committee recommends the expansion of automatic mutual recognition to achieve greater labour-force mobility. This will facilitate further GDP growth, which means more services, more jobs and higher wages. Four specific recommendations were made by the committee. First, it recommends that the Council for the Australian Federation, in close consultation with relevant stakeholders, renews its efforts toward occupational licensing reform, with a starting presumption against licensing. Subject to the licensing being retained, the committee recommends that occupational licensing be based on specific, measurable outcomes and the identification of best practice models for occupations throughout Australia. It recommends the expansion of automatic mutual recognition based on the objective of increasing labour-force mobility. And it recommends that the Council for the Australian Federation commission a study into the health and safety benefits of occupational licensing to strengthen efforts towards reform. I commend the report to the Senate and seek leave to continue my remarks.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Stoker, Sen Amanda",LP,2018-08-23,"



Senator STOKER
 (Queensland) (18:44):  On 11 June 2018, Mr Wallace, the member for Fisher, held the inaugural Fisher Schools Debating Competition at Kawana Waters State College in the fabulous electorate of Fisher, on Queensland's beautiful Sunshine Coast. It's important to me as a senator, as I know it is for Mr Wallace, to encourage our young people to engage in Australia's political system and to get a good understanding of civics and the role of government. It's crucial that we demonstrate to our leaders of tomorrow that an understanding of the political landscape in Australia, both now and in years past, will set them up for success in the future. Complementing this are skills that can be developed through participating in good old-fashioned debate.


I strongly believe that it is vital that all of our young people, at some stage during their school journeys, are encouraged to participate in debating. The skills of public speaking, critical reasoning and the ability to construct and execute an argument are transferrable to many areas of life. It also demonstrates the importance of a fundamental Australian value: freedom of speech. School debating is how we develop the resilience to hear ideas that challenge us and, rather than claiming that we should never be confronted or challenged, to instead have the strength and confidence to counterargue. Freedom of speech makes us strong, not mere snowflakes. It certainly developed that confidence in me when I was a school student.


The member for Fisher took great pleasure in hosting the first of what he hopes will be many Fisher debating competitions this year. I'm told it was a tremendous event, with numerous local schools competing and vying for the opportunity to be the best debating school in the electorate of Fisher and to be able, as their prize, to prepare a speech to be read out in this parliament. I am delighted to announce to this Senate that Chancellor State College won the competition. The following speech was written by Mia Seefeld, Lucy Gillespie and Kate Frankish, who join us in the gallery today, along with their teacher, Ms Amanda Watson. I acknowledge each of them now.


There are some great ideas in this speech. While I don't endorse all of the ideas that are put forward in it, I welcome the debate and I wholly admire the heartfelt passion with which they have written something so special to be delivered today. It goes like this:


Dear future,


You may not know it yet but we have plans for you. We want to make a difference and have an impact. We want to pave our own path and colour it in our favourite shades. We also want to have a say. Every time our parents go to vote, we go with them. We take the flyers shoved in our face, we read the policies, we consider our options but then we just feel frustration. We feel frustrated because everyone is voting on issues that impact on us. And yet we are silenced. University fees, education, the future of housing affordability, medical care, infrastructure, the environment and many other areas of interest and importance. Why does someone else get to have a say in our life, why are they allowed to thrust their hand into the clay of our future that is just beginning to take shape? Why can't we remove their hand until we are 18, when we are classified as an adult? Why does my age define my maturity?


We know many adults who couldn't hold a flame to the political understanding we have at 16 years of age and yet someone who has never or will never be linked to the path we are travelling gets to shape the policies influencing this path? How do we justify that approach? Voting is just one of the ways we should get to have a say. There needs to be more opportunities for us and all other young people to stand out and speak up.


There is nothing more empowering than delivering a jaw dropping speech on issues which put a fire in our belly. But then the spotlight shifts, and we take our seat, once more leaving our inspiring words and plans to shape our world lingering in the air. Without a hand to catch these sparks, they soon fizzle out. Opportunities like public speaking and debating are vital as they give young people a voice. Competitions run by parliamentary members, thank you so much Andrew Wallace MP, are even more crucial as young people can be heard by someone who can put their ideas into action. But there is no point to giving us a voice if only the confident and outgoing speak. Our peers, many who won't get up in front of a room full of people, deserve their say too. Voting will give young people the option to express their views. 


So dear future, despite all the negativity that surrounds our generation, we plan on making a difference in this world but first we need a chance. Dear future, we are ready for you, but are you ready for us?


Sincerely,


Mia, Lucy and Kate


I think we have in Chancellor State College some outstanding debaters, some outstanding leaders, and three very impressive students, who I know will have made the very most of their opportunity to have the ear of their federal member during their visit to Parliament House today.
