"Taylor, Bill, MP",LP,1998-04-06,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's report entitled Australia and ASEAN: Managing change , together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—This report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade—Australia and ASEAN: Managing Change —is its first in this area since 1984. I thank Margaret Swieringa, who is in the chamber today, for her work in its preparation.
As all members are aware, a profound change has occurred in the region. The optimism of the early part of this inquiry that ASEAN economies would continuously grow and prosper has been tempered by the currency crisis which began in Thailand in July last year and has since affected, in varying degrees, all of East Asia. The crisis has brought expectations of growth back to more standard levels, has highlighted the complexities of achieving sustainable development and has emphasised the importance of institutional development and good governance in that process. It has thrown down a challenge to 
 ASEAN—its slow consensual style, its decisiveness and its cohesion.
The crisis also has altered the strategic outlook for the region, with the strategic uncertainty inherent in the reorientation of great power politics at the end of the Cold War exacerbated by the possible threat to internal political stability in some states. The decline in economic circumstances is likely to worsen the broader security threats of transborder crime, illegal movements of peoples, the outflow of refugees, disputes over environmental degradation and competition for resources. Many of these are issues of concern already on the agenda of the ASEAN regional forum, whose importance is recognised and supported by the committee.
The inquiry took a considerable body of evidence in the early part of 1997 which stressed the opportunities in the region for Australian trade. Australia's natural, geographically based connection to the `fastest growing region in the world' appeared to ensure the expansion of Australian export trade. The report deals in some detail with an analysis of the bilateral and sectoral trade relationship between Australia and the region, including regional trade liberalisation under both AFTA and APEC.
The committee does not underestimate the seriousness of the current problems or the challenges they pose. These are not simple or painless matters for countries to resolve. The committee was able to take some evidence on the possible causes of the problems and on the response of the IMF and regional governments. The committee endorses the Australian government's readiness to participate in the IMF packages offered to the Republic of Korea, Thailand and Indonesia. However, with such rapidly developing circumstances over recent weeks, our analysis is simply a snapshot. The seminar held in Parliament House on 19 March and the seminar report will elaborate on our preliminary findings, particularly in respect of Indonesia.
The report remains optimistic about long-term trends. It concludes:
Despite the recent economic difficulties in the region, which are likely to result in depressed demand for Australian exports in key ASEAN 
 markets, the prospects for continued growth in two way trade in the long run remain solid.
However, in other spheres of our relationship with the region, some concerns were expressed. Many witnesses stressed the importance of paying more attention to the social, cultural and political relationships between Australia and regional countries. Areas of weakness were perceived in bilateral tensions over political style or the differences in values, particularly human rights, declining cultural representation or the paucity of expenditure on regional cultural activity.
Strongly criticised was the withdrawal of our most natural communication with the region through the closure of Radio Australia. The committee strongly urges a reconsideration of the decision to close the Cox Peninsula transmitters.
The committee believes that Asian studies and student exchanges, both of Asian students coming to Australia and of Australians studying in Asia, should be enhanced and improved, and that literary, artistic and cultural exchanges with the region be increased. To this end, the committee endorses the new international cultural council and hopes that it will be adequately funded.
In its 30th anniversary year, which ASEAN began as a self-confident, independent and forceful regional voice, the economic crisis has provided a challenge to the association's ability to retain its cohesion and to act decisively in the interest of the whole region. This report lays down some of these challenges. I commend the report to the House.

"Jones, Barry, MP",ALP,1998-04-06,"—Yes, a little, Mr Speaker. I am pleased to have the opportunity to support the report on Australia and ASEAN prepared by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. This was the particular responsibility of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, chaired by the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor).
The period between 1967 and 1997 was very much a success story for ASEAN. Its growth figures were extraordinarily high and it was not uncommon for some ASEAN countries to have figures of between six and eight per cent GDP growth annually. But since October 1997, not as a direct result of the holding of our inquiry but certainly as our inquiry developed, there was a tremendous change in what we were hearing from witnesses. After October 1997 things in ASEAN seemed to change rather dramatically. As we said in our conclusions, `two ASEANs emerged in the course of this inquiry: one, at the beginning, prosperous, confident and exhibiting uninterrupted growth; the other, after October 1997, uncertain, demoralised, suffering sharp decline in economic indicators and intently seeking an understanding of the cause of the crisis and the nature of the solution'.
The Asian crisis that emerged at that time changed completely many of the assessments the committee had received in submissions and evidence to that date. I thank heaven that we did not produce the report about a year ago—it would not have had a very long shelf life. No doubt the committee would have shared in the ringing prophecies about what would happen as ASEAN went from strength to strength.
The report will make valuable reading—perhaps disconcerting in some embassies in the region. We drew attention to matters of considerable concern. For example, paragraph 13 of our conclusions states:
The crisis in the economies of the region demonstrates that corruption is a serious political and economic problem. Its cause rests in the political systems where there is little transparency, accountability and scrutiny; the lack of a free press, a viable opposition and an independent judiciary. These fundamental civil and political rights are the means by which corruption, while not eliminated, is kept at bay. There is commonly expressed, in Australia and in the region, the view that the political and economic systems can be compartmentalised, that human rights and trade are not connected, and that a country can adopt western economics and reject broader democratic accountability: this appears, in the light of current events, to be a fallacy. The experiences of the past months in Asia have had antecedents in capitalist economies on a number of occasions. Both this experience and the clamour for reform in Thailand, Indonesia and the Republic of 
 Korea illustrate that, while the problems of greed and the abuse of power are not uniquely Asian problems, they are universal; the solutions of fairness and equity are not Western, they are universally understood to be valuable.
One subject in the report was the race debate affecting Australia's image in the region. We pointed to the irony that, at a time when the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) was receiving extensive media coverage in South-East Asia for her misinformation, the government chose this time as a budget economy, part of its campaign against the ABC, to pull back from its responsibilities to provide Radio Australia and Australia Television services for the region. I echo the remarks of the honourable member for Groom when he pointed to our recommendation that the government restore the Cox Peninsula transmitters to full operation for the use of Radio Australia.
If Australia is to engage in the region, and especially with ASEAN, we cannot give conflicting signals and say we are interested in ASEAN while at the same time we are pulling back as if we were not interested in informing the people of the region about the quality of life, the system of government that we have and the things about Australia that we are very proud of. If there is one consequence to come out of this which is aimed at the Australian government in particular, it is that it recognise its responsibility to restore and, indeed, enhance the way it communicates information to South-East Asia through both television and radio.

"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,1998-04-06,"—Mr Speaker, I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 6th annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum, which was held in Seoul, Republic of Korea, from 7 to 10 January 1998.
The APPF is now a well-established regional organisation to which Australia has made a strong contribution since its beginning at meetings in Singapore and Canberra in 1991. Previous annual meetings have been held in Japan, the Philippines, Mexico, Thailand and Canada, and the organisation has evolved its own corporate practices and procedures over this time. The underlying principles have remained, however, and have been strengthened at each annual meeting. These principles include a commitment to frank and constructive dialogue between parliamentarians from the 26 member countries representing over 45 per cent of the world's population. These countries are from Asia, Oceania and both North America and South America, and they include superpowers, G7 nations and smaller Pacific Ocean island states.
Yasuhiro Nakasone, the former Japanese Prime Minister, who is President of APPF, emphasised in his opening remarks the importance of the APPF as a parliamentary forum with representatives of governing and non-governing parties. This broadens the views that are expressed and explored.
I can inform the House that there were certainly free and frank exchanges of views in Seoul. The agenda covered a wide range of matters. These included the fourth ASEAN regional forum; the Korean Peninsula situation; Cambodia; APEC's Vancouver meetings; the Asian currency crisis; regional economic cooperation; the environment and other global 
 issues such as energy, education, drugs, terrorism, cultural exchanges and corruption; the Ottawa convention; and Myanmar. There is a deal of interest within member countries about the actions taken towards implementation of the positions agreed on these matters. I urge members, in consideration of these resolutions, to have this in mind.
The delegation was led by Bill Taylor, the honourable member for Groom. I was the deputy leader and the other members were Paul Neville, the honourable member for Hinkler, and Senator John Quirke of South Australia. I thank all members of the delegation for their comradeship. I particularly congratulate the honourable member for Groom on the way he conducted himself as leader of the delegation. He led by example and made sure that we made a very full contribution.
We were advantaged by the fact that the honourable member for Groom had attended the executive meeting late last year of APPF and was known to many of the key players at the conference. The delegation was also served by Mr Peter Gibson as secretary and I am pleased to see that he is in the chamber at the moment. Peter's long and continued involvement with APPF as secretary to various delegations was another important fact because Peter also was well known to other members of APPF.
The delegation was given strong support in Korea by the Australian Ambassador, Mr Mack Williams, and by the counsellor at the embassy, Mr Richard Ryan. We were grateful for this and for the excellent support provided before our departure in the form of high quality briefing material provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of the Parliamentary Library. The delegation highlights that Mr Williams is soon to retire from the department. We take this opportunity to congratulate him on his long and very highly valuable service to the nation and we wish him and his wife, Carla, a very happy, peaceful and healthy retirement. I would also like to place on record our congratulations to the national assembly of the Republic of Korea not only for the way in 
 which they were fine hosts but also for their efficient conduct of the meeting.
The Australian delegation participated fully in the plenary sessions and I believe made a significant contribution. We acted as a team, whether it was in the executive committee, the plenary or the working committee to develop the joint communique. I was appointed as rapporteur to that joint communique working committee, which was a lesson for me in high international diplomacy as a war of words broke out about the way in which the final draft communique was being presented to the plenary session.
—I bet it was nothing like the Victorian ALP.
—Even though I have had those experiences I would tell the honourable member for Moore that this was still a very educative process. It was a reflection on the way in which APPF operates that those problems were ironed out in an amicable and very good way.
Mr Deputy Speaker, this was my first experience of an APPF meeting but I know you and your predecessors have given strong support to the APPF over the years. This year's meeting in Seoul was pleased to accept Australia's invitation to host the eight annual meeting in Sydney in January 2000 and this was widely seen as an example of Australia's commitment to this important regional organisation.

"Neville, Paul, MP",NP,1998-04-06,"—I am happy to endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), who was deputy leader of the Australian delegation to the 6th Annual Meeting of the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum in Seoul in the second week of January this year. It was quite a balanced team, which was led by the member for Groom (Mr Taylor) and included the member for Scullin, me and Senator John Quirke. The delegation put a concise view on many issues and I compliment the opposition members in articulating government policy in an even-handed and sensitive way.
I think the forum was a great lesson for all of us. To be in Korea and work with Koreans and other Asian delegates at the height of the 
 Asian economic meltdown added a true to life relevance to what we were doing. The relative value of the won to the Australian dollar had halved in the previous four months and, while we were there, there were daily fluctuations. We were there in the interregnum between the two presidents: Kim Dae-Jung was about to take office from Kim Young-Sam. The dynamic of that change and the strong stance on economic issues was becoming evident at the time of the forum.
While we were there both Qantas and Ansett announced a suspension of flights to Korea, one recently arrived flight carrying only seven passengers. There were two lessons in this for us as Australians: one, the intensity with which Korea can harness national sentiment and, in the medium term, correct the direction of its economy; and, two, in the short term there might be some pain for Australian industry and exporters.
Yet another dynamic that was evident was the all pervasive concern over the North Korean situation. No doubt honourable members have been aware of the perilous state of the North Korean economy and recent periods of near famine. As the member for Groom pointed out at the plenary session devoted to this and the related subregional matters, Australia had contributed $18.5 million to economic and food aid. He also stressed Australia's commitment to the four-nation dialogue on reunification.
With the per capita income of South Korea at $US10,200 and North Korea's at $US957, and with the South Korean-American forces totalling 540,000 and North Korea's army standing at a million, we should not be cavalier or ho hum in our approach to this delicate situation. As delegates our sensitivity was heightened by a visit to the Armistice Village at Panmunjom. It was a chilling reminder to us of the fragility of peace and the price that still has to be paid to maintain it. I must admit that I came away with a healthy respect for the US and South Korean forces. So against these twin local backgrounds of meltdown and Korean Peninsula politics, the sensitivities of the 25 delegations were well focused.
We debated the Cambodian situation, the entry of Colombia into the organisation, the World Trade Organisation, drugs, drug trafficking and money laundering, which was Australia's major agenda item at the conference and one in which the member for Groom played a key part. With regard to the El Nino and climate change, which I participated in having had first-hand knowledge of its effects on Australia and in particular on the central Queensland coast, we were able to play an important part in directing the forum away from yet another international regulatory bureaucracy and enticing them to enhance the role of the World Meteorological Organisation.
Our effectiveness as a group was enhanced by the administrative leadership of our secretary, Peter Gibson, currently at the table, and advice from Mr Richard Ryan of the Australian embassy. It is also worthy of note that we were well supported by the Canadian delegation, which held similar views to our own and with whom we enjoyed fellowship on a number of occasions.
—You had a good drink?
—Indeed we did. Our attendance was timely and the resolutions pertinent to a number of highly sensitive issues globally. For my own part, I welcomed the opportunity to be part of that delegation. I learnt more about those issues in four days than one could learn in a library of books.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Delegation to the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum, Seoul, Republic of Korea</title>",Delegation Reports,2,1,speech
"Taylor, Bill, MP",LP,1998-04-06,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report on treaties, tabled on 25 November 1997 and 3 March 1998, entitled Thirteenth report , together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—The report I have just tabled deals with eight topics although, with the limited time we now have available, I will deal with only three. Firstly, it deals with the 1996 protocol which will replace the so-called 
 London Convention on Sea Dumping and, related to it, an amendment to the convention as a result of the cessation of the dumping at sea of the spoil from the mining of jarosite.
In the International Year of the Oceans, it is appropriate for us to table a report which will reduce the amount and type of material which can be dumped at sea. The 1996 protocol will replace the London Convention when sufficient nations have expressed consent to be bound to the new agreement. We can only hope that this occurs sooner rather than later.
Secondly, we have reported on amendments to the schedule to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling which were agreed at Monaco in October 1997. A number of important issues confront the International Whaling Commission (IWC) at its 50th annual meeting next month in Oman. Indeed, some would say that the commission's future is increasingly called into doubt by pressures such as aboriginal whaling and continued whaling by nations such as Japan and Norway. Attempts are continuing to reach a consensus on fundamental questions about the revised management strategy which evaluates whale population levels and, if resolved, would be used to set quotas for whaling.
As we point out in the report, attitudes to whales and to whaling have changed since the IWC was set up in 1946. To remain relevant, the commission must face up to a number of issues, set out in the report, to the satisfaction of a majority of its members.
Thirdly, we have considered the Agreement on the Neutral Truce Monitoring Group in Bougainville. This is an important matter for Papua New Guinea, for Australia, indeed for the region, but it is vital for the people of Bougainville where there has been fighting since 1989.
Australian Defence Force and non-military personnel were involved in the truce monitoring group (TMG), and they performed in a professional way which was a credit to themselves and to their country. We were particularly impressed by the contribution the women members of the TMG were able to make. Bougainville is a matriarchal society, 
 and the women in the villages invited the women members of the TMG to talk over the issues in a way which appears to have made a significant contribution to the peace process. The TMG may become a peace monitoring group after 30 April, and the committee hopes that Australian personnel can continue to remain involved in the peace process in Bougainville.
Once again, I take the opportunity to pay tribute to the members of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and their positive attitudes to a heavy workload, reflected in the tabling of 13 reports since September 1996. At present, we have another three inquiries at various stages of completion, with a fourth to be taken up as a result of a tabling last week.
The reference of the Multilateral Agreement on Investment to the Committee by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) is generating much interest right around the country. We look forward to public hearings commencing next month in Canberra.
The reference of the Minister for Justice (Mr Williams) of the draft enabling legislation for the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials is under way. Indeed, there was a further hearing this morning here in Canberra. Additional hearings are scheduled for Sydney and Melbourne later this month.
All this could not have been achieved without the cooperative spirit of all members, in both Houses and on all sides of politics. I thank them all, and commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Treaties Committee</title>,Committees,3,1,speech
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,1998-04-06,"—My comments relate to the amendments to the schedule to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, which is referred to in the thirteenth report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. History reveals that Tasmania was the home of one of the world's major whaling peoples and built its early economy on its connection with whaling and the sea. Tasmania has long since finished with its whaling days, but it still retains the artefacts and memories of those heroic days.
Now Australia believes in the moratorium on commercial whaling and the establishment 
 of the Southern Ocean sanctuary for whales that was introduced in 1994. We also consider the International Whaling Commission to be the most appropriate forum for pursuit of improved international efforts to conserve whales.
It was interesting to look at different countries perspectives on the preservation of whales. The Norwegians have a long history of whaling and like whale meat, but I understand they sell the blubber to Japan. The Japanese too are keen to see some whaling continue for trade purposes and for local consumption. So there is still a commercial interest in whale catching and its exploitation. That is to be dealt with when this convention has been through the commission.
While it is appropriate that we look for the establishment of a global whaling sanctuary, we need some ability to allow aboriginal subsistence whaling for those people who still have it as part of their culture—the Chukotka people in Alaska being a case in point. It is about these people and our European reaction to whaling that I wish to speak.
I have a Tasmanian friend by the name of Kay Ilmar, currently living in Barrow, on the north coast of Alaska. She has experienced her first whale `catch' with the Eskimo community. This is someone who has been anti-whaling for most of her life and is suddenly confronted with her stepchildren's heritage. I would like to share her comments with the House. She says:
Dave came home from working late last night at round 10 p.m. to tell me that the Eskimos had brought in a whale and it was on the beach just near here. It is the first whale caught of the Fall Whaling Season and so we walked along to take a look. There were people everywhere, it seemed like half the town was out. I felt a little uneasy we approached, feeling a sadness. It was much bigger than I expected, seemed twelve foot high and apparently measured 44 ft 8 inches long. Big and black, only a few barnacles on the end of the tail. There was a big crowd circling it, the Eskimos seemed so excited, taking photos while it was measured. Children everywhere. I stood amongst them, watching their reactions, absorbing the immensity of it. Imagining it swimming around at peace. The evening was warm, well warm for here. I wasn't cold but I'd rugged up well. 

Then a man with a knife that looked like a big hockey stick, blade on the end, climbed up onto the top and began to cut. Carving big slabs in sections, while others on the beach pierced big hooks into what had been sliced from the top and pulled with rope as the blubber was dragged back off it. The captain of that whaling crew keeps a large proportion, the remainder is distributed to the Eskimo families here and in the outlying villages of the North Slope. It is given, not sold.
I talked about my mixed feeling, about my anti-whaling stand, but still trying to understand and accept the Eskimo heritage. They've been doing this for as long as anyone can remember, it's their life.
She continues:
It's morning now and from the window I can see it, a bloodied carcass on the beach, people still around it. Not much left. Jennifer—

told me earlier that they would use a bulldozer to take it much further down the beach away from the town so that if the polar bears come in to pick over it, they'll be away from the houses. The local news reported the catch on this morning's broadcast.
Coming to terms with your own history and coming to terms with the current culture is what allows these people to be able to harvest their whales. We did harvest our whales and we used them for all our daily needs, much like the Eskimos. That should be taken into account, as it is within this treaty. There is some concern about the difference in the killing methods; that they should be more humane. As we improve technology, should we allow Aborigines to use new technologies to undertake their whaling? (Time expired)

"Taylor, Bill, MP",LP,1998-04-06,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report on treaties, tabled on 25 November 1997 and 3 March 1998, entitled Thirteenth report , together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—The report I have just tabled deals with eight topics although, with the limited time we now have available, I will deal with only three. Firstly, it deals with the 1996 protocol which will replace the so-called 
 London Convention on Sea Dumping and, related to it, an amendment to the convention as a result of the cessation of the dumping at sea of the spoil from the mining of jarosite.
In the International Year of the Oceans, it is appropriate for us to table a report which will reduce the amount and type of material which can be dumped at sea. The 1996 protocol will replace the London Convention when sufficient nations have expressed consent to be bound to the new agreement. We can only hope that this occurs sooner rather than later.
Secondly, we have reported on amendments to the schedule to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling which were agreed at Monaco in October 1997. A number of important issues confront the International Whaling Commission (IWC) at its 50th annual meeting next month in Oman. Indeed, some would say that the commission's future is increasingly called into doubt by pressures such as aboriginal whaling and continued whaling by nations such as Japan and Norway. Attempts are continuing to reach a consensus on fundamental questions about the revised management strategy which evaluates whale population levels and, if resolved, would be used to set quotas for whaling.
As we point out in the report, attitudes to whales and to whaling have changed since the IWC was set up in 1946. To remain relevant, the commission must face up to a number of issues, set out in the report, to the satisfaction of a majority of its members.
Thirdly, we have considered the Agreement on the Neutral Truce Monitoring Group in Bougainville. This is an important matter for Papua New Guinea, for Australia, indeed for the region, but it is vital for the people of Bougainville where there has been fighting since 1989.
Australian Defence Force and non-military personnel were involved in the truce monitoring group (TMG), and they performed in a professional way which was a credit to themselves and to their country. We were particularly impressed by the contribution the women members of the TMG were able to make. Bougainville is a matriarchal society, 
 and the women in the villages invited the women members of the TMG to talk over the issues in a way which appears to have made a significant contribution to the peace process. The TMG may become a peace monitoring group after 30 April, and the committee hopes that Australian personnel can continue to remain involved in the peace process in Bougainville.
Once again, I take the opportunity to pay tribute to the members of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and their positive attitudes to a heavy workload, reflected in the tabling of 13 reports since September 1996. At present, we have another three inquiries at various stages of completion, with a fourth to be taken up as a result of a tabling last week.
The reference of the Multilateral Agreement on Investment to the Committee by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) is generating much interest right around the country. We look forward to public hearings commencing next month in Canberra.
The reference of the Minister for Justice (Mr Williams) of the draft enabling legislation for the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials is under way. Indeed, there was a further hearing this morning here in Canberra. Additional hearings are scheduled for Sydney and Melbourne later this month.
All this could not have been achieved without the cooperative spirit of all members, in both Houses and on all sides of politics. I thank them all, and commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,3,2,speech
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,1998-04-06,"—My comments relate to the amendments to the schedule to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, which is referred to in the thirteenth report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. History reveals that Tasmania was the home of one of the world's major whaling peoples and built its early economy on its connection with whaling and the sea. Tasmania has long since finished with its whaling days, but it still retains the artefacts and memories of those heroic days.
Now Australia believes in the moratorium on commercial whaling and the establishment 
 of the Southern Ocean sanctuary for whales that was introduced in 1994. We also consider the International Whaling Commission to be the most appropriate forum for pursuit of improved international efforts to conserve whales.
It was interesting to look at different countries perspectives on the preservation of whales. The Norwegians have a long history of whaling and like whale meat, but I understand they sell the blubber to Japan. The Japanese too are keen to see some whaling continue for trade purposes and for local consumption. So there is still a commercial interest in whale catching and its exploitation. That is to be dealt with when this convention has been through the commission.
While it is appropriate that we look for the establishment of a global whaling sanctuary, we need some ability to allow aboriginal subsistence whaling for those people who still have it as part of their culture—the Chukotka people in Alaska being a case in point. It is about these people and our European reaction to whaling that I wish to speak.
I have a Tasmanian friend by the name of Kay Ilmar, currently living in Barrow, on the north coast of Alaska. She has experienced her first whale `catch' with the Eskimo community. This is someone who has been anti-whaling for most of her life and is suddenly confronted with her stepchildren's heritage. I would like to share her comments with the House. She says:
Dave came home from working late last night at round 10 p.m. to tell me that the Eskimos had brought in a whale and it was on the beach just near here. It is the first whale caught of the Fall Whaling Season and so we walked along to take a look. There were people everywhere, it seemed like half the town was out. I felt a little uneasy we approached, feeling a sadness. It was much bigger than I expected, seemed twelve foot high and apparently measured 44 ft 8 inches long. Big and black, only a few barnacles on the end of the tail. There was a big crowd circling it, the Eskimos seemed so excited, taking photos while it was measured. Children everywhere. I stood amongst them, watching their reactions, absorbing the immensity of it. Imagining it swimming around at peace. The evening was warm, well warm for here. I wasn't cold but I'd rugged up well. 

Then a man with a knife that looked like a big hockey stick, blade on the end, climbed up onto the top and began to cut. Carving big slabs in sections, while others on the beach pierced big hooks into what had been sliced from the top and pulled with rope as the blubber was dragged back off it. The captain of that whaling crew keeps a large proportion, the remainder is distributed to the Eskimo families here and in the outlying villages of the North Slope. It is given, not sold.
I talked about my mixed feeling, about my anti-whaling stand, but still trying to understand and accept the Eskimo heritage. They've been doing this for as long as anyone can remember, it's their life.
She continues:
It's morning now and from the window I can see it, a bloodied carcass on the beach, people still around it. Not much left. Jennifer—
her stepdaughter—
told me earlier that they would use a bulldozer to take it much further down the beach away from the town so that if the polar bears come in to pick over it, they'll be away from the houses. The local news reported the catch on this morning's broadcast.

"Zammit, Paul, MP",IND,1998-04-06,"—I bring forward my bill, to be known as the Sydney Airports Bill 1998, with one, and one only, overarching objective: to take the whole issue of aircraft noise and air pollution away from the political process which is susceptible to 
 political manipulation of winner-take-all stakes with the government of the day determining flight paths to favour their friends and colleagues and dumping on others, even though they may be on the same side, for political expediency. On the day that I resigned from the Liberal Party—that is, 9 February 1998—over the broken promises of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to me and to my electorate prior to the 1996 federal election, I stated the following:
The issue of aircraft noise is beyond politics. It is not about maximising the use of an airport to the detriment of the health, wellbeing and lifestyle of people. It is not about a winner-take-all attitude by political leaders who redesign flight paths to favour themselves and their mates. It is all about justice and equity for the people. The people in every instance must come first.
Before I go any further, I want to pay tribute to the parliamentary staff and Parliamentary Library staff for their tremendous cooperation. I also want to thank the representatives of the peak anti-aircraft noise groups and environmental experts from ECAG, CAAG, SOS, NWRAG as well as Graeme Harrison, Henry Richards, Frank Inga, Rod Hibbard, Peter Hicks, Alan Bonham, Janette Barros, Phillip Anderton, Gretchen Fitzgerald, John Berry, Alister Simington, Phillip Lingard, Sue Hogan, Tony Williams and many others with whom I have consulted, and whom I will acknowledge in my second reading speech.
My bill becomes public today. I welcome any constructive comments, which will be noted and which will be considered for incorporation after my second reading speech. The issue of flight paths at airports around Australia will not only grow in intensity but exacerbate to unmanageable proportions, the likes of which we have never seen before in our nation. Within the next five to 10 years, we will be seeing more and more challenges in the courts and the pitting of Australians against other Australians who are aircraft noise and pollution affected—that is, those who have benefited against those who have been cheated and conned by the government of the day.
I make two observations that are directly relevant to my assertions. Firstly, in regard to the flight paths, it is no longer just a case of 
 the noise of the planes affecting people; it is even more the case that—incontrovertible evidence is piling higher and higher—emissions from these planes may cause, at the very least, respiratory tract infections. In more serious cases, cancer is the result. The medical and psychological effects on children are, on a percentage basis, potentially even worse. Secondly, litigation has already commenced on a major scale—in fact, Woollahra Municipal Council has undertaken action in the Federal Court of Australia against the federal Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) and the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile). It should also be noted that not only have I been subpoenaed but also the Prime Minister has been subpoenaed.
In this bill, I propose the establishment of an independent apolitical authority, consisting of judges drawn from outside the greater Sydney area who would take advice from federal and state public institutions, airlines, airport authorities, local resident groups and regional airline operators. I also wish to state that the member for Calare (Mr Andren) will be seconding this motion. I pause to say that, at the meeting held in my office on Thursday night of last week, as previously mentioned, there was overwhelming and unanimous support for guarantees for the regional airlines to operate at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and great dismay expressed at the attempts by the government to squeeze them out through the back door by a dramatic increase in landing charges and attempts to have them replaced with heavy jets with further deleterious consequences for the people of Sydney.
The proposed authority would consider the advice and evidence tendered to it and then make appropriate planning decisions, particularly on matters related to flight path locations around Sydney and the location and operation of any second major airport. The process, by its very nature, would be an open one and its success would be guaranteed by objective judicial duty. I have thought about this bill for a long time. I have consulted widely, and there seems to be overwhelming support for this bill to be put forward. As the situation 
 can only get worse as more and more flights come in and out of Australia, I urge the government, in the spirit of goodwill, in the spirit of bipartisanship, to have a look at the bill and to try to make sure that the people in Sydney and around Australia who are airport noise affected must come first, before profits.
Bill read a first time.

"Bailey, Fran, MP",LP,1998-04-06,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	 expresses its concern at the number of bank branches which have been closed in both rural and outer suburban areas;
(2)	 calls on the major banks to honour their responsibility to provide services to their customers and the community as well as delivering dividends to their shareholders;
(3)	 further calls on the major banks to adopt a moratorium on any further planned branch closures until such time that alternative services are made available to their customers and that their customers are educated in electronic banking practices;
(4)	 endorses the Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration's investigation into the feasibility of the major banks providing a combined banking kiosk or agency capable of delivering full banking facilities in areas where no bank exists because of branch closure;
(5)	 urges the Government to ensure that departments and agencies are able to utilise alternative banking arrangements such as regional banks, building societies or credit unions where applicable; and
(6)	 notes and supports the Government's financial support of the Credit Care program in rural areas which has provided the means to re-establish financial services through regional banks, credit co-ops and building societies in areas where the major banks have withdrawn services.
I rise to speak to this motion listed under my name. I do so not just to raise awareness but also to put forward some positive suggestions 
 to help alleviate what has become a very serious problem for many small rural towns and a growing number of urban areas. I do so in the hope that members of the opposition will put aside any political differences and support this motion. I hope that I will get bipartisan support because the effect that bank closures are having on people in rural towns and metropolitan areas, on communities and on small business in those communities is now so severe that I believe that all of us in this place must put our political differences aside in order to bring a national focus to this problem and, in doing so, provide some alternatives to the current intransigence of the policy of the major banks in this regard.
There is no doubt that bank closures have significant economic and social costs in our society. There is now abundant evidence available to prove this. The Centre for Australian Financial Institutions report, produced for credit care and entitled Economic and social impacts of the closure of the only bank branch in rural communities, provides a plethora of evidence of the impact bank closures have had in rural towns. I believe the picture described in this report applies to small urban communities as well.
This report reveals that almost one in three branches of major banks in regional Australia, typified by areas like my electorate, have closed between 1993 and 1996. The major banks have displayed a clear lack of concern for the needs of their customers and the communities in which they live by closing the only bank in town, such as the ANZ in Hurstbridge and the Commonwealth in Warburton, and forcing residents to travel long distances to access banking services.
Urban and semi-urban closures, such as the ANZ in South Morang or the Westpac in Diamond Creek, are equally distressing for the frail and elderly in those communities, who need face to face banking services and are unable to cope with electronic banking, which in any event may not cater for their loan, mortgage or pension inquiries. Individuals suffer the practical difficulties of a lack of ready cash or, alternatively, being forced to hold too much cash on their person or in their homes. This poses a real security threat for 
 these people. EFTPOS services from local traders do not alleviate the loss of a branch as they cannot handle deposits or non-transaction banking inquiries, while withdrawal limits are often too restrictive.
Further findings from the CAFI report found that 65 per cent of people indicated that saving was more difficult; there has been a loss of individual investment income from $100 to $2,000 a year due to loss of services; 50 per cent said credit now costs more; 70 per cent said obtaining credit was more difficult; and 75 per cent said getting financial planning advice was harder since closure. The day-to-day problems for small businesses are that they frequently run out of change and therefore lose sales; accumulate high denomination notes; lose customers if they refuse to cash cheques; accumulate cash and cheques because they cannot make deposits, and therefore face an added risk to their security and lost interest; and face an increase in bad debts as customers default on store offered credit.
For many communities the bank has been the hub of business activity. The psychological effect of the loss of a town's only bank is profound and causes a lack of security about the town's future. In fact, the CAFI report says that 90 per cent of respondents indicated they were more pessimistic about the future of their community; and 88 per cent of respondents surveyed from towns where their only bank was closed reported that they spent an average of $320 per month less in their local town because they now do their shopping in the new area where they have to travel to access banking facilities. This effect is being felt in the urban areas as well. Consequent effects of reduced local spending include the physical decline of local shops and streetscape and a decline in business and real estate values. Once again, those with limited transport—the aged, the unemployed and many young mothers—are the worst affected.
The report proved that the loss of branches on some small communities led to a loss of capital—and, of course, there is a direct link between capital investment and economic activity. Thirty per cent of respondents indicated that after the loss of their only bank 
 they had decided not to undertake a loan for either business or housing. Much needed investment will be lost if the major banks maintain their practice of closing small community branches. To put it bluntly: permanent decline in local spending patterns and investment brought on by bank closures spells great uncertainty about the future economic viability of small communities.
I understand and wholeheartedly support the fact that banks have a responsibility to provide healthy dividends to their shareholders. However, they have a responsibility that is equally important, that is, a duty to provide service to customers. I believe that should underpin banking practices. The financial imperative argument put forward by the major banks justifying closures rings hollow as multibillion dollar profits are recorded, staff restructuring continues and fees are increased.
Fergus Shiel's article in the Herald Sun of 29 March 1998, based on leaked memos ordering NAB managers to actively discourage over-the-counter transactions, demonstrates the banks' abrogation of their responsibility to provide service to their customers. I have received hundreds of complaints from within my electorate alone, attended public meetings and listened to angry and disillusioned customers of major banks about this issue. It is about time the major banks realised that communities in rural and outer metropolitan areas have had enough of their lack of concern for customer needs.
The major banks must take note of the findings of the CAFI report and the concern raised in this debate today. I urge the major banks to adopt a moratorium on any future planned closures, to provide alternative services and to educate existing customers in the ways and means of electronic banking. I call on the major banks to cooperate with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration to investigate the feasibility of funding a combined banking kiosk that can deliver full banking services to communities affected by branch closures. These banks already combine to fund the banking ombudsman, and I call on them to fund a banking kiosk in the same manner.
It seems incongruous to me that government departments at all three tiers of government continue to give their business to those major banks that are acting contrary to the interests of people that those same departments or agencies are set up to assist. I strongly encourage smaller regional banks and credit co-ops to seize the initiative from the major banks with dynamic and innovative solutions to the problems created by the desertion of the larger banks. It would be a great fillip to the rural communities if government departments like the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, or local governments, would support these alternatives to the major banks with their business. As an example, I applaud the Bendigo Bank for its community bank proposal, which for some communities may be a solution to their banking needs and provide ongoing community development capital to help sustain our regional communities.
This government's credit care program has already assisted a number of communities by facilitating alternative banking services and, in fact, has provided the lifeline so many rural communities have needed right across the country. The behaviour of the major banks in closing banks in rural, outer metropolitan areas and, increasingly, in urban areas in the manner in which they do, with little notice given to their customers or their traders, and creating the problems I have outlined today, is attracting a ground swell of public opposition.
I urge this House to recognise the impact of these closures on people, on small businesses and on communities, and pressure the banks to cease further closures, alleviate the impact of recent closures and pursue alternatives to support those adversely affected by this destabilising feature of the major banks' commercial behaviour. I commend the motion to the House.

"Wilton, Greg, MP",ALP,1998-04-06,"—I endorse the sentiments submitted to the House by the member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) and 
 draw the House's attention to a recent interesting development in this area whereby the ANZ Bank, in fact, broke ranks with its rivals by admitting recently that the rural and outer suburban population's access to banking services is a real problem that cannot be left to the market alone to fix. There is no doubt a need for innovative solutions to resolve this problem of such legitimate concern to members on both sides of the House.
Such solutions may well include country pharmacists and newsagents—grocery stores, even—paying somewhere between a forecast $18,000 to $30,000 to secure a five-year franchise to become a bank outlet in such a plan as the one, for example, devised by the Colonial State Bank to arrest the decline of rural bank branches. This is a decline which has seen up to one in every three major bank branches in rural communities close between 1993 and 1996, leaving about 600 communities across Australia without access to a financial institution. Of course, the population in rural Australia is similarly declining and the Sydney Morning Herald on 10 February this year said:
In 20 years the number of people living in 215 rural municipalities declined by 12%.
The Australian Bankers Association has similarly told the Financial Institutions and Public Administration Committee that this is a key reason that banks are closing their branches in rural areas. Those of us on this side of the House in particular believe that there is a role for government in assisting rural communities to both survive and prosper. I believe that the rural population is declining by and large due to this government's policies, which have had such a detrimental impact on rural communities.
It is fair to say that non-metropolitan unemployment is high and increasing. In Victoria, between March 1996 and February this year it has increased from 8.5 per cent to 9.4 per cent. In New South Wales it is similar. From March 1996 to February this year it went from 9.8 per cent to 11.9 per cent. As I say, it is federal government cutbacks and closures to Telstra, Medicare and CES offices that have also driven the final nails into the coffins of many of these country towns.
We believe that banks do have by and large a social obligation to ensure the proper provision of banking services and access to banking arrangements, and also to stem job losses in the banking industry. It is a concern to us and should be a concern to banks.	Mr Graeme McEwen is a prominent Melbourne barrister specialising in commercial law who has acted both for and against banks. He is a nephew of the former Prime Minister Sir John McEwen and a candidate in the next election for the seat of McEwen. He said in a recent press release:
More is required than `window dressing': banks have now closed or reduced hours of service (or foreshadowed doing so), for example, in Diamond Creek, Hurstbridge, Warburton, Healesville and Wallan. No part of the electorate seems immune.
He goes on to say:
We should not meekly accept `rationalisation' of the traditional bank branch network in circumstances where ongoing pressure exists by banks and government to implement the Wallis report recommendations permitting bank mergers. Are the banks to be required to offer nothing?
He goes on:
As the endorsed Labor candidate for an electorate in which bank closures and reduced hours of service are now becoming widespread, I can say that I have been advocating within the . . . Party the adoption of a more far-reaching and meaningful remedy.
Those of us on this side of the House can attest to the fact that that is the case. I am always amazed when I see those on the other side of the House advocating more interventionist style policies because the federal government has been telling us now for quite some time that the market always knows best and advocates more Thatcherite, laissez-faire policies. I refer to the Treasurer and member for Higgins, Mr Costello. That is what he says about banks and regulation. In his post-Wallis comment, he said:
The Government endorses the Financial System Inquiry recommendation that financial institutions (operating in a competitive setting) should be free to set their fees and charges based generally on the costs of provision.
That sounds to me like an open invitation for banks to charge rural customers whatever they want, yet the ABA has affirmed in its submission to the FIPA committee on this inquiry 
 into regional and rural banking that the cost of providing a service in a rural area is higher than it is in the city. On Wallis and government banking regulation, the Treasurer has said:
Our regulatory arrangements must keep up. Existing arrangements do not treat all new market structures and activities equally.
Nowhere in the Treasurer's response to Wallis, which went on to discuss at length the need to maximise the international competitiveness of our financial services industries, has he mentioned much at all about intervention in the finance area to help rural Australia. One can really only ask whether the coalition is serious about this motion, or is it perhaps just an exercise in profile raising? Given this government's performance on regional development and the way the bush has suffered under it, I believe that country and regional areas will have cause to question its agenda in this regard.
In the last three years credit unions have flourished in the bush and have filled part of the gap created by the departure of banks from country towns. Some 39 new credit unions have opened during that time under the scheme established by the former Labor government known as the credit care program, a program which, I am pleased to say, continues to enjoy the support of those on both sides of this House.
I conclude by saying that this is an issue primarily about equity. The death of country towns as we know them in Australia—the land of sweeping plains and small country pubs and farmers, who many say are the backbone of our country—is of great concern to us all. The elderly, the disabled and the recipients of government benefits in rural communities do need ongoing access to banking services where there is a smiling face and cash still changes hands in some environment of established rapport and trust. Sure, smart cards, the Internet and phone banking might well be the way of the future, but they do not solve all of the problems.
I believe that the Financial Institutions and Public Administration Committee has raised some of the community's concerns and will no doubt continue to work towards a solution 
 so that rural Australia is able to access some decent banking services in the future. I have heard and read of government members talking about working towards fixing the problem. However, I hope those statements are not politically motivated and aimed at just simply pleasing rural constituencies.
This government's actions so far in relation to the equity and banking issue provide me with only some confidence that the right thing will occur in rural and regional Australia. As public companies, banks have a duty to act in the best interest of shareholders but they must also accept a duty to their customers, regardless of where they live in Australia, because, after all, it is these customers who have made these profits possible for the banks.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Banking</title>,Private Members' Business,5,1,speech
"Hawker, David, MP",LP,1998-04-06,"—In seconding this motion, I would like to start with some of the comments that the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) made because I was a little disappointed about some of them, given that he is deputy chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration and has been actively involved in the inquiry that we are currently running into alternative banking for regional areas. I found it a little offensive when he asked whether the government is serious about this motion and the thrust of this motion.
I would have thought that the fact that the government made the reference to the Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration is clear proof that the government is very serious about this. Furthermore, what is expected from this committee and what is expected from the report that will be delivered to this parliament later in the year will provide the framework for some very clear government action on dealing with what is a very serious problem and one that the member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) has outlined very eloquently in relation to what is happening in so many parts of regional Australia. Therefore, I take exception to those comments.
I also point out that when the honourable member for Isaacs makes reference to what can be done to assist rural communities, any problems that he wishes to highlight today 
 have their origins back in the days of a Labor administration. I was also rather curious to see him quoting unemployment figures, comparing regional Victoria with regional New South Wales, given that New South Wales has a state Labor government and the figures in New South Wales were worse. I do not know what that says about his colleagues in the state government, but I do not think they would be too flattered by that comparison.
As has been pointed out, there has been a very serious decline in the provision of banking services to people in regional areas. One in three bank branches have closed in the years between 1993 and 1996. Six hundred communities around Australia no longer have a bank branch. The inquiry that I have already mentioned follows on from recommendation No. 96 from the Wallis report, which said that governments should examine alternative means of providing low cost transaction services. I think what we are already finding with the Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration is that there is very real interest in this whole issue. In fact, the committee has received more than 100 submissions from every state and territory in Australia. It will be visiting every state and the Northern Territory and taking further evidence from the authors of these submissions. I think that all honourable members would be pleased to know that we are taking this inquiry very seriously.
We do recognise that competition has been driving change in the provision of banking services but, as has been pointed out, there is a very real concern that there is a gap appearing in the provision of services, particularly for elderly people and certain groups of people who cannot easily change to some of the newer services such as ATMs or phone banking. We also know about the effect on the communities, contrary to what has been said by some, including the ABA, the Australian Bankers Association, that when the last bank leaves town, it may be as a result of declining business but it also has a dramatic effect on that town when it does go. One example that came before the committee shows that when a bank closes, the super 
 market's turnover drops immediately by 20 per cent.
As my time is limited, I again reinforce the very important work that credit care is doing, which has already been mentioned. I also highlight the fact that the major banks have been rather slow to respond to the inquiry, which again reinforces a poor public perception of their attitude towards their customers. However, we are seeing some more positive signs. I am hoping that, as the interest in this inquiry continues to gain momentum, we will see a much more positive response and a bit of lateral thinking from the major banks. I support this motion. I hope that it will help to lead to better services for people in rural and regional Australia.

"Brown, Bob, MP",ALP,1998-04-06,"—This Thursday, 9 April is the 100th anniversary of the birth of an outstanding, talented and courageous American, Paul Robeson. Paul Robeson fought against discrimination, racism and intolerance. He fought courageously for peace, freedom, friendship, dignity and civil rights. He said he had never experienced full human dignity until he visited the Soviet Union prior to World War II and after witnessing the racism and anti-semitism of Nazi Germany. It had a profound impact on him. It could not have been otherwise. He was a victim of the blind hatred and anti-communist hysteria of the McCarthyist era.
ABC Classic FM broadcast the Robeson story yesterday. It will broadcast some of his songs on Thursday morning. I congratulate Dr Hannah Middleton and the Paul Robeson Centenary Committee for ensuring that this anniversary would be recognised. A Paul Robeson exhibition will be held in the Sydney Town Hall from 8 to 14 April and in Melbourne's Percy Grainger Museum from 16 to 19 April. A concert tribute will be held in 
 the Tom Mann Theatre in Sydney this Thursday night, with Margaret Roadknight and others, and in the Melba Hall, Melbourne, on Sunday, 19 April. Everyone should try to attend these events to honour a great human being, a great American negro, a great fighter for peace, a great artist and entertainer, and a great, great man.

"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,1998-04-06,"—My question is to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. I ask whether the minister recalls telling the House last Wednesday:
There are 10,000 more Commonwealth-funded student places in universities this year than there were in Labor's last year.
Why then does this document—the higher education funding report—issued by the 
 minister himself last week, show a drop of nearly 5,000 in Commonwealth-funded student places between 1996 and 1998? Minister, haven't you been caught out red-handed misleading the House?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Education</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,question
"Kemp, Dr David, MP",LP,1998-04-06,"—Mr Speaker, it is very nice to see the member for Werriwa getting up and asking a question on education. There have not been too many of them. I was very interested to see Brian Toohey's comments in the Sun-Herald  yesterday.
—Mr Speaker, on a point of order—
—Wait until I call you before you make your point of order.
—On the question of relevance, I do not need a character reference from the minister; I need an answer to the specific question I asked.
—There is no point of order. The member for Werriwa will resume his seat.
—As Brian Toohey wrote in yesterday's Sun Herald —
—Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order which goes to the question of relevance. The question was whether or not the minister misled the House; not Mr Toohey's article. I ask that you bring him back to the point of the question.
—The member for Batman will resume his seat.
—Further to the point of order: the member has just drawn to our attention some of the substance of that question which, in my view, I would submit to you, makes the answer wide open in terms of relevance.
—The member for O'Connor will resume his seat. The minister is entirely in order. At the moment he has said three words since the last point of order, so I suggest that we might hear what the minister is saying.
—He has said at least 23 words, and they are not relevant.
—I did not count them precisely, but I suggest that we let the minister have another go.
Opposition members interjecting—
—I ask members to remain silent.
—This goes to the issue of education that I was asked about. Brian Toohey said yesterday:
Beazley's supporters argue that Latham would be in a better position to criticise—
that is, his own side—
if he had not been such a disappointment since being appointed Shadow Education Minister last year.
—Answer the question!
—The minister will resume his seat. When we have some silence, I will call the Leader of the Opposition on a point of order.
—On a point of order: now that we have actually heard what he wanted to read, it has absolutely no relationship to the question of university student numbers.
—The Leader of the Opposition would be aware that, over the years, ministers have generally been allowed a fair amount of latitude in their introduction to their response. I suggest the minister now respond to the question.
—Mr Speaker, let me put the facts very clearly on the record because it is quite clear that the member for Werriwa has not done sufficient research to actually determine what the situation is in universities. This year, there are an extra 4,000 fully funded Commonwealth places in universities. There are some 10,000 more fully funded Commonwealth undergraduate places in universities this year than there were in Labor's last year.
—That is not what your own report says. Read your own report.
—Tell the truth!
—The member for Hunter will remain silent.
—Overall, there are some 19,000 more undergraduate students in universities in 1998 than there were in 1996.
—Tell the truth!
—The member for Hunter will remain silent.
—The Commonwealth government's objective is to expand the number of student places available to school leavers in Australia and to expand the resources available to universities, and we are doing that by shifting the balance between government-funded places and private funding of places in universities. This year, Australian universities will have more students in them than ever before and will be better funded than ever before. In fact, between 1995 and 1998 the total revenue of Australian universities is some $550 million higher this year than it was in your last full year of office. So don't come into this House and try, with your constant deceit, to tell the people of Australia that this government is restricting places in Australian universities or restricting funding. This government is all about expanding opportunities for young Australians and, if you had done a bit more work on your portfolio, you would know that that is the fact and you would stop trying to mislead the Australian people.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Education</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,answer
"Bevis, Arch, MP",ALP,1998-04-06,"—My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Minister, do you remember your statements in this place that Centrelink will give all job seekers better access to facilities, and that you have an understanding with the major agencies that job seekers, whether they are eligible or not, will get help? Minister, have you seen comments by the Mitchelton Centrelink manager, Ms Kay Albretch, in Brisbane, that her staff will be unable to help job seekers unless they are receiving unemployment benefits and `job brokers wont' have a lot of time for those that don't qualify'? Minister, is it not the case that from 1 May job brokers like Employment National, Drake, Mission Australia and the Salvation Army are under no legal or contractual obligations to help find jobs for those not on benefits? Minister, if the Mitchelton Centrelink manager can be frank and honest, why can't you?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Employment Services</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,question
"Kemp, Dr David, MP",LP,1998-04-06,"—I am sure that many inaccurate statements are made by particular people; they are mainly made on the other side of the chamber, I may say. But I prefer to rely on the nationally stated policies and the contracts which my department has with Centrelink. The fact of the matter is that Centrelink will be providing free access—universal free access—to all job seekers to access the free vacancy base—
—Oh, the terminal?
—The computer!
—The terminal, the job vacancies. This is a minor thing: that people have access to a greatly expanded job vacancy database? That is the first thing they get free access to. The second thing is that they get free access to the other facilities which Centrelink provides—free computers to do their job resumes; free photocopiers to copy 
 their resumes; free telephones to phone the employers, so that they can make contact with any employer who has a job on the Centrelink database.
The next thing, of course, that they can do is to access any of the agencies that have got on that database job vacancies which are not clearly restricted to longer term people on benefits. Of course, there may well be cases where employers and job agencies are negotiating with each other to place longer term unemployed people, and they may wish to indicate that on the job vacancy database. But, apart from those particular cases, anyone looking for a job, whether they are in a job, even if they are not on unemployment benefit, will be able to access these free services through Centrelink.
The major job agencies have already made it clear that they will be offering their services to anyone who comes to them, because their undertaking to employers—and, indeed, their own self-interest as agencies—will be to say to employers that they can place with that employer the best person to fill that vacancy. The Job Network will be offering greatly improved services to unemployed people.
—What services?
—The member for Hotham!
—It will have a much larger job vacancy database than has existed in the past. And the government is taking further steps to ensure that the size of that job vacancy database is expanded. The Job Network will provide many more points of access for unemployed people. The current CES has some 296 offices around Australia available for basic job matching services; the Job network will have over 1,400—1,400 such points of access. Above all else, members of the Job Network, unlike anything that has gone before, will be competing with each other to get unemployed people into jobs. They will be paid for those basic job matching services when they get an unemployed person into a job.
How different this is to the system supported by the member for Hotham and the member for Batman when they were in office—a system into which was poured hundreds of 
 millions of hard earned taxpayers' dollars into a system which had in relation to its major program a four per cent success rate and cost $143,000 a job; a system that almost bankrupted Australia. We are putting in place a system which will provide unemployed people with the best job service searching that they have ever had.

"Fahey, John, MP",LP,1998-04-06,"—It is always a pleasure to be able to have the opportunity in this House and outside to recognise an achievement by one of my constituents. I believe the honourable member for Forrest is, on this occasion, referring to media reports that have emanated from a publication by the honourable member for Werriwa. That publication is entitled Civilising Global Capital . I have noted in respect of a chapter entitled `A Role for Government' that there is a clear difference highlighted in the different approaches taken by those opposite on the use of proceeds of assets sales. The member for Werriwa highlights what they did in government and he highlights what he says should happen. Under a subheading in that chapter `Ownership Neutrality', the member for Werriwa says:
The liberalisation of capital markets has allowed governments to shift their fixed capital investments from markets featuring competitive private capital to the enhancement of human capital.
It is difficult to know first up just what that means but I believe that what the member for Werriwa was saying—
Opposition members interjecting—
—Let me put it into simple English: there are better ways for government to spend their scare public capital—for example, on welfare, education and health—rather than spending that public capital on running businesses. Businesses are run by what the member for Werriwa calls competitive private capital which we on this side of the House are happy to say means `run by the private sector'. The member for Werriwa also goes on to say:
I do not see a lasting role for the state public sector in the ownership of large slabs of industrial capital.
He further says:
It is possible for the public sector to vacate its ownership role without a loss of economic efficiency or social equity.
They are very sound principles. We on this side of the House agree with those statements by the member for Werriwa. But the member for Werriwa goes on to concede that these were not the principles which drove the former government. When Labor were in government, they did not abide by these principles when they dealt with privatisation 
 policies. Labor in government were driven by what the member for Werriwa says were `the exigencies of the budget bottom line'. The government agrees with the member for Werriwa: Labor privatised for all the wrong reasons. They were not interested in retiring debt; they were interested in funding recurrent expenditure. The member for Werriwa goes on to say `that questions of ownership should not be determined through fixed ideological preferences for either private or public sector activity.
Opposition members interjecting—
—Members of the Opposition will remain silent. If you remain silent, we can hear the answer. At the moment there is too much noise in the House.
—I take a point of order on relevance. We appreciate the lecture—
—The Leader of the Opposition will direct his point of order.
—but this goes to a question of relevance. He was asked a general question and he has devoted himself entirely to this. If this point needs to be made, perhaps he will tell us about the impact of the social bonus he intends from selling the people's assets in Telstra.
—There is no point of order. The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. He is no longer making a point of order. The minister will draw his answer to a conclusion.
—The relevance is that the member for Werriwa is relevant and the rest of the frontbench are not relevant when it comes to policy. On the very question of whether or not questions of ownership should be determined through fixed ideological preferences, it is clear that the bulk of the members on the front bench of the Labor Party believe in ideological preferences. All I can say is that the government welcomes the contribution by the honourable member for Werriwa. We agree with most of what he says. Clearly, the rest of his colleagues are backward thinking; their role model is Arthur Calwell.

That the bill be now read a second time.
Guaranteeing workers' entitlements in the event of company insolvency is one of the most important reforms yet to be undertaken by an Australian government. Australia has a fine record when it comes to the introduction of social legislation. We were one of the first countries in the world to introduce worker's compensation, and we were the first to grant child endowment payments to mothers and introduce long service leave to workers. And yet, when it comes to guaranteeing workers' entitlements against an employer's insolvency or providing them with the utmost priority against all other creditors, Australia has neither. The rest of the world has passed us by. In this respect, our proud tradition of social reforms stands diminished.
Guaranteeing workers' entitlements is a social reform for our time. The recent tragic stories of the miners at Cobar and Goulburn and of the meatworkers at Grafton remind us of that. None of us needs to be convinced that Australians have never before felt less secure in their jobs. As Asia's economic woes begin to have their effect on our shores, business insolvencies are destined to increase dramatically.
This bill seeks to reform an aspect of Australian industrial relations that can no longer be set aside. We can no longer enjoy the luxury of sitting in this House and expressing our sympathy to workers left without their entitlements and saying: `Oh yes, something needs to be done to stop this happening in the future,' and then wait for somebody else to do it. With this bill, I am doing some 
 thing about it. With this bill I am giving the government and other members the opportunity to do something about it as well.
As it stands at the moment, at least 3,000 Australian workers are owed roughly $20 million in their legal entitlements due to company insolvency. This is a disgraceful figure, but it should not be a surprising one. It is estimated that 13,000 businesses and companies become insolvent each year in this country, leaving at least 20,000 workers out of a job. Of course not all of these ex-employees are left without their accrued entitlements but a good many are.
In 1993 the Labor government, supported by the coalition and by both unions and employer groups, relegated the Commissioner of Taxation to the category of `unsecured creditor', thereby improving the position of unpaid employees for priority of payment in the event of an employer's insolvency. This was an important and commendable reform. However, in hindsight, it has not proved as successful as was first hoped. Employees have continued to miss out on their entitlements for the simple reason that, if a bankrupt enterprise no longer has any assets, the workers, whatever their position in an order of priority, do not benefit.
The  Employee Protection (Wage Guarantee) Bill 1998  aims to rectify this situation by establishing a scheme to guarantee the payment of wages and other liabilities in the event of insolvency. Under the scheme, no Australian worker need ever again be left without entitlements should his or her employer collapse into insolvency. Unless exempt under the legislation, all employers must take out and maintain a policy of wage protection insurance for their work force with an approved insurer. The Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner will administer the scheme. In the event of an employer's insolvency, workers will be insured for unpaid wages, annual leave or long service leave, liabilities resulting from the termination of employment without notice or with insufficient notice and liabilities for repayment of any amounts paid by the employee to the employer for training in a particular trade or profession. One of the most important aspects 
 of the scheme is that it will include a bad risk cross-subsidisation system to help offset the concerns of employers and the insurance industry.
I am well aware that there will always be some employers who are perceived by the insurance industry as potential bad risks. If this concern were allowed to manifest itself without regulation, some employers would find it very difficult to obtain insurance cover or, if they did obtain it, it would be prohibitively expensive. As a way around this problem, the bill requires approved insurers participating in the scheme, along with the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner, to participate in a bad risk cross-subsidisation system.
Under such a program, an insurer would be required to accept an insurance proposal—even from an employer considered a bad risk—at a rate of premium not exceeding a maximum fixed by the commissioner. In order to mitigate the harshness of this from the insurer's point of view, the bad risk cross-subsidisation scheme would allow for the transfer of the burden of bad risks away from the individual insurer to the total body of insurers.
Critics of my bill have argued that it would place an unfair extra financial burden on all employers to make up for the unscrupulous actions of a few. My response to that is twofold. Firstly, I do not consider the estimated extra 0.1 to 0.3 per cent of an employer's total wages bill that they would be required to contribute to participate in the scheme to be an unfair burden. It would certainly not be a burden of the stature that has been discussed: impeding a business' growth, the hiring of their staff or indeed hastening their own insolvency. Secondly, all employers are members of a corporate community. As a community they have a number of social responsibilities and one of those is seeing that all of their workers, in return for their labour, receive the entitlements that they are owed. Obviously we have seen that, at the present time, there are occasions when that responsibility is not being met. Employers have to work as one to address this issue, to live up 
 to their responsibilities. Participation in this scheme should be seen in that respect.
However, if the government is uneasy about socialising the burdens of insolvency by passing the responsibility of risk on to all members of the corporate community, it has a number of options open to it. One would be to amend my bill to require participation in the scheme only by those employers who did not enter formal arrangements to place their employee's entitlements in trust. Another would be to amend this bill to require lending institutions to pay for maintaining their privileged position at the top of the creditor preference queue. If the government were to underpin my scheme by firstly taking contributions from the banks, payments required from employers would be substantially reduced.
Since I introduced this bill into the House a fortnight ago, the response I have received has been extremely positive. I have received many expressions of support from members, not only from my own side but also from the government's side as well as from the community at large. Australians, not just those workers who have lost their entitlements but I think the great majority of the people we represent, want to put an end to this sort of unfairness taking place. I think most of us recognise that fact. By supporting this bill, members can put this vexing problem behind this country once and for all. As long as this reform remains undone, thousands of ordinary Australian workers and their families will continue to be failed by a system they look to for justice, fairness and equity.
The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said just last week, in relation to legislative reform:
There'll be people running around saying, `Oh, don't do it—it's too hard'. I mean, you can't go on forever saying that. We know everything's a bit difficult if it's a big reform, but the Australian people in the long run will respect you and support you if you have a go.
I invite the Prime Minister and the members of his government to heed his advice and act on this matter with the utmost urgency. The opposition, I know, stands ready to give him that  support. I commend  this  bill  to  the House.

—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",REPS,<title>EMPLOYEE PROTECTION (WAGE GUARANTEE) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Charles, Bob, MP",LP,1998-04-06,"—I rise this afternoon for my contribution to this debate firstly to thank the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) for bringing this private member's bill, the Employee Protection (Wage Guarantee) Bill 1998 , in front of the parliament. This is an issue that has occupied her mind—and indeed, I suspect, her heart—for some time. It is an issue that she has raised in this place at a prior time, so it is not with surprise that I found that the member had brought in front of us a bill to consider as a private member's bill.
I think private members' bills are very important. I know in my six years in opposition in this place I brought in front of the parliament two private members' bills and they were relatively early in my time here. The first of those was to introduce voluntary membership of associations. While the then government refused to even allow significant debate on that bill, when we came to government, with the passage of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and its enforcement on 31 December 1996, I got my wish and fulfilled the intent of my private member's bill, into which I had put so much time and effort. We got it and we have it today. You can see it in every newspaper in the land today as we debate the waterfront issue.
The second of my private members' bills came good too, but in a strange sort of way. I proposed that what was then section 299(1)(d)(ii) of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 be excised because it said, in essence, that it was an offence to say something naughty about a commissioner of the Industrial Relations Commission or the commission itself. It said: if you do, then you may pay a fine or go to gaol or both. Members will recall the High Court case of Nationwide News wherein the High Court found that that section of the Industrial Relations Act was in fact in violation of the constitution because—as I had reported to this House on a number of occasions—it violated freedom of speech 
 and freedom of the press. So the then Labor Party in government turned around and introduced its own amendment to the Industrial Relations Act to take care of that disparity which I had brought to their attention on an earlier occasion. Two bills, two wins.
I wish the honourable member for Prospect well too. I noted that in her contribution she said—I assume in all sincerity—that, if the bill requires amendment, if there is a different approach that will work better, she would be happy to participate and accept that, as long as we could get something that worked. I happen to agree with the member for Prospect: I think this is an important issue; I think we need to address it. I think, for too long, we have not totally addressed it.
To give credit where credit is due, I acknowledge that the last Labor government did improve the situation somewhat—and I have forgotten the year. I think an amendment was brought in in 1995 in order to give employees a kick up the ladder in terms of unsecured creditors—
—It was 1993.
—over the top of the Commissioner of Taxation. I thank the honourable member for Prospect for her interjection of 1993, my memory being not the best there. But, in any case, as I said, I acknowledge the fact that you did that in government.
I will also tell you, as you know and I know, that you did not go any further because this is an extremely difficult issue. I am sure that the honourable member for Prospect and, indeed, the honourable member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), who will follow me in this brief debate, would acknowledge that there is nothing about this issue that is easy. I have read a Lateline transcript from a couple of weeks ago. Participating in those discussions were union officials and my colleague the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), and I have to say they were held without acrimony. In those discussions, everybody agreed that legally this is very difficult.
I will tell you a couple of the reasons why I think the issue is difficult. I agree with you that employees have their rights. If they are 
 entitled to wages, they are entitled to them. If they are entitled to other benefits which they have accrued during their term of employment, they are entitled to them. They should be legally protected—and, to the extent to which we can, they are at the moment. That is what makes this such a heartbreaking and difficult issue.
There are other individuals who form groups, if you will, who also have the same kinds of rights, and they face the same kind of difficulty. One of those groups is contractors and subcontractors who exist not just in building construction but across increasingly broad reaches of industry. These are the true small business people of Australia. They are not shopkeepers, but they frequently provide services. They might be computer programmers. They might be carpenters, plumbers or bricklayers. They might have and drive a small truck. They might, indeed, mow people's lawns or clean people's houses as a small independent contractor or subcontractor working for a larger collective.
From my own experience, I can tell you that it is very tough when, under the terms of a contract, if you have gotten very far into it, someone in the chain goes belly up; it makes life pretty difficult. I feel absolutely for the people at Cobar. I have felt for myself as a building contractor over almost a couple of decades when I had a few—very few, thank goodness; but every once in a while, you make a mistake and pick the wrong one—go belly up. And chances are that you have not held enough money out of the subcontract, because they have been pushing you hard for payment because obviously they have needed payment, and that is why they went bust.
The other part of the issue is you then have to find someone else to finish the work that they were doing, and that is always more expensive than it would have been with the original contractor or subcontractor. I have lost tens of thousands of dollars in my time in business because people went bankrupt and there was no money to pay. The third lot that I refer to is other unsecured creditors who come further down the line than do employees who are on wages or, indeed, do the Australian Commissioner of Taxation.
This bill provides employee protection against employer insolvency by establishing a scheme of wage protection insurance. The scheme would require an employer to insure its work force with an insurer approved by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. Insurance then would form the basis of employee protection in circumstances where an employer becomes insolvent and cannot pay accrued entitlements.
`Insolvency' is broadly defined to include circumstances where a company or an individual is unable to pay debts but formal steps towards insolvency have not been taken. Under the bill the protection afforded to employees extends to an employer's liability for unpaid wages, payment in lieu of notice where termination of employment has occurred without notice or with insufficient notice, annual leave and long service leave, and repayment of any premium paid by an employee to an employer for training expenses.
I am advised that the bill is probably constitutionally invalid, at least to the extent that it purports to rely on the Commonwealth's powers to make laws with respect to insurance, bankruptcy and insolvency. The Commonwealth's constitutional power to make laws in respect of corporations would support the bill to the extent to which it required employers who were corporations to take out employee protection insurance.
Similarly, the Commonwealth's power to make law with respect to the territories would support the scheme in respect of unincorporated employers therein. However, the bill purports to apply to all employers in Australia, other than Commonwealth, state, territory or local government employers. To the extent that the bill purports to apply to unincorporated employers in the states, it is beyond power.
The bill defines `wages' to include `any payment made, or to be made, by an employer to or for the benefit of an employee under a contract of employment'. The definition of `wages' would not capture the payment to be made to an employee pursuant to a federal award and may not cover payments pursuant to an Australian workplace agreement or certified agreement. Accordingly, such entitle 
 ments would not be indemnified. An example of an entitlement that would not be guaranteed is severance pay due to an employee pursuant to a federal award or agreement. The bill, therefore, does not achieve its stated purpose of wage protection.
The bill defines the concepts of bankruptcy and insolvency broadly, so the bill would apply to some entities that would not be regarded as bankrupt or insolvent under the Bankruptcy Act 1966 or the Corporations Law. In other words, formal steps to effect insolvency or bankruptcy need not be taken before an employee becomes entitled to pursue a claim. This means that an employee could make a claim against an insurer simply because an employer is unable to pay its debts at a given point in time.
For instance, an employee with accrued annual leave might become aware that his or her employer is unable to pay a debt in the short term. The bill would permit the employee to make a claim for payment in respect of that annual leave in anticipation of a possible insolvency by the employer. Thus, the scheme proposed by the bill has the potential to become an alternative avenue to the enforcement of wages through court processes. The bill also contemplates and fails to safeguard against frivolous or vexatious claims, that is, claims for payment in circumstances where a company is temporarily unable to pay its debts as opposed to being insolvent.
In her second reading speech to the bill, the member for Prospect made the assertion that the money required from employers, not only to insure their workers but also to cover the scheme's administration costs, would be an extra one-tenth of one per cent of their total wages bill. I am advised that it is not possible even in general terms to assess the validity of the honourable member's statement in the absence of information as to the number of employers to be covered by the scheme and the relative risks involved. Even if that information were available, the process of verification would still take a significant period. This gives rise to the question of how the honourable member made her calculations and whether they have any real basis.
While some overseas countries have established wage guarantee schemes, I am advised there is no example of any other country introducing a compulsory insurance scheme along the lines of that proposed by the member for Prospect. I have examined the United Kingdom bill and the ramifications of those several acts that work together to form the basis of insurance for employees. I have to say that it is on the basis of both employees and employers contributing and there being very strict limited liability.
I asked the question as to why Great Britain agreed. The United States has no similar system and most major industrialised Western countries—except Western Europe—have no such system. I am advised such a system in Western Europe, with its long tradition and history of socialisation of the work force—that is, labour coming together and providing a complete bureaucratic structure as the counterpoint to the bureaucratic structure of capital—does not exist outside of Western Europe but certainly does there.
I am afraid I have to say that the financial burden placed on good employers to subsidise bad employers has the possibility of becoming inequitable. If insurers are required to issue premiums and rates not exceeding a maximum set by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, then we may be squeezing insurers inequitably. There will be additional administration and cost burdens placed on employers by this act, and no-one denies that.
The government's response is that it will explore this issue at the labour ministers council on 1 May and take into account all the words of the member for Prospect. The minister and the government will consult with the business community on the totality of this issue.

"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,1998-04-06,"—I have great pleasure in rising to support the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) in her initiative in introducing the Employee Protection (Wage Guarantee) Bill 1998 . Somebody had to act in this matter. The government should have acted; it is a pity they did not. Their attention and focus in industrial relations is elsewhere, where they pursue their particular obsessions.
There are thousands upon thousands of Australian employees losing not only their jobs but their legally guaranteed entitlements. This has been highlighted at Cobar and it has happened at Woodlawn near Goulburn, Grafton, Rockhampton, Yeppoon and in the member for Prospect's own electorate, and there are tens of other examples affecting thousands of other workers who have not had the publicity. Somebody had to act, and it is to the credit of the member for Prospect that she took the initiative.
What we have here is not just a grave injustice which is apparent but a grave injustice which has now come starkly to our attention in a way that it has not done until very recently. The publicity surge, which I welcome, has in fact occurred only in the last months. It does not mean that this is a new problem, it is the new face of an old problem, but we all know it exists. It will not ultimately be resolved until the government acts to resolve it.
I do not accept many of the criticisms made of the bill by the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), but I accept, and the member for Prospect accepts, that this bill is probably not perfect. I do not think all of the criticisms that are made are right. It is a typical brief one gets from a public servant when you say, `Raise all the things that might possibly be wrong with this bill.' Australia has a very efficient Public Service and they very loyally serve the government of the day, so they raise all the queries that anybody could imagine. But they stretched some of them a long way, contrary to the legal advice that the member for Prospect has received about many of the constitutional aspects and other elements of this bill.
Some initiative was necessary. The government was not and is still not acting. The member for Prospect's initiative is the best proposal before the people of Australia today and deserves support so that it can be debated in this House. I welcome the fact that the initiative was taken to ensure that it was debated and that the member for La Trobe—notwithstanding his later remarks which were very negative—did address and recognise the seriousness of the issue in his opening state 
 ment. I welcome that and I think that would probably reflect the views of the vast majority of members of this House. In speaking to this bill and in supporting the initiative by the member for Prospect to the government, what we are trying to say here today is: do not get involved in a great debate about who is to blame, do not get involved in a lot of rhetorical flourishes about this issue, do not just stand there; do something about this problem—thousands of Australians are depending upon you.
We have the most alarming of double standards being applied whereby it is clear on the public record from the government that substantial amounts of money will be available from this government to assist on the waterfront to fund people who are not redundant but who are likely to be sacked by their employer. The government think it is a good thing that they should be sacked, so they provide money to fund that. But what do these people who have lost their jobs because their employer can no longer afford to keep them—the employer has gone into some form of insolvency or bankruptcy and ceased operations—hardworking Australians who have paid their taxes, get from their government? Nothing. You cannot feed your family on sympathy, and that is all these people have got. It is good that they have got sympathy, but it will not pay the bills, it will not pay the mortgage, it will not pay the rent, it will not feed the kids.
What do we have today, just before this bill comes up? We have the government putting out a press release, from which the member for La Trobe loyally quoted, saying that this matter will be taken to the meeting of ministers responsible for industrial relations and labour matters on 1 May. I do not object to it being taken there, but I do object if it is as it appears—merely a ruse to avoid a concrete response.
To the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)—who has responded to me in this place and said that the government would give a response to the concerns of the workers from Cobar, Woodlawn, Grafton and others who met him—and to the government my statement is: do not just put this problem before that 
 meeting; put your proposal before that meeting. Do not just turn up at the meeting and say, `Look at this difficult question.' It is the government's job to go to that meeting with a concrete proposal, recommend it to the state ministers, seek the cooperation of the state ministers and, if the state ministers do not cooperate, act in any event in so far as it is within the Commonwealth's jurisdiction to do so—and that is a long way.
The Commonwealth could act on all the matters that are currently of notoriety because they all relate to corporations; each one of them relates to a problem of a constitutional corporation about which the Commonwealth can legislate. It may be that there are some unincorporated bodies about which Commonwealth legislation will not apply, in which case we should seek the cooperation of the states. But every one of the cases on the public record relates to a constitutional corporation and the Commonwealth can and should act about them.
This bill deserves the serious consideration of this parliament. The member for Prospect deserves the gratitude of this parliament for taking the initiative that nobody else would take. It should be the catalyst for concrete government action so that the problems confronted by the 3,000 workers, who have been publicly identified as losing $20 million of their entitlement, can never happen again. The government should take up this bill, improve it if it wishes and bring back its version. It will have our support for expedited handling of it through the parliament. Let us take it off the political agenda and say: this is a problem that we as Australians cannot allow to continue. We were sent here by people who are losing their rights and who expect us to act in their interests and on their behalf. The member for Prospect has given us the chance to do so with her bill. I congratulate her for so doing.

"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,1998-04-06,"—I move: 
That this House:
(1)	 agrees that former Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating's unsuccessful attempt to implement substantial tax reform in 1985 was an acknowledgment of the contemporary failings of the taxation system;
(2)	 recognises that the former Labor Government failed over 13 years to implement substantial tax reform;
(3)	 agrees that the Government's achievement in fixing Labor's $10 billion budget black hole proves that this Government has the resolve and the courage to implement significant and sensible taxation reform; and
(4)	 notes that the Opposition has no plans for substantial taxation reform and favours a return to the tax and spend policies of the past that led to high interest rates, high unemployment and low growth that had it been allowed to go unchecked could have dangerously exposed Australia in the environment of an Asian financial crisis.
—No-one to second it. What a shame.
—The parliamentary secretary can second the motion.
—It does not need seconding yet; it can be seconded when you conclude your statement.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. My seconder has arrived. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham)—the Labor Party's man in the iron mask—knows that there is something rotten with the tax system. In his book Civilising Global Capital: New Thinking For the Australian Labor Party  the member for Werriwa refers to the narrowness of the current indirect tax base, which does not cover services, and refers to the advantages of taxing consumption over income. At least he has demonstrated that he is prepared to abandon the failed policies which the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, oversaw when Minister for Finance and which he wants Australia to return to.
It is not news to Australians that our taxation system is obsolete and in a shambles. 
 The Labor Party have known it too. Treasurer Keating knew it at the taxation summit in 1985 when he supported a 12½ per cent consumption tax. The Labor Party cannot and will not deal with the realities of the tax system because it requires too much discipline and too many tough decisions need to be made. Already the Leader of the Opposition and his team of tired hacks have advocated a return to failed tax policies of old—for example, a re-run of R&D syndicates.
The members for Hotham (Mr Crean) and Gellibrand (Mr Willis) and the member for Holt, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans)—the dinosaurs of the front bench and the back bench on the other side of the House—have learnt nothing from the massive rejection that they suffered in the 1996 federal election. The Labor Party steadfastly maintains that, despite 13 years of minor tinkering with the tax system, they have suddenly found the answer—a wealth tax that will penalise two-income families but will fail to capture the true wealthy whose lawyers can find legitimate loopholes in the 3,300 pages of taxation legislation in order to minimise their clients' tax responsibilities.
In 1985, the Hawke-Keating government held the gimmicky taxation summit. The then Treasurer, Mr Keating, knew that a broadly based taxation system was essential if Australia was to remain internationally competitive. Despite cosmetic reforms to keep the average taxpayer's head just above water, the Labor government could never summon the strength or party unity to bring fairness to the taxation system. Rather than rolling up their sleeves and doing the hard yards, the former Labor government chose to ignore the problem and rack up national debt until disaster struck—it would have struck again had it not been for the repairs that the Treasurer, Mr Costello, has made to the Australian economy in the lead-up to the Asian financial crisis. How can the Labor Party support a taxation system in which private jets are tax free but the family car is slugged with a 22 per cent tax?
—What about the health system?
—Rather than address the fundamental flaws in the taxation system, the Labor Party initiated their own unique brand of 
 fiscal practice. The member for Denison (Mr Kerr) is now finding form on taxation reform. For the entire time he was in government, along with his colleagues, he did nothing for 13 years to reform the tax system, except following the 1993 federal election, when they reversed their l-a-w tax cuts and then put wholesale sales tax up by two per cent across the board. That was the member for Denison's contribution to tax reform in Australia.
The Labor Party initiated their own brand of fiscal justice during their term in office: do not repair the taxation system, just run up $70 billion worth of debt in five years. Now with an election due within the next 12 months, the Labor Party has already shamelessly made unfunded promises of $8 billion to the Australian public in health alone. Where is this money going to come from? Who will have to pay more tax? The Labor Party has taken irresponsibility to new levels.
Mr Albanese interjecting—
—You tell us where the money is coming from. You tell us where the $8 billion you have promised to spend on the health area alone is coming from. I look forward to the member for Grayndler's opportunity to tell us where the money is coming from if, sadly, he achieves government again, which I am sure the Australian taxpayers would not be so foolish as to repeat.
In the last five years of the Labor government, Australians watched our national debt snowball—$70 billion for five years; $16 billion a year. If they had been allowed to stay in government, where would that have left us today? What would our inflation rate be? What would our interest rate be? The average Australian would have their backs to the wall with poor purchasing power for their money and crippling loan repayments because of unmanageable high interest rates. We need to have a disciplined approach to the budget position. Labor believes you can enter into unfunded promises and run up deficit and debt. This is pursuing a policy of higher interest rates and higher inflation and running the economy into a brick wall that costs Australians their jobs.
The Labor Party ratcheted up interest rates to 17 per cent in 1989-90, and unemployment was forced to over 11 per cent. We now have got unemployment back to where it was before these crippling interest rates. Australia has among the highest rates of growth in the OECD; it has the lowest inflation since 1963; interest rates are the lowest they have been in 25 years; there is a movement into budget surplus; labour productivity is up; and we have a budget which, on current estimations, will halve the debt to GDP ratio in Australia. Labor only ever offered deceit, deficit and debt.
The Asian financial crisis is significant not just as a demonstration of what the government has done to fireproof the economy but as an example of the opportunities lost while the Labor government was doing nothing to benefit the Australian economy from the stimulus that was coming from Asia for the previous decade. These 10 years should have been Australia's salad days, yet Labor created a recession we had to have and an unemployment rate of 11.3 per cent.
Who was the minister for employment? It was the Leader of the Opposition. As employment minister, he managed an 11.3 per cent unemployment rate. As finance minister, he oversaw $23 billion worth of deficit. During his tour de force of economic mismanagement, he looked straight into the television cameras before the 1996 election and promised the Australian people that the budget was not in deficit. In fact, it was $10 billion in deficit. For this the Labor Party made him the Leader of the Opposition.
Gareth Evans, the Frank Spencer of shadow treasurers, has shown that as a shadow Treasurer he was a good foreign minister. In October 1996 he said on 3AW:
I think that since we are so undertaxed by any relevant international standard, there is a case for having some overall revenue increases.
Twenty-four hours later, he said:
I did not say that there was a case for higher taxes or for increased taxes.
When commenting on the ACOSS proposal that negative gearing should be abolished, the member for Holt replied:
Well, that is certainly one option which could be contemplated.
Then, by the afternoon—perhaps after one of his advisers had reminded him of Prime Minister Keating's disastrous experiment in abolishing negative gearing in 1986 and the damage it caused to the rental market—he changed his mind. So he released a statement saying:
. . . we are not, however, proposing to embrace ACOSS's proposal to end negative gearing.
On 17 August 1997, Gareth Evans said that he was in favour of states biting the bullet on inheritance taxes. As expected, he reversed his position within a fortnight. On 13 May 1997, he said that the services part of the economy was not pulling its weight. Within a fortnight he had changed his mind on a services tax. On 19 May, when discussing a broad based indirect tax, he said:
If the business community and the welfare community can get together and come up with some proposal . . . then of course we'd have a look at any such proposal.
Just two days later, he changed his mind. He said:
Let me make it absolutely clear that . . . the GST is not on our agenda.
On 17 August 1997, Gareth Evans told channel 9's Sunday  program:
Those who say that the tax system is broke are really being quite a bit absurdly breathless.
At the National Press Club he said:
Tax reform is a second or third order public policy economic priority.
Obviously, the member for Werriwa does not agree with the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party. The member for Werriwa wrote in his book, Civilising Global Capital :
Even without the spread of globalisation the tax system would be in need of constant repair and reform. Notwithstanding the pitfalls of tax reform in the electoral arena, this process now seems unavoidable in Australia. The effectiveness of the taxation regime, both in its adequacy and equity, has become a first order issue for social democracy.
The shadow Treasurer is promising fast economic growth, tax cuts, the abolition of negative gearing and R&D syndicates for every Australian. His urgency for reform is 
 appreciated by the government. (Time expired)
—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Taxation Reform</title>,Private Members' Business,15,1,speech
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,1998-04-06,"—I rise to speak against this motion on taxation reform today because it hides the government's real agenda: to introduce a goods and services tax, which would impact adversely on all Australians and their families—this from a government led by John Howard. This is the man who, as Treasurer, remained mute for five years between 1976-77 and 1982, and did nothing whilst the level of tax avoidance in this country got to epidemic proportions. Embarrassed by the Costigan royal commission into the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, the then Treasurer was forced to actually acknowledge that there was a problem, but previously he had denied there was a problem at all.
When the McCabe-Lafranchi report on tax avoidance came down, Howard mocked it. In a speech to parliament in 1984, the then Treasurer, Paul Keating, estimated that the government had suffered between $250 million and $300 million a year in lost revenue from bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. What did Labor do about it? Labor, in government, fixed the problem. We held a tax summit in 1985. We introduced, as a result of that tax summit, imputation of dividends, a fringe benefits tax and a capital gains tax; and we rejected a consumption tax. Total revenue from the fringe benefits tax during the period 1986-87 to 1997-98 was over $20 billion. Total revenue from the capital gains tax from 1987-88 to 1995-96 was over $7 billion. All up, those two Labor progressive taxation measures have raised over $35 billion in revenue—and they were rejected by the opposition at the time.
The Liberal Party went out there and campaigned in favour of free lunch and in favour of capital gains rorts. To this day, they are still in favour of tax avoidance and evasion for the rich. Added to this was the fact that the Labor government was very efficient in cutting capital gains tax avoidance schemes. It is very hard to avoid paying this 
 tax. It does not have the loopholes that the government continues to allow to operate with regard to trust accounts and taxation. If people made large capital gains, they simply paid capital gains tax. It is as simple as that.
This follows on from Labor's tax achievements in the area of income. In November 1993 tax cuts worth $3 billion were introduced. This was the seventh round of personal tax cuts since Labor attained office in 1983. These cuts in personal tax rates were implemented in successive stages. When were personal taxes cut? On 1 November 1984 there was a tax cut; 1 December 1986, tax cut; 1 July 1987, tax cut; 1 July 1989, tax cut; 1 January 1990, tax cut; and 1 January 1991, tax cut; up until the seventh and final on 15 November 1993. With that, the corporate tax rate was lowered from 46 to 36 per cent.
As I have said, exploitation of the tax system has been reduced by Labor's introduction of the fringe benefits tax and the capital gains tax. This 1993 income tax reform changed the tax rate on incomes between $20,700 to $38,000, a drop from 38 per cent to 34 per cent. On incomes of $38,000 to $50,000, it dropped from 46 to 43 per cent. Furthermore, a low income rebate of $150 was introduced for those on incomes below $20,700. Labor also dropped the lowest tax rate from 30 to 20 per cent, while raising the tax free threshold.
Australia is a low taxing country compared with OECD averages. Tax revenue in 1992 represented approximately 28.5 per cent of GDP. The OECD average is 38.8 per cent. Tax revenue as a proportion of GDP has fallen quite steadily since the 1980s. If the same level of taxation were charged today as 10 years ago, there would be $15 billion extra each year in government receipts. However, the rich continue to avoid their fair share of the tax burden. That is why I am concerned about the member for Sturt's motion here today: it does not acknowledge that some of the richest people in Australia declare incomes of less than $20,000. As the Australian Financial Review revealed in February last year:
Even the 1,074 Australians who declared an income of more than $1 million in 1994-95 paid an average of only 20.7% in income tax.
When this is the situation, how can this mob opposite actually go on about the need for a GST? They need to look at the real problem with the tax system. The real problem with the tax system that they do not want to look at is the tax avoidance and evasion that occurs through the use of trusts. It is interesting that there are 17 members of the opposition frontbench who have trusts. Perhaps that is the member for Sturt's concern with the Labor agenda on tax reform.
I want to pluck out an individual to use as an example of someone who has done a very good job of minimising his tax—that is, W.R. Parer. What better example could I find than Senator Parer? In the 1993 financial year there were dividends worth $210,372 in the W.R. Parer family trust. In the 1994 financial year dividends worth $192,000 were paid. In the 1995 financial year there were dividends of $243,000. In the 1996 financial year there were dividends worth $200,000 to $250,000. In or about August 1996, January 1997 and July 1997, minor shareholders in the Parer trust are alleged to have received dividends of between $100,000 and $150,000.
Since 1993 the W.R. Parer family trust has received just over $1 million in dividends. This income was then split between the individual Parer family members. This is a very effective way of minimising tax. Tax is saved by directing dividends to family members who have no other income.
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I sat here silently while the member for Grayndler told outrageous furphies about the Labor Party's record in government to do with tax reform and tax cuts and left out the l-a-w tax cuts, which of course had been abolished by Labor after the 1993 election.
—Order! The honourable member will come to his point of order.
—My point of order is that the member for Grayndler is imputing the motives of Senator Parer, who is a senator in another 
 house, naturally. Under standing order 76 he is not able to do that. I would ask you to call him to order on that basis.
—Order! I have been listening very carefully to what the honourable member said. He is within the standing orders so far, and I hope he will remain within the standing orders.
—Of course I accept your direction, Mr Deputy Speaker, because I know that those opposite are very sensitive when it comes to their rich mates. It is these sorts of tax evasion and avoidance schemes which cost the Australian nation billions of dollars over years in lost revenue, revenue that could be spent on education, health, transport and regional development. This government has ministers who say, `Oh, $200 million; I forgot all about that.' That is the sort of government that defends the setting up of family trusts. The fact is that working Australians in my electorate do not have family trusts. These are the same sort of people who go on about young women having children to get benefits.
This is a mob who, with the GST agenda, will be rejected at the next election. We are quite happy to get into a debate about tax. We welcome the debate that has occurred today because at the next election we will be talking about their wealthy mates and how they evade tax, how we fixed it up with a capital gains tax, how we fixed it up with a fringe benefits tax, how John Howard opposed it each and every time and how, after the rejection in March 1993, he is coming back again with a GST across the board on food, clothing and essential items. Just as the GST was rejected in 1993, it will be rejected in 1998 by the Australian people.

"Broadbent, Russell, MP",LP,1998-04-06,"—I would firstly like to refute everything put forward by the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) that did not edify this House and did not edify the relationship between this House and the Senate. More than that, I question the member for Grayndler on the fact that he said he has raised $35 billion worth of new taxes. How did you end up $8 billion short when we came to power? How did you end up $8 billion short after you raised an extra $35 billion? Do not scurry out 
 of the House. Stay and face what I have to stay to you, for heaven's sake. The tax cuts that you have talked about you threw away and then you clawed them back in 1993.
Every leader of substance who has entered this House since 1985 has said, `We need to change the tax system. We need fairness. We need equity. We need to give the battlers a go.'
—What have they done?
—What did they do? Keating gave up in the middle of a summit when Bill Kelty and a couple of others walked in and said, `This isn't on. We have spoken to Bob. You can't have what you want.' That was the leader who said that a new, changed tax system would be the saving grace for Australia and then in 1993 he said that it is the poison for Australia. Why? For base political reasons. It is not for the people who gather in this House and not for the people in my electorate of McMillan who are paying far too much PAYE tax not only on their normal income but on their overtime as well. If I get a complaint from anyone, it is, `I'm paying too much PAYE tax and it is not fair.' But obviously from what we have heard today, there is one great scare campaign left in this tax issue.
I am here to talk about fairness, opportunity and rewarding people for their work. The Labor Party have obfuscated their responsibilities completely. They are the party of big spending, high debt, high tax and high interest rates. Remember when we had 22 per cent interest rates for small business? We had high unemployment rates of 11.2 per cent. These were the great achievements of the Labor Party of Australia. It is time that this House looked at our taxation system and said, `Let's come together and see if we can find a better outcome for the communities that we all serve.'
I have had enough of people paying half their pay in tax. I have had enough of people paying so much of their overtime in tax and saying to me, `There's no incentive to work. We have to put some incentive back.' I am sick of Labor Party politicians standing up in 
 this place and saying one thing when they truly believe another. They have been the party that have reduced the Public Service by 18 per cent, and then accuse us of bashing the Public Service—wrong; wrong party. They were doing it before the member for Blaxland (Mr Hatton), the next member to speak, came into the House but while you were here, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins. Who has done all the privatisations in Australia?
—Labor.
—The Labor Party. The Labor Party have been the great party of the right.
—The dinosaurs.
—The dinosaurs of the right, but the party of the right. They wanted efficiency in every area but that which was politically dangerous, politically brave, politically courageous.
What we are asking for is something reasonable. I support the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) on this motion. We are putting to the Australian people, `Let's have a discussion. Let's be reasonable about that discussion. Let's give everybody a fair go. Let's not go out there and just scare the pants off everybody we possibly can. Let's say, ""Is there a benefit here for the Australian people?"" If there is a benefit here for the Australian people, let's deliver it.' That is exactly what they are demanding of me; of you, Mr Deputy Speaker; of both the members at the table, the member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) and the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson); and of every member of this House. If we cannot deliver that, we are failing in our responsibilities to the people we serve. I do not want to be one of those people who fail in that responsibility.
It is time to begin to deliver good governance. It is time to deliver a better tax system. It is time for the Australian people to take some pride in their politicians, rather than see the exhibition in this House today, particularly by the member for Grayndler. I am glad he came back into the room. Those arguments that he raised today—the politics of envy and the politics of greed—
—Order! The honourable member's time has expired.
—are all that he is on about.

"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,1998-04-06,"—It is wonderful how people can get carried away during debate. However, there was in that five-minute contribution from the member for McMillan (Mr Broadbent) a plaint, a plea, for this issue not to be debated, for the opposition to simply say, `Go ahead; introduce a GST, and we won't have anything to say about it.' I am sorry to inform the member for McMillan and the mover of this motion, the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne), that we will not be agreeing to that plea that he has put to us here today. We will not be doing so quite simply because this House is a place for debate. This House's central function is as the sorting house for interest groups, issues, difficulties and problems that the nation has. We will never give up our right to debate and to disagree with this coalition government.
I had thought that the reason the member for Sturt put this motion up was to get some interjection practice. In fact I asked him whether that was the case. He indicated that he was bored. He may well be bored—
Mr Pyne interjecting—
—Order! The honourable member should not encourage the honourable member for Sturt.
—Sure; this is past history. If we look at what has been put together in this motion that I disagree with in every 
 particular, what we see is effectively the current coalition parties' mantra in relation to the past practice of the Labor government, the past practice of their own and the current practice of this coalition government. It could in fact be subtitled `How to succeed in politics without really trying' because this is purely the current coalition mantra in relation to what they want out of a GST and to their arguments about what the previous Labor government stood for in the tax area. My colleague the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) pointed out that Labor brought in a range of taxes. I well remember the debate which took place in the tax summit in 1985. Labor in fact called it a tax summit. It was debated fully.
—What happened?
—The result of that tax summit was that option C, as a whole, could not go forward. The element of option C that was extra was a consumption tax. The consumption tax was quite simply knocked on the head. It was knocked on the head not only by the union movement but also because business did not support it fully, openly and totally. That tax summit, which covered the broad range of people within this community, did not agree with it. Only the consumption tax elements were knocked out. What did we go back to? We went back to options A and B, all of the key things that the member for Grayndler pointed out. The capital gains tax and the entertainments and fringe benefits legislation were introduced after the tax summit and after agreement at that tax summit that that range of matters should go ahead, but not the consumption tax. So we gave that the flick. The other matters have raised, as the member for Grayndler said, over time more than $35 billion worth of tax.
Point 2 says that this motion `recognises that the former Labor government failed over 13 years to implement substantial tax reform'. The key elements of that tax reform have been enumerated again here today by the member for Grayndler.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,1998-04-06,"—Today my grievance is against the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for his failure to provide leadership. You can trim the eyebrows; you can cap the teeth; you can cut the hair; you can put on different glasses; you can give him a ewe's milk facial, for all I care; but, to paraphrase a gritty Australian saying, `Same stuff, different bucket.' In the pantheon of chinless blue bloods and suburban accountants that makes up the Australian Liberal Party, this bloke is truly one out of the box. You have to go back to Billy McMahon to find a Prime Minister who even approaches this one for petulance, pettiness and sheer grinding inadequacy. I read the late Paul Hasluck's description of Billy McMahon, and I cannot find a thing that does not describe this Prime Minister equally well:
I confess to a dislike of McMahon. The longer one is associated with him the deeper the contempt for him grows and I find it hard to allow him any merit. Disloyal, devious, dishonest, untrustworthy, petty, cowardly—all these adjectives have been weighed by me and I could not in truth modify or reduce any one of them in its application to him.
In John Howard, here also is a man, small in every sense. Some have said that he is the worst Prime Minister since Billy McMahon. That is unfair to Billy McMahon. I am one of the few people who have opened up and read David Barnett's biography of John Howard. I have to admit I have not read it all, because it is impossible to stay awake. I did, however, get to page 17. Here Barnett outlines Howard taking six weeks off work to campaign for the 
 McMahon government. Was Billy McMahon grateful? Barnett outlined:
An appointment was arranged with McMahon in his office in Parliament House. Howard was ushered in, and Bill McMahon jumped to his feet. ""No"" he said. ""I don't want to see him."" Then McMahon, who also had an appointment with a Japanese delegation, stopped himself. ""I thought you were Japanese"" he explained.
Barnett goes on to explain what John Howard's incredibly crucial and high-powered job was in the McMahon campaign: he was given the job of rolling the manual auto queue built into McMahon's podium. How appropriate. In this book Howard is quoted as saying of McMahon `he arrived in the job too old and too late'—this from a man who was born old and for whom time has stood still.
But the gulf, Mr Deputy Speaker, between the man in his mind—the phlegmatic, proud old English bulldog—the Winston of John Winston Howard—and the nervous, jerky, whiny apparition that we all see on the box every night. When he looks on the box he gets to see what we see—not the masterful orator of his mind but the whingey kid in his sandpit. Spare a thought for us, Mr Deputy Speaker, because we have to watch this performance every day—the chin and top lip jutting out in `full duck mode'. We get this every day because this is a man in refuge from himself and from the rest of Australia.
This prime ministership is not about the future of our nation. It is about John Winston Howard's past. We do not hear about the future of this nation when we listen to this Prime Minister. In every performance all we get are his life's grievances. All we get is the accumulated bitterness and bile of 13 long years in opposition and the people he blames for keeping him there.
John Winston Howard grew up in the inner west of Sydney. His father owned a service station on the corner of the street where I now live. These were the halcyon days of little Winston's life—when the working classes knew their place and when all migrants were British. Lucky John Winston Howard moved further north, across the harbour; he certainly would not be comfortable living in the inner 
 west of Sydney any more. A bit too much change for his lifetime.
John Howard has always been proud to call himself a conservative. The problem I think is that he has confused this with preservative. He probably wishes good old Ming had dosed the country with formaldehyde when he had the chance. Because it all started going wrong in the late 1960s. Here is a man who lived at home until he was 32. You can imagine what he was like. Here were young Australians demonstrating against the Vietnam War, listening to the Doors, driving their tie-died kombi vans, and what was John Howard doing? He was at home with mum, wearing his shorts and long white socks, listening to Pat Boone albums and waiting for the Saturday night church dance.
Yes, it all started to go wrong back in the 1960s. Radical and sinister notions of equality for women, world peace and, dare I say it, citizenship rights for indigenous Australians. So what do we hear when we listen to John Winston Howard today? We hear the hatred and resentment in his voice—the sort of hatred and resentment we saw at the reconciliation conference last year—hatred and resentment from a man who was never part of the scene, who was not accepted, for whom a different life was too big a leap and who took refuge in a previous generation. You can see it in his instinctive hatred of any progression, and he sees it everywhere—policies of social inclusion, multiculturalism, women's liberation, Aboriginal reconciliation. In all of them, he only ever sees the jump he was too weak to make decades ago. Now he wants the whole nation to stay back and keep him company.
Try an interesting little exercise some day. Punch `Howard' and `multiculturalism' into the Hansard database. You will find he has never mentioned the word. When you punch in `Howard' and `multicultural' you do get it nine times but each and every time he is referring to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. This is the man we have leading the country—a man who is so instinctively petty and so bitterly obsessed that he could craft an entire parliamentary career without mentioning the word `multicultural 
 ism' and what that represents, because it is an idea he is opposed to. He is positively Orwellian in his pettiness. This is a smallness of mind, a meanness with breathtaking scope. I can just imagine his enormous pride at this aspect.
It is a small thing, really, but remember when the Spice Girls came to Australia at the beginning of the year? Everyone said it was just the silly season that the Prime Minister's refusal to meet with them got so much press. Well, it was and it was not. What did he say? He said it would not be `appropriate' to meet with them. That is vintage John Winston Howard. If he really did not want to meet them, he could have just said he was on holiday at Hawks Nest—same place, same flat every year for decades—with the family, and that would have been fair enough. People would have respected that. But he could not resist. He could not resist telling the youth of Australia that he thought they were infantile and stupid and therefore it would be inappropriate to meet these people who, after all, are Tory supporters from Britain.
We have a man leading this country who is prepared always to go out of his way to insult people he does not like, but not with the courage to come out and say it but do it sneakily. Weakly and sneakily. Weaseling around the point. Remember when he decided to give Jeff Kennett a blast? He does not do what anyone else would do—go into parliament or go outside and do a doorstop. He tells the coalition party room and then organises for one of his mates to leak it. No wonder Jeff thought it was so funny.
This is the man we have leading this country—yesterday's man, a weak man, a little man, a man without courage and a man without vision. This is Billy McMahon in short pants. This is the man who has brought the full force of his personality to bear on Australia. Australia is now learning what it is like to live life through John Howard's eyes. This is the man whose only aim in the end—for getting the prime ministership—was to pay back all those who had tried to stop him along the way. Australia is a better country than that and Australians are better people 
 than that. Australians are, if we are anything, courageous people.
So steeped in conservative values and fear of what is new is John Winston Howard that, if he were born before the Wright brothers, he would have organised a campaign against air travel of any description on the grounds that it was new and potentially dangerous. He is an antique, a remnant of the past that should be put on display, but not in government and certainly not in a leadership position, for anachronisms belong in museums and historical texts, not in parliament. Australians deserve a courageous leader; they do not deserve the kind of leader that used to dob on them in the schoolyard. They do not deserve John Winston Howard and in time they will put him out to pasture.

"Reith, Peter, MP",LP,1998-04-06,"—I move:
That the amendments be agreed to.
In moving that motion, I seek the concurrence of the House to the amendments which have been passed by the Senate to the package of measures contained in the government's Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997 . The measures which have now returned to the House are the government amendments in the Senate.
I am pleased to be able to say to the House that all the other amendments—namely, those moved by the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Independents—were in each and every case lost in the Senate. The government's amendments in each and every case were supported by the Senate. Today is an historic occasion in the federal parliament because by the end of today's business we will have seen through the parliament the historic reforms announced by the government in our New Deal: Fair Deal package last September.
The new law in the Trade Practices Act will give to small business for the first time protection throughout Australia against unconscionable conduct by big business. It will also allow the introduction of legally recognised codes of conduct underpinned by the Trade Practices Act, including mandatory codes for small business franchisees in the retail and oil industries. It is a ground-breaking policy development for the benefit of small business. It is the light at the end of the unfair trading 
 tunnel. It sends the strongest message ever from the federal parliament to the Australian business community that commercial relations between big and small businesses must be treated on a fair and reasonable basis.
The purpose of these historic changes is to induce behavioural change in commercial practices so that small businesses do get a fair go and, where they are treated unfairly, they have available to them a means of redress. For the first time real teeth are being provided within Australian law, and to the ACCC, to benefit those small businesses who, because of their unequal bargaining power, are subject to exploitative business conduct.
Small business has been calling for these sorts of reforms for years and years. It was not until the election of the Howard government that the cries of small business for a fair go were finally heard and responded to in a constructive way to the interests of small business. When the previous Labor administration were in office they had report after report. Barren year followed barren year of reports to provide some assistance recommended to them for the small business community, but year after year their cries fell on deaf ears within the Labor Party and small business failed to get the protection which they deserved.
It has taken the commitment of the Howard government, with its strong bias towards the small business community, for these reforms to be achieved. Even the Labor Party admitted as much in the Senate. For example, Senator Schacht, who himself was a Labor small business minister, very kindly said that I had made myself a hero for pushing these reforms through. The Democrats said:
Minister Peter Reith, to his credit, recognised the scope of the problems in small business and has brought forward this bill.
I pay tribute to the parliamentary committee which we promised before the election and which delivered on these issues, chaired by the Liberal member for Bendigo, the Hon. Bruce Reid. It is amazing that, all the way through, the Labor Party, having done nothing for 13 years, were giving advice as to what 
 should be done when they went into opposition. It is amazing that in the Senate they were proposing amendments which even the spokesperson for the Labor Party in the Senate recognised must have been open to some question, seeing that those amendments were being advanced and advocated by representatives of big business supposedly for the benefit of small business. Senator Schacht was remarkably open and frank in his own description of the amendments that the Labor Party were proposing. Thank heavens they did not get up. Thank heavens this government remained determined to the end to ensure a fair deal.

"Martin, Stephen, MP",ALP,1998-04-06,"—We on this side cannot share the enthusiasm of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) for the success that he has achieved in respect of getting this legislation through, for a number of reasons. I am sure during the course of our contribution this evening we will try to get that message across. First and foremost, I think it is important to recognise that the Reid committee, to which the minister referred, did hand down a report. That report made recommendations about a number of specific areas in respect of unfair trading. It made recommendations about unfairness, not unconscionability; unfairness in terms of trading relationships between small business people and others in a trading environment. The government's response was to take the unfairness element, throw it away and say, `That won't work. We're going to talk about unconscionability.' It was an issue that had been examined by this committee, which the minister now lauds, but was set aside as being unworkable.
Secondly, of course, one of the major issues that were considered in this was the whole issue of retail tenancy law. Again the minister has set that completely aside; yet the committee, which, I repeat, he lauds in this place—and its chairman, Bruce Reid, the member for Bendigo, and all the other government members should hang their heads in shame on this one—made recommendations about retail tenancy laws. The government completely jumped on those recommendations and just 
 put them to one side. The minister went along to a small business ministers meeting on 5 December last year. He spoke at length to a number of small business organisations and basically said to them, `You take what we're going to put up or we'll give you nothing.' As a consequence, of course, we get qualified support from many of these business organisations for what the government has done.
The opposition has said, `Because of the way this debate has gone and because the government has succeeded in the Senate in getting its watered down version of the legislation in place, a watered down version of the Reid committee report, we support what the government is attempting to do here, although we do not believe it is strong enough.' If the minister thinks that I or indeed the Labor Party might have arrived late on the scene for this, it is a reflection of the fact that this committee that he lauds so mightily around this place brought down, I think in his own words, one of the best reports that we have seen in this place. This side of the House adopted it in full; the government did not. The government, in its legislative program, adopted parts of the report that was brought down in this place. Now it tries to turn around and say that it is responding to the committee's report. It is responding in part to a much weaker and a much watered down version.
You have to laugh. I know the minister is known in some of his press releases for trying to perhaps lead people up the garden path; but, when he talks about the Labor Party delaying the legislation in the Senate or in this place or putting in place a watered down version, you really have to sit back and say, `What is this man talking about?' What we sought to do with our amendments was to simply put in place what the Reid committee had recommended.
There was one other area, and that was of course the $1 million transaction issue. That was an issue that was raised by organisations that he talks about as the big end of town. This was an issue that was raised with small business organisations, by the Property Coun 
 cil of Australia, with a whole range of people. The simple reason is that there are many small businesses that do not get to that threshold of $1 million. In fact they go right past it. They are not going to be caught in this legislation. They are not going to get the opportunity to take an unconscionable conduct case, because they are beyond that $1 million threshold. They are still small businesses and we were trying to bring them in, as were the Australian Democrats through the amendment proposed by Senator Murray. I want to speak a little bit more about that during consideration of these amendments this evening.
But we are not going to be frightened off by what the government is attempting to do with this. We will continue to look at ways in which the small business community can get the benefit of the Reid committee report. We will look at ways to try to keep the government true, honest and correct in every detail of that committee report. Regrettably, we fell one short in the Senate the other evening. It certainly is going to be regretted in the small business community as they understand just what all of this legislation actually means to them.

"Reith, Peter, MP",LP,1998-04-06,"—I think the sad thing about the—(Quorum formed)  The sad thing is that, instead of congratulating the government on achieving these historic reforms, the Labor Party can only stand up and say how much better they would have done if they were in government. Given the fact they did nothing for 13 years, it is a rather hollow claim. Given that in the Senate they supported amendments which would have reduced these benefits to small business, it is a quite incredible claim for the shadow minister to make.
The shadow minister caps it off by saying we should have also voted for the opposition's retail tenancy reforms in the Senate. The impact of those reforms would have been to give Australian small businesses not one but two sets of retail tenancy laws. Who would have been entangled in red tape by the setting up of a duplicative system of dual tenancy laws? No-one other than the small business community, who would pay such a 
 heavy price. It was something Labor never proposed when in office. We can only marvel at their hypocrisy to be now proposing it in the Senate as these reforms go through.
For Labor it is catch-up politics because for the first time this government has taken a lead on tenancy laws. We did bring together the state and territory ministers. We have an agreed set of principles. We have taken this debate further than ever contemplated when Labor was in office.
The technical amendments that have gone through are sensible ones. They are consequential drafting amendments and other technical amendments which reflect the intent of the original legislation. This is an historic day for small business. This is a great moment for the small business community. As one leading representative of small business said, this is the best news for small business to come out of Canberra for over 20 years. I commend this bill to the House. It means that our legislative package is on track for 1 July, as promised, as delivered. This government is pro small business and proud of it. This is the best piece of legislation that the small business community has seen for decades.

"Martin, Stephen, MP",ALP,1998-04-06,"—A little earlier we talked about the retail tenancy element of this matter. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) just said that our amendment, if it had been passed, would have delivered two sets of retail tenancy laws. The simple fact is that the Reid committee report recommended there be one set at the national level, which is what we were talking about. We were saying that, if that had have been enacted, if the minister had have used his great silver tongue, his great powers of persuasion, on his state colleagues—
—That's right.
—I am saying it nicely to you; I know how you operate. If the minister spoke to his colleagues at the state level in the same way he speaks to people in the business community, we may have seen what we recommended in our amendments in the Senate: one set of retail tenancy laws that 
 covered retail tenants around Australia. It simply is what the issue is about. To see what small business think, I need go no further than the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, who put out a press release welcoming the passage of the fair trading legislation and saying it is great. But then they said:
The area of unfair trading which most affects community pharmacies is around retail tenancy issues. In the Guild's view, there is still insufficient protection for small business from unfair and predatory practices by large landlords in the renegotiations of tenancy agreements.
That is precisely the point that we were making: we wanted to have national laws in place to pick up that very point. As a consequence, we were concerned to see that the passage of the legislation did not include that.
In relation to unconscionable conduct, which is the area the government settled on—it completely overturned the Reid committee's recommendations in terms of unfair conduct—we find that the Small Business Coalition said:
Small business has now been given protection against unconscionable conduct which was highlighted in the Reid Report.
Yes, it was highlighted—but it was not agreed to. The committee report rejected the idea of unconscionability in favour of unfair conduct, which is the point we have been trying to get across to the minister and, might I say, to the government members of the committee, including the chairman, who did all the investigatory work. For 12 months they went out there and listened to people in the small business community, and then they came in with a report which the government says was you-beaut and which the Labor Party adopted in full. The government then came along and said, `You beaut, but we're not going to do it. We're going to water it all down because we can't have uniform retail tenancy laws. We certainly can't have unfair conduct. No, we have to have unconscionable conduct.' They were not going to talk about the way in which some small businesses might be excluded from this. As a consequence, Peter Reith, in his usual style, turned around and said that the Labor Party is trying to water down what the Reid committee recommended. It is the other way around.
—He was right; he's always right.
—Even the parliamentary secretary, who was with me when this whole issue was being debated out there in the broad community—he heard from retailers about what they wanted: tougher laws but not rammed down their throats by this minister saying in his usual style, `Take it or you'll get nothing'—cannot get away from the fact that this government response is watered down and weak. The Franchise Council of Australia has even said the unconscionable provisions are no good. At the end of the day even they have come out and said they are no good.
I simply want to put on the record for once and forever that the Labor Party adopted fully the Reid committee report. We supported every one of those recommendations; the government did not. The government rejected most of those and brought in a watered down bill which has now been through both houses of parliament and to which we are now considering some minor technical amendments. I want people in the small business community to clearly understand that.
Secondly, we on this side of the House did not trade with big business and say we will put in what they want. Rather, we talked to small businesses, small business organisations, retail organisations and landlord organisations—which is probably more than the minister did—because we wanted to get out there and find out what people wanted. As a consequence of that, we heard very clearly at rallies right around this country what small business wanted: the adoption of the Reid committee report.
What would make you laugh, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that when many of these so-called organisations representing small business that were knocking on our doors when the Reid report came down, saying, `Adopt it in full. It's the only way to go,' did not get that, they went to water as well—very quietly, because Peter Reith went and visited them. We do not know what he said but we have an idea.
Only Labor stood up for what the Reid committee report recommended. Only Labor was prepared to go with those amendments, and it was the government that thugged 
 through these changes, these watered down amendments, that we are now considering in this place. (Time expired)

"Martin, Stephen, MP",ALP,1998-04-06,"—Before the break we were talking about the proposed amendments to the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997  moved by the government but more particularly about the whole issue of unfair trading. I want to reaffirm one or two other issues associated with some of the misinformation and blatant disinformation that has been put around by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) in respect of the Labor Party's position on this.
One of the furphies that has been peddled through the small business community is that in some way the amendments that we had proposed—that is, the amendments which were carefully considered to faithfully reflect the findings of the Reid committee report in respect of unfair trading and unfair business conduct—were a reflection of other factors. He said that we had delayed and that, by moving these amendments, we were in some way impeding the government's program. The fact of the matter is that that is not the case. The simple fact of the matter is that the legislation which emanated from the Reid committee report—the watered down government version of the Reid committee report—came into this place and was debated on 3 and 4 December last year and subsequently passed this House.
When the legislation went to the Senate the Labor Party denied the minister in that place leave to table his second reading speech and said that he had to read it into Hansard. Peter Reith then ran around and said that in some way we were delaying the implementation and the passage of that legislation, and it simply was not the case. The government itself, at long last, scheduled it for consideration in the Senate only last week. In no way was the opposition impeding, holding up or trying to change substantially the legislation to make it weaker. That was not the case at all; in fact, we were trying to beef the legislation up.
I again say to the minister that, in suggesting that because Labor found the cause of small business through the Reid committee report we should in some way be denigrated for it, we adopted that report in full; the government has not. The government has turned its back on the Reid committee. The chairman, the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), and all the other Liberal-National Party members of this place who sat on that committee that brought down a unanimous report recommending unfair trading and recommending issues associated with retail tenancy legislation should all hang their heads in shame because they all supported what Peter Reith ultimately put up: a watered down, weak version of what had been recommended and put together after 12 months of extensive and intensive inquiry by that committee.
We on this side just find it extraordinary that he should criticise us for wanting to ensure that, even though it was the Liberal-National Party government that was ultimately going to have responsibility for acting on it, the legislation that came through did give some real protection and some real power for small business. I say again to the minister that he may talk about the number of inquiries that were held by Labor when in government and claim that nothing was done, but that simply is not the case and he knows that that is a fact. The simple fact of the matter is that when Labor were in government they did act for small business in a number of specific areas. Unlike this minister who, along with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), promised that there would be a reduction of some 50 per cent in the paperwork burden which he cannot possibly deliver, unlike this Prime Minister who has been out in the community parading as the patron saint of small business and promising all sorts of things to them and who is going to impose on them a GST burden where one million people will be turned into the tax collectors for this government, the Labor Party are opposed to those measures.
The legislation that has gone through this place and through the Senate is a watered down, weakened version of what Labor was 
 prepared to support. It is unfortunate that Peter Reith and the cabinet were not prepared to back the member for Bendigo and his committee, which brought down an excellent report. I am sure some of my colleagues will comment further on this particular matter, but I would hope that, once and for all, I have laid to rest the nonsense that the minister has been peddling around the small business community that in some way the Labor Party either delayed or watered down this legislation. We did not under any circumstances do that. We were supporting small business for all the reasons that were outlined in the Reid committee report. It is unfortunate that Peter Reith was able to thug the small business community into accepting a much weaker version of the legislation which otherwise would have had bipartisan support.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1998-04-06,"—Far be it from me to be a killjoy at what is an orgy of self-congratulation on the part of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), but we all understand the way in which the minister for small business is positioning himself as a potential Prime Minister or at least as a potential leader of the Liberal Party by setting himself up as a friend of small business and contrasting himself with the Treasurer (Mr Costello). In that respect, he is onto something. The Treasurer is unashamedly a top end of town man and anyone who gets to have a look at where the Treasurer gets his advice from—and recently, having some responsibilities in the superannuation and business regulation area, I have had the opportunity to see some of the areas where the Treasurer gets his advice from—will see that he is unquestionably a top end of town man, so this does provide some potential room for the minister for small business to pose as a champion of small business. Regrettably, however, what we have finally before the parliament is less than satisfactory from the point of view of small business, and I want to go into that in a moment.
However, there are a few things in debating that upset me. I understand that we on this side of the House will have different pers 
 pectives from those on the other side of the House and that those different perspectives are often sincerely held and argued. For example, we think it would be better if Telstra were in public ownership; the government believes that it would be better if Telstra were in private ownership. The government believes that the taxation system would be better with a GST; we do not. We believe that it would have adverse effects on the community. These things can be argued legitimately, but it does annoy me when you see people on the other side of politics blatantly rewriting history and endeavouring to perpetrate falsehoods. Sadly, this area of fair trading and protection of retail tenants is one of those areas.
If you listened to the contribution of the minister for small business before the break, you would get the impression that it was this government which had initiated retail tenancy reform. That is in fact not the case. If you go back to 1995, the former Labor government introduced legislation to deal with problems of unconscionable conduct. I recall quite well the former minister for small business, Chris Schacht, announcing those changes and introducing that legislation, as someone who had received a lot of representations from small businesses, from retail tenants, and who was anxious to see some justice for them, noting that the government had done the right thing and had introduced this legislation.
The then opposition refused to pass it. They said, `No, we want to have a closer look at this.' Indeed, they said, `We are troubled by the idea of black letter law, so we will refer this off to a committee.' And that is what they did: they referred it off to the Reid committee. It is common ground, I think, amongst the parties that the work of the Reid committee was very good work, but it ought to be understood that in doing so the government failed when they were in opposition to support the legislation coming forward from the government. Equally, when we went into opposition Kim Beazley moved a private member's bill, the Trade Practices (Better Business Conduct) Bill, which would have addressed some of these concerns. The government did not move to implement that 
 legislation, and I believe that it was most unfortunate that they failed to do that, for reasons that I will come to in a moment.
Before doing that, I want to support what the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) has said about the deficiencies of the bill. In particular, I want to express concern about the fact that the government has not moved on the idea of a uniform retail tenancy code. That is something which they have handballed off to the states. All the indications from the states are that they are not going to address it properly, and therefore one of the most important reforms for retail tenants, one of the things that would give them genuine access to justice and genuine avenues for redress, a retail tenancy tribunal, simply will not be there. For the minister to come into the parliament, as he did earlier on, and say, `Oh, what is being proposed is too different jurisdictions, a national and a state jurisdiction, and two different sets of tribunals' is nonsense. That is not what the committee recommended and it is not the opposition's position.
I think it is most unfortunate that the government has not moved to implement a uniform retail tenancy code and to establish a tribunal which would be able to give effect to that. What we have seen is a delay in bringing forward legislation, from the time that Labor moved on legislation in 1995 to the bill that is now before the House. (Extension of time granted) In the time that the government has not moved to bring this bill before the parliament and has been conducting this inquiry, there are a great many retail tenants who have suffered in the process and many people have gone out of business, have lost their life savings and, in the most extreme cases that have been brought to my attention, are now living in caravan parks and the like as a result. They are rightly concerned about the fact that there is nothing in this legislation which gives them any satisfaction or any compensation for the hardships that they have gone through. For example, I have received correspondence from Mrs Mary Caruana from the Ex Traders of Victoria saying:
We feel very strongly that `New Deal Fair Deal' is not new or fair. The meaning of the `unconscion 
 able law' that is in the Trade Practices Act 1974, 51AA, means `duty of care'.
She goes on to say that the ex-traders have talked to politicians from both sides of the fence and that they have endeavoured to show that there has been a horrendous lack of duty of care, causing thousands of small business people, their homes, their families, their cash flow and their health to suffer, with more of this conduct still going on. She says:
We know that you all know that too, and that `New Deal Fair Deal' does not come close to fixing the problems that we have proven. We would like to let Mr Peter Reith know that the laws that he has introduced are not good enough to take the great pressures, stresses and losses that all of this has caused.
She raises the issue of compensation and security of tenure legislation.
I know that she and others in that group are so concerned about it that they have put together a petition of several thousand signatures from people who are concerned at the plight of the ex-traders. There are, I think, two petitions floating around. One, which comes from traders and ex-traders, says:
I want my voice to be heard. I call on the Federal Government to immediately implement the complete recommendations of the Fair Trading Inquiry, and to organise immediate compensation for ex-traders forced out of business through the misrepresentation and unconscionable conduct of landlords.
I know that the House has heard many cases of retail tenants who have suffered, but once again I think we need to hear about these things to bring home to people what the real impact on the lives of ordinary people this issue has. At the bottom of this particular petition I have, this chap from Epping Plaza says:
I'd like to inform you that I'm a well-educated person with qualifications in architecture and modern accounting who couldn't find a job. I hate to be unemployed, so I started my business, a gift shop. Now I work 65 hours a week to earn almost $150 a week. It is just unfair and unhuman; I feel like a slave working for somebody else who's taking all my profit. I've been in many European countries and haven't seen such a mess before.
This is the kind of situation that people who are in retail tenancies are suffering, and they 
 are saying that they want the complete recommendations of the fair trading inquiry implemented, and that is the position that we in the opposition, we in the Labor Party, have taken. We believe that the complete recommendations ought to be implemented and we are disappointed that the government has failed to do this.
The other thing that ought to be said in relation to this debate is that there is a major role for the ACCC in acting on unconscionable conduct claims. I have been disappointed at what I have seen as a lack of action on their part in relation to this issue, but it is interesting to note that just recently they have instituted proceedings in the Federal Court in Perth concerning a particular shopping centre—
—Farrington Fayre.
—Indeed, the member for Cunningham is correct. The ACCC alleges that in 1996 and early 1997 the owners implemented a strategy whereby they refused to grant renewals, variations or extensions of leases to three tenants unless those tenants withdrew from legal proceedings against the owners which were before the Western Australian Commercial Tenancy Tribunal, or agreed not to pursue legal rights against the owners. If that is the case, I think we would all agree that that is disgraceful conduct. The ACCC believes that those retail tenants were at a special disadvantage when bargaining with the owners because of their financial dependence upon renewal, variation or extension of their leases. (Extension of time granted)  That is exactly right, and that is often the situation for retail tenants. Once you get into a shopping centre, and you have often paid a lot of money to get in there in the first place or have paid a lot of money to renovate and fit up the shop, you need to have your lease renewed. It is not a position of equal or comparable bargaining power. If you lose the lease—if it is not renewed or you are evicted—a great deal of your livelihood is lost in the process. So I am pleased to see that the ACCC is acting on unconscionable conduct issues, and I hope that in future we will see a lot more of that.
To conclude, I support the remarks of the member for Cunningham. The opposition has played a very constructive role in this issue all the way along, trying to achieve justice for retail tenants; indeed, it drew to the attention of the parliament the conflict of interest problems surrounding the former minister for small business, the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser). I believe that if we had not done that, and if we had not secured his resignation, we would not have seen anything like that which we are seeing before the House today in terms of legislation to deal with this issue. Regrettably, when you examine the legislation closely there is somewhat less to it than meets the eye, and I believe that many of the concerns of retail tenants will continue into the future. But, in so far as the bill takes steps forward, they are welcomed by us and the legislation has our support.

"Kemp, Dr David, MP",LP,1998-04-06,"—I move:
That the amendments be disagreed to.
The government has no alternative but to once again reject the Senate amendments to the Public Service Bill 1997 [No. 2] , the Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]  and the Parliamentary Service Bill 1997 [No. 2] .
I remain deeply disappointed at the actions of the Senate. Significant legislative reform in this area is vital, yet the opposition and the minor parties in the Senate have introduced more than 50 amendments which, taken together, would return the Australian Public Service to the past, burying employment actions in layers of unnecessary prescription.
The government expects, and the people of Australia expect, that the APS will be a modern and efficient employer. It is committed to ensuring that Australia has a public service which is competitive into the next century and which is amongst the world's best. It is important to Australia that its Public Service is world class. Countries compete internationally these days, not only in the marketplace but also on the quality of their public sectors. The OECD has noted that the quality and effectiveness of governance is crucial to national prosperity and wellbeing.
The Public Service needs to be organised to provide governments with the best possible advice, it needs to be able to provide outstanding service to the general public and it needs excellent mechanisms of accountability to the government and to the parliament. To achieve these goals, the Australian Public Service must provide motivating and satisfying workplaces. In reaching these objectives, it is essential that we break away from the traditional approaches based on high levels of centralisation and prescription.
The bill which the government introduced into the Senate provides an appropriate framework for our high performance Public Service. It is all about making the Public 
 Service more efficient and effective and delivering better service to both the government and the public. It not only removes prescription and central control but enhances the accountability framework which the parliament and the community expect of the Public Service. It will enable the Public Service to meet market competition, to benchmark itself more effectively against other sectors, to bring employment arrangements into line with community standards and to promote a stronger performance culture.
The amendments made by the Senate do nothing to assist the Public Service to move towards this goal of becoming a high performing organisation. They are unduly prescriptive, they contain excessive regulatory controls and they are, considering they come from a major party, irresponsible. They even abandon a number of reforms which the Labor Party introduced while in government. For example, they reintroduce appeal rights for senior officers, which were removed in 1987 by the former government.
I have noted comments by the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) in this chamber and in the Senate by Senator Faulkner which allege that the government has rejected the amendments made in the Senate out of hand, without giving them proper consideration. I would like to remind the opposition that amendments to legislation can be opposed for good reasons and that someone just might disagree with the approach they propose. In this instance, the government gave full consideration to the amendments made and concluded that they did not add value. They reintroduce or, indeed, exacerbate the very problems that our proposals for reform identified and sought to overcome. They would deny the opportunity to build a more efficient and effective Public Service to deliver services to the people of Australia.
Let us again look at some of the amendments that the Senate has proposed and reasons that the government has for rejecting them. It is for good reason that the government has rejected the amendments that the Senate has proposed which prevent secretaries and agency heads from entering into an Australian workplace agreement with their 
 employees unless the AWA covers a particular category of APS employees which has been exempted from this provision by a regulation under the Public Service Act. The government does not support these amendments because they attempt to override the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and place the Australian Public Service on a different footing to the private sector.
The Labor Party has not accepted the fact that the parliament has passed the Workplace Relations Act and that the government is entitled to apply that legislation. It is still fighting the old battles on behalf of its union mates. If there is one thing you can be sure about it is that the Labor Party is a sectional party bound hand and foot to the union movement. It will introduce those amendments which the union movement wants. What we see in these amendments is the CPSU attempting to mark out its previous territory of control. (Extension of time granted)
Other Senate amendments attempt to establish the primacy of awards and certified agreements over classification rules and determinations. The government does not accept the amendments because they are largely unnecessary or may be handled in other ways. To the extent that awards may cover matters contained in the classification rules, an award would override any rule that sought to diminish the provision in the award.
The Senate has also sought to omit the provisions that determination of employment provisions will not apply to the termination of an SES employee, the secretary to a department or the head of an executive agency. The government does not accept these amendments because they treat these employees differently from their equivalents in other public sectors.
Another major concern for the government are those Senate amendments which attempt to establish the Merit Protection Commissioner as an independent statutory agency, and retain and expand the current tripartite appeals process. The government does not accept these amendments because they impose binding decisions on agency heads and unduly constrain their employment powers. The 
 amendments would also indirectly continue the costly focus on process within agencies.
The government also has significant concerns with those Senate amendments which attempt to limit the powers of agency heads to engage persons as employees other than on a permanent basis and to transfer employees to other duties and locations. The government does not accept the amendments because they unnecessarily restrict the flexibility of agency heads to employ staff efficiently and economically to meet the needs of their agencies from time to time. There are also significant technical problems in relation to the application of the proposed provisions.
Of a similarly limiting nature are those Senate amendments which place restrictions on the powers of agency heads to terminate employees. The government does not accept these amendments because they unnecessarily limit the exercise of termination powers and would contribute to the current emphasis on process. The amendments, although presumably they seek to be comprehensive, preclude termination for other necessary reasons such as abandonment of employment or failure to complete a training course. They would also result in confusion in relation to the interaction of the grounds specified in the bill with those in the Workplace Relations Act. The Workplace Relations Act already protects employees by prohibiting termination on a number of grounds and by setting out procedural requirements, as well as conciliation procedures and remedies.
The examples that I have given clearly illustrate that the government has good reasons for rejecting the amendments made by the Senate. The common theme of these and the other amendments is that they add unnecessary and ambiguous detail to the bill and, through a culture of central control, seek to limit the ability of agency heads to manage their agencies efficiently and effectively for the benefit of their employees and of the Australian people.
Throughout the development of these bills the government has shown a willingness to seek reasonable compromise and bipartisan support. Following many hours of negotiation with the unions we agreed to more than 30 
 changes to the original proposals. Amendments were made to the bill to take account of all the 20 unanimous recommendations of the Joint Statutory Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. The government has also accepted the suggestion of the Joint Statutory Committee of Public Accounts and Audit in relation to the Merit Protection Commissioner. The government has shown that it is prepared to work towards a compromise piece of legislation that will provide a framework for the present government and alternative governments. The Labor Party has not been prepared to accept this process. It has persisted with its attempts to destroy the framework for a high performance organisation which is established by the bill.
This legislation sets out the legislative requirements which would enable the Australian Public Service to develop its agencies as high performance organisations which motivate the members of those organisations and, most importantly of all, provide good government to the Australian people. The government's goal to achieve the Australian Public Service of the future is too important for it to be abandoned and the government has no choice but to reject the Senate amendments.",REPS,<title>PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,1998-04-06,"—Obviously the opposition does not agree with the motion and I will seek, as briefly as possible without traversing all the grounds that we have all covered in second reading speeches and which were dealt with in detail in the committee stage in the Senate, to set out why.
It is always a cause for concern, and it must worry Australians when they look at the parliament, that it seems to be mandatory that in cases such as this everybody has to argue that absolutely all the virtue is on their side, that without doubt they are 100 per cent right and that there were clearly no possible grounds for agreement on anything anybody else might have said on the debate. We just had a really outstanding example of it from the minister, Dr Kemp. It was a rather sad litany, only exceeded by the overweening self-congratulation of the minister who dealt with the previous piece of legislation.
There are some things about which everybody in this debate is agreed. You would not have understood it from what has just been heard, but there are, and they are important, and they are all going to be lost because the government will not accept any of these amendments.
We are all agreed that reform of the Public Service and the Public Service Act is important. A large part of the government's proposed legislation has gone through the Senate unamended. The process of reform was initiated by the previous government and continued by this government. If we had won the election and the process had continued, the outcome would have been different, but that there would have been a Public Service bill proposing major reforms, including a large number of those which are agreed in this bill, is beyond doubt. So let us put that context, and then look at the amendments.
It is true that I argued before on one or two occasions that the government rejected these amendments without consideration. Let us just put it like this: it could not find any one of the 50 amendments acceptable. It is not that the government said, `We only accept two and 48 are unacceptable,' or half and half. But none, not one; there is no acceptable amendment. Why? We all really know why. It is because the government is aggressively pursuing a series of alternative double dissolution triggers to cover the fact that it covets a double dissolution trigger on the Wik native title legislation which is now in the Senate. The government wants to ensure that, if it suits its political purpose to call that election, it has other grounds on which it can obfuscate and, to some extent, blur the fact that the election is being called around the Wik legislation so that the government can pursue what it sees as a partisan purpose in campaigning around that. So the government needs some other double dissolution triggers. Therefore, we get this intransigence in these matters and we find that, strange as it is, there are no acceptable amendments from the Senate.
We, the opposition, the Labor Party, were attacked because some of the positions we are advocating here are, at least in the minister's 
 eyes, different from those which we took in government. It is one of the ironies of life—and I guess in a democracy, if you lose an election, these things happen to you—that if we take the same position that we took when we were in government we are criticised because we do not change, but if we take different positions we are criticised because we have shifted from where we were before.
Of course what this really means is that anything that the minister does not agree with is unacceptable—if argument A does not work, revert to argument B. This is not unique to this minister; he just does it slightly more often and is the most recent performer of this particular gyration.
What the minister in his comments did make clear—and I welcome this—is the fact that the real purpose of many of the government's amendments and why it rejects many of our amendments is really about its views of the industrial relations arrangements in the Public Service, not about the broader principles of public service operation—not about those core values of an Australian Public Service that are legitimate matters of debate, many of which are shared between government and opposition. (Extension of time granted)
We disagree about some of the ways to achieve those agreed purposes. But there are agreed purposes as to the apolitical nature of the Public Service—the obligation on government to deliver an efficient non-partisan public service that can serve governments of either political persuasion in our democracy. Those sorts of elements are shared. We argue about whether this particular way or that particular way is the best way to achieve that purpose, and that is fine. There would be something very strange if members of a House of Representatives, representing the diversity of opinions in our community, came in here and suddenly were struck by unanimity on all matters. That would make us an unrepresentative House by the very nature of the splendidly diverse democracy in which we live. But that would have been a legitimate debate and we would have had some disagreement and some of the amendments that are before us would lead to disagreement on those 
 grounds and we may or may not be able to come to an agreed compromise position.
But what we are having here is a secondary purpose which may in fact at its core be the primary purpose. The government's agenda here is to make fundamental changes to the nature of industrial relations in the Public Service rather than in its core functions and structure.
We do have problems with the legislation, apart from some of the industrial relations matters with which we disagree, and the way in which they are being applied to the Public Service with which we disagree. I outlined at great length in the second reading speech that and our concerns about too closely tying together public sector and private sector industrial relations and other management approaches and missing the fundamental difference between the operation of the two sectors, and I quoted from a very important paper written by a former head of Public Service departments under the Fraser government and the Hawke, Keating and Howard governments, Dr Michael Keating, in an article in the Australian Quarterly. I will not reiterate those arguments because it will take too much time.
But it is important that we appreciate that there are concerns shared not just by the opposition and a few senators. In fact, they would not have been passed if it were not for all the non-government senators sharing our concern, but these concerns are shared by a number of people outside this parliament as well.
Some of the amendments that are being rejected have provisions making it very hard to see why the government finds them so unacceptable. There is the requirement that the Public Service should provide its employees with a fair, flexible, safe, healthy and rewarding workplace, free from harassment; that it should provide its employees with remuneration rates and conditions of employment commensurate with their responsibilities; and fair and consistent treatment, free of arbitrary or capricious administrative acts or decisions; the right to be represented by unions; opportunities for appropriate training and development; and opportunities for 
 appropriate participation in the decision making processes of the agency in which they are employed.
Those six provisions constitute one of the amendments—amendment No. 4, as a matter of fact. If we were dealing with a government that really was trying to find an agreed way of getting through a piece of Public Service reform legislation with which all in the parliament could live, it is hard to see that being an amendment which they would have found unacceptable.
 The sad fact we have here is that what could have been an agreed purpose and some very useful agreed changes will go out because the government will accept none of these amendments. We are having a double dissolution trigger because the government needs a double dissolution trigger rather than wanting as a priority Public Service reform. We will not walk away from the changes we have sought and which the Senate has made because we feel they are important to the nature of the political process and the democratic system in this country. We will persist in our support for the Senate's amendments.

"Kemp, Dr David, MP",LP,1998-04-06,"—I move:
That the amendments be disagreed to. 

The Senate has moved three amendments to the Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2] . These amendments are unacceptable to the government as they are unduly prescriptive and do nothing to assist the Public Service to move towards becoming a set of high performing organisations. We are not rejecting these amendments out of hand. Australia is now breaking away from the prescriptive, restrictive work and management practices that the Labor Party set in place and that the CPSU is currently urging the Labor Party to continue within the Public Service.
The new Public Service Act will allow for the emergence of more creative ways for managing staff and the provision of services to the public. We will not allow it to be corrupted by inappropriate and backward looking amendments. The government has been willing to compromise: we made 30 changes to the original draft bill before it was introduced last year, we had 15 hours of consultation with the trade unions, we made amendments to meet all 20 recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit and we also accepted the suggestion of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit in relation to a Merit Protection Commissioner.
This bill, together with the  Public Service Bill 1997 [No. 2] , provides an ideal employment framework, free of complex and prescriptive provisions. It is therefore of concern that one of the amendments made by the opposition seeks to retain the outdated and inflexible mobility provisions of the current Public Service Act. Of course, if the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) had had his chance, there would have been a more rational set of amendments. But the dills sitting around him on the other side of the House simply could not recognise any of that.
The opposition amendments also seek to have any dropped determinations included in an award or certified agreement and seek to extend the transitional period before existing determinations cease to have effect from 12 months to three years. This amendment is inappropriate. There is currently no requirement for provisions deleted from determina 
 tions made under section 82D to be retained in any other form; they are management instruments which are tabled in parliament and are disallowable. The government does not accept this amendment because it is of the view that 12 months is an adequate transitional period. Additionally, the amendment would reduce the flexibility of agency heads and prevent them from rationalising existing determinations which have no relevance to the employees of their agencies.
We are keen to remove the out of date and prescriptive determinations and provide the conditions necessary for establishing a high performing and world class Public Service. It is important to this country that its Public Service is world class. Countries compete these days internationally not only in the marketplace but also on the quality of their public sectors. The OECD has noted:
. . . the quality and effectiveness of governance is crucial to national prosperity and well being.
The opposition's amendments take us back to the old regulatory regime and are therefore rejected. The demand for less prescription, greater flexibility—which is vital for good governance—and effective delivery of quality service to the public cannot be ignored. This is all about good government. The Labor Party—a narrow, sectional party, tied to the trade unions—has introduced into the Senate those amendments which the CPSU, the Commonwealth Public Sector Union, have demanded that it introduce.
We see in this piece of legislation, which has come back now from the Senate and which has been amended by the Senate, simply one more piece of evidence that the old union dinosaurs still dominate the Labor Party and that, however much some of the young and the restless may wish to change the fundamental character of their party, they are unable to do so. They are trapped, as the older members of the party are—the members of the party whose roots lie deep in the trade union movement and in the fact that the Labor Party is irremediably and relentlessly sectional. It has nothing to say about the good government of Australia.

If it was not sad, it would have been funny. Choose your example. I simply say that, notwithstanding that the minister chose to waste five minutes of the House's time by reiterating the boring speech he made on the first bill, we will not be speaking further to any of these bills. The principal arguments relate to the primary bill, which we dealt with by division.
The opposition supports the amendments moved by the Senate in regard to these three other matters. As I have said, the principles have been set down in the debate held around the place and the division concerning the principal Public Service Bill. We will not be dividing on any of these other bills, nor will we be seeking to reiterate the arguments that have already been put. They apply to the transitional provisions legislation and to the parliamentary legislation. We will not be speaking any further on it, but we will be pursuing the debate in public. If the government wants to continue the debate around these bills in the public or anywhere else, we will be very happy to take it on.

That the amendments be disagreed to.
The Parliamentary Service Bill 1997 [No. 2] , drafted under instruction from the Presiding Officers, adopts the general approach, content and structure of the Public Service Bill 1997 [No. 2]  with modifications to ensure the independence of the parliament from executive government. As a result, the amendments moved by the opposition in the Senate to a great extent replicate the amendments moved in relation to the Public Service Bill. The government rejects the detail of, and philosophy behind, the amendments moved in the Senate to the Parliamentary Service Bill by the sectional Labor Party as it has rejected the amendments to the Public Service Bill 1997.
It is unacceptable that the opposition should once again thwart the establishment of a separate and independent parliamentary service. The amendments put forward in the Senate seek to bind the proposed parlia 
 mentary service by rigidity, prescription and restriction. In short, the amendments bring nothing of benefit to the bill, and they bring nothing of benefit to the parliament. For these reasons, they will be opposed by the government.
The government is determined to establish a Public Service that is competitive into the next century and among the world's best. The government is not going to be deterred from achieving this objective by the short-sighted obstruction of the opposition and the minor parties in the Senate. A corollary to this is our desire to support the creation of a parliamentary service which mirrors the best of the general Public Service and provides efficient and independent support to the parliament.

"Lee, Michael, MP",ALP,1998-04-06,"—I will explain the reasons why the opposition is not surprised that the government is not seeking a double dissolution election on this piece of legislation, the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 . As I understand it, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Ms Worth), has moved that the amendments be agreed to, 
 which is the signal that the government has now agreed not to proceed with this schedule. In my speech of 5 March on the second reading, I expressed some concerns about the impact that this schedule may have on a small number of patients in private hospitals. Basically, it affects people who are in need of nursing home care, but who, for whatever reason, are not able to gain immediate access into an aged care facility. As a result, people have to stay at home. In some cases an individual's health can be so frail that it is impossible for them to remain at home even with the best possible support from their family and friends.
This problem arises on many occasions in country towns where it is inappropriate for people to remain at home due to the frailty of their health and there is no nursing home available in the country town because of the shortage of nursing beds. The only choice available to those with private health insurance is to remain in a private hospital until a nursing home bed becomes available.
What this legislation would have done was result in quite large out-of-pocket expenses for people who had private health insurance, were in need of aged care accommodation and could not secure it. When you consider that the out-of-pocket expenses were to be up to $400 a day, if it took a person 10 days, for example—and that is being quite optimistic in some cases—before they were able to obtain a nursing home bed, you can imagine what people would feel if they had a bill of up to $4,000. These extra, out-of-pocket expenses could also, in some cases, be applied retrospectively, without people realising that they were going to be hit with this massive bill. For those reasons, we expressed in this House, during the second reading debate, our concerns about this schedule.
At that time we tried to be constructive with the government. You can imagine our surprise when the government came to the opposition and said that they were willing to drop this schedule, on the condition that the opposition agreed not to have any debate whatsoever on this piece of legislation in the Senate. It is one thing for the government to seek and obtain our assurances that there 
 would not be an attempt by the opposition to artificially delay this piece of legislation. We made it clear that if the government dropped this schedule there would be no divisions in the Senate.
But the government came to the opposition and said, `You can have this piece of legislation only if you agree to have this essential piece of legislation dealing with a number of important health insurance matters not discussed in the Senate.' This government is once again displaying its timidity in not being prepared to have a full and open debate on private health insurance matters. That is what this is really all about: the government was terrified that there would be another debate in the Senate which would expose this government's $1.7 billion flop of its private health insurance tax rebate. It was afraid to have that debate in the Senate. On 24 March, the minister put out a press release making the following prediction:
Mr Lee's office advised the government this morning that the ALP would force a debate on the bill in the Senate, delaying the legislation by at least two months.
That was on 24 March. He said it was going to be delayed two months, and here we are today, two weeks later, and the legislation has passed the Senate, due to the cooperation of the opposition. And it is just one month since a speech on the second reading was given by the opposition in this House. That is almost a record: to have the second reading debate of a piece of legislation in this chamber and then have it passed by the Senate, with its amendments being accepted by the government, within a month. For the minister to have claimed that there was going to be a massive delay because the opposition was insisting on a debate in the Senate shows that in some way the government is afraid to have a debate in the Senate. It just goes to show once again how out of touch this government is and how concerned the Labor Party has been to ensure that people were not exposed to these massive out-of-pocket and at times retrospective bills. I am pleased the government has agreed to accept these amendments.

"Worth, Trish, MP",LP,1998-04-06,"—The government is disappointed that this small schedule of the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997  was defeated in the Senate, as it regarded it as a sensible reform, especially as the reform was accepted by the Council on the Ageing. So we are still not quite clear why it was opposed. However, it is important that this legislation has got through the parliament as promptly and efficiently as it has, because the main points of the bill allowing for one admission, one bill and informed financial consent remain intact. That is particularly important for the private sector.
For the opposition to claim that the government is unhappy debating private health insurance as a component of the way health is administered in this country is really a furphy because it is regarded to be very important. As we have said from time to time, a viable private sector operating alongside a viable public sector has stood health consumers in this country in very good stead. It is appropriate that that remain the case. The provisions in this legislation for one bill, one admission and informed financial consent are important and the government now hopes that industry will take up the challenge widely, following the examples of Melbourne private hospital and Sportsmed in South Australia, to provide better customer service and better value for money for those who do have private health insurance.",REPS,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1997</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,21,1,speech

—You verballed me on Adelaide radio.
—I have not discussed this legislation on Adelaide radio. I think the only time I mentioned the shadow minister's name on Adelaide radio was to affirm—and it was in fact the truth—that he said he was having an argument with the minister at the time about something and therefore was not going to cooperate on another matter before the Senate.
To my knowledge, this legislation was never discussed on Adelaide radio. I would have thought that those who might be listening at the moment would be sick of point scoring about verballing on Adelaide radio, or any other radio for that matter, given the fact that this is very important legislation. The shadow minister has said how quickly it is passing through the parliament.

"Lee, Michael, MP",ALP,1998-04-06,"—The simple question is: will the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Ms Worth), on behalf of the Howard government, give us an assurance that the government will not seek to reintroduce this schedule of amendments which can impose such large out-of-pocket fees on patients in rural country hospitals who cannot get admission to nursing homes? I am talking about fees and out-of-pocket charges that at times can be retrospective. Can the parliamentary secretary give us an assurance that they will not be reintroduced?
If the parliamentary secretary wants to get some advice from the officials, I will fill in for a few seconds, but I think we are entitled to an answer to the question. Is this government going to seek to reintroduce these measures that will impose such large and unfair out-of-pocket expenses on people who might be staying in country hospitals?
Let me give the example again. The charges are $400 a day. There may be someone listening to this broadcast tonight who is living in a country town, where often there are long waiting lists for access to nursing homes. If people cannot be looked after in their home if their health becomes too frail, 
 it is not uncommon for people to have short-term admission to a local rural private hospital while they try to find a nursing home bed.
We have said that, if you clock up a bill of $400 a day, it does not take long to get a very large bill that could cause quite severe financial distress for many people in country towns, people that I am sure are known to the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor). We do not think it is unreasonable to seek an assurance from this government, having accepted the deletion of this schedule of measures in this piece of legislation. We would like to know, given that there is an election looming, whether or not this government is going to seek to have these measures reintroduced on some future occasion.
Having seen one of the officials come back to the box, that should now give the parliamentary secretary an opportunity to consult with the government's experts. We would like to know what the answer to the question might be, given that the parliamentary secretary has now had a chance to obtain expert advice.",REPS,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1997</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Worth, Trish, MP",LP,1998-04-06,"—It is not just a question of gaining expert advice. If I speak for the government, I speak for the minister, and I would like to have it confirmed by the minister's office that that is the case. My own inclination would have been to have said straightaway that that would be right, if the government had in fact been negotiating with the opposition in the Senate. I can now give that cast-iron guarantee that that is not the case, so there will not be any further amendment moved in the Senate in this respect.
Elderly people wanting nursing home care, whether they be in the country or any other part of Australia, are perfectly entitled to that. I perhaps more than most others in this place would be aware of the situation that many country people requiring acute care do find themselves in. I remind the shadow minister that this was about a 35-day rule and not about anything less than that. I also remind the shadow minister of the very generous package announced just last week by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) which, of 
 course, is very important to the 95 per cent of people who most fortunately do not require institutionalised care in their last years of life and as they are becoming older.
Again, this was one component of this piece of legislation. The government is agreeing to the opposition's amendment. There were very many other important parts to this, particularly those that will help the private health sector.

I was seeking an assurance that, in the unlikely event that the Howard government is re-elected, the government will not attempt to reintroduce these amendments.

"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,1998-04-06,"—The Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998 , which we are debating here today, represents a monumental act of betrayal of the national interest by the Liberal and National parties in this country. It is a betrayal of Australians who live in rural and regional areas, particularly in northern Australia, who over time will bear the economic and social burdens flowing from the sale of this great national asset.
Let me put on the public record my disgust at the government's threat to guillotine this important debate which has restricted the time for me and other members of this side of the House to speak on the bill. This bill proposes the full sale of one of Australia's largest enterprises, yet the government seeks to curtail debate in this House on this matter. One wonders what the government is attempting to hide by this course of action. The government might attempt to muzzle debate in this House, but it will not be able to contain the anger of the Australian people, who know in their hearts that this weak Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who cannot even bring himself to conceding that Australia should have an Australian head of state, is proposing to sell Australia's most important public asset, all for a narrow political purpose.
The full privatisation of Telstra is one of the biggest con jobs and deceitful acts yet pulled by this weak Prime Minister and his arrogant Treasurer (Mr Costello). It is a con job for a very simple reason. The citizens of Geelong and the rest of Australia already own Telstra. They are its shareholders—every one of them. What the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are proposing to do is to take those shares owned by the citizens of Geelong and the rest of Australia, sell them back to a chosen few investors who are lucky enough to have the cash to buy them, sell them to a few big institutional investors who have the accumulated funds to purchase them and sell them to foreigners, whom the government will allow to buy up to 35 per cent of this great Australian company. The crowning disgrace of this Prime Minister is that he will take from ordinary Australians the share they already own in Telstra and sell that share to foreign interests.
But it is not just the shares they already own that he wants to sell. He wants to flog off to foreigners and to a limited number of Australian shareholders the $25 billion in future profits over the next 10 years that will go to general revenue to build schools and hospitals for Australians and to construct roads and bridges for people in rural and regional Australia. The sale of Telstra is an act of betrayal by a government that has no standards and which, with the resignation of seven ministers and its Speaker, and with multiple backbench defections, is literally falling apart at the seams.
There are very powerful reasons why Telstra should be retained in public hands. It is one of Australia's largest enterprises and it occupies a strategic place in the economic and social affairs of this vast country. The company provides around 90 per cent of the nation's telecommunication services. In the new information age in the new millennium, Telstra will be a central agent in providing equitable access for all Australians to a range of social and economic opportunities that will underpin their standard of living and quality of life for decades to come. Access to information and the communications network will be a significant economic and social justice issue in coming years. It is my view that we can best guard against the emergence of an information rich and an information poor society by the retention of the national network in public hands, not hand it over to profit seekers to whom the social imperatives are not paramount in their operating commercial philosophy.
Historically, Telstra has played a pivotal role in the industrial development of Australia's telecommunications industry. Over 70 per cent of Telstra's equipment, materials and service purchases are from Australian companies, and that buy Australian purchasing policy has been critical to the development of an export orientated electronics and communications industry. Indeed, Telstra has been one of the largest exporters of telecommunications equipment in this country. It is that electronics industry that has grown its exports from $50 million a year to over $1 billion a year at the present time.
It has to be clearly understood that under a fully privatised Telstra there would be no such pressure to maintain such a purchasing policy. The communications industry is a rapidly growing segment of global industry, and Australian companies must participate in that growth. But it is a competitive business and they need the demand generated by an Australian owned Telstra with a buy Australian purchasing policy to maintain the economies of scale production to enable efficiencies to be achieved and to enable those companies to stay competitive in the international marketplace. That factor will not be present if Telstra is fully privatised.
It is rural and regional Australia that will pay the biggest penalty for the full privatisation of Telstra and this government's betrayal. Already rural and regional dwellers have had their level of service diminished by the sale of a third of Telstra. The part-privatisation has led to significant job losses in regional Australia—jobs that are almost impossible to replace. With those job losses has been a reduction in services to residents. Under a totally privatised Telstra it would be well nigh impossible for the federal government to enforce or to uphold the community service obligations. The threat of a $10 million fine for failure to discharge those CSOs is a sick joke, given that it is estimated now that those community service obligations would cost the company in the region of a billion dollars.
People of regional areas of Australia, particularly northern Australia, are certainly not stupid. They have a real concern for their economic futures and they know that, if they do not have appropriate access to the sorts of on-line services their metropolitan counterparts do, they will labour under a massive competitive disadvantage for decades to come.
Effective communications is central to the economic development of our great regions, particularly in northern Australia. It is those communities that will be most disadvantaged by what this government is proposing to do. It is another act of betrayal in a long list of betrayals of the promises the Howard government made to rural and regional Australia. Those people know that untimed local calls, 
 which they now enjoy, will become a thing of the past under full privatisation. They also know from experience of privatisation of other public utilities such as electricity that full privatisation will mean declining levels of service to rural and regional customers.
Only last Thursday, on 31 March 1998, the Australian Communications Authority, in its third Telecommunications Performance Monitoring Bulletin reporting on service performance of the major carriers, including Telstra, had this to say about Telstra's customer performance at the moment:
Telstra again reported mixed service performance results for the quarter. Results for provision of new services on or before the agreed commitment date declined for all customer categories, in particular, performance for country customers declined by nine percentage points. Performance for restoration of service and fault reporting indicators once again declined during the December 1997 quarter, with country customers suffering the most.
Of course we know why the Prime Minister has announced the full privatisation of Telstra at this time: he and his ramshackle government are under siege over Senator Parer's breaches of the ministerial code of conduct and the Prime Minister's failure to sack him. But this is not an announcement that has been greeted enthusiastically by the people of Australia.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The honourable member for Corio made an allegation that Senator Parer breached the ministerial code of conduct. The Prime Minister and the government have pointed out that has not occurred. That is a reflection on the minister. I would ask that he desist and that he withdraw that reflection.
—There is no point of order. I will ask the member to continue but to be careful with his comments.
—The members of the government are very sensitive tonight on the Parer affair, aren't they. The simple fact is that the Prime Minister should have sacked him. The Prime Minister established the code of conduct, and Senator Parer violated it time and again. If you do not like it—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. It goes to relevance. The member has already complained about a lack of time to talk. I suggest that he should use his time as arranged by his side to talk and not to bring up irrelevant issues.
—There is no point of order, but I once again draw the member's attention to the fact that he is debating the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998. I ask him to direct his remarks at that legislation.
—I was explaining to the House and the listeners why the government made this announcement to fully privatise Telstra at this time. I think it is a fairly obvious reason to all: the Prime Minister was under pressure because of the violations of the ministerial code of conduct by one of his senior ministers and because of calls from the opposition for the Prime Minister to sack him.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I mentioned before that the member opposite accused the Minister for Resources and Energy of breaching the ministerial code of conduct. He has said that. That clearly is a reflection on the minister. He has not breached the ministerial code of conduct. The Prime Minister has said that. I would ask you to direct the honourable member for Corio not to make reflections such as he has just made on the Minister for Resources and Energy.
—There is no point of order, but I will direct the honourable member to direct his remarks at the legislation before the House.
—The announcement to fully privatise Telstra has certainly not been greeted enthusiastically by the people of Australia, if the polls are any indication of voter sentiment. Since the government made its announcement three polls have indicated majority opposition to this measure that is being proposed by the government. A recently published Morgan poll indicated 62 per cent of people were against the full privatisation of Telstra. The West Australian  poll on 24 March indicated 60 per cent are opposed. The Herald Sun , in its Melbourne poll on 19 March, indicated 58 per cent of Australians 
 are against the full sale. I can understand, in the face of these polls, the sensitivity of members of the government on this particular piece of legislation. Those polls are hardly a ringing endorsement of a policy announcement that was intended to turn around the fortunes of this beleaguered and ramshackle government.
The arguments the government has mounted justifying the sale on the basis of improvements to the budget bottom line are similarly flawed. The government provides a static analysis which indicates that, after retiring public debt and taking into account the loss of Telstra dividends, the budget would be better off by $1.2 billion. Given that Telstra dividends have grown on average since 1992 by 15.6 per cent per annum, the crossover point where dividends would be greater than the savings on public debt is 2002-03. The nation gains for five years in budget returns, then loses forever. That will be Prime Minister John Howard's great legacy to the nation in the wake of the Telstra sale: a short-term five-year budgetary gain and a loss for the rest of the 21st century.
In summary, there are very compelling reasons why this great public enterprise should stay in public hands. From the point of view of access and equity to the information age, it is most important that Telstra remain in government hands. Telstra have spawned an electronics and telecommunications industry in this country that is now making great gains in the international marketplace. It is very important that the demand that is generated by Telstra's `buy Australian' policy, which would be removed if foreign interests got control of this great company, stay to the benefit of Australian companies.
From a customer service point of view, we have already seen, with the one-third privatisation of Telstra, a significant decline in customer service. Of course, the gravest impact of all in an adverse way will be felt by residents in rural and regional Australia. It is those Australians, particularly in the north of Australia, who know very well that the full privatisation of Telstra will disadvantage them quite considerably. That is why the National 
 Party backbench is nervous and that is why several rural Liberals are nervous as well. Telstra should stay in public hands.",REPS,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1998-04-06,"—I listened to the contribution made by the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) with some amazement. The honourable member for Corio appears to have forgotten the sad and shabby history of 13 years of Labor government and the hypocrisy shown by the former Labor government. Time and time again that government said that it would not privatise public assets—that it would not privatise Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. Yet those promises were broken time and time again.
—Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the member for Fisher took several points of order on relevance, and I would ask that you direct him to address his remarks to the bill, which is about the further privatisation of Telstra.
—There is no point of order.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I did not take any point of order on relevance. My points of order were in relation to the reflections cast by the member for Corio on the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer). He really ought to listen. It ought to be appreciated that, unlike the former Labor government, this government is determined to keep its promises. We went to the people of Australia prior to the last election with a pledge that, subject to strict conditions, we would sell one-third of Telstra. We have delivered on that promise. We have now announced that we will legislate to sell the remaining two-thirds of Telstra, and this legislation before the chamber at the moment will bring that about. We have made it clear that the people of Australia will have the choice at the next election to cast a verdict on our policy and thus this act will not become law until after the next poll. The reason that we are bringing the legislation into the parliament now is to ensure that, after we receive a further mandate to sell the remaining two-thirds of Telstra, we will not have Senate obstruction frustrating our election policy, 
 which had been supported by the electorate. The honourable member for Corio also wrongly accused the government of imposing a guillotine on this bill.
—That is correct.
—It is not correct. By arrangement between the parties, there is eight hours of debate on this Telstra legislation. No-one in his or her right mind could suggest that eight hours of debate is a guillotine. By agreement we will have eight hours of debate, and we believe that is fair, reasonable and appropriate.
—One hour for every $5 billion.
—The member for Chifley will have his go shortly, but the fact of the matter is that, unlike the former Labor government when it was in office, we are prepared to facilitate extensive legislation on important changes confronting this country.
It was also interesting to listen to the honourable member for Corio speak about profit seekers. He seems to think that it is wrong that the mums and dads of Australia will be able to buy the remaining two-thirds of this important national company. The honourable member for Corio also would have us believe that Telstra does not operate in the marketplace as a commercial enterprise. He also managed to fudge the reality, which is that the government has ensured where no more than 35 per cent of Telstra could be owned by overseas interests—with not more than five per cent owned by any individual.
The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced on 15 March that the government will seek an explicit mandate from the Australian people at the next election to give us the opportunity to allow them to buy the balance of Australia's largest company. We are keeping the commitment we made at the last election that we would not sell more than one-third of Telstra in this term and we are seeking explicitly a further mandate. Unlike our predecessors, we are honest and upfront, and we do not apologise for that.
—Is this a core or non-core promise?
—You ought not to interject, my friend. Why don't you tell us that the 
 Labor Party in its draft policy was going to sell a further 16½ per cent of Telstra but that policy was withdrawn at the last minute? The Labor Party will do anything and say anything. The Labor Party has a sad and sorry history of saying that it will not sell public assets, and then breaking those promises. The difference between this government and its predecessor is that when we have sold public assets we have paid off debt. When we sold the first one-third of Telstra, we retired a considerable amount of debt and we had a social bonus—the $1.25 billion Natural Heritage Trust of Australia. We are the only government to have such a wide ranging policy to address the impact of 200 years of European settlement in Australia.
The Prime Minister has indicated that when we sell the remaining two-thirds of Telstra we will be able to retire 40 per cent of Australia's remaining foreign debt and that there will be a further social bonus. I believe that this will be as far reaching, visionary and necessary as the social bonus delivered by the sale of the first one-third of Telstra.
Many people listening may not be aware that the coalition inherited from the former Labor government a debt of some $96 billion. The interest payment on that debt cost taxpayers $8 billion last year, without reducing the actual debt at all. In selling the remaining two-thirds, we will pay off a substantial portion of that debt and we will in doing so make a better future for our children and grandchildren. The honourable member for Corio claimed that by selling Telstra we would deprive the government of an income stream. He maintained that this was used to support infrastructure such as schools. He ought to look at what respected economist Chris Richardson from Access Economics has said:
If we pay off government debt, then we're saving money forever, and the net balance . . . is in favour of the Telstra sale to the tune of $1.5 billion a year. That is the saving in interest versus the . . . loss of income from Telstra.
So the honourable member for Corio has been shown to be selling a shabby and false argument, because the government and the people of Australia will be infinitely better off, not 
 worse off, through the sale of the remaining two-thirds of Telstra.
He made mention of the fact that there has been some reduction in the employment sector of Telstra. That is nothing to do with the privatisation of Telstra. Many companies, whether private or publicly owned, have reduced their number of employees, as it is necessary to compete effectively in the marketplace. Telstra has been exposed to the blowtorch of competition and obviously it is a leaner and meaner but better company. Telstra will provide a very effective service to rural and regional Australia, and the government has legislated for the community service obligation. The minister himself mentioned that there would be a penalty of some $10 million at times if Telstra fails to deliver on its community service obligation.
It must also be appreciated that the idea of governments owning telecommunications companies has not become popular in recent times. Right throughout the world, governments have been divesting themselves of telecommunications companies because there is a general recognition that in a deregulated, privatised marketplace with competition it is simply not appropriate or necessary for governments to own them. This bill will provide to the people of Australia the opportunity to buy the remaining two-thirds of Telstra. In fact, the Labor Party sought to frighten the employees of Telstra prior to the first part sale by suggesting that they ought not take advantage of the special opportunities given to employees to participate. Well, the employees of Telstra voted with their feet: 92 per cent chose to invest in Australia's largest company. They obviously supported what the government wanted to do, and they, like other shareholders, will be the beneficiaries.
The government also believes that it is important to allow the people of Australia to buy and own large Australian companies. The Labor Party, when one listens to what they have been saying in this debate, appears still to support `the socialisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange'. The Keating and Hawke governments flogged off everything they could see and used the money they got for recurrent expenditure. Unlike 
 them, this  government is making the sale of some public assets, but we are using the proceeds to pay off debt.
The Labor Party obviously opposes the attempt by this government to make Australia the largest share owning democracy in the world. Robert Menzies made Australia the largest home owning democracy in the world, but this government, in giving Australians a further opportunity to directly share in the ownership of Telstra, will help turn Australia into a country of shareholders. We will free Telstra from the restrictions of government bureaucracy and allow it to perform better. A better Telstra will deliver better services, more choice and lower prices to its customers around Australia. Phone prices have already been coming down as a result of the coalition's historic move last year to allow competition with Telstra, and this will continue.
Let us look at the contribution of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). He said that the government is selling Telstra for `tawdry electoral purposes'. What reasonable person could say that retiring $40 billion in Labor accumulated public debt could be for tawdry electoral purposes? He also said, referring to the Prime Minister, `that without consultation the Australian public would stand idly by and that the opposition would stand idly by and witness the privatisation of a public asset'. What we have done is to announce to the Australian people what we plan to do, and we are seeking a mandate to achieve that. The Prime Minister does not expect the Australian people to stand idly by. He does not expect the opposition to stand idly by. What we are doing is going out to the electorate and saying exactly what we plan to do. The Labor Party, on the other hand, has a long history of saying one thing and doing another. The Leader of the Opposition also claimed, wrongly, that it is actually impossible to legislate for community service obligations. What absolute nonsense. We already have legislation on the statute books for community service obligations, and I must say that legislation will remain in place.
The Leader of the Opposition says that the people own the system through the government and that this legislation eliminates 
 people's shareholding in Telstra, yet 1.8 million Australians now own shares in Telstra, including 92 per cent of Telstra employees. The Leader of the Opposition suggests that this legislation will somehow divest the ownership of Telstra from the people of Australia. What we are doing is permitting ordinary citizens of Australia to invest in this important national enterprise.
The Leader of the Opposition also shamefully referred to the Natural Heritage Trust as a blatantly political exercise. We make no apology for repairing the impact of 200 years of European settlement on our environment. Environmental groups have said that the Natural Heritage Trust is the most wide-ranging program ever put in place by any government to benefit the environment of Australia.
To sum up, the bill before the House is honest, up-front and it follows on from our election promise given prior to the 1996 poll. We are saying to the electorate: if you re-elect us at the next election, whenever it is, we will sell the remaining two-thirds of Telstra, subject to very strict conditions. We will ensure that no more than 35 per cent of Telstra is owned by overseas interests, that no more than five per cent is owned by any individual and that the community service obligations remain in place so that there is a quality telephone service regardless of where people happen to live in Australia.
Mr Price interjecting—
—The honourable member for Chifley ought to stand up and say that this bill is a win-win-win situation. It is a win for the people of Australia overall, it is a win for those who choose to buy Telstra shares and it will be a further win for the Telstra employees who no doubt will again participate in this share offer. The Labor Party once again stands condemned and its hypocrisy is breathtaking. It ought to stop scaremongering and support this very important bill, which will allow people throughout Australia to invest once again in this important national company. I commend the bill to the chamber.",REPS,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,1998-04-06,"—The honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) 
 alludes to the 92 per cent of Telstra employees who have taken up the share offer. With the deal that was offered—a bonus one for two, as I understand it, and a time purchase arrangement—one wonders about the eight per cent who did not take it up, given that 24,000 of them have lost or are about to lose their jobs. Why wouldn't they take it up? In its explanatory memorandum to the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998 , the government sets out its philosophic reasons for selling off the remainder of Telstra. It says:
There is no good public policy reason, nor market failure reason, for the Australian Government to continue to own a communications carrier.
It goes on:
It is intended that the further privatisation of Telstra will enhance its competitiveness and performance.
For whom does the phone ring, one might ask? The performance of a privatised Telstra will enhance the incomes of those fortunate enough to hold shares in the company. It will not enhance the services to those people in rural and remote areas who do not form part of a large competitive telephone market and who will be at the end of the line when it comes to repairs, installations and new services. Why would a privatised Telstra, for instance, outlay $100,000 to install a data line to a farm north of Bathurst, using two machines and three men for a week, without seeking full cost recovery?
Without the monitoring and control a publicly owned and operated service provides, there will be an inevitable watering down, and the universal service obligations—untimed local calls, customer service guarantees and so on—will be consigned to the pages of history as quaint political rhetoric of the 1990s. There are corporations salivating out there, waiting to get a bit of the Telstra action. This is lazy, non-productive investment, whether it be by Australian corporations or foreign—sitting like praying mantises while the golden moth of Telstra is handed to them to devour.
This government thought it a clever political move to sell off what Australians already own, but this two-thirds sell-off is not popu 
 lar, whatever the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) 
 might say about the mums and dads who will be able to buy a bit of the action. Mums and dads are in fact—according to Labor's figures—selling up and the corporations are moving in. Surprise, surprise! Sixty per cent of Australians opposed the first sale of Telstra and 62 per cent oppose the next sale. It is not a popular move. The government is not acting in the interests of the majority of Australians. Something as important as this should have been put to the Australian people in a referendum.
This government cannot claim a mandate to sell Telstra just because it announces it and introduces the legislation prior to an election it will probably win because people out there have got such a lousy choice—apart from in Calare and several other notable seats—including, I expect, the seat of Parkes. The member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) says he gets only one complaint a month about Telstra. I wonder why. Perhaps they are ringing me, so frustrated are they with the inability of the National Party to listen to their concerns. They gave up on Labor long ago. In this proposed Telstra sale, the government is demonstrating that it governs not for the mums and dads but for the elite, the shareholding public, the well-off, the top 30 per cent.
As Robert Manne pointed out in an article last week, the free market and economic rationalist views dominate within the economic elite but nowhere else. He rightly points out that the majority of Australians still want protection for Australian industry, generous state provisions for needs like pensions and health and still prefer government ownership of critical services—like Telstra, the Commonwealth Bank, the power industry and water resources. These are the ordinary people, with ordinary expectations not based on greed but on need—dare I say the battlers?
We should not kid ourselves that this two-thirds final sell-off of Telstra is popular. It is not, and the government stands condemned. The vast bulk of proceeds from this sale will be used to retire debt. Then what? How do we pay our remaining debt and the debt that will occur in years down the track? Do we 
 flog off the Lodge, privatise Parliament House or outsource government perhaps? We would rob future generations of an asset any country would be proud of—an asset generating a $3 billion dividend a year and a revenue stream that could fund the environmental crisis facing this country on a permanent basis.
The Murray-Darling Basin alone is an environmental time bomb. We heard this week that the Murray has stopped flowing into the ocean for the first time in 20 years. Its feeder river is salty, toxic and infested with the devastating European carp. Its cropping demands are out of kilter with the supply of water, its lands are polluted by rising water tables, its trees are dying, and the landcare and natural heritage programs are unable to keep up with the inexorable decline and degradation. Quarantining but half a billion dollars of the Telstra dividend should have been the sort of vision and forward planning needed to arrest the crisis, but this government has thrown away that opportunity. I suppose it expects market forces to repair the environment as well.
In his second reading speech the Minister for Finance and Administration and the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Mr Fahey) cited the pro-competitive countries like the US, Great Britain, Canada and New Zealand, where private ownership coupled with robust government imposed safeguards are the norm. Ask the Brits about the benefits of privatised water supplies—increased costs and a deterioration in services. Ask the people of Auckland about corporatised power supplies. Ask the mums and dads and ordinary people of Europe, where the wave of privatisation since 1992 has cost five million jobs. Ask the people of Australia about a privatised Commonwealth Bank and its total rejection of any community service obligation in smaller country communities. It is leading the charge out of town, deserting the school savers and the pensioner clients. Profits, not people, greed, not need: that is the price of giving up control of these utilities and assets.
Let me put to rest the furphy about public ownership equating with inefficiency. The 
 Bureau of Industry Economics has shown no association between economic indicators and the type of ownership of the main enterprises in the market. Iceland and Switzerland, for example, both have publicly owned telephony infrastructures for the moment; the former has the world's lowest business user charges while the latter has the world's best revenue per line and per employee. Competition is one thing, ownership is another. You can achieve the desired marketplace competitive advantages through proper competition alone. Keeping one of the players, whether it is a bank or an insurance company or particularly if it is the world competitive Telstra, in public ownership also serves to keep the rest of the bastards honest. So what does this government do? It sacrifices three per cent of our national revenue to the benefit of several million shareholders, inevitably large corporations and 35 per cent at the moment offshore.
The minister speaks of the customer service guarantee. Let me cite some recent examples from my own electorate. Daryl Wilson of Millthorpe requested a second line in January; Telstra was not able to install it until March. Ross Jones of Central West Smallgoods in Orange had his phone out twice for over a week. Carol Parker of Meadow Flat was told in early February that no phone was available to her mother in a nursing home until 10 March. With regard to a public phone in Sofala, out of action many times, people were told by Telstra that because it was in a remote area it could not be fixed for two weeks. In another remote area, Stuart Town, a subscriber was told that the phone would be fixed when Telstra got more problems in the area so as to make the repair trip cost effective to the company. This is under a third private ownership.
Lisa Chamberlain, a casual teacher in Orange, had her phone out for over a week despite her pleas that she needed the phone to get work offers. Anne Deane of Lithgow waited four months for a phone connection. Dr Peter Bentivoglio, who is a neurosurgeon at St Vincents, of Lue near Mudgee in the electorate of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), cannot be contacted in an emergency. Telstra still has 
 not provided a mobile service to the area and he cannot get a phone on because Rylstone exchange needs to be updated. Alexandra Coffer of Rylstone said that her husband was told five times that a Telstra crew would turn up. He took five separate days off and five times Telstra failed to show up. Bernie Trainor of O'Connell, who suffers from a brain tumour, was trying to get the phone on at his rural property since June last year. Telstra delivered the cable and said, `String it out yourself, dig a ditch and bury it, and we will be back when we can.' Oberon Council lodged a complaint on 3 March and two weeks later the fault had still not been rectified. So it goes on. Public phone boxes are now to be closed—five in Rylstone shire—in remote locations where there is not even a mobile service.
Finally, there is the example of John Shepherd of Cullen Bullen. The line was laid across the ground to his farmhouse in January. His cattle tripped over it, his farm ute ran over it and no-one came to fix it. He was given some clips to fix it. It was not until A Current Affair covered his plight that some very overworked and overstressed Telstra men turned up last week, no doubt abandoning other urgent work around the state because the media had embarrassed Telstra. And Telstra had the gall to come down here to Parliament House a few weeks ago and, through its boss Frank Blount, brag about the great services it is providing in the bush, then threaten its own employees for trying to bring to public notice these problems. That is the arrogance and the community service of a one-third privatised Telstra.
The clever political ploy of a $10 million maximum fine is just that—a clever ploy. The rigmarole alone required for a consumer to validate any complaint will be enough to deter anyone from taking on the giant, privatised Telstra.
The government has only belatedly taken on board the criticisms from the bush about the lack of community service, the appalling attention to breakdowns and the delays. I gave senior Telstra management a list of over two dozen complaints on 16 February. They promised me in the local media that they 
 would personally deal with them all. A month later, when I and my staff checked on the complainants, there had been no word from Telstra. The company said it was dealing with the list but had not realised that it promised to contact the people to apologise.
The Minister Representing the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, detailed the Telstra performance in the House last week, spelling out in detail the very reasons why Telstra should not be privatised. Let me remind you of the report from the Australian Communications Authority:
Results for the provision of new services on or before the agreed commitment date declined for all customer categories and, in particular, performance for country customers declined by 9 percentage points.
It went on:
Performance for restoration of service and fault reporting indicators once again declined during the December 1997 quarter, with country customers suffering the most.
There we have it; CSO now means city services only, just as it applies to Optus, Vodafone and those other providers interested only in the lucrative pickings of the big return markets. In a recent article, James Cook University's John Quiggin says:
. . . the benefits of such a sale to the budget line would disappear in five years . . . leaving us without the enormous financial and social benefits the retention of Telstra in public hands would provide.
Quiggin says that, relative to the alternative of retaining ownership, there has not been one major privatisation in Australia where the government has made a profit. The Australian taxpayer has been ripped off, to put it mildly—and in Telstra's case enormously so, given the value placed by the market on the share.
One of the major concerns about this proposal is that the government expects that, by implementing a series of penalties, it can ensure that the people of rural Australia will be adequately served by communications carriers. It is a totally absurd suggestion because, as we know, there are already a series of minimum standards and penalties in 
 place—but already the people of regional Australia are being left behind.
Peter and Helen Muller have a small farm in an isolated area north of Bathurst. Their kids are educated through the Distance Education School based at Dubbo. They have four kids under the age of six, and already the eldest are missing out on an adequate education because they do not have access to a decent phone line—just 50 kilometres north of Bathurst. And, under this arrangement, Telstra still meets its universal service obligations. The Mullers have an old copper wire leading to their property, but it cannot handle fax or data.
Just stop for one second and ask yourself why governments became involved in providing telegraph and telephone services in the first place. Private operators in the sector are not new; private companies have been involved in delivering these sorts of services since they were first invented. But the reason government took control of this sector in Australia was to ensure that all Australians had equal access to the service.
In fact, the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905 ensured that the Postmaster General was given exclusive rights of establishing, erecting, maintaining and using stations and appliances for the purpose of transmitting and receiving messages by wireless telegraphy—assuming control, as he did, of systems that had been set up by private operators between capital cities from as early as 1854. As long ago as 1859, cable was laid across Bass Strait from Victoria to Launceston—in those days a tremendous achievement—to link Tasmania into a growing nationwide network. And last week the minister asked in the other house why Telstra should be expected to provide a basic service to Hobart—not Bullamakanka, which will never get it, but Hobart.
Market forces did not build our communications infrastructure; national pride, determination, creativity, research, government guidance, and public need and interest certainly did. I ask the government—in particular, members representing rural and regional seats—what has really changed since those first colonies clustered around the harbours and inlets of our vast coastline?
The last time I looked Australia was still one of the most urbanised countries in the world. The people of rural Australia still, in many respects, are second-class citizens when it comes to gaining access to all-important transport and communications infrastructure—or, for that matter, any government service. I say to any country member who supports this privatisation: you are betraying the rural constituency you represent; you are putting conservative Thatcherist ideology ahead of what deep down you must surely know is in the best interests of the people of rural Australia.
The mobile phones most of us take for granted today seemed like science fiction toys a little more than 20 years ago. Who would have thought back in the seventies when Telecom was carved out of the PMG that today it would be one of Australia's biggest companies perhaps worth more than $50 billion? Who knows what it will be worth in 20 years time?
But there are a few things that are certain. Telstra will eventually become foreign owned and controlled, whatever assurances are given now. There will probably be but five telecommunications giants worldwide within 15 years. Country people will not have access to telecommunication services of the standards they require. The Commonwealth will forgo billions of dollars in revenue that will end up in the hands of those wealthy enough to become shareholders, including the current and soon to grow 35 per cent of foreign owners. Our grandchildren will ask why their forefathers sold those magnificent enterprises that were owned by all Australians, served all Australians and benefited all Australians.
They sold the Commonwealth Bank, the Labor Party; they sold Qantas, the Labor Party; and they sold Telstra, the coalition. They are both guilty. And now they have sold out Australia—especially the bush.",REPS,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,1998-04-06,"—Talking about selling out the bush, I take a lot of notice of the member for Calare (Mr Andren) when every time he votes with the Labor Party over native title. If that is not a sell-out of his rural constituency, I would like to know what is. He goes to the people of his 
 constituency and says, `Vote for me, I'm independent,' but when it comes to an issue as important as his constituents' property rights he votes with the Labor Party. He does not care, as demonstrated by his vote on schedule 4—a schedule clearly defining the circumstances under which people can keep from going to court by referring to one part of the Native Title Act to find out whether or not their property extinguishes native title. So, when we start to moralise in this place about representing our constituents, get on the right track.
The reality is that the member for Calare made another great admission: he cannot get a telephone fixed in his electorate. I have been here for 18 years, mate, and I can tell you that throughout that time I have had complaints about people who could not get their telephones fixed—and that was manna from heaven for me electorally, because I got them fixed the same day, and I still do. If you cannot do it, there is something wrong with your capacity—not with Telstra. You are a failure.
—The member for O'Connor will address his remarks through the chair.
—Let me repeat that to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. You would well know that from your work in your own electorate. Fixing the tax act, that is difficult—but not being able to get a telephone fixed! The member for Calare has been keeping a record of his failures so he can come in here and make a speech. What a blooming hopeless member of parliament! Let us put that aside, because I do not want to waste much time on him. I do not have much appreciation for his ability.
The reality is that we have looked at this issue in many ways. Let me remind the House of one thing: when the government of the day borrows more money than the value of its assets, they are sold, they are gone. This House is responsible for rebalancing the books. The tragedy of the privatisation program of the ALP was that, firstly, having promised the workers of the Commonwealth Bank, having promised its own caucus—and it does not say much for them—and having 
 promised the people of Australia that it would never sell more than half the Commonwealth Bank, it came back and sold it.
The other tragedy was that they spent the money. They had already borrowed and taken our debt up to a point where we have an annual interest bill of $10,000 million a year—much more than they netted from Qantas. I think they got only about $4 billion for Qantas, and it was nearly as much as they netted out of one tranche of the Commonwealth Bank. We have got that every year because of the money they borrowed. Having sold the assets of this country, what did they do with the money? They spent it. They come in here and they tell us that the easy way back into government is to do the same thing again—but the next time round there will be no assets to sell. The simple reality is that they sold Telstra because they borrowed in excess of what it was worth. That should never be forgotten. This government has good reasons for selling Telstra, and they are all to do with economic efficiency. The reality is that the government is also obliged to do it for the future of our children.
The member for Calare, as I recollect, suggested that we have lost $3,000 million a year in dividends. I have just put a phone call through to my office because I understand that figure is closer to a billion dollars a year. The interest savings on this current proposed repayment of $40 billion arising from the sale of the rest of Telstra will reduce our interest costs by $4 billion a year. The net cash flow value to the Australian people is $3,000 million a year, which we might put into some of the issues that are the responsibility of government, such as addressing the health and retirement needs of the less fortunate in our community.
The simple fact is that you do not need to own a communication facility to deliver the service. It was Maggie Thatcher who set that example in England. I will never forget her remarks to our party room many years ago when she said in her special voice—and you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, would possibly remember this little lecture too—`You have to get government out of business. After all, if we politicians were any good at business 
 we would be in business.' That is the fundamental question. The member for Calare turns around and says to us that there is no difference between the efficient running of a private business and that same business in the hands of government.
It is interesting that so much attention is being paid to public hospitals around Australia at the moment. I remind the Labor Party that the only hospitals held by the Commonwealth were the repatriation hospitals, and they quite correctly decided to get rid of them. It is interesting to me that in my state of Western Australia the state government declined the opportunity to run another hospital. It is a very interesting set of figures because as a consequence a private operator, Ramsay Health Group, got the hospital. They reduced the staff from 1,100 to 700 and got rid of all the waiting lists in 10 months. Surely that is what we are about. Surely we are about getting rid of the waiting lists in hospitals and providing better services that people want from telecommunications.
The member for Calare bemoaned the fact that there will be only five major telephone companies left in the world. We are creating the circumstance where one of them might be Telstra. If we left it in the hands of government it would certainly never happen. But they will be in the position to raise the capital on the stock exchanges and expand what is already one of the biggest ownerships of international cables of any country in the world. It is an accident of history but we have them. We are perfectly positioned through Telstra to be one of those five great companies and to bring in huge import revenues to Australia.
—Import revenues?
—Yes, we will import the money. You can call it export revenue if you like, it does not matter, but it is a rather peculiar situation where the money is flowing back and the service is going out. The reality is that all of that is possible because we are providing the opportunity.
I well remember the arguments arising from the Labor Party when they said to us all those years ago that you could not keep the Commonwealth Bank any longer in the hands 
 of the government because we could not give it the funds necessary for it to compete with other private banks. Please remember where all this started. It started, I think correctly so, when the previous government decided to introduce competition to the telecommunications market. From then on, as it was with the Commonwealth Bank, it becomes imperative that you privatise these concerns or their private competitors run over the top of you.
We heard the member for Calare start to run all his furphies. The member for Chifley (Mr Price) might have had something to do with this, because back in 1986 the Labor government, in trying to establish its case for the deregulation of the telecommunications industry, was confronted with the first campaign of furphies. The union was out there, as they are again, spreading fear and loathing wherever they hope someone will listen.
—Shareholders.
—No, that is the union. The shareholders are  the workers. There is a big difference in this day and age between the institution of the union and the people who go to work every day. The union is a self-generating, self-protecting institution. It has nothing to do with the welfare of workers. I watched the MUA people come here the other day, and one of them had two Mont Blanc pens in his pocket—two! I can tell you what they cost because I have managed to afford one. I nearly thought about time payment. We were told of this massive cross-subsidy, so they had an inquiry and they gave it the rather catchy name of Poles apart  in 1986.
—I'm innocent, Wilson.
—If you were, it is an interesting point, because what did this report discover? It talked about this cross-subsidy. They had been told the minute that you bring in deregulation we will have to walk out of the bush. We cannot stay there. The committee did a bit of homework on this and it said:
Whatever the accounting difficulties, the Committee still supports the present cross-subsidy for a number of reasons.
It did not say there was not a cross-subsidy on an individual basis, but it stated:
Firstly, it is crucial to distinguish between `cross-subsidy' and `profitability'. Telecom customers in high-cost areas are not necessarily unprofitable for Telecom. They contribute less per service than users in low-cost districts but their contribution to Telecom's revenue is still positive.
That was back in 1986. It continues:
Non-metropolitan customers of Telecom in 1984-85 paid for all the direct costs incurred in their districts as well as for $433.8m of Telecom's total indirect costs.
In other words, a profit of nearly half a billion. The report stated:
As the largest component of these indirect costs relates to items such as interest on borrowings, which are not necessarily directly attributable to non-metropolitan areas, the loss of all rural and remote Telecom customers would in fact impose a net additional cost on metropolitan users. Rural and remote users contribute towards Telecom's indirect costs and any contribution to these costs is better than none.
Another part of that report said that there was actually a cross-subsidy paid to private telephone users in metropolitan areas. It is a fact that there is a lot more to providing a telephone service than providing a bit of wire. In paragraph 7.9, the committee makes a point about access externality. What that means is people do not buy telephone services if they cannot ring their relatives in the bush; businesses do not buy telephone services if they cannot ring their customers in the bush. The reality is that those services will be provided on good commercial grounds.
Again, the member for Calare bemoaned the fact that someone only had a copper wire and might not get an Internet service. I want to see them get Internet services, but I think they are more likely to get them through a low orbiting satellite service than they are through running out another bit of wire. In fact, those services will be implemented here in Australia by Iridium in September, according to the advice given to a seminar organised by the government members' backbench committee on communications the other night. We were shown the handpieces that will be used which will allow you to access the digital network if you are within range. You just plug the digital phone back into the other handpiece, which is not much bigger than the phones that came out at the origin of mobile phone 
 services, and you can talk through that same phone, through the satellite, wherever you want to go.
The opening cost for that outfit is about $5,000 and the price per minute is going to be about $4. But for how long? There is a second low orbiting satellite company called Global Mobility which is about to start up. Of course, we know from the history of modern technology that those prices will fall dramatically. Those phones are suitable for faxstream; they are suitable for all of your data transmission in a limited way. So the realities are that the options that are arising are such that Telecom probably could not have competed in all these fields if it was coming back to government all the time.
But, of course, the member for Calare happened to raise the issue—his little story that no doubt he will run all around his electorate with—of what has been going on in Auckland in terms of the power supply. What a scandal it is that every second Australian has been told that is a privatised operation. He was a bit more clever; he used the word `corporatised'. Of course the Labor Party corporatised Telecom; it has been corporatised for years, but it remained a government instrumentality until the coalition sold a third of it. The reality is that the Mercury power supplier in Auckland is a government instrumentality. It is government that let the lights go out. It is about time that that point was made and people stopped telling fibs about it, because that is the situation. We read it in the media—they stand to be criticised on that as well because they let this myth be perpetrated that Mercury is some private organisation owning the distribution system in Auckland. It is not; it is a government system.
The reality is that it is not the role of government to own business, but it does have a role to regulate such essential services as telecommunications. The Labor Party were the ones who decided to deregulate it and they did so with our support. At least we stuck to our principles in opposition, something that they have abdicated completely. But the realities are that, in imposing those regulations, you do so as a condition of licence. I 
 heard someone argue one day that you do not tell Woolworths how many supermarkets they can open. Local government does to a degree, but the reality is that Woolworths are selling groceries and they do not get licensed to do so. When you licence someone in this area, you naturally impose conditions, and this government has. In fact, it has relied somewhat on the universal service obligation which I think was originally laid down by the Labor Party. I will stand corrected by the member for Chifley if I am wrong, but that has got to be upgraded. It is patently silly to suggest, for instance, that a group of people in a small community of 200 are so remote that they should have to wait 27 months for a phone.
—There's nothing in the bill that upgrades it.
—In fact, if the member for Chifley wants to bet with me that we do not address this issue, he is welcome to do so. Sir, I do not know what we would be putting on it; maybe we could bet each other a haircut or something like that? But, other than that, the reality is that we are going to make sure of it. I have got huge faith in Minister Alston. I have had communications with him from day one about mobile phone services—about analog and digital. Whilst the Labor Party signed up for digital and left the government of Australia with a problem that was very difficult to address, because time has proved that there is a place for analog in our network, it is our government that has told those people that when digital is the only remaining service it has got to cover the total areas previously covered by analog. That will mean some additional stations because we know digital does not cover the same distance. That is what they will have to do. That is appropriate.
I thank the minister for listening to my entreaties, and no doubt those of others on our side of the House, saying that we had to do something. It was he when looking at the change to digital transmission—it is unique to my electorate at the moment with satellite TV—who came out voluntarily and offered $750 to each and every owner of the old style analog black box to assist them in buying a 
 new digital one. There has been no fanfare about that, but that is what the minister has done. He has had other problems with this changeover due to commercial thuggery, you might say—TV stations beating each other around the head and leaving their customers until last—but the minister has been active doing everything within his power to address these matters, and I congratulate him for it. He will address the outstanding issues relating to the universal service obligations which will be sensible and will represent the interests of country people.
—They are not in the bill.
—I am making the point that it will be changed. We have talked to him in our party room. I think he understands the representations we make. One that I made was, as I have communities of 200 people living within a few kilometres of a community of 4,000 people, why should it be that one group gets a guaranteed telephone connection in a matter of days and the other in a matter of years? It is a silly proposition and it does not recognise the demand on the infrastructure. That needs changing. The minister listened to that, and I am sure we will see something come out of it. As I stand here, I guarantee to my constituents that it will be done.
The fundamental issue of selling Telstra is to give it the chance to be the major organisation that Australia needs and to give Australians, including the workers of Telstra, the chance to be the recipients of that profit through shareholding. Also, the government taking its proper role to regulate the entire industry in terms of adequate service levels is the way that all governments should run. Without it, we end up investing all our money in business when it is our job to look after poor people.

"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,1998-04-06,"—I firstly want to defend the member for Calare (Mr Andren) from the attacks of the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). I do that by reading a press release of 31 March from the Australian Communications Authority. It is headed `Carrier Performance During December Quarter 1997' and states:
Telstra again reported mixed service performance results for the quarter. Results for provision of new services on or before the agreed commitment date declined for all customer categories. In particular, performance for country customers declined by nine percentage points. Performance for restoration of service and fault reporting indicators once again declined during the December 1997 quarter, with country customers suffering the most.
My leader and party are opposed to this privatisation. I say to the member for O'Connor: you have not really thought it through. Towards the end of his speech, he cottoned on to the universal service obligation. I happen to agree with the remark that the plain old, ordinary telephone should be the minimal requirement for the universal service obligation is quite dated. In fact, I want to compliment an earlier contribution by the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), who pointed out to the House that we are depopulating rural and regional Australia.
As an urban Labor member with a poor electorate, I say that this ought to be a matter of concern. If anything, I would have thought National Party members would have been saying of farmers and small business in rural and regional Australia that they should not just have the prices that they are being offered at the moment but in fact they should have lower prices in order to increase their competitiveness. They do suffer a significant disadvantage. But what does the member for O'Connor say? He says, `Look, if you've got a problem in rural and regional Australia, don't worry, spend $5,000 with a satellite dish and for a mere $4 a minute all your problems are solved, you will have digital service.' What bloody great news for the bush that is!
It is true that I was involved in the deregulation that we undertook in 1988 and then later in 1991. I say to the House that I am amazed at the National Party. When I first came into this parliament you could guarantee that the National Party would speak up—if not in this parliament, in the joint party room—to ensure that the needs of rural and regional Australia were not sold out. Undoubtedly, they are being sold out in this bill.
The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) takes great satisfaction from the fact that 92 per 
 cent of Telstra employees are now shareholders. I think that is a good thing. I do not have a problem with it. But what I do have a problem with is that the Prime Minister condones Telstra when they say, `We will sack you if you start reporting difficulties of service problems in rural and regional Australia. Shareholder or worker'—both roles—`we will sack you, we will gag you. How dare you publicly alert your customers to how poor the service is or the decline in service.' I am surprised that his government allows shareholders to be so gagged.
There is no doubt that the urban poor and rural and regional Australia will suffer the consequences. The honourable member for O'Connor mentioned community service obligations. I well remember the department saying, `Look, we ought to put these out to tender, Telstra might be unsuccessful,' completely missing the point that you have to lock the dominant carrier, Telstra, into providing services for the bush. What rural and regional Australia require is far more than a plain, ordinary telephone service. I would have thought that the members from the bush would have given this bill a lot of scrutiny and would have said, `Look, we are completely dissatisfied with it. You cannot privatise this.'

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,1998-04-06,"—In this adjournment debate I would like to speak about the work of the Blacktown Migrant Resource Centre in my electorate of Greenway. My wife, Jan, and I attended the MRC's 10th AGM and I was pleased with the overflow attendance indicating our multicultural community's support for the work of this particular organisation. With over 150 different multicultural groups in Greenway, the MRC plays a major role in assisting ethnic communities to settle into the Australian environment. I was pleased to read the annual report and to find out how this organisation 
 is responding to its mission statement, which is to promote and assist in the development of multicultural society through ensuring equal access, opportunity and participation of all migrants and refugees.
One report that I was particularly interested in, in view of the debate in this place recently over aged care, was the community aged care package program. This project is funded by the Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services and consists of 20 packages equally divided between the Filipino, Maltese, Polish and Ukrainian communities. The aim of the project is to help older people improve their quality of life by providing a combination of services delivered by trained multilingual workers, hence giving them the option to live independently at home instead of going into a hostel for care. The project employs six bilingual care workers and a lawn mowing contractor. The language skills of these people prove to be very helpful and clients are pleased that they can communicate in their own language.
The care for our aged multicultural community is a major issue in Greenway. While there are excellent nursing homes catering for specific ethnic groups such as Maltese, Polish, German speaking and Hungarian people, the needs of our aged ethnic community will increase and many will not be able to provide separate nursing homes for their individual groups. So the demand for aged care packages will increase. I was delighted at the success of this pilot program which I had the honour of launching in 1997 and I wish the project coordinator, Maria Skibinski, continued success.
The specialist migrant placement officers program is funded by the New South Wales government Department of Education and Training. This program aims to provide assistance to disadvantaged migrants to utilise or enhance their skill, experience and qualifications. The placement officer deals with a range of issues relating to qualifications recognition, work experience, training and courses leading to the acquisition of additional or new skills, liaising with government departments and generally assisting with job seeking skills. The program also includes 
 extensive linking with employer and other organisations for the purpose of work experience placements and employment opportunities.
Legislation passed in 1997 extended migrant waiting periods for a range of Department of Social Security benefits from 26 weeks to two years. Therefore, it is important that new migrants find employment speedily upon their arrival. While the general unemployment rate in Australia is still far too high, the rate for migrants, particularly new arrivals from non-English speaking countries, is even higher. In 1997, there were fewer training courses available for new migrants and some of these have now become fee-for-service courses, placing additional burdens upon those whose finances are already stretched.
The success of the migrant placement program can be appreciated by the fact that in the past 12 months 395 clients, of whom 72 were recent arrivals, have been assisted. Of these, 63 work experience placements were achieved, well in excess of the 25 contracted for, 28 clients obtained full-time employment, 70 found casual or part-time work, 80 entered long-term training such as traineeships and 91 enrolled in shorter training, including English language courses.
Maria Votano, in her report as the MRC coordinator, advised us that centre staff had participated in various forums addressing issues affecting migrants and refugees. Mr Speaker, you can see from this thumbnail sketch, the important service that the MRC is providing for our large multicultural population. I congratulate the management committee members and staff for their magnificent work.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Migrant Services</title>,Adjournment,25,1,speech
