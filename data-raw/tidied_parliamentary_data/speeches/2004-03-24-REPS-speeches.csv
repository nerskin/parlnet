"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2004-03-24,"—I spoke last night on the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 following the member for Jagajaga, who commented that the Labor Party did not believe in discrimination. I reminded the House of the rules that apply in relation to preselection in the Labor Party—of how you are given points if you are female. In my own area, somebody I know very well, who was a very good candidate for the Labor Party in the seat of Hughes, was knocked out because the female who was running got extra points and won the preselection. She did not win the seat, because Danna Vale was an excellent candidate for us and won the seat convincingly with an increased majority. We have that from the Labor Party and we also have EMILY's List, which is frequently referred to. So the Labor Party have their own means of discrimination. I am not saying that they should not; I am just reminding them of how things work on our side. We actually have more females who are successful in the preselection process without getting any loading or special consideration simply on the basis that they are females. As you can see, on this side of the House we have some excellent female members without such a program.
I just highlight the hypocrisy of the Labor Party. The member for Jagajaga came in here and said, `We don't believe in discrimination, except for EMILY's List and the preselection of females; and we don't agree with what you're doing.' She made it very clear that there is a problem with the number of males going into teaching. She mentioned issues such as status, salary and career opportunities as inhibiting the number of young men going into the teaching profession—and that is true. It is true that the question of discrimination goes to the very heart of what we are talking about here. But status, salaries and career opportunities can be addressed simply by state governments. If the opposition wish these salaries to be raised, they should speak to the education ministers around Australia. There is no doubt that the salaries of teachers in public schools around Australia fall behind the salaries of those in the private sector, but she should talk to her state counterparts if she believes that it is a problem.
Undoubtedly status, salaries and career opportunities are issues. The deputy head of one of the major schools in my area sent me a note indicating that he saw those factors as significant. Nevertheless, there is discrimination as well. The member for Charlton got into this House by one point, having used discrimination against females as the basis for a recount; she became the member in this House by a margin of one point. So do not lecture us about our being in favour of discrimination, because there are clear examples in terms of your own members. I am sure that the member for Fowler got up in her own right and without any special points. Nevertheless, discrimination exists in the way things are carried out.
Having enough male teachers is a real problem, a real issue that relates to having male models in young people's lives. One part of the problem is that one in seven children grows up in a household where a female is the only parent. As it stands now around Australia, almost 80 per cent of primary school teachers are female and there is a student female population of 55 per cent. We do not even have a clear gender balance between teachers and students. In New South Wales 250 primary schools are without a male teacher—and this is an issue. Young people, who are very easily influenced, are growing up without a role model and there are no male teachers they can look to. Very often, as we know and as I have said, one in seven families does not have a male member in its household. 
We are trying to correct the imbalance. It is not the only solution and we should be very clear about that, as there are a number of issues that should be addressed. But this just removes one of the impediments that stand in the way of appointing more male teachers. It will enable the Catholic education system or any other private school, where they want to, to employ more males as young teachers. I thought the Labor Party would say, `Yes, we'd like to see numerous things done.' I heard from the member for Jagajaga about what was in their policy and it is fine for them to outline those details. But what about this legislation which provides real and immediate assistance in terms of getting more males into the teaching profession?
In terms of early childhood learning, it is true that the number of male teachers is even more alarming: only 3.6 per cent of the 7,115 teachers nationwide provide a male influence on young boys in Australian classrooms. We need to address this issue and I commend the minister for his proposal of positive discrimination to get more males into the teaching profession. This legislation could also apply to women if a shortage of females going into the teaching profession occurs. The current legislation, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, has provisions which make it illegal to discriminate in the hiring of male teachers. During the last 10 years we have seen a decline of some 24 per cent in the number of male students going into the teaching profession. That should ring the alarm bells. It is for that reason this piece of legislation is so important. As I have said before, there are many reasons why young males are not going into the teaching profession—and those reasons should be addressed as well. But let us take this piece of legislation and say, `Yes, this is a positive step forward.'
As we know from previous studies by committees of this House, from the beginning of their schooling career all the way through to the end, on average, boys are performing more poorly in all areas of the current curriculum than are girls. Some people see this resulting from the lack of male leaders for young boys and young men to follow in the area of education. That is why the government has developed a $159 million Australian Government Quality Teacher Program; and it has listed boys' education as a priority, with $6 million being committed to the Boys' Education Lighthouse Schools Program to identify best practice in boys' education. One school in my electorate, Gymea technical high, received a grant under this program and it is working very well, I am very pleased to say. There are examples of encouragement from other authorities: the Queensland teaching authority has created the Male Teachers Strategy, and others have been implemented by the Catholic Education Office in Sydney. 
This legislation does not discriminate against women. We have seen across the board a drop of 5 per cent in the number of male teachers over the last five years, and this needs to be remedied. The Sex Discrimination Act 1984 provides a few exemptions already when looking at this sort of issue. With respect to charities, religious bodies, educational institutions established for religious purposes and voluntary bodies in the areas of employment, superannuation and insurance, there exists an exemption in the Sex Discrimination Act. This bill removes that exemption in relation to the hiring of male teachers. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission has granted exemptions to the Sex Discrimination Act to favour women on three occasions similar to this one. In 1991, the Australian Defence Force Academy was permitted to offer a prize for female students completing a postgraduate degree or diploma. In 1992, an exemption was allowed for the ANU to offer reentry scholarships for women wishing to resume studies after a significant leave of academic studies. In 1993, an exemption was granted to permit women to be offered an engineering research award in order to encourage more women to take on academic and research positions in the field of engineering.
This was all under the Labor government, and they say they do not believe in discrimination. Here are examples of where they discriminated positively in relation to women, and I would agree. That is fine. So let us look realistically at this piece of legislation and at the positive male role models it can provide in the schools to encourage young men and boys. The father-son relationship is always important, and we want to see that strengthened and developed. But, for those young people who do not have males in their household because there has been a separation in the family, this provides positive role models for them. It is a step forward in trying to recruit more male teachers into the profession. There are many more things we need to do, and I know the minister is addressing quite a number of these. I believe it is a good piece of legislation, and I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—I would like to say to the honourable member for Cook—and I am sure he will agree with me—that women have come a long way in politics, but we still have a long way to go. If ever there were a bill before this parliament where the only justification given by the government was that the end justified the means then the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 would be the textbook case. But when the means involve riding roughshod over the rights of women to equality in the education system even a highly beneficial outcome would not justify what the government is asking for in this bill. The most likely outcome, as I will explain in this speech, is that this bill will have no effect and may even result in a negative outcome.
Let me get one thing straight from the start. Labor do not oppose the aim of this bill to encourage more men to teach in our schools, but it is the means of achieving that goal that we question. Given the alternative means of achieving that goal, we see this bill as an unnecessary attack on the rights of women in our education system and the workplace. Let me remind the members of this House that those rights have been hard won by women after more than a century of struggle. Even today, when comparing the incomes of men and women, we find overall that women are paid only 80 cents in the dollar that men are paid, and that is one of the roots of the problem. Until that inequality is addressed measures such as those we are debating here are bound to fail.
This legislation is the government's response to the refusal by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to endorse a plan by the New South Wales Catholic Education Office to offer scholarships to male students studying to become teachers. As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, the Catholic Education Office has recently announced that it will now offer an equal number of scholarships to women, thus avoiding the requirements of the Sex Discrimination Act. This is a measure which the Labor opposition proposed, and I congratulate the Catholic Education Office on its adoption of this approach.
Having said that, however, there is still one other point to make, and that is that the move to offer scholarships in the first place is in fact recognition that men are not attracted to teaching because it is seen as being poorly paid. In other words, it is a woman's job. I have seen many young people who have chosen a career in teaching, and their experience would no doubt turn off many bright young people from taking on a career in teaching. To begin with there is a rigorous fouryear degree course, and for many graduates a permanent teaching position is not immediately available. Many teaching graduates are in their mid- to late-20s before they obtain a permanent position. The pay for first-year teachers is much less than that paid to many nongraduates in less demanding jobs, and there is the HECS debt to repay as well. In short, the teaching profession holds little attraction to bright young people, and it should not come as any surprise that teachers in our schools do not sing the virtues of a teaching career.
I might add that, having heard so much from the Minister for Education, Science and Training and the Prime Minister about the values being taught in our schools, I should not be surprised if students seek out higher paid careers than teaching. If we are to believe the minister for education, we should expect that independent and Catholic schools might be teaching the kinds of values that would lead to a greater number of their students taking up teaching careers. But it appears that this is not the case. As we have seen from the Catholic Education Office, it is necessary to provide special benefits to students to attract them to teaching careers. Even then there is no guarantee that new recruits to teaching will stay in the classroom. The current trend for as many as one-third of teaching graduates to leave after less than 10 years in teaching is not good news for schools hoping to hold on to good teachers, male or female. So if you look at the most likely outcome of this proposed change to the Sex Discrimination Act, apart from the very small number of male students who may be attracted by the prospect of not having a HECS debt when they complete their studies, it is hard to see the change as having any significant effect. In fact, as I said earlier, it may even have a negative effect.
Shortly after this legislation was first announced, I had a meeting with a number of young local teachers. They were furious at the thought of male teaching students receiving preferential treatment. Commonsense would tell you why. Each of those teachers sees a $50 or $60 deduction from their pay each fortnight to pay for their HECS debt. At a time in their lives when they are saving for a home or paying off a mortgage, they are also paying back the cost of their university education. Just imagine how they would feel, knowing that the teacher across the hall—teaching the same grade as they are, having the same qualification that they have, not working any harder or longer than they are—is not having to pay that $50 or $60 a fortnight. Just imagine how those teachers feel.
Commonsense will tell you that they will not be happy. But being unhappy is not the only thing. In what is known to management theorists as equity theory, we also know that when employees are aware that they are paid less than other employees for performing the same work they will adjust their performance to a lower level. That does not mean that good teachers will become poor teachers as a result of inequity. Teachers are professionals and, for the most part, give their best. But can we expect women teachers to go to that little extra length when they know that some male teachers are regarded more highly for doing the same work? If this sounds theoretical, I would remind members that in the workplace agreements that this government promotes there is usually a clause which requires employees not to give details of their pay to other employees.
Those women teachers will not drop the work they now perform and the special roles that they have with boys' education. But the real risk that this legislation represents is that it assumes that only male teachers can provide a suitable education for boys. That can lead to a situation where what we might call `boys' problems' are left to male teachers. Our schools cannot afford the luxury of that approach. With men representing fewer than one in five primary school teaching graduates, a handful of scholarships would be a drop in the ocean in providing numbers of male teachers in our primary schools. Who would be left to deal with these issues? The women who make up 80 per cent of our primary school teachers. What reward will those women get for providing special education programs for boys? Under this minister's legislation, they will get nothing.
But it gets worse when you consider that this legislation does nothing to ensure that male teachers are evenly spread throughout the schools. In some of the disadvantaged schools in my electorate of Fowler, it is not uncommon to find only one or two male teachers. In those disadvantaged schools there is a much higher proportion of children from separated families—many more boys growing up without fathers or other male role models. But you will find women teachers developing special programs for boys. You will find women teachers with an understanding of the difficulties faced by many of the boys in their classes. You will find women teachers coaching the boys' soccer team or the boys' cricket team. This legislation will do nothing to bring male teachers to those disadvantaged schools. The problem they face at the moment is having male teachers poached by the independent and Catholic systems, which offer advanced standing and increased salaries to recruit male teachers from the public school system—not the best teachers, just the male teachers.
I can imagine the same discussion that I had about this legislation going on in every school staffroom across the country. The reaction would have been the same in each one. Teaching was one of the first professions to accept the principle of equal pay for equal work. It was accepted that the value of work performed by male and female teachers was equal and that their pay should therefore be the same. That led to the acceptance of this principle across all workplaces. It is fundamental to the idea of gender equality. It is accepted as a basic right of all women. It is guaranteed by the Sex Discrimination Act, the same act that this government regards so lightly that it seeks to make this amendment. Just as the women teachers in the staffrooms around Australia realise that this is the thin end of the wedge that threatens to destroy the principle of equal pay, once the government has rolled back on a requirement of equal access to education it is only a matter of time before it sees the necessity for other means of increasing the number of male teachers. But the government has not changed its thinking when it comes to equal pay for women. I remind the House that back in 1972 the McMahon government opposed the ACTU application for equal pay. In one of its first actions as a government, Labor, under Gough Whitlam, instructed its advocate to reverse the government's submission against equal pay and to favour the ACTU's case.
This bill threatens equal pay. We had to fight hard for equal pay; we will certainly not give up the fight now. When I was working for the Sheet Metal Workers Union at Rheem, Malleys and Email, the women process workers in Sydney factories were doing the same job as men and working the same machines, but were being paid 40 per cent less. I will never forget the determination of those strong women as we addressed them out on the grass at those factories in support of equal pay.
Mr Deputy Speaker, you might understand why I am so determined to protect those hard won rights and why the ends in this case can never justify the means. The changes in this legislation which open up the Sex Discrimination Act and expose the principles of equal pay simply cannot be allowed. If those ends—better educational outcomes for boys—are so important, there are many other ways that we can achieve them without compromising the Sex Discrimination Act.
We have seen in recent days the Catholic Education Office concede in one way by offering an equal number of scholarships to males and females. But, if we are really serious about improving educational outcomes for boys, we could look to the recommendations of the committee which looked at that issue. Their report did not recommend changes to the Sex Discrimination Act. In putting this legislation before the parliament, this government is conducting another exercise in wedge politics. The Prime Minister has made it perfectly clear that this legislation is about the government wanting to be seen to be on the side of commonsense, but he immediately placed himself in a different corner to that of his Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward, who attacked his plan to introduce discriminatory quotas for males.
Now that the Catholic Education Office has backed away from its plans, the government is left out on a limb on this issue. The commonsense thing to do would be for the government to withdraw this bill and look to some of the suggestions put forward by Labor, which would have a real and lasting effect on increasing the numbers of male teachers in our schools. This bill is nothing more than another quick fix solution that will achieve very little in increasing the numbers of male teachers. That is why the Catholic Education Office has backed away from its idea. They can see that even if this bill were passed it would not make much difference. That tells us that this government's strategy with this bill has nothing to do with increasing the number of male teachers in our schools or addressing the issue of male role models for boys. If it were part of a package involving a range of initiatives, we might think that the government was serious.
Labor has come up with a package, a five-point plan including a national campaign to attract quality entrants to teaching, targeting men with relevant skills and backgrounds, encouraging more male mentors to work with schools and parents, providing incentives for quality teaching for teachers who have the skills needed to improve the learning outcomes of our boys, targeting improvements in teaching skills for our boys and developing student discipline and welfare programs targeted at boys. This package is not the quick fix that this government would expect us to believe will solve the problem. These are real initiatives designed to deliver real results. They are definitely not a cynical wedge to divide the community; they are commonsense solutions to the problems faced in our schools. There are few issues more worthy of the attention of this House than the education of our children, and we have more than ample evidence of the difficulties faced by boys in achieving in our schools. But this problem warrants much more than the cheap political exercise that is this government's response to this issue.",REPS,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Bartlett, Kerry, MP",LP,2004-03-24,"—The Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 introduces an amendment to the 1984 Sex Discrimination Act to allow educational authorities to provide scholarships to males—or to females, should the case arise—to encourage them into teacher training. It is gender-neutral in its language to enable, should the situation arise, discrimination in favour of women for scholarships. But, at the moment, it would enable us to address the need to get more men into teaching. A number of questions arise regarding this legislation. I want to look at five of those.
The first question is: why is this amendment necessary? The simple answer is that there is a drastic shortage of male teachers, especially in our primary schools. Less than 21 per cent of teachers in our primary schools are male, and that figure is declining. In just the last 10 years it has declined from 26.3 per cent to 20.8 per cent. For those in teacher training, the figure is less than 19 per cent, and in some cases it is far less than that. The University of Western Sydney reported in 1998 that only 12 per cent of teacher trainees were males. 
The Australian Catholic University indicated in its report to the boys' education inquiry that only 10 per cent of those in training to become teachers were males. The situation in secondary schools is not as bad—males made up 49.5 per cent of teachers in 1991, and that figure went down to 45.1 per cent in 2001. But less than 21 per cent of teachers in primary schools are men. In New South Wales alone, some 250 schools have no male teachers. Children can go right through their kindergarten and primary years of education with no male teacher. In many cases the only male that they would see would be the gardener, the cleaner or the janitor.
The second question is: does it matter? People might say, `Surely women teach every bit as well as men do.' Yes, they do; women can teach boys and girls every bit as well as men do. That is not the point. The point is that boys and girls need both approaches to teaching. It is important for their social development and for their educational development. Firstly, boys need positive male role models. It is important for their social development that they see men in caring, nurturing roles as well as in positions of authority and that they see men implicitly as well as explicitly modelling appropriate ways to relate to other people, including women. It is important that their male role models are not only the sporting heroes or the exaggerated media stereotypes of hypermasculinity that we often see.
This is increasingly an issue due to the growing number of children being raised in single-parent families. Just in the 11 years between 1989 and 2000 the number of children under 15 growing up in single-parent families grew from 14 per cent to 21 per cent of all children. Eighty-nine per cent of those single-parent families are headed by women. Again, this is not in any way to say that single mums do not do a great job raising their children; they do a fantastic job, often under very difficult circumstances. But boys need positive male role models as well as the nurturing and caring of their mothers. Girls do too; they need to see both women and men in positions of leadership and authority and in nurturing and caring roles.
Secondly, it is important educationally that boys as well as girls have exposure to male teachers. Boys and girls tend to favour different types of teaching and tend to learn in different ways—not exclusively, but there are general preferences for different approaches to learning and better responses to different approaches to teaching. Neither approach is necessarily better, but all children need a diversity of approaches in the classroom. Therefore, boys and girls will benefit from having both male and female teachers, particularly in their primary school years. That diversity cannot happen if there is an overwhelming predominance of one gender over the other or if children go through their seven years of presecondary schooling with no male teacher at all.
The impact of the lack of male teachers—and many other factors—is quite clear. Boys are clearly underperforming educationally. In the 2000 national literacy benchmarks, 3.4 per cent fewer year 3 boys and 4.4 per cent fewer year 5 boys reached the acceptable national benchmark compared to girls. If you look at high school retention rates through to years 11 and 12 you see that 11 per cent fewer boys stay on to complete year 12 than girls. Results in the HSC and its equivalents around the country show clearly that girls are outperforming boys in nearly every subject area. Eighty per cent of suspensions and expulsions from schools are of boys. Only 43 per cent of those who enter university are boys. Clearly, boys are suffering educationally.
I am not pretending that the lack of male teachers is the only issue. There are many factors responsible for this situation, but the need for positive male role models—the need for male teachers in the classroom saying, `We value education'—is absolutely vital. We say to our young children, `Education is so important; it's important that you work hard at school and that you focus on your education,' yet many of our kids look around and quite rightly ask: `Well, if education's so important, where are the men in teaching? Why don't they value education?' So this issue of male role models and male teachers does need to be addressed.
Apart from the people with their heads in the sand, most would agree that we need to encourage more men to take up teaching as a career, especially at the primary level. This legislation is a very practical and commonsense yet modest approach to trying to achieve this outcome. In the days after this strategy was announced I noticed in the Australian on 11 March an article by Dr Peter West, who is the head of the research group on men and families at the University of Western Sydney and the author of the book entitled What is the Matter with Boys? In the article, Dr West put it quite simply:
Will male-specific teaching scholarships improve the standard of education for Australian boys? As a long-time ... researcher of the subject, I believe the answer is yes ...
He goes on to say that we need more than just this measure; we need a number of other measures. I will talk about those other measures in a moment. Dr West says:
Still, a strong case can be made that male teachers do make a difference in the classroom (and playground and sporting field), and they can reach out to boys in a way that women teachers can't.
Will male-only teaching scholarships make a difference? He says:
... I believe the answer is yes ... 
The third question is: what will male-only scholarships do? The fact is that providing financial support for men who want to go or are considering going into teacher training will make their study much easier. For a four-year course in the band 1 category, the overall cost of HECS is around $15,000, so this is a substantial financial incentive. For young men perhaps contemplating a university education, contemplating teaching but not sure, or tossing up between a few alternatives, here is a very clear and strong financial incentive to enter university to undertake teaching. If it were in some way related to a bond to teach for a certain number of years then those young men would stay on in the classroom and many, hopefully, would find that that was the start of a long, productive and satisfying career in teaching. We need to be doing what we can to encourage males into teaching, and this measure will help.
The fourth question I pose is: will these measures on their own be enough? No, clearly they will not, and the government has never pretended that they will be, contrary to some comments we have heard from the other side. There needs to be a whole raft of measures to encourage men into teaching and indeed—
—Tell us what they are!
—just hold on one second and I will tell you—to encourage boys to perform better. Certainly, other things need to be done and have been done. For instance, just in the last two years this government has committed over $6 million to the Boys Education Lighthouse Schools Programme with a view to demonstrating and expanding the take-up of pedagogy and successful approaches to teaching boys—a practical, $6 million commitment by this government to improving the education of boys. There is already extra money for the professional development of teachers. There is funding for research into boys' education. The Australian Government Quality Teacher Program has substantial funding, $159 million, to improve the quality of teaching. There are other responses to the boys' education inquiry report, such as trying to address gender equity issues and different approaches to pedagogy in teacher training to focus on the style of teaching that addresses the needs of boys.
The point has been made that to attract men into teaching and keep them in teaching other measures are needed and that we must raise the status and financial rewards of teaching, and that is absolutely true. No-one would dispute that. Specifically, teachers need to be paid more for experience in the classroom and there needs to be a long-term career path where quality experienced teachers are rewarded for their experience, for their commitment and for their professionalism. Experienced teachers are grossly underpaid and until the salaries of teachers are adequately addressed it will be difficult to attract men to and retain them in teaching. There is no doubt about that. But the point is that clearly the whole issue of salaries is the responsibility of the state governments. They employ teachers and it is up to them to address the salary issues. A member opposite is shaking his head. I have not once seen a proposal from the other side suggesting that the federal government, or indeed the federal Labor Party, somehow get involved and increase salaries to state school teachers. I would be very interested if they had a proposal along those lines. I will return to that in a moment. But here is a point where the federal government can make an impact. By a simple change to legislation we can make it possible to attract more males into teaching, and this really should be taken seriously.
The fifth question I have is simply this: why is there opposition from those on the other side? This is a commonsense, modest approach in the right direction. It is disappointing that for some distorted, obsessive political correctness we are seeing those on the other side shaking their heads and saying, `We can't support this very sensible proposal.' It is disappointing that the Leader of the Opposition, despite all the rhetoric we have heard from him in recent weeks and months about the need to encourage boys and the importance of boys' education, at the first opportunity to undertake a very practical, commonsense proposal refuses to do anything about it. They would rather keep their heads in the sand than address this issue. 
They give a number of excuses. The first excuse is that other issues are more important and they have supposedly got a great five-point plan to address the issue. That five-point plan simply is an excuse to do nothing. The one point of substance in that five-point plan is the need to raise teachers' salaries. As I have said, clearly that is the responsibility of the state and territory governments. If the opposition have any proposal regarding how they plan to raise teachers' salaries, how many hundreds of millions or billions of dollars they want to give to the states to raise the salaries of state school teachers, I would be very interested to hear the detail of their proposal. So really their plan is a plan for doing nothing, to continue the hand-wringing and continue the crocodile tears and say: `Yes, there is an issue with boys' education. We are concerned about it but we are not going to do anything about it.' Here is an opportunity to do something that is practical and sensible to allow education authorities to provide a financial incentive to encourage more males to take teacher training courses and to enter the classroom. So, on this excuse about those other issues being important, yes, those other issues are important, but until the Labor Party offer something concrete to address those issues they really need to support this very concrete and practical proposal.
The second excuse they give for not wanting to support this legislation is that it will not work—it will not make any difference; an incentive of a $15,000 HECS free scholarship will not make any difference. If it would not make any difference, I ask first of all why the Catholic Education Office, an employer of teachers and a trainer of teachers, wanted to go down that path. I put it to you that the answer is that they knew it would work. Under the old system back in the late 1960s, when teachers' training scholarships were offered, many people took up teacher training because of those scholarships. I was one in the late 1960s who was encouraged into teacher training at university because the scholarship was there that would pay the way. I could not otherwise have afforded a university education, I could not have afforded to undertake teacher training, but a scholarship encouraged me and many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of my peers to enter teacher training. We were bonded. Some stayed in the classroom and have gone on to decades of a satisfying career in education. I spent some 25 years in the classroom that would not have been possible had it not been for those teacher scholarships that were available then, in the late 1960s. So this proposal will work. It is a strong financial incentive. 
We have heard the nonsense from the member for Jagajaga that these scholarships will not make any difference and will not attract one extra person into teaching, yet members opposite were wringing their hands about how supposedly a modest increase of less than 25 per cent in HECS fees would drive people away in droves from university education. Here is the potential for a 100 per cent rebate on HECS and they are saying it will not make any difference to attracting people to education. That is a totally contradictory and inconsistent approach. The fact is that a $15,000 scholarship will make a big difference, particularly to those of limited means and those from working-class backgrounds who may be considering teaching, and it will be the first step to encourage them into teacher training and indeed into the classroom.
The third excuse we have heard is that, because the Catholic Education Office now have gone down this other path of offering equal scholarships to men and women, this legislation is no longer needed. Yes, the Catholic Education Office did go down that other path, but they were forced to because they could not achieve what they wanted to by offering scholarships to men in the way they wanted to. This is a much more expensive approach and they cannot offer as many scholarships for men as they might otherwise have wanted to. The point has been made by some speakers opposite that this approach that they are finally taking is the one recommended by the committee inquiry into boys' education. That may be so, but the fact is that a proposal to offer male-only scholarships would have been rejected, as it has been rejected now by the Labor Party, because of its offence supposedly to the Sex Discrimination Act. But here is a much more direct, effective and better targeted approach to offering scholarships to males. It is a very simple, very modest and very sensible approach, which is not being supported by the opposition, when clearly it should be supported because it will help address the issue and get more males into teaching.
The fourth excuse we have heard from some members who have spoken on this bill—we heard last night from the member for Jagajaga and this morning from the member for Fowler—is that this is somehow an outrageous attack on the Sex Discrimination Act. What absolute nonsense. It is not an attack on the Sex Discrimination Act; it is not an attack on equality of pay and working conditions for men and women. In fact, as I said earlier, the legislation is written in gender neutral language so that it can address the teaching needs of either men or women, if there were a shortage of either, or if there were a shortage regionally. The bill contains a very specific amendment for a very specific purpose—yet, sadly, the sacred cow of political correctness seems to be more important to the other side than addressing this obvious need to have more males in our classrooms. 
I am astonished that the Labor Party are against this. They seem to be against any affirmative action to get men into teaching, yet they have an entrenched system of affirmative action for their own preselection processes. The Labor Party have weighting for preselection to get more women into winnable seats, and that is acceptable to them, but a modest approach to affirmative action to get more males into the classroom is not acceptable. Where is the consistency in that, members opposite? Why is affirmative action acceptable for Labor Party preselection but not for something as fundamental as getting more males into the classroom? The real issue for those opposite seems to be a paranoia about any slight advantage to men, no matter how necessary it is and how beneficial the outcomes would be.
It is essential that all children are given the best possible chance to succeed at school. This involves many things: adequate resources; correct pedagogy; appropriate curriculum; small class sizes; support for students with special needs; and committed, professional teachers. But one requirement is for students to be exposed to a range of teaching styles—a balanced and varied approach that they can only get by having both male and female teachers. This need is best met by having balanced numbers of teachers, and this proposal is one sensible, practical way to achieve this outcome. I am very disappointed that those opposite do not want to support it. I encourage them to think again, because the future education of our boys is what is at stake here.",REPS,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Bevis, Arch, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—It is not the future education of our boys that is at stake here; it is the future education of our children—boys and girls—that is at stake here. The Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 is not a solution to increase the percentage of male teachers in our schools around the country; it is a stunt. The bill has been cobbled together in a rather hasty fashion. It consists of four sentences and a schedule, and the schedule does not run to a page. This bill was cobbled together by this government as a political ploy in the last few months as the government reeled under the weight of negative public opinion during the first part of this year.
The government latched onto a justification for this bill arising from an application by the Catholic Education Office in Sydney to be exempt from parts of the Sex Discrimination Act in order to offer 12 scholarships to male students. That was the basis on which the government justified this bill. If indeed that was the honest reason for this bill's hasty appearance, it exists no more. The Catholic Education Office and HREOC have come to a resolution on this matter, and a new application is being lodged for 12 male and 12 female scholarships—not a problem. The Catholic Education Office have put in place a mechanism to do precisely what they wanted to do, which was to offer 12 male scholarships. They were also offering 12 female scholarships. There is no doubt the Catholic Education Office are going to employ far more than 12 males and 12 females. It is not an imposition on them to be offering those scholarships. It is certainly the case that the basis that the government claimed for this bill no longer exists, but the government wants to persist with the bill in the hope of creating some third-force wedge in Australian politics to try to reclaim some of the public debate.
I want to deal with some aspects of the bill, its operation and what goes on in schools. I have spent a few years as a teacher, and I spent 13 years working for a teachers union—and I will come to the point of teachers' salaries later. I think I am one of only two people in this entire parliament who have been actively involved for some years in trying to improve conditions of employment for teachers. I do not recall getting assistance from the Liberal or National parties at any point in the 13 years I worked in the Queensland Teachers Union. But I will return to that later.
At the outset, I want to make some comments about the importance of the teaching profession. Teaching is, I think, one of the most noble and important professions in our community. It is fundamentally important to the welfare of our current society and, more than most professions, it shapes our future. It is the key that unlocks the future for many, and, as a number of members in this parliament have already commented, for those of us here in this chamber it broadened our horizons and provided us individually with opportunities that we would not otherwise have had. In my case, having left secondary education after year 12 in 1971 and having started my tertiary education in 1972, I happen to be one of those people who are indebted to the reforms of Gough Whitlam, who ensured that tertiary education was something that was available not just to the privileged. I was fortunate. I had a choice of scholarships to take when I went into tertiary education. Many people I went through primary and secondary school with, in the suburb I grew up in, did not have that opportunity and did not have the funds to go to university or further education. I think that was a great tragedy. Gough Whitlam's reforms were a major step forward in ensuring that opportunity for many.
Let me go back to the days when we had bonded scholarships, offered by state governments, for teachers. In those days, in order to get males into the profession, there was a preferential system. My school years predate a couple of systems of tertiary entrance assessment, but the figures roughly translate like this: when I did year 12, if you had what amounted to 22 or 23 points under the old external examination system in Queensland, you could get yourself into an arts degree at university. Other courses had a higher entry: a medical degree at the time was around 30 points and a law degree was around 25 or 26 points.
If you were a woman and wanted to get into teaching, you needed 20 points; if you were a man, you needed 17 points. The government of the day lowered the bar for males wanting to teach. That is not a solution to the problem. We do not improve the opportunity for our young children in schools by giving them teachers who were placed there simply because we lowered the bar and they happened to be of a particular gender. But that was in fact the system that operated in the good old days. In 1971, when I qualified to go on to tertiary education, I could have got into my teaching course on lower marks than any girl going through high school. That system of bias operated for decades. I know that system operated in Queensland and I am not sure whether it operated in other states, but I would guess that other states had a similar system to try to encourage more males into the teaching service. That was not a solution to the problem; it was a superficial answer. We have before us today another superficial answer wrapped up in some political spin-doctoring. That system does not work.
Let us fast-forward to today: a few weeks ago, when the government announced its intention to pursue this legislation, I got a call from a constituent, who was bemused by the actions of the government in its approach to this problem. This constituent is a mature-aged entrant into a teaching course. With university qualifications and a profession, he had been encouraged to enter teaching and so did a postgraduate course. He entered tertiary education when he was around 48 years old. He is now in his early 50s—a mature-aged teacher with world experience and qualified to teach maths and science. Maths/science teachers are in great demand in our schools. This constituent is male, has the highest assessment for employment and is looking for a job in an area where there are shortages but he cannot get a full-time job. Why? Because he has family commitments and other obligations in Brisbane and is not willing to tick the box that says he will travel anywhere in the state. He is able to get part-time work, but that does not pay the bills, the rent or the loan and does not look after the family obligations.
We have a shortage of male teachers not because they are not offered some sort of scholarship up front but because the system is structured in a way that does not encourage them into it or to stay in it. The best thing that can be said about the government's proposal to facilitate gender based scholarships is that it might encourage people to start, but it will do nothing to encourage them to stay. This is a stunt designed not only to get over a hiccup that some people see in the system but also, more than that, to capitalise on the Catholic education officers' application a couple of years ago, which has now been resolved in any case.
Attracting someone into the teaching profession does not help much. One of the problems the teaching profession has long had is that it has a significantly high turnover, as is evident from the number of ex-teachers in this chamber and also in state and federal parliaments. You will find that there are a lot of ex-teachers in a lot of different walks of life because, typically, they do not stay in the job for 20 or 30 years. There have been a lot of surveys done as to why this is the case. One thing is clear: the career paths and the rewards of staying in teaching are not able to compete with those available in the private enterprise market.
I have listened to a couple of government speakers who have said that we do not pay our teachers enough—and they are right. I spent some years arguing the case for teachers to be paid more. When I was a union official in the Queensland Teachers Union, I argued with the Bjelke-Petersen government. I can tell you that there were not too many favours for teachers from the Bjelke-Petersen government. The Bjelke-Petersen government was suspicious of anybody who had completed year 12, let alone anybody who had gone on to tertiary education. The idea that you paid teachers more was a foreign concept. Some people will say that that was then, but since then things have not changed dramatically at all.
Government members in this parliament say that we should pay teachers more, but say, `That has nothing to do with us. That is a state problem and all the states are Labor. The reason we have this difficulty is that the Labor states are not doing the right thing.' Let us be fair dinkum about this: the problem of low teacher pay is not something that has cropped up in the last three years; low teacher pay has been a problem for decades. Until the nation—not just the states—faces up to that reality, we will be in this vexed position forever. In this category in the education system are not just teachers but also our academics in tertiary education and our researchers in research institutes, and I am appalled at how badly we pay them. We want world-class education, yet we pay second-rate wages to people who are critical to the process.
What is more important than how many men are teachers is the quality of the teachers who are in the classroom. Having quality teachers involves providing support and facilities that have seldom been available to teachers. One of the best systems of support in our education system that I can think of in the last 25 years was when the former Labor government introduced national funding to the states to ensure that there was full and proper in-service education for teachers. That meant that those people who had been attracted to the profession could get relief from day-to-day class activities to go and do the upgrades and in-service work necessary to maintain their skills and confidence and to recharge their batteries.
I can well remember in the early 1980s the Labor government establishing a system that allowed for what were known as whole school withdrawals. Teams of teachers paid for through Commonwealth funds would go to schools throughout the state on a systematic, rotational basis to enable the teachers in those schools to withdraw from their classroom activities for a week and go and do professional training in a structured program. The children were properly looked after by a team of specialist relief teachers, who would come into the school and pursue the programs that had been developed by the standard classroom teachers, while the classroom teachers, as a group, had a rare opportunity to work together on professional development, school planning and curriculum work. That was a great system. Unfortunately, it does not exist anymore. Systems like that are not going to happen if we simply say in this parliament, `That's the states' responsibility.' It does not matter whether there are Labor or Liberal state governments or whether there is a Labor or Liberal federal government. As a matter of good public policy, the national parliament has to accept its responsibilities in these matters, and programs like that one are essential if we want to provide for the genuine involvement of teachers and encourage teachers to stay in the profession longer.
In Queensland a parallel problem exists in providing teachers in remote parts of the state. In the good old days that was not a problem, because people were on bonded scholarships. You had to work wherever they sent you, so they would send you to the bush. You worked in the bush for a couple of years and then, if you were lucky, you got back to the coast and maybe a few years after that back to south-east Queensland, if that was your home. After many years, what was put in place was decent accommodation for teachers and reasonable rents for that better quality accommodation—which, of course, is what the private sector do. If they discover a mine in the back of Bourke, they do not simply compulsorily shift folk there. They provide financial and other incentives so people want to go there. Some people go to those places, are tickled pink and will stay there forever. A fellow I know well went to Thursday Island as a young teacher, and that would have been the best part of 30 years ago. He has married and settled there, and you would not get him out of the place in a month of Sundays. Other people who go to a place like that want to do their two years and then come back to Townsville, Rockhampton or Brisbane. But there are people who will go to those places, love them and stay there.
The essential ingredient is to provide incentives, both financial and professional. The bill before us today does nothing at all about those things. It is a short-term political fix for short-term political gain. The most it can possibly do is encourage a few people in the front door. All that will end up doing is costing the system money, because it will increase the rotation. If this change attracts people who are not otherwise interested in teaching, then they will not stay just because of a scholarship. It will take a lot more than exempting them from HECS to make them want to teach for the next 15 years. I am sorry; they will not do it. They might teach for one or two years and then decide it is not for them and walk out the door. All we will have done then is waste the employer's money and taxpayers' money, as we will have a revolving door of people being enticed in for a year or two before walking out, only creating a greater demand for someone to walk in to replace them in the vacancy they just created.
That is not the way to address any of these questions of staffing. It is certainly not the way to address the gender issue of needing more male teachers. It is desirable that we have more male teachers in our schools; I share that view. But I do not share the view that this is the basis upon which we should set aside the antidiscrimination act. I do not share the view that, if we offer scholarships, it will somehow fix the problem of how many male teachers we have in the classroom; it won't. And how many scholarships are we talking about, by the way? Twelve. We have a bill before us in this parliament that is going to fix the problem of the gender imbalance amongst teachers—yet we know there are only 12 scholarships out there, and those 12 scholarships have been offered without this legislation.
How many additional scholarships does this bill create? I invite the members on the government side in this debate to quantify it. Tell the parliament how many additional male teachers the passage of this bill will facilitate. Put a figure on it. Put a target on it. We want to have outcome oriented assessments in so many of the things we do in life, in the public sector and the private sector. Do not talk about the inputs; talk about the outputs. Let us hear a government member apply that to this bill. Let us hear a government member specify how many additional male teachers we will have in a year's time, five years time or 10 years time as a result of this bill. The government cannot answer that question. They do not know how many extra teachers it will create. They do not even know how many extra people it will create walking in the front door. There is no reason to deny the possibility that every one of the males who takes up a scholarship as a result of this bill would have gone into education anyway. Every one of them may have been intending to become a teacher in any event. There is not a shred of evidence the government can advance to demonstrate that this bill will in any way alter the number of males either entering the teaching service or staying in it. The best they can suggest is that it will increase the number of male teachers at the moment by 12. Big deal! How many of those 12 teachers will still be teaching five years after they enter service? Probably about a third, if we are lucky.
If you are fair dinkum about wanting to address this issue, look at the broader problems. Do not just look at them, as the previous government spokespeople have, and say, `It's the states' responsibility to pay teachers more and do all these things'. It is not. The critical improvements in education in this country have come when there have been national programs that the Commonwealth parliament has funded. Nearly all of those have been under Labor administrations, through the Hawke years and the Whitlam years. This bill is a stunt. It does not address the issue that it sets out to address and it does not deserve to be carried by this parliament. I suspect it will not be.",REPS,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2004-03-24,"—Before the member for Brisbane leaves this place I would say that, in listening to his offering this morning, it is not unexpected that you would hear that from a politically correct union hack on behalf of his union. Sharan Burrows, the head of the ACTU, is a former union representative on the national body. Members opposite are obviously driven to oppose this bill by their politically correct union masters. It has nothing to do with the rights and wrongs of it; it has to do with the directions they are given by their unions.
The member for Brisbane has outlined his previous work history, how he got into this place, how he is wedded here and, ultimately, why he has to say what he says.
—I am proud of my background!
—We have dealt with him, so let us move on. The fact is that the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 is endeavouring to correct an imbalance. The Labor Party might want to criticise the bill for all it is worth but, at the end of the day, this side of the parliament is trying to do something about the imbalance of male teachers in primary schools.
I come from a position of some authority on this. Like other members of this parliament, I was a school teacher—for 18 years, on and off. My brother is still a school teacher at Merredin High School, my sister is a teacher at Albany High School and my younger sister was a teacher of intellectually disabled children at, believe it or not, the Kim Beazley Centre in Fremantle. So I come from a background where school teaching is part of our life.
As a school teacher I always bemoaned the fact that there were so few male teachers in primary schools. As has been said before, we are now getting to the stage, particularly in primary schools, where quite often the only male influence in the school other than the headmaster is the gardener or somebody who comes in to do labouring work around the school. This has had a detrimental effect on the quality of education, particularly for boys.
It is difficult to have one of the female teachers take the boys out for football coaching and other more male oriented sports. I was the coach at the boys' football clubs at all my previous schools and we had a lot of success. That was a good opportunity to bond with the boys, to see them achieve success and get stuck into a good game of football.
They would not have had the same opportunities with a female teacher because as much as any female teacher might like to have coached the boys—and they did—they did not have the same hands-on experience of playing football. When the boys go off into the change rooms, they do not want the female teacher going in there—because there is no male teacher—hurrying them up to get out onto the ground. It is just a practical impossibility. Those are some of the practical effects of not having enough male teachers in schools.
I also say at the outset that there are a number of reasons why males are not attracted to primary teaching in particular. We know that the ratio in high schools is far higher—it is closer to fifty-fifty—but declining. In primary schools it is one to five, which is quite disappointing. This is what this legislation seeks to address.
The member for Brisbane says, `This is for 12 scholarships. What are 12 scholarships going to achieve?' It is about a program which may grow to provide greater opportunities. The member for Brisbane himself said that he was a bonded teacher, as was I. Coming from a rural background as I did—I was not born with a silver spoon in my mouth—the opportunity of tertiary education was afforded me, my brother and two sisters because we had the opportunity to receive bonded scholarships.
When I graduated from Graylands Teachers College the first place they sent me to was Wickham. I thought, `This is good. That is High Wycombe in Perth. I will be just down the road from where I've been all these years.' But Wickham was not even on the map; it was a new mining town out of Roebourne. For those who do not know where Roebourne is, it is south of Karratha and Port Hedland. It was a great shock to suddenly find myself delivered into the Pilbara as a brand-new teacher ready for my first class. Things have changed for the better. My first class had 42 kids in it—so much for class sizes these days—and I humbly say that I got in and taught them rather well.
When I started teaching in 1973 or 1974, as a male I was paid more than my female counterparts. I am not saying that that was right but that was what happened in those days. It was quite strange—I recall I was on $5,000 a year, which I thought was fantastic, and I think the ladies were on $4,500 a year, which was wrong. It is good to see that equality has been brought into pay for teachers. At the end of the day, teachers are not paid what they are worth, just as nurses are not paid what they are worth.
This is another inherent problem with the system. In the state school system there is inflexibility about paying teachers what they are worth. There is no reward for merit in the state school teaching system, of which I am a product. My wife is also a school teacher in a state government school, so I have a continuing interest in school teaching.
We are about to debate in this House today the award system and workplace relations. The inflexibility of the award system in teaching is one of the things that strangles men and prevents them from staying in the system. There is no reward for merit. The teacher who turns up at nine o'clock and leaves at three o'clock gets paid the same as the teacher who gets there at seven in the morning, leaves at 5 p.m. and takes work home. There is no reward for the person who wants to negotiate a better deal because he or she is a quality teacher. This is one of the things that could attract males to stay in primary schools longer.
Non-government schools have the flexibility, through their employment arrangements, to be able to offer individual agreements. But the state based systems are unfortunately all the same because of the rigid award system that the people on the other side of this House want to see maintained. This inflexibility does not encourage teachers of merit or teachers of quality to stay in the schools. Quite often many male teachers who want to make a long career of it see their friends, their contemporaries and their colleagues being offered far more money in the private sector or other forms of employment while they are stuck in this rigid time warp that the state regimes offer under the awards.
But there are other obstacles to male teachers staying in primary schools. When I was a teacher, we used to go into the local bar of the Wickham Hotel and people would come up to you and say, `G'day, Mr Randall,' and, because you were a teacher, they would seek your advice and they would pat you on the back as if you were somebody who was highly respected and creditable. Now the status of teachers is not much better than the status of some people who appear in that sliding scale which is printed every now and again—and I do not want to name people because that will come back and—
An opposition member—Not ahead of politicians?
—I suppose teachers may still be ahead of politicians in terms of credibility, but that in itself could even be a little bit sad. There is a lack of respect for teachers. I went to a primary school's graduation ceremony at the end of last year and the principal got up and talked about the fact that, after the home-time bell, teachers had been assaulted in the car park because parents had not liked some of the efforts during the school day. Teachers being belted up in the car park or on the way home from school would have been unheard of in days gone by. I am also aware of similar cases with female teachers in some of the northern suburb schools that I used to teach in in Perth. People would wait in the car park for them to give them a bit of a hiding because they had not been happy with the discipline or some of the things that had gone on at school during the day. So lack of respect is another reason why teachers do not stay.
One of the things about primary school teaching is that, rather historically, the workplace obviously describes certain types of people it wants. It is pretty hard to imagine many male teachers being in kindergarten or pre-primary because that level lends itself to a more matronly, maternal type of care that does not necessarily come with a male. You can see that there are very few male teachers in most of the preschools and kindergartens around this country. You also see that there are very few male teachers in grades 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 and that the bulk of the male teachers are in grades 6 and 7. It tends to graduate itself. It is pretty obvious that male teachers often lobby quite hard to get the senior classes because they feel more comfortable with the senior classes. So that is another factor that is self-describing.
I want to address one reason that has not been mentioned very much so far, and that is the issue of child protection and male teachers in schools. I will just outline a couple of cases. In Perth, Mr Frank Pownall went through a long and exhaustive inquiry where he was accused of sexual harassment. He was eventually exonerated but he lost his job. A very dear friend that I taught with many years ago, Peter Millar, used to be called God because he was an almost angelic type of person who would never do anything wrong. He was one of those teachers who arrive at school at dawn and leave in the dark of the evening. He was the perfect teacher—and, as I said, he did not get paid any more for that. Strangely enough, when Peter was a teacher at Manning Primary School, he was accused by a student of inappropriately touching one of the female students. Peter Miller was married and had three daughters. He went through the court for years and, sadly, it destroyed his family. It destroyed their self-image and their self-respect because the case was reported in the papers in Perth. At the end of the day, I was a character witness for Peter in court and the case was dismissed. But that case stopped Peter getting a promotion—a promotion he deserved because of the sort of teacher that he was. It had a detrimental effect not only on his career but also on his wife and daughters. His wife is a schoolteacher as well. It was one of the most disgraceful episodes.
They are the sorts of episodes that scare men off teaching, particularly in primary schools. It is very dangerous for a male teacher to have a boy or girl sit on their knee, for example, when the student wants to be comforted. You see these children who are crying who have been hurt in the playground or are being bullied and you want to put your arm around them and comfort them, but the nasties in this world could then accuse you of some sort of inappropriate touching or handling, and then you would find yourself in court or facing some disciplinary action from the teaching union.
The fact is that there are inappropriate people in schools. I taught in a school where we suspected the deputy principal of being a paedophile—and we kept a very close eye on him, I can assure you. He was eventually pushed out of the system, although nothing could be proved. At the end of the day, it is a sad fact that it is difficult in primary schools for men to totally engross themselves in their jobs because they have these issues of child protection and there is the opportunity for them to be got at.
Let us look at why the Labor Party are opposing this bill. As I said, they have basically been given the instruction to do so by the unions. Sharan Burrow, from the ACTU, is a former teacher herself. They want to make sure that the only affirmative action in this place is affirmative action on behalf of women in the ALP. To see that you need look no further than EMILY's List. EMILY's List was the creation of the Labor Party under Joan Kirner. It gives special weighting to female candidates for the Labor Party. We can see some of the people it delivers in this House. They tell me Kelly Hoare got over the line by one vote—and she is an absolute bonus to this parliament!
I would like to read a letter written to the editor of the West Australian on 15 March by a former Labor member of this House, the member for Kalgoorlie, Graeme Campbell, who fell out with Mr Keating for some of the same reasons we are talking about today—that is, not being able to tell the truth about certain things. Graeme Campbell's letter goes like this:
Factions in the Labor Party decided women were under-represented in the Parliament. To correct this perceived imbalance they decreed that a certain number of seats should be allocated to women.
There was no pretence of merit; gender was to be the determining factor. The factions did not want bright women. They wanted obedient women who could be relied on to toe the factional line.
What they now have to do is explain to the public why it is acceptable to discriminate in favour of women in politics, but unacceptable to discriminate in favour of men going into the teaching profession, when the imbalance is greater than it was in politics and the consequences far more dire.
Is there any chance of the media subjecting Mark Latham's policies and utterances to critical analysis?
This is a former Labor colleague certainly giving them a bit of a touch-up on this; in fact, he points out the hypocrisy of this. The Leader of the Opposition, Mark Latham, says in this House that he wants to do something about male role models for boys in the community who are in single-parent families without a male—dysfunctional families. We read about some of his dysfunctional male role models in the paper on the weekend. At the end of the day, when he gets the opportunity to do something about it in this House, he baulks at it, again because of the union masters of the Labor Party in here. We know that something like 78 per cent of the Labor people in this House come from a union background, yet only 17 per cent of people in the community belong to a union, so it is just not representative.
Janet Albrechtsen, in her column in the Australian this morning, is critical of this argument. She is a bright lawyer who has been a commentator on many issues. But, at the end of the day, even in her criticism of this particular initiative she points out that the Leader of the Opposition, Mark Latham, has had an opportunity to do something positive and come out and make some strident statements on this. She says this in a nice way, and not, as the Leader of the Opposition described her in this place, as a `skanky ho'. She points out that he has missed the opportunity to negotiate a decent opportunity for male teachers.
The member for Brisbane asks, `Twelve teachers—what is that going to prove?' Let me just say that it is about the weight of numbers. Let me use the analogy of a racehorse trainer. If you train 10 racehorses, there is a good chance that you may get one good one. Based on that theory, if you train 100 racehorses, there is a good chance that you will get 10 good racehorses. Ultimately, it is a numbers game: the more male teachers you can get into the profession the better the chance that some of them will like it and stay.
That is not to say that many teachers do not come back after having resigned from teaching. Last year I went to a 30-year reunion of my teachers college class. Many of the male teachers there had left. In fact, most of them had left, and only one or two had stayed teaching over the course of that whole 30 years. Interestingly, for many reasons—for some it was financial and for some it was just that they sought a different direction in life—a number of male teachers had come back. In this place, for example, the member for Franklin, Harry Quick, has said that, when he leaves this place—he is retiring—he is going to go back and give something to the boys of his area by becoming a teacher again. I think that is a noble sentiment. He would not be able to do that if he had not been a male teacher in the first place.
We are criticised for trying to do something positive on behalf of the young boys of this country by giving them a greater number of male role models in schools and a greater opportunity to have a male presence in their formative years; it is opposed by the opposition. Yet when they do affirmative-action things for themselves—in the Western Australian teaching profession, for example, they had affirmative action for the promotion of female teachers—it is all right.

"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2004-03-24,"—I rise to speak in opposition to the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill, and I do so because it rests on a fundamentally flawed principle. In his second reading speech, the Attorney-General referred to the report of last year's House of Representatives inquiry into the education of boys, which is entitled Boys: getting it right. He went on to quote from that report, pointing to the facts that only 20.9 per cent of primary school teachers in Australia are men; that, in 2003, male teachers comprised only 24 per cent of the more than 55,000 students enrolled in initial teaching courses; and that only—there is that word again—18.8 per cent of trainee primary school teachers and a mere 3.6 per cent of early childhood teacher trainees were males. The Attorney went on to tell us:
Research shows that teaching is not an attractive career option for men for reasons including concerns about salary and the perception of a risk of allegations of abusing children in schools.
We have heard previous speakers in this debate, including the member for Canning, talking about some of these issues. We should mark this well: there are `concerns about salary and the perception of a risk of allegations of abusing children in schools'. These are real concerns.
To fix that, this government proposes to amend the Sex Discrimination Act by inserting a new section, 38A, to allow a person to offer teaching scholarships for persons of a particular gender. Frankly, I say that they have got to be joking. How in heaven's name can offering gender-specific scholarships address concerns about salary and the perception of a risk of allegations of abusing children in schools? If these are the barriers that men identify to joining the teaching profession then how does recruiting more men help? Does it get rid of the problems? All the rhetoric in the world about providing male role models for boys in schools does not answer that fundamental question, yet that is all the Attorney had to offer as justification for this legislation.
You might even get the idea that the Attorney-General's support for this measure is only lukewarm, judging from the level of justification he provided to this chamber in his second reading speech. So who does want this change? Not the profession itself, that is for sure; there is plenty of evidence for that. The New South Wales Teachers Federation, which represents the teachers, says that the move has more to do with seeking headlines than addressing the issue of attracting more men into the teaching profession. The federation's senior vice-president recently had this to say on the matter:
The conclusions of the 2001 NSW Government Inquiry into Male Teacher Numbers do not support the action of the Howard government.
The final report states that ... strategies that are likely to succeed in increasing the number of male teachers in public schools will be those which also benefit the entire teaching service.
Attempts to implement affirmative action strategies for male teachers are likely to be divisive and, based on international experience, such strategies are unlikely to succeed. 
So a 2001 report on this issue rejects the very action being undertaken by this government. The report went on to state:
... the desirability of the profession as a career choice ... will improve with increased status ...
And it recommended that:
... improving remuneration, career structure ... and working environments is critical in achieving this. 
In the context of an international teacher shortage, rather than seeking headlines and continuing to denigrate the profession, governments are better advised to provide the resources to attract and retain quality teachers. 
The Queensland Teachers Union is equally unimpressed. It says that federal government attempts to allow male-only teacher scholarships ignore the real issues facing schools and students. The President of the Queensland Teachers Union put it thus:
We are unfortunately now seeing a simplistic and shallow move from a Federal Government which has spent years undermining state schools and fine tuning a grossly unfair funding formula.
Instead of trying to change the Sex Discrimination Act, the Government should get serious about education and start properly funding and supporting all schools.
Why should the Government be surprised that some people aren't attracted to the teaching profession when for years the Prime Minister and his colleagues have consistently attacked and under-funded parts of the education system?
Likewise, the State School Teachers Union of Western Australia—the state that the member for Canning comes from—says that teachers oppose the federal government's move to amend sex discrimination laws, because it does not deal with the reasons that men do not want to teach. The union's senior vice-president says:
The issue goes to questions around remuneration, career advancement opportunities, and workload.
That is pretty much an all-round view, isn't it? The teaching profession is telling us that men are not attracted to teaching because of pay and status—and the previous speaker went into those reasons in a little more detail—so how will positive discrimination recruit more of them? It is a complete non sequitur—it just does not follow.
It is not just the teaching profession that regards this legislation as a bit of a crock; the body charged with applying the legislation which this bill seeks to amend does not like it either. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has urged the government not to be hasty in legislating to allow teaching scholarships based on sex rather than merit. Federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward, has been quite vociferous on this issue. She said:
One of the problems is that male teachers either leave the profession mid-career because of poor remuneration, or they are promoted out of the school room to become Principals or Assistant Principals.
Programs to stop this exodus and programs to encourage the promotion of a representative number of women teachers into senior administrative positions in schools would both result in more male teachers in the classroom.
There are any number of alternative programs that are not discriminatory and which do not need a legislative amendment, such as paying teachers more.
The simple fact is that young men are not attracted to teaching because they can earn better money elsewhere.
As `women's work' it has never been remunerated properly. 
Front loading the pay of male teacher students through a scholarship, effectively relieving them of the HECS burden their female counterparts will carry into their professional careers, entrenches this inequity and has not been demonstrated to address the disparity in numbers of male and female teachers long term.
Ms Goward is in a position to know. After all, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission just last week granted the Catholic Education Office temporary exemption to offer 24 new scholarships—12 for men and 12 for women—for each of the next five academic years. If there is a need to get gender specific in trainee teacher recruitment, the means already exist. So why introduce this bill? The federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner thinks it is a seriously retrograde step. She said:
Australia has long recognised that assisting women to achieve positions based on anything apart from merit may well hinder rather than help in achieving equality.
It's about giving everyone a fair go. Removing the requirement for merit in the award of teaching scholarships for young men is a big change from that.
The government, and surely the community, needs to be sure the proposed amendment can achieve its purpose before even considering support for any deviation from the merit principle.
However, if that is the way forward, then the government should immediately introduce programs that pay a premium to women who enter parliament or seek positions as executive board members, university professors, surgeons, engineers, senior military officers or judges, where women are still disadvantaged and are seriously under-represented.
Women and girls need role models too ...
In summary, this bill is seriously flawed. It is based on an untested premise. Even if what it seeks to achieve is a worthy aim, the means to achieve it already exist within the Sex Discrimination Act. The Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill is a waste of this House's time. I reject it and urge other honourable members to do likewise.",REPS,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2004-03-24,"—The one point I do agree with my colleague the member for Cunningham on is that teachers generally are underpaid compared to the rest of the community considering the tremendous job that they do. I have argued that since I first came to this place, and I still believe that to be so. That is undoubtedly one of the factors that influence career decisions by young men. There are much more lucrative positions for them to go to. It is a great pleasure for me to be able to speak on the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004, because the particular challenges of how to improve the educational outcomes for boys in our community are not just local to Australia; they are a worldwide concern. I understand there is a worldwide trend. This bill is not about giving boys some kind of advantage over girls. Rather it is redressing a trend that has consistently seen boys perform much below what they are capable of and how they have performed in the past.
In the 21st century we have met the challenge of the previous decades when community attitudes did not place such a high value on a full education for girls, thus denying many young women, myself included, the opportunity of reaching their full potential both in education and later in the work force. The Sex Discrimination Act 1984 provided the legislative framework to improve opportunities for females, and affirmative action helped to ensure the inclusion of females in many areas of education and the workplace. I can remember the days when it would be rare to go into any school and find a woman as the principal. In this day and age, of course, it has become very commonplace. I believe part of that was driven by implementing the Sex Discrimination Act in 1984.
The Sex Discrimination Act currently provides 15 exemptions relating to charities, religious bodies, educational institutions established for religious purposes and voluntary bodies, and in areas of employment, insurance and superannuation. There are always some practicalities that must be dealt with in any legislation. It is never a perfect process. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has the power under the act to grant exemptions on a casebycase basis. In fact it is quite an interesting point that these decisions are not common practice—since the Howard government came to office in 1996 there have been no new exemptions to the act. Prior to that, similar exemptions to those proposed in this amendment were made. In 1991, an exemption was allowed to offer a prize for female students completing a postgraduate degree or diploma from the Australian Defence Force Academy. In 1992, HREOC approved an exemption to allow ANU to offer reentry scholarships to women wishing to resume academic studies after a significant absence. And in 1993, an exemption was granted to the University of New South Wales to allow them to offer an engineering research award to women to increase the number of women in engineering research and academic positions.
So this legislation is by no means out of the ordinary. In any event, legislative measures are rarely successful entirely in themselves of resolving matters involving discrimination. Because we know that discrimination is often within people's minds, it is not something that can easily be rectified in black letter law. But black letter law or legislation does provide a precursor and foundation for change, which is a very important starting point. The real changes take place when community attitudes, including prejudice and stereotyping, are changed. Legislation is an important catalyst in giving people a chance. We have witnessed that most dramatically in this House with the number of women who are now elected to represent constituencies. Once you begin to effect that change, you give people a chance—in this case, we are talking about a chance for women to demonstrate that they could be elected to office and make a great contribution to Australian political debate—and you will begin to see that gather pace, as we have seen it in this place. Maybe it is not fast enough for some of us, but nevertheless it is taking place.
Therefore, the amendments to this act are not without precedence, and as the Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Hon. Dr Brendan Nelson, said, this is about ensuring:
... the very best educational outcomes for both boys and girls.
A good starting point to highlight the importance of this amendment is the parliamentary inquiry report, Boys: getting it right. Some of the conclusions of that report really focus the mind on the consequences of doing nothing about changing some of the factors affecting the poor performance of boys in the education system. I do not think any of us would want to contribute to those consequences by having a donothing attitude when it comes to changing the system to allow boys to meet their potential. According to the report, between 1975 and 1995 the literacy achievements of 14yearold boys declined. In 2000, nine per cent of boys in year 3 and 15 per cent of boys in year 5 failed to achieve minimum reading benchmarks. This compares with just six per cent of girls in year 3 and 10 per cent of girls in year 5. Recent research shows that in some instances boys represent up to twothirds of those in the bottom quartile of school achievers, and I think I heard someone say earlier in this debate that the retention rates for boys in schools are also problematical. In another report—Meeting the challenge: guiding principles for success from the Boys' Education Lighthouse Schools Programme stage one 2003—it is said:
The problem is not that girls are doing better than boys—it is instead that boys are not doing as well as they once did.
The report went on to highlight the fact that wherever boys were being educated these disturbing factors arose. In the foreword to that report, Minister Nelson highlighted one of the concerns raised in the `getting it right' inquiry when he said:
Only one in four students studying to be teachers is a man. When you walk into a school to find the only man on site is the gardener, how does that affect the development of both boys and girls?
I think we do need this mix and balance for the benefit of both girls and boys. To find the solutions to better outcomes in education, especially for boys, the government has drawn on a number of individual experts in education. This is not something where the government has just said, `Oh, well, this looks like a good idea, and we will do this.' This government has done the underlying research and work and has consulted the appropriate educational specialists in order to try to find a balance of measures that will redress what has become a very serious problem.
We have drawn on some of the best brains in education. The minister instigated the Boys Education Lighthouse Schools Program. Unlike Labor, I know that when I first came into this place I was really shocked at the number of reports that were done on a variety of matters, lining the shelves up in the library, that were never acted on. What we have here is a minister and a government that have recognised a problem in the community—it certainly is one that comes to me from my constituents quite regularly—have presented a detailed report and have provided funding and the structure for a positive program to redress it. It is not just a single approach but a multifaceted approach to dealing with the problem.
For the Boys Education Lighthouse Schools Program the government has committed grants totalling $860,000 to 230 primary and secondary schools—I understand that this is just for stage 1 of this program—so that they could document their successful practices in educating boys. This multifaceted approach by the government is addressing concerns raised by both parents and educators. It is well documented.
In my electorate of Pearce, the Sawyers Valley Primary School—up in the hills, well out of the mainstream city area—are celebrating their 120-year anniversary this year. I congratulate them. They do a fantastic job, and they are very proud of their continuous commitment to education in the hills area. They have contributed to the program. I have here the executive summary of the report Meeting the challenge, on stage 1 of the 2003 Boys Education Lighthouse Schools Program. The Sawyers Valley Primary School, on participating, developed hands-on learning in maths in particular, linking technology and enterprise learning with mathematics. They understand that boys need to engage in their own learning and they need to be physically involved—that is, moving, doing, making and building.
The Sawyers Valley Primary School principal, teachers and staff, the community, the parents and citizens and the board of the school had always recognised the value of hands-on building in maths approaches. They had used it in their senior years over a lengthy period and they had observed that it made a big difference to making learning enjoyable and productive. I also add my own observation that it makes it relevant to these young people. The Sawyers Valley Primary School found that the use of equipment in learning was very attractive to boys. In consultation with the students and teachers, they guided the learning process to include making large rockets, for example, and retelling stories using blocks as part of their `solar system' theme. They worked in small groups and they shared. The `motive power' theme involved students in making boats that would travel three metres and back loaded with an egg. This gave them a real focus and gave a relevance to why they were learning mathematics, which was so important. For the older students, they  presented more complex challenges. The report about the Sawyers Valley program outlines the results of this innovation in motivating and teaching boys in particular. It says:
Research evidence from students, teachers and parents, along with samples of student work, suggest that `boys have become very organised and self-directed' through such challenge activities and that they certainly `do enjoy' hands-on work. Boys are, in this context, `fascinated by the new technology equipment and are more than happy to use it to complete their challenges'; and an element of competition, such as the school's `reading race', results in improved organisation and independence among boys.
The report went on to say, and I think this goes to the heart of the matter we are debating today:
One positive outcome of the project has been increased teacher and parent awareness of the needs of boys and the fact that changes can `subtly be made to not only enhance their learning but the learning of all students in the class'. What the school would do in future, however—
it goes on to say—
as it maintains and further extends the approach, is to use more male role models, if they are available, to work with students in small groups. 
This school has long had an understanding of the difficulty with boys' learning and, before this process took place, it began to explore options to make learning relevant, interesting and exciting for its students—boys and girls—recognising the particular problem with boys, saying that in future one of the keys to improving the learning outcomes is `to use more male role models, if they are available'. Clearly, one of the key elements in resolving the declining performance of boys in schools is the acute shortage of male teachers, leaving boys without male role models in schools. Between 1992 and 2003, the proportion of male schoolteachers declined from 25.8 per cent in primary schools and from 49.4 per cent to 44.7 per cent in secondary schools, and the problem is getting worse. In 2003, male teachers constituted 24 per cent of the 55,577 students enrolled in teaching courses in Australia; 18.8 per cent of male students were training to become primary school teachers—and 3.6 per cent of the 7,115 students training to become early childhood teachers in Australia were men.
In Western Australia, the situation in primary schools is most acute, with the 2003 ABS figures showing that 2,587 primary school teachers in WA are male and 9,542 are female. Despite the federal government's move to redress this imbalance, there have been criticisms from the WA government. This is extraordinary, because I noticed that the press release that our Attorney-General put out today after his speech said:
Last year, the WA Department of Education and Training offered 37 male-only scholarships worth $10,000 each as part of its scholarship program. The funds are paid as a lump sum and the recipient has to sign a two year employment contract.
The WA department has indicated it is planning another round of male-only scholarships for primary teaching this year.
I understand the WA Government has not sought an exemption from the Sex Discrimination Act for the scholarships and it is unclear whether they have sought an exemption from their own Equal Opportunity Act, which makes it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of gender.
One can only conclude that Labor sees the gender imbalance—and we have heard a lot about this from the Leader of the Opposition in this place and out in the electorate over the last few weeks—in primary teacher numbers as an issue that needs addressing, particularly in Western Australia, yet it has been critical of the federal government's similar measures.
It is important to stress that the federal government is not just relying on improving the number of male teachers in the system but also trying to address, in a whole range of ways, the very important issue of young boys falling behind in the education system. The Attorney-General went on in his press release to say:
The Opposition has clearly demonstrated again that it is trying to walk both sides of the street and we should not look at what they say, but what they do ...
That was a lesson my grandpappy taught me years ago. He said, `You observe people. Don't judge people on what they say, but make a decision about them on what they do.' It is fundamental. I am sure, come the next election, that the Australian people will make a decision based not on what comes out of the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition but on what he practically does to put into place policies which go to the heart of concerns that are raised within electorates around the country.
While it is acknowledged that longer term solutions may well rest in improving the career outlook and remuneration for teachers, the federal government's proposal to amend the sex discrimination legislation to allow scholarships to attract more male teachers is sensible in the medium term. Given the many changes that have taken place in our communities over the past several decades and the alarming evidence of the parliamentary inquiry, commonsense should surely prevail to ensure bipartisan support for some sensible initiatives that make a good start in redressing the imbalance that has occurred. We have done it for women. We have seen the practical effects of affirmative action and the establishment of the Sex Discrimination Act. I know that parents and most educators in my electorate will welcome the way the minister has listened to the community and engaged experienced educators to move forward with a multifaceted approach to addressing the particular challenges of improving educational outcomes for boys while continuing to ensure that we give the best possible education to our girls.",REPS,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—I would like to comment on a couple of things that the member for Pearce said. As she knows, I admire her sincerity. But I ask her to go back and read all the reports she referred to. Not one of those reports or recommendations state that we need amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act, and this is really what the debate on this bill, the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004, is all about today. It is about the fact that the government have introduced a bill and now realised that they do not need it, yet they are still persevering by having what I think is a Clayton's debate.
Nevertheless, like all the other speakers here today, I am somewhat at a loss to work out why we are even discussing this bill at this time. The government claims that the amendments are necessary to fix the problems of imbalance in the number of male and female school teachers. The government also claims that the existing provisions of the act will not allow schools—and non-government schools in particular—to provide extra male primary school teachers. This is simply not true. The government has introduced this legislation in an attempt to reclaim the agenda on boys' education and to attack Labor for its support of the original bill.
What happened was that the Catholic Education Office applied to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for an exemption to offer 12 teacher training scholarships to male students. When HREOC declined to grant the application, the Catholic Education Office lodged an appeal with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Howard government pre-empted this appeal process by introducing an amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act—the bill now before the House that we are debating.
Since the bill was introduced on 10 March, there have been further negotiations between the Catholic Education Office and HREOC which have resulted in an exemption being made for a period of five years. This means that the arguments presented by the Howard government in support of this bill are no longer valid. As the executive director of Catholic schools, Brother Kelvin Canavan—a person I admire and have a lot of confidence in—said in a letter to the Catholic community on 15 March: 
... the main motivation for seeking a temporary exemption from the Act has always been to meet the expressed needs of students, parents and the wider community ...
Brother Canavan said the intention was to seek approval that would allow the active recruitment of more males through the provision of some additional male-only scholarships. The plan was seen as one small initiative to raise awareness of the shortage of males entering the teaching profession. In the past five years, 80 per cent of the scholarships on offer from the Catholic Education Office in Sydney have been awarded to women.
The original CEO proposal simply sought to add 12 additional male-only scholarships to year 12 students in 2004. At no stage did the Catholic Education Office request amendments to the act—nor did anybody else, except, of course, the minister. In his letter, Brother Canavan said that a far bigger challenge was the need to address the underlying reasons why more men are not attracted to teaching. These include the status of the profession, the salaries and the career opportunities.
Changes to the Sex Discrimination Act are not—I emphasise, are not—the most effective way of dealing with this problem. They do not deal with the fundamental reasons why men are choosing not to enter the teaching profession. The Catholic Education Office has now taken the sensible approach, with the agreement of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, to offer an equal number of scholarships to both men and women. This agreement makes this bill unnecessary, but the government has moved with unseemly haste to have the act amended. The legislation was introduced into the House in the last sitting and is scheduled to be debated in both houses by the end of the week.
The last amendments made to the Sex Discrimination Act were in response to a report by HREOC which was delivered in June 1999. The government response to that report was delivered in November 2000, some 17 months later. The related bill was introduced in February 2002 and assented to in October 2003. In other words, legislation based on their own recommendations in their own report took some four years to be passed. Now, suddenly, there is an urgent need to have these changes legislated in less than three weeks. I wonder why. Is it because changing the act costs nothing and the government can look like they are doing something? Symbolically, action is being taken to help boys in schools, just when Labor and our leader, Mark Latham, have identified this as a major social issue.
Indeed, Mr Latham has had an ongoing interest in the so-called crisis in masculinity. From early on in his career—as Hansard reflects—he has sought to highlight the lack of male role models and mentors and has pointed to the lack of male teachers in our primary schools as being of great concern. Since Mr Latham became Leader of the Opposition, he has continued to voice his concerns—concerns which formed part of both his initial speech to the National Press Club and his early media interviews as Leader of the Opposition.
It is not only the opposition which has concerns about the amending bill we are debating today. A Queensland union has described the bill as `simplistic' and `a shallow move'. The Australian Education Union is reported as saying, `The proposed changes are simplistic and short-sighted.' This government's proposal invests nothing in the future of boys' education and makes no significant attempt to address the real issues—and they are the issues that we should be debating in the House, not this amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act. The fact that there are more female teachers in primary schools is not disputed; it is not disputed by any member in this parliament.
I am indebted to the staff of the Parliamentary Library, who told me that the international instrument on which the SDA is based is the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, or CEDAW. Unlike the Australian act, the UN convention focuses specifically on eliminating discrimination against women because, it says, `Women have suffered and continue to suffer from various forms of discrimination because they are women.' The government has ruled out participation in a complaints mechanism under CEDAW; nonetheless, it would be interesting to examine whether the provision of male-only scholarships would breach that convention. Alas, we can only speculate.
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that in the past 10 years the proportion of male primary school teachers has declined from 25.6 per cent in 1993 to 20.9 per cent in 2003. This drop has affected government schools more than non-government schools, with the proportion of male teachers in government primary schools dropping from 26.7 per cent in 1993 to 21.1 per cent in 2001—a drop of 5.6 per cent. The decline in non-government schools was 1.7 per cent for the same period. This downward trend is not exclusive to this country. In 2001, in all OECD countries for which data was available, primary school teachers were predominantly female—64 per cent or higher. Australian figures were not included in the OECD analysis, but our Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that 75.4 per cent of primary teachers in Australia were female, which is below the OECD average of 78.6 per cent, the figure supplied in 2001.
So it would seem that there is no argument about the shortage of male primary school teachers. The argument is: how do we best address this problem? We know that there is no barrier to men entering the teaching profession or in fact progressing within the profession. If anything, there are indications that, while fewer men are teachers in primary schools, a disproportionately large number of men are school principals. The lack of men in the profession is not because of any kind of systemic discrimination or disadvantage that they face in applying for teaching courses or positions; they are choosing not to enter the profession for other reasons. Whatever those other reasons might be, it is plain that, in the words of our leader, Mark Latham:
In public policy you never want ... to use a sledgehammer to crack a nut.
That is exactly what this proposed legislation is: a sledgehammer. As usual, this government is taking its heavy-handed approach where none is needed. When all is said and done, the proposed legislation is a no-cost cop-out option for the government to hide its inaction.
By way of contrast, we in the Labor opposition have a five-point plan to address the very real problem of getting men back into the teaching profession, particularly into our primary schools. First of all, we will mount a national campaign to attract quality entrants to teaching. We will target men with the required skills and backgrounds. Secondly, in line with the view expressed by Mark Latham, we will encourage more male mentors to work with schools and parents. We will involve fathers in reading to students, using technology, vocational education, music, drama and sporting activities. Thirdly, we will provide incentives for quality teaching aimed at teachers who have the skills needed to improve the learning outcomes for our boys. Fourthly, a Labor government will target improvements in teaching skills for men in the Commonwealth's professional development program and in the development of our national teaching standards. Finally, we will introduce student discipline and welfare programs, most of which will target boys.
The House of Representatives committee report Boys: getting it right made some 24 recommendations for action which needed to be taken to address the needs of boys in schools. None of them recommended changing the Sex Discrimination Act. What the report did recommend was the provision of scholarships for equal numbers of males and females to undertake teacher training, all of which would be merit based scholarships. This in fact is what the Catholic Education Office and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission have now agreed to do, albeit on a limited basis of 24 scholarships split equally between men and women for the next five years. As Brother Canavan has pointed out, the 24 new scholarships will be worth up to $2,000 each and will not affect the existing scholarships. He said all candidates would still have to pass university entrance requirements, so there was no question of dropping standards.
As I said earlier, the Catholic Education Office did not, at any point, ask for changes to the Sex Discrimination Act. It tried, as it always has, to work within the system. When its original request to HREOC for an extra 12 male scholarships was disallowed, it lodged an appeal with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This appeal was overtaken by events when the government introduced this new legislation and the CEO and HREOC reached agreement on an extra 12 scholarships for 12 males and 12 females. All of this was without any necessity to change one word of the Sex Discrimination Act. The act has always been intended to remove barriers where there is entrenched disadvantage, and ignoring this basic point undermines its whole purpose. The new amendments in this bill—this diversion introduced by the Howard government—mean there has been next to no debate on this central point or on the fact that the Sex Discrimination Act already lets organisations take steps to ensure substantial equality between men and women. As I keep saying, we do not need to change the act to add a new exemption. What we need is for people to use the existing act properly and, more importantly, we need to address the substantive issues which Labor has proposed.
The very fact that the Catholic Education Office had its second application to HREOC approved after some minor changes is proof that the act does not need amending to permit the desired outcome. Indeed, this bill as it stands may well limit future action by restricting the use of section 7D of the act for other initiatives. In its original submission to HREOC, the Catholic Education Office acknowledged that the proposed scholarships may have fallen under the `special measures' provision in section 7D of the act. HREOC did not decide on this issue and expressed some reservations about the way the application had been formulated. Because this bill partly duplicates section 7D, it could limit the scope of the special measures that could be allowed under the Sex Discrimination Act to redress gender imbalance in teaching.
The opposition has received legal advice which suggests that section 7D offers an existing and more flexible solution to the granting of scholarships proposed in the bill and that the legislation, if passed, could endanger that solution. The advice indicates that there is a danger that a court could regard the specific provision in the bill dealing with scholarships as excluding that subject from the general provisions of section 7D. This could have the effect of denying the flexible aspects of section 7D to the other proposal for granting scholarships. This presents a potential problem for future initiatives in this area, and that potential should be avoided while we have the chance, here and now.
I am sure honourable members are aware of my longstanding opposition to discrimination in all its forms. Earlier I mentioned CEDAW, the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. I remember in November 2000 expressing concern in the House at the significantly diminished role Australia was playing in the negotiations of the optional protocol to the CEDAW and at the low priority given to that protocol by the Howard government. I called on the government then to take an active role in the process, to promote a speedy ratification of the protocol and to have Australia become a signatory to it. Of course I was ignored—but we can have a simplistic amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act come in within 10 days.
Today we have another example of the Howard government's reluctance to take the proper action on yet another form of discrimination. The Prime Minister has not traditionally been a strong supporter of the Sex Discrimination Act. He spoke in the debate on the passage of the original SDA, and I refer members on the government side to the Hansard. The Prime Minister  said:
In deciding to vote for the third reading of the bill, I should say I certainly have major reservations about the concept of affirmative action legislation and I certainly do not regard support of this legislation as being indicative of support for that.
It really says it all, doesn't it? It really says we are discussing and debating the bill because when it was introduced on 10 March the government thought they could change the whole prospect of what was happening in the debate in the electorate at large. It was a cheap, opportunistic decision that I do not believe the public will accept, nor will the public agree with it. It was formulated into an amending bill that is now not necessary. All it really took was this government and this minister for education, the Catholic Education Office and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to sit down and negotiate an agreement that they could possibly enter into. This has been done without this government and without this minister for education—yet here we are in this House today still debating an amending bill that is no longer necessary. 
One wonders why—and I say this to the people in the gallery—with all the important pieces of legislation that this parliament needs to debate, we are now discussing this bill, which is not necessary, to amend an act which need not be changed at this time. I call on the government, the minister for education and the Prime Minister to come clean with the public of Australia and let them know that the only reason why we are debating this bill in the House today is that this government, in its own cheap, political way, has turned to rhetoric in an area where we in the Labor Party believe action should be taken—and that is to encourage more men into the teaching profession.
It will not work. It will not work today because people will not accept it. I think it is up to all members of the parliament to be honest and truthful when they stand up to debate this legislation in the House. This is not an amendment that needed to be debated. This act does not need to be changed. The problem that existed has been fixed. The scholarships have now been entered into. The Catholic Education Office is happy; the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is happy. The only people who are not happy are the Prime Minister, the minister for education and the government, because just when they thought they were going to take cheap headlines, all of a sudden it has turned around to hit them over the head—and it will continue to do so. Do not fiddle while Rome continues to burn. There is a large problem out there in the community. There are more important pieces of legislation that we should be debating in this House, yet we have given time to this debate. I believe that I stand with the members of the Labor Party when I say that I am proud to object to and vote against this bill.

"Pearce, Christopher, MP",LP,2004-03-24,"—Before I begin my remarks, I note that the member for Prospect has just demonstrated to all of us the value of having time limits on speeches. I rise today to speak on the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 because I believe that the education of our children is the single most important consideration we have as a nation. If we do not get our education system right—and that means everything from national curriculum consistency and benchmarks through to facility and infrastructure standards—we are destined to never achieve our real potential as a country. If this happens, we as community leaders are to be condemned as failures.
Erasmus once said, `The main hope of a nation lies in the proper education of its youth.' I believe that to be true. I have been disappointed by the level of negative debate that has surrounded this bill and its goals since it was first announced by the government. What has happened in the past few weeks has been the all-too-frequent skewing of the actual and real intent of the legislation with misinformation. In all of this rhetoric and discourse, the main purpose of the bill has been lost. As a result of negative fault-finding, the focal point of the bill has moved away from the true focus—which should be the children—to what is best according to all of the self-proclaimed `expert' adults.
It is time to bring the debate back to the most important element: the best interests of our children. For those people who are genuine about their concern for education, we know that, as Malcolm Forbes said, `Education's purpose is to replace an empty mind with an open one.' This bill is about having an open mind to positive action, albeit a single step, to help our children. In order to achieve our full potential, all of us—here in this place and throughout the nation—must have open minds in how we educate the young people of Australia. That is what we should be focusing on: ways to ensure that our children get the maximum benefit from their education, that they get the best education in the world and that they are supported by the best teachers in the world. This bill is an important part of that effort. It is an important step along the path to placing greater value on education in Australia and, most importantly, to placing greater value on the incredible importance of the role of teachers in the future of our nation.
Let us first take a minute to consider the environment and the challenges that have brought this issue to the forefront. As the father of a young boy, this is an issue that is very close to my heart. It is an issue that I am very much aware of as a result of my time on the inquiry into the education of boys, which was conducted during this parliament. The report of that inquiry set out some of the real challenges that we face in the education of boys, not just today but in the future. At school, boys are underachieving in comparison with girls across the various year levels and across a range of educational measures. As noted in the report, powerful evidence was presented of the differentials in the educational achievements of boys and girls. For example: nationally, girls' results in year 3 and year 5 literacy benchmark tests are up to five percentage points higher than boys' results; the year 12 retention rate for girls is between 11 and 12 percentage points higher than for boys; and girls' average levels of achievement in a majority of subjects assessed at senior secondary level are higher—and the gap has been widening. For example, the difference in the aggregate New South Wales tertiary entrance score for girls and boys widened from 0.6 per cent to 19 per cent between 1981 and 1996.
Throughout the inquiry, there was a significant amount of evidence provided as to the main reasons for these trends. What became clear was that one important reason is the lack of male teachers and role models in the classroom. Of great concern to many who contributed to the inquiry throughout Australia is that this imbalance in the number of male and female teachers in Australian schools, particularly primary schools, looks set to widen. Nationally, fewer than 21 per cent of primary school teachers are men. Last year, men constituted only 24 per cent of students enrolled in teaching courses. Even more worrying, fewer than 19 per cent of students training to be primary school teachers were men. 
What we see happening is of great concern and it should be addressed. It is of concern to academics, to teachers and to parents. But, most importantly, it is of concern to those who must be our chief focus: children. That is why we must work to ensure that more young boys and girls have both positive male and female role models in their lives, and that is what this bill seeks to achieve. It provides an opportunity to move closer to ensuring a better balance of female and male teachers in the classrooms of our nation's schools.
This bill, in practical terms, amends the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to provide that scholarships may be offered to people of a particular gender for participation in a teaching course. It is important to acknowledge that there are fundamental conditions related to these proposed scholarships. For example, they can only be offered to redress a gender imbalance in schools, whether in a particular region or category of school, or, indeed, in an individual school. It is also important to note that this amendment is gender neutral. That means that scholarships could similarly be offered to women in cases where a gender imbalance exists in favour of male teachers.
The genesis of this bill is underpinned by the belief that our children are best served by having the benefit of both male and female role models in the classroom. It recognises the differing yet equally important contributions that both male and female teacher role models can make in the development and maturity of our children. Education, with all its nuances, is a complex issue which requires a range of targeted solutions in order to gain improvement. The concept underlying this bill is only one such targeted solution—it is not designed to be a panacea to fix all ills—that will, when combined with other strategies implemented by this government, such as the $159 million Australian Government Quality Teacher Program and the $6 million Boys' Education Lighthouse Schools Program, assist in delivering the best educational outcomes for both boys and girls. It is important to remember the words of Herbert Spencer: `The great aim of education is not knowledge but action.' This bill is action—positive action—aimed at ensuring that all Australian students, both boys and girls, get the most from their education. 
When discussing and debating education, the focus must always be on the best interests of our children, not on what adults and so-called experts believe is best. I believe earnestly that the small step forward that this bill provides is a huge step forward in helping all children in Australia. As elected representatives, we have an obligation to develop and formulate ways to improve the lives of all Australians. The children of Australia need us to support positive measures such as this so that they can be given all the best possible opportunities to grow, mature and experience life to its absolute fullest. As I said earlier, the focus must always be on our children. My focus is on the best interests of the children. I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—I start my comments today by asking: why we are debating the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 at all? We know that it is a sad attempt by a Prime Minister, who is spooked by recent polls, to regain ground on an important social issue. On our side of the House, we recognise that there is a need to encourage more men into teaching so that boys have more male role models—not better teachers—in their lives. This bill will not get more male role models into schools. It will do absolutely nothing of the sort. The tragedy is that passing this bill is not going to resolve this problem one iota. The government is using the parliament in a stunt to water down very vital legislation of which it should be proud, because it was Malcolm Fraser who introduced most of the sexual discrimination legislation a long time ago. You should be proud of this piece of legislation and not want to tamper with it or water it down. You should defend it to the hilt. This stunt is not going to help in any way.
We all recognise that we need more male role models for our young men. There is a crisis with young men in our society. Rates of youth suicide amongst males have increased disturbingly over the past 20 years. Sadly, I have spoken in this House on male suicide before, particularly when we lost one of our own to that dreaded act. I spoke then about how Greg Wilton, the former member for Isaacs, had himself spoken about the lack of support and services for young men in crisis. Sadly, several years have passed and there has been no movement on this issue—no movement, no support and no money have gone into programs to address this fundamental crisis in our society. This bill is not going to address this crisis. This bill will not give our young men a greater perception of their own worth and value or a greater ability to deal with the stresses and strains of modern life. 
More women attempt suicide, but more men succeed. They use far more violent means and they achieve their end, generally without anybody even knowing they are in a state of crisis, because they do not talk or confide. If we want to address the crisis of young men in our society, let us do something about that. Let us provide mentoring, counselling and services for men going through depression. Putting more males into schools is a good thing—do not get me wrong—but it is not the only answer, and this bill is not even going to address that issue.
We on this side of the House acknowledge that we need to introduce measures to encourage men into teaching. More than that, we need to encourage them to stay in teaching once they enter that profession. That is an important point, and one which this bill ignores completely. We would welcome the government's input to this debate if we thought it would actually help solve the shortage of male teachers, but this is just a stunt which skirts around the edges of this problem without doing anything to address its core. So why continue the stunt? The Catholic Education Office—which, by the way, never requested this amendment in the first place—and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission agreed on a resolution. The commonsense approach of the resolution will result in the CEO offering 24 additional merit based scholarships, 12 for males and 12 for females. That just happens to be in line with one of the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training report, Boys: getting it right.
I am a bit saddened about all the fantastic reports we do in this parliament. This report—Boys: getting it right—was tabled in 2002. What have we done in respect of that report? What has been the government's response to the 24 recommendations of that report? There has been nothing. De facto, one of the recommendations has been picked up by the Catholic Education Office and the human rights commission. They have actually picked up one of the recommendations in this report, but the government has not done anything. We keep tabling great reports, which we put a lot of energy and heartfelt passion into, but they sit on shelves and nobody does anything about them. I think that is a damn shame.
We are sitting here today with a stunt of a bill, yet if the government had done something about a report that a government minister asked a committee to do—if the government had actually responded to some of the recommendations—we might not be having this stunt today. I really wonder what the value of doing all that committee work is, when reports sit on shelves and do not get looked at. This is the third report in as many weeks back in this parliament that I have now spoken about. I spoke about older workers. There was a great report, called Age counts. What has the government done in response to that? I talked about the recent report into shared custody. There was a fantastic report done in the last parliament about marriage and marriage breakdown. There has been nothing done on any of those reports. If some of the recommendations in those reports had been picked up, some of the legislation we have here today would not be needed, because some of these issues might have been resolved.
The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training, in the report Boys: getting it right, recommended:
The supply of teachers, and male teachers in particular, should be enhanced by providing HECS-free scholarships to equal numbers of males and females to induce high quality candidates to enter teacher education.
The inquiry also recommended:
... that the Commonwealth government and university teacher education faculties work together to develop admission processes for teacher education courses that evaluate relevant personal attributes in addition to academic achievement ...
This bill would have merit if there were discrimination against men who want to enter teaching. After all, the purpose of the Sex Discrimination Act is to remove barriers where there is entrenched disadvantage. However, there is no barrier that prevents men from being able to enrol in teaching courses or, in fact, progress within the teaching profession. There is certainly no evidence that financial hardship is a barrier preventing men from enrolling in primary teacher training. This argument was backed up by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in its reasons for rejecting the CEO's application for an exemption last year. The commission found:
The reasons for the gender imbalance in the primary teaching profession are many and complex, with the material before the Commission indicating that those reasons include status of teachers in the community, child protection issues and the pay and conditions of primary school teachers relative to other occupations.
The commission went on to say:
... there is insufficient evidence before the Commission to support a finding that the gender imbalance in the primary teaching profession is caused by matters, factors or circumstances that might be remedied by the proposed scholarship scheme.
Offering scholarships is not going to resolve the problem. The commission also noted that there was no substantive inequality between male and female teachers and that, although not conclusive, it had evidence before it that indicated that there may be practices which, in fact, disadvantage female primary teachers. It pointed to statistics provided by the New South Wales Catholic Education Commission web site showing that, from 1995 to 2001, female principals as a proportion of female teachers had decreased each year, from 5.36 in every 100 female teachers in 1995 to 4.54 in every 100 in 2001. Conversely, over the same period, male principals as a proportion of male teachers in Catholic primary schools in New South Wales had increased nearly every year, from 15.79 in every 100 male teachers in 1995 to 17.74 in every 100 in 2001. So males are not being discriminated against within the system. Generally, they are not staying within the classroom; they are becoming principals. The commission also received a submission from a former commissioner for public employment in the Northern Territory, who contended that male teachers do better in the promotion stakes than female teachers. Another submitter, a former deputy principal of a Catholic school, stated that male teachers are favored with promotions and privileges.
The real reason for the shortage of male teachers is that they are choosing not to enter the profession. This is due to a number of factors, including the status of teachers in the community, salary, career opportunities and concerns about child protection issues. A submission to the committee inquiry stated that, essentially, a teacher's salary is only seen as an adequate second income for a family; hence the dearth of males. As the inquiry found, these issues need to be addressed. The committee recommended:
... that State and Territory Governments urgently address the remuneration of teachers with the payment of substantial additional allowances for skilled and experienced teachers as an inducement for them to remain in teaching and to attract new teachers by offering more attractive career paths.
As the federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward, said earlier this month:
Successful programs that have worked to allow more women into traditionally male dominated professions can all be adapted to encourage young men into teaching.
Some of the suggested measures which Ms Goward cited were sending young male students to schools to encourage young men to consider the career, and supporting career counsellors to promote the benefits of a teaching career. Ms Goward went on to say:
One of the problems is that male teachers either leave the profession mid-career because of poor remuneration, or they are promoted out of the school room to become Principals or Assistant Principals. Programs to stop this exodus and programs to encourage the promotion of a representative number of women teachers into senior administrative positions in schools would both result in more male teachers in the classroom.
This bill—this stunt—is not going to put more male teachers into our classrooms. It is not going to get the gender imbalance right because males are not being prohibited from seeking out educational opportunities to train to become primary school teachers. That is not the reason there is a lack of male primary school teachers. They are not attracted to the career, they are not attracted to the profession. Unless we make the profession attractive to them they will not go into it.
I know that not one of the five or six of my male friends who went to university with me and studied to become secondary teachers is actually a secondary teacher. I think one of them ended up in a classroom but the rest of them got other jobs because teaching was not seen as a substantial profession for a male to take up.
I think that is tragic. My brother-in-law is a fantastic teacher who loves teaching but he is forever asked by people, `Why aren't you more ambitious? Why don't you leave teaching?' He is ambitious; his ambition is to be a great male teacher and he does that well.
This bill is not going to resolve the crisis in our schools, and it is not going to resolve the crisis with young men. If we want to do that, then we need other programs, we need other measures. Watering down the Sex Discrimination Act will only start us down a slippery slope.
I find it highly entertaining that the Liberal Party is putting up a proposition in respect of what is basically affirmative action or positive discrimination. When I was elected in 1998 there was a whole new cohort of women coming into the parliament. Women who had recently been elected and others who had been here previously sat in a room in Old Parliament House and were interviewed by 60 Minutes. I recall the member for Mackellar screaming at us across the chamber and being abusive to Labor women, saying we were only there because we had affirmative action in the Labor Party. It was like using a dirty word and she spat it at us, saying that we had only got here because the Labor Party had a policy of `promoting girlies'. That was more or less what she said on 60 Minutes, but I am not sure if it made it onto the tape.
Senator Jocelyn Newman, Senator Amanda Vanstone and others then weighed into the debate and accused us as being here as sort of second-class citizens because we were under affirmative action. I have never been a great supporter of affirmative action, for that very reason. I do not want anyone to think I got here because I was a girl; I want everyone to know I got here on merit. I think every male teacher who goes into a school wants to know that they got there on merit too. 
In contrast to the government, Labor have a five-point plan to address the real problem of getting men back into the teaching profession, particularly at primary school level. Our plan recognises that, if we are going to see more men in our primary schools, we have to improve the pay, conditions and career structure of teachers.
Our five-point plan recognises that we have to make sure we have great teachers in our primary schools who are skilled at educating boys. We want to encourage dads into our primary schools to help with reading, sport and all sorts of activities. These are the sorts of initiatives we should pursue if we really want to do more to make sure that the boys who are struggling at the moment do better at school.",REPS,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2004-03-24,"—I quote Dr Tim Hawkes, headmaster and education expert. He said: 
Whenever a child's potential is not realised—be they male or female—we will have failed them.
We are talking about a very important subject but I think the amendments we are proposing are fairly unremarkable. The Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 amends the Sex Discrimination Act to provide that a person may offer scholarships to persons of a particular gender regarding participation in a teaching course. The new section would apply only if the purpose of doing so is to redress a gender imbalance in teaching—an imbalance in the ratio of male to female teachers in schools in Australia—in a category of schools or in a particular school.
This bill means that education authorities and others can offer scholarships to encourage male teachers into the profession in a manner consistent with the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. The bill is drafted in gender-neutral language which means that the amendments would allow discrimination in favour of females if a gender imbalance in favour of males were to emerge generally or in a particular regional sector.
I speak today to address the issue of the gender imbalance in teacher recruitment and in the classroom, especially in rural and regional areas of Australia. I also want to say something about the upbringing of our boys and young men. An example of this, as we know, is the Catholic education system in New South Wales where the number of male teachers has fallen to a level of only 14 per cent. The gender profile of teachers is of increasing concern to parents, schools and departments of education, and the Australian government are keen to discover what is deterring male school leavers from enrolling in teacher preparation courses and what we should be doing about it.
The 2002 inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training into the education of boys recognised that women and men can be equally competent teachers of boys and girls. The committee agreed that the quality of the teacher is the most important thing and that that is more important than the gender of the teacher. However, the committee determined that more male teachers are needed because male teachers as role models do matter.
I think it is true that there is a crisis of masculinity in our schools. The majority of teachers in both primary and secondary school are female and the proportion of male teachers is declining. Between 1992 and 2002 the proportion of male school teachers in a full-time equivalent measure in Australia declined from 25.8 per cent to 20.9 per cent in primary schools, and all the indicators are that this trend is set to continue. Looking at teacher education classes, females make up the bulk of students enrolled in teacher pre-service education courses in Australia. In 2002 females represented 77 per cent of the 53,908 domestic students enrolled in initial teacher education courses.
The lack of male teachers in the Northern Territory is worrying those in the Territory. A story in Monday's Northern Territory News said that, out of 1,080 general primary school teachers in the Territory, only 176 are male and most schools are lucky to have one male teacher in their ranks. If you look at the number of trainee teachers in universities you will see more of the same. Clearly, the situation is going to persist and it is only going to get worse. Across Australia, one in five primary school teachers is a man. In Catholic schools in New South Wales and the ACT in 2001, there were 937 male teachers and 4,265 female teachers.
Reading through the discussions and comment, it seems that there are three reasons for this situation: the perception that teachers are poorly paid—and I think that is quite a reasonable perception; the idea that somehow teaching young children is women's work; and the microscope that men feel they are under as teachers regarding their physical relationships with children. I think state and federal governments, between them, can do something about all three of those things. We in federal government are taking some clear initiatives which I will talk about a bit later.
We have heard about opposition to the government's announcement that we plan to amend the antidiscrimination act. Some of the responses have centred around the argument that other measures should be used—such as increasing teachers' pay, targeting potential male students, and selling teaching as a career so it will appeal to more students and shed some of its negative imagery. I say: bring them all on. We should use whatever measures we can to get the number of male teachers higher than it is today. And we need all levels of government to work on the issue.
The member for Gellibrand said that 12 teachers are not enough—we need thousands. We would agree, but 12 is a very good start. If you look at the figures I just quoted from the Northern Territory, you will see that 12 would make a difference in that territory. Other speakers have said that this measure will not make young men take up the career of teaching. On its own, possibly not—probably not—but, in tandem with other measures, it is a start. The member for Prospect does not know why we are discussing the bill. She quoted the United Nations convention stating that women suffer and continue to suffer discrimination because they are women and suggested that this amendment bill may breach that convention. That is an argument right outside this debate and I think it trivialises what we are trying to do.
Most of the people I represent would not accept that that is a valid argument. They do not necessarily object to the existence of these international tribunals that deal with matters of equal opportunity, but they certainly object to their interference. I would say that there are serious human rights issues around the world that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission should be concerning itself with greater priorities than this issue, rather than looking through the microscope at Australia's Sex Discrimination Act.
Others have said that we should be introducing a package of measures, including increasing teachers' pay. That is definitely something that state governments should address. We have put other initiatives in place relating to the ongoing funding of the education of boys and of male teachers. We funded around 230 schools in 110 projects to examine best-practice models in relation to the education of boys. Under the government's Teachers for the 21st Century initiative, there is a $159 million quality teacher program which aims to update and improve teacher skills and understanding in priority areas and generally enhance the status of teaching for both young men and young women.
The government has committed up to $3.5 million to the Boys' Education Lighthouse Schools Program to identify and showcase successful practices in the education of boys. Under stage 1 of the program, primary and secondary schools from across Australia have been awarded grants of up to $5,000 to document their successful practices in the education of boys. Stage 2 will commence in 2004, when approximately 30 cluster school zones will be established across Australia to support best practice in boys' education. Funding of up to $60,000 will be provided to a Lighthouse school to develop, facilitate and implement a professional development program for teachers in a cluster of surrounding schools.
The Commonwealth is also initiating research into significant areas of education relevant to boys, including pedagogy, curriculum, assessment and students' perceptions of teaching as a career. Funding of up to half a million dollars in the current financial year builds on the solid base of research which the government has undertaken in recent years.
The gift of teaching is, I think, a peculiar talent. It is a calling, a vocation, as alluded to by the previous speaker, who has a brother-in-law who, she says, clearly finds teaching a fulfilling career. I think it is a calling because, in being able to teach, the teacher answers a need in himself or herself, and this can lead to an extremely rewarding profession. We should encourage all those who are called to answer the call, and we should do this in a number of practical ways and by sending a clear signal—just like the one we are sending now—that the government values young men becoming teachers.
Steve Biddulph, the well-known author of Raising Boys and other books on bringing up boys and male education, talks about the sheer loneliness of being male in the 20th century—`so far from nature, so long pretending'. There is a lot of literature about angry young men. Angry young men start by being angry young boys in schools. We only have to look at the statistics and the underperformance of boys in schools to know that this is the source of our problem. Boys, particularly low achievers, receive eight to 10 times the reprimands of their female classmates. They are removed from classrooms and they serve more time in detention than girls.
Boys comprise 71 per cent of all school suspensions and are expelled at even higher rates. They drop out of school four times more than girls. They receive more failed grades and have lower grade point averages, more grade repetitions and more failures to graduate. The majority of school violence victims are males, and they also represent about three-quarters of all assaults, homicides and suicides. Girls outperform boys in reading and writing by much greater degrees than boys ever outperformed girls in maths or science. I think these are fairly startling statistics which we should pay some close attention to. 
Something we hear about is the feminisation of schools. Clearly that means that we have a greater number of women in schools than we have men. Respected feminist Dr Josephine Milne-Home says: 
Unfortunately education has become a feminised profession. We need more compassionate and caring men in teaching. The research says that men tolerate more noise and activity from children—
whereas with women—
there's too much emphasis on sitting still and making pretty pictures.
I want to quote from a letter from a single mother of a 12-year-old concerned about the lack of role models. She says:
The Principal and the Deputy are the only males in the school, excluding the janitor. The flavour and atmosphere of the school is what I call a hen club. The female teachers are most influential and vociferous. The norm for child behaviour is that of girls. It is difficult raising a male child single handedly. I expected some assistance from the school when he first started attending. I thought he would have access to male role models. Unfortunately I was very wrong.
As all members do, I try to attend as many end-of-year functions in my electorate as possible. I have sat on many school stages and watched with pride the presentation of awards at speech nights at both primary and high schools. It comes as no surprise that the girls win more awards than the boys; that has always been my general impression. But that is not the main thing that concerns me. What worries me is the boys' presentation, compared with that of the girls. I noticed this very starkly the first time I attended one of those functions. It is not that I looked for it at subsequent functions, but I still notice it in just the same way as I did at that very first function. In primary schools—in the younger years, anyway—both boys and girls look happy, pleased and proud as they walk up to the stage to collect their awards. But the change creeps in late in primary school and in high school. The girls walk up with backs straight, heads high and smiling with confidence at the world. But the boys tread much more carefully, their shoulders are often slumped and their eyes are usually downcast; they are not looking the teachers, the officials or the world in the eye.
More than once, it has occurred to me that there is something uneasy and troubled about these young men; they are not secure in who they are, in their place in the world—how they fit into the world around them—and that troubles me. I think that as a society we have some ground to make up with our boys and young men. The most dramatic symptom of something going wrong in boys' culture is the growing suicide rate. There is a reluctance by governments to specifically address the problems that boys have. The New South Wales government had a national action plan for the education of girls. But, when boys started to lag behind, did they have a national action plan for the education of boys or for boys' problems? No; they had just a gender equity strategy. They were very careful about not specifically aiming measures at helping boys in schools. But they should have been, and they do need to.
Another letter I recently read in the press said, `We are becoming a society that fears it will never cross a bridge built by a woman but couldn't care less that its children may never be taught by a man.' That quote has not been pulled out of the air. In 2003, the University of Melbourne's engineering faculty was granted an exemption under the equal opportunity legislation to create three postdoctoral positions specifically for women.
I think many of us live our whole lives with the pain of what our parents could not be for us. Boys and young men live with the pain of what their fathers did not say or do or show, and they have fewer strategies for dealing with that pain. Steve Biddulph, who I mentioned previously, said, `If you don't examine your own wounds, you wound your children.' I think that is relevant. Which is the better option: having boys learning from good male teachers who are also good role models about how they should get in touch with their feelings, how they need to express themselves and how they should learn to manage the things they do and the things that they perceive are done to them; or do we put that to one side and say that, after a life of not having the opportunity to connect with a man they can relate to, disturbed teenagers should be directed—as they are now—to a web site to help them cope when life delivers the inevitable kick in the guts; or, as the medical and criminal system does when it comes across an adult man whose life has fallen to bits, should we refer them to a counsellor? I am afraid that by then the damage has been done.
There are homes and families without fathers. There are homes and families where a man is present who may be a role model but not the sort of role model you would want. The man at home may demonstrate qualities, but these may be the qualities of violence, drunkenness, idleness or disinterest. He may be the only man the children in that home associate with. All these negative qualities can apply equally well to women, but it is most likely that the children see a woman at school or elsewhere in their lives who is a positive role model. That enables them to think that the man they have most to do with represents what it is to be a man. That is the problem we are facing.
It is all very well to talk about ideals and how we should have this and we should have that, but it is not a perfect world. We really do need to recognise that these are the home lives that many of the young boys who attend our schools come from. If we have the opportunity to do something in those schools to present them with a more positive role model—which, as I said, can show them that men do exist who do not treat them the way they may well be treated at home or the way they see characters in movies, Nintendo and computer games treating women and treating the world in general—then we should do so.
I have spoken very much in favour of boys. I think there are other times and other places to speak in favour of girls and of women's issues. I do feel that the opposition has trivialised this debate to a great extent. I do feel that this is a simple and commonsense measure. It is not going to answer the whole problem clearly. As I said, a suite of measures at all levels of government is needed to do that. As I watched the Leader of the Opposition listening to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education, Science and Training introduce this bill and talk about it in question time, I think he actually approved of it and appreciated it. I am sorry that forces within his own party and possibly within the teachers unions have prevented him from taking this on. I am sorry about that. As I said, I think it is a commonsense measure, a straightforward measure. I commend the bill to the House. I want to end with a quote in favour of the teaching of boys from Ralph Waldo Emerson. It states:
We teach boys to be such men as we are. We do not teach them to aspire to be all they can. We do not give them a training as if we believed in their noble nature. We scarce educate their bodies. We do not train the eye and the hand. We exercise their understandings to the apprehension and comparison of some facts, to a skill in numbers, in words; we aim to make accountants, attorneys, engineers; but not to make able, earnest great-hearted men.",REPS,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—I rise to speak on the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004. The previous speaker said that she was speaking in favour of boys. I am here to speak very strongly in favour of boys. I think this House has a unique opportunity to introduce the recommendations that are highlighted in the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training, which is entitled Boys: getting it right. That is what we in this House should be about—getting it right for the boys in our educational institutions, getting it right so that they can achieve, getting it right so that they have the absolutely best opportunities when they leave school, getting it right so that our country as a whole can benefit from their getting it right—from us getting it right and giving those boys the opportunities that they need.
As was said by the previous speaker, this is not a perfect world; it is anything but a perfect world. I can see no way that the legislation we are discussing here today will make our world more perfect. Rather, this legislation is just a cover-up. It is just a glitzy way of trying to address a real issue—an issue that is impacting on families throughout the country and on all our young boys as they sit in their schoolrooms.
The Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill is bad legislation. It is legislation that is designed to create division; it is not designed to fix a problem. This is purely a political exercise which ignores the recommendations of a report commissioned by the previous parliament in March 2000 and tabled in October 2002. It is interesting to note that the education minister sat on that committee and was privy to some of the evidence given to it. Yet he and other members on the opposite side of this parliament have ignored the fact that this situation exists and have put in place this quick-fix glitzy approach that will do nothing, rather than accept the report's recommendations, which were designed to remedy a longterm problem and have a longterm effect. This legislation is designed to circumvent proper process and it ignores what is in Australia's best interests, what is in the best interests of the teaching profession and, most importantly, what is in the best interests of the boys in our schools. There is widespread concern about the performance of boys within the education system, and the reasons for this are many and varied.
I will now turn to the report of the committee I mentioned earlier and talk to a few of the issues that it raised. The report's introduction emphasises that there is widespread evidence that, within our education system, boys underachieve and disengage from learning and that the strategies used in schools do not connect with boys. The committee has brought down a report of some substance which looks at raising the level of achievement of boys. Its recommendations highlight the types of strategies that a government truly interested in maximising the achievement of boys and girls would put in place.
As far as boys are concerned, the report's key indicators are measures of early literacy achievement. In 2000, compared with girls, 3.4 per cent fewer year 3 boys and 4.5 per cent fewer year 5 boys achieved the national benchmark. That is a quite significant and real problem which needs to be addressed. In 2001 school retention rates of boys to year 12 were 11 per cent lower than those of girls in the same years. Results in most subjects in years 10 and 12 showed that girls were achieving a higher average mark in the majority of subjects. Once again that shows there is a quite significant problem. With admission to higher education, approximately 56 per cent of university places were taken up by females—once again, that shows that educationally boys achieve a lower rate of admission than do girls—and suspensions and expulsions were much greater for boys than for girls. At the end of their time spent in education, labour market figures show there is a much higher level of unemployment for boys. This goes right across the community, despite the fact that boys to a large extent have or perceive they have a greater choice of jobs than do girls.
These are serious issues that need to be addressed. Boys tend to respond more negatively to learning processes that they see as being irrelevant; therefore, that issue needs to be taken up. It is also important to note that all students need to develop a sound foundation in literacy in their early years. The figures that I have cited demonstrate that boys are not achieving that sound foundation. That impacts negatively on their life choices and, to a large extent, on the choices that we as a nation have. I say that because the underachievement and failure of boys to connect within our education system have a very detrimental effect on Australia as a whole. This goes to lost opportunity. It is about our country losing the opportunity to utilise the skills and the abilities that these young men can offer. So this is a very significant problem.
Unfortunately, I see the bill before us today doing nothing whatsoever to address this problem. It is, as I said earlier, just a political exercise—a stunt brought on by a government trying to be populist and coming out with something that it thinks will make a difference within the education system. This bill facilitates measures which will exempt the Catholic education system from the Sex Discrimination Act and enable it to offer 12 teacher training positions to male HSC students; these will be male-only scholarships.
It is important to note that on 23 February this year the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission declined to grant that exemption and there was to be an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, but the government decided to pre-empt this appeal process by introducing an amendment to the act. The CEO has stated publicly that they are not seeking an amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act. So here is the government acting against the wish of the people in trying to address the problem. It is also important to note here that the matter has already been resolved, because the Catholic education CEO has agreed to offer 12 scholarships to male students and 12 scholarships to female students. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is very pleased with this, and to all intents and purposes it has been resolved.
However, this is not going to do anything to address the imbalance of male teacher numbers within the teaching profession. The main reasons that have been identified for males not entering the teaching profession are: low status of the profession, low salaries, lack of career opportunities and perceived issues around child protection concerns for male teachers in primary schools. One of my own children is teacher trained but has never taught within any school because he does not perceive that teaching is an occupation that caters to his needs. I spoke to my sister, who is a teacher, prior to coming down to this chamber. When I said was speaking on this piece of legislation, we had a little discussion and she said, `Look, it is not the issue of offering scholarships to males that will attract them to teaching; rather it is the way the teaching profession is perceived.' She has not been privy to reading the legislation. She has not read the report that I quoted from before and that I will turn to in a moment. But you would think that she was reading straight from this report, because she mentioned all the issues that were identified in the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training. She identified the professional status, the low esteem that teachers are held in, the salaries and the lack of career opportunities that exist.
It has already been pointed out that there is quite a disparity in the number of teachers teaching within primary schools, and high schools to a lesser extent. This report identifies that now 21.3 per cent of teachers in primary schools are males. That fell from 26.3 per cent in 1991 to 21.3 per cent in 2001. It is also interesting to note that that is not reflected in the number of principals and deputy principals within primary schools. Those positions are still skewed very much towards male teachers. To me that says that people looking at entering the teaching profession are entering it with a view to a longterm career path—something that currently does not exist and that the current system fails to provide. Men do not find it as attractive as working within other occupations that have higher profiles and attract more esteem and interest within the community. It is only a student who is truly dedicated to learning and to passing on that knowledge to other people who considers teaching as an occupation. A person can look at doing that in many ways. Under the current system more young students are turning their eyes to other occupations.
The `getting it right' report talks about male teachers and role models, and it points out that there is widespread concern about the decline in male teacher numbers. Once again, this report highlights that the status of teachers within the community, salaries, career opportunities and concerns about child protection are real issues. It makes a number of recommendations. One that I would like to put before the House is that admission criteria for teaching courses should be broadened to recognise those motivational factors and personal qualities that teachers require. It is a special person who is a good teacher, and that is what should be recognised when people go into the teaching profession. If that were targeted, then we would probably get more people who were prepared to work within the teaching profession over a long period of time and more men working in the profession. Another recommendation is that there should be HECS free scholarships to equal numbers of males and females. The report also mentions developing positive relationships between male role models.
The Labor Party has some very good ideas about how we can turn this trend around. We should have a national campaign for attracting quality entrants to teaching, targeting men with relevant skills and relevant backgrounds, and we should look at those issues I was talking about a moment ago. The other thing that we are very keen on doing is encouraging more male mentors to work with schools and parents. That includes fathers being involved in reading to students, using technology, vocational education, music, drama and sporting activities.
I would like to mention one program in the area I come from: the Engaging Fathers program. The Family Action Centre at the University of Newcastle has been involved in developing this mentoring program. It has had some amazing outcomes, where fathers are now participating in programs at disadvantaged schools and at Alcazar at the Windale Primary School. Fathers are participating in breakfast programs, various committees, playgroups, sporting activities, parenting, and mentoring programs. It has brought about a great change in the community. It has given support to young boys in the community who very often do not have male role models. The government should be looking at initiatives like this—things that will make a real difference—rather than at changing the Sex Discrimination Act in a blatant political move that is not about quality education but more about manipulating and playing politics. Real change is brought about by introducing the recommendations in the report Boys: getting it right—a report that the government commissioned and which it now chooses to ignore.
This government attributes the poor performance of boys within our education system to gender imbalance, and that is quite ludicrous, but it is something that we as a parliament need to consider, along with all the other issues. The legislation is a disgrace. It is a political stunt by a government that is seeking to improve its position in the polls. The reason its position in the polls is so poor is that people in the community are awake to political stunts like this—stunts that are designed for show and have no real substance. I am calling for real change which has substance to it: change that actually addresses the needs of the boys within our schools who are crying out for help, for programs that address their needs and for male mentors. They are crying out for our education system to be relevant, and for it to adopt the types of issues that Labor has in its policies. We need to put in place incentives for the right types of people to take up teaching and teach within our schools.
I call on the Howard government to revisit the wonderful report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training—the report that it commissioned and in respect of which the Minister for Education, Science and Training was privy to hear evidence given on many occasions—seriously contemplate the educational problems and challenges facing boys, and then come back to this parliament with serious legislation designed to make real change and not just a political stunt.

"Panopoulos, Sophie, MP",LP,2004-03-24,"—I rise to speak in support of the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004. In doing so, I congratulate the Minister for Education, Science and Training and the Attorney-General on bringing this important bill to the House for what is, without a doubt, a central debate in education values and the prospects of our young people. The member for Shortland briefly spoke about parents and young boys crying out for changes in education and crying out for help. May I implore the member for Shortland to speak to her state Labor colleagues. We all know that state governments have primary responsibility for state education. Where are their hearing aids for listening to the pleas for help and assistance from parents and young boys? I implore her to work cooperatively with her state colleagues so that they may assume their primary responsibility and assist and work cooperatively with the Commonwealth to improve education for both young boys and young girls.
This bill represents a very commonsense approach to a difficult issue. It seeks to amend the Sex Discrimination Act to allow for the offering of gender specific scholarships within the teaching sector. Currently 21 per cent of teachers in our primary schools are men and we know that only 18 per cent of people training to be primary school teachers are men. Whilst I am informed that some primary schools in Wangaratta have a higher level of gender balance in their teaching make-up—including Wangaratta West Primary School, where every class level, from grade 2 upwards, has both male and female teachers, and where between 30 and 40 per cent of the teaching staff is male—the nationwide statistic that fewer than one in five teacher trainees are men is a cause of great concern to me and to many parents I have spoken with.
We might refer to legislation in this area as a work in progress, because, just like many skilled worker and labour shortages, the problems cannot be genuinely solved overnight. Over time, though, the benefits of this legislation will be widely felt. The Catholic Education Office in Sydney will not be the only beneficiary; it might be all the other dioceses in the country, and then the state school system can follow in that regard. Gender specific scholarships to lure men into the teaching profession within the Catholic system, the government school system or the independent school sector will become a reality, ensuring that this legislation provides a greater gender balance of teachers in our schools. A very positive aspect of this bill is that the language employed is gender neutral. Therefore discrimination against males may take place should a distinct gender imbalance favouring men occur in the future. On current trends it seems highly unlikely that this would be the case, but there is that provision to assist changes to be made in the future.
My contribution to the debate on this bill is directed towards highlighting the need for more males to be employed in our primary schools and the need for our young boys to be exposed to male role models within the teaching profession. The approach of offering male-only scholarships to entice young men into primary school teaching should not be a matter of derision and divisive debate but rather a positive and sensible first-step solution to a pressing social problem which—if we do nothing about it—will only get worse. At any rate, encouraging more men into the teaching profession through male-only scholarships represents a positive step forward in meeting the needs and aspirations of our school students and their parents, who require both male and female role models in schools. Currently, young primary school students have a one in five chance of securing a male teacher. That figure could well decline further if we do nothing—and if this bill does not get through this parliament.
Too many young men are getting into trouble at an early stage of their lives. We have all seen this, right across the country, and all members of this House would have seen it in their own electorates. Sometimes, through no fault of their own, be it due to family breakdown or for other reasons, boys are growing up without any male role models to provide advice, values and the like. If there are fewer and fewer men to nurture our future generations of young men and women then we have reached a very critical juncture—and one which requires remedial action very quickly.
I was amazed at the baseless ideological opposition to this legislation when it was presented to the House. The cries of the Australian Education Union went out swiftly following the government's announcement that it would proceed with the bill, and the Labor Party's left wing also cried out and labelled this solution as simplistic, but these critics should not be so quick to judge. As a party that preselects its candidates not on merit but on their gender, it is a bit rich for the Labor Party to come out and oppose this opportunity for affirmative action for male teachers, who represent just over 20 per cent of the teaching work force in Australia's primary schools. The Labor Party is more concerned about placating the cries of old-style feminist ideology within its own party ranks than doing the right thing by our primary school students who are our future generation. We should not let the future of our young men and women be hindered by the Labor Party's dogged adherence to an old ideology over commonsense, to political correctness over practicality, in a matter as important as this one. And I was not amazed to hear such arguments and fallacies trotted out—appropriately—yet again by the shadow Attorney-General, as recently as last week, when we were both panellists at a public lecture series in Melbourne.
The government in no way intends to diminish the central aspects of the Sex Discrimination Act. But, where it can be refined to relieve contemporary pressures and social problems such as the critical shortage of male teachers in our primary schools, we should take with both hands the opportunity to do so, without fear of compromising the act's universality and, more importantly, without compromising our instincts to do the very best for our future generations.
I know there are members on the other side of this House who know that this bill is genuinely needed and that this bill requires and incorporates very commonsense elements to bring back some gender balance in our primary schools, but unfortunately caucus solidarity has silenced them yet again. I implore them to think of future generations and put that dogged ideology aside. Do not listen to the old-style feminists; do what is right for our primary school students, who are our next generation.
All we hear are catchcries such as `vertical social institutions', `horizontal social capital', `zero sum choices', `mutuality', `endogenous growth', the `competitive advantage paradigm' and other such phrases from the Leader of the Opposition. Similarly, researchers in the area of male education fear that buzz words such as `hypermasculinity' and `disguised nihilism' will be used to describe the learning difficulties of our young men if too many of them grow up without role models. We do not need buzz words. We do not need these phrases. We know what the problems are, in very simple and direct terms.
It is so disappointing that the Leader of the Opposition refuses to support this bill. He says: `Our boys are suffering from a crisis of masculinity,' and that `their identity and relationships have become blurred and confused,' yet he refuses to support this simple, effective amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act which would enable more men to take up the challenges and the very rewarding profession of teaching in primary schools when they might otherwise end up completing a science, commerce or engineering degree.
Only in the past few years has there been a growing awareness that the politically correct precepts imposed on us—though no doubt particularly well intentioned—can become, over time, a significant hindrance to the application of that increasingly rare commodity: commonsense. Certain aspects of the Sex Discrimination Act clearly fall into this category. If we cannot change the more arthritic aspects of the Sex Discrimination Act to achieve flexibility and commonsense outcomes for our future generations then I think, as in this instance, our young people will have simply fallen victim to the throes of the antimale ideology that is present in so much of today's contemporary feminism and in the ideologically opposed left wing of the Australian Labor Party.
The problems confronting young men are very real, and they have been well documented. More than 80 per cent of opiate overdose deaths are men. Four times as many men as women take their own lives, and more then five times as many young men as women commit murder. Fifteen per cent of Australian boys do not have the literacy skills to benefit from their schooling years, and only 55 per cent of 15-year-old teenagers score the OECD mean in literacy tests. Girls regularly outperform boys in the tertiary entrance score rankings that we read about at the end of every year, and young men make up only 43 per cent of all students in higher education.
Some researchers say that this is a direct result of the lack of male role models. For some students this may mean that there are absent fathers and for others it may mean attending schools with not enough male role models. A great deal of modern research shows that masculine examples to youngsters—male role models—are critical and important to their development. A responsible male role model can show young boys how to be decent men with the common traits of being men—not to have that at times unrestrained male aggression, but how to be a real man and channel the positive and interactive traits of their personality.
In this interconnected world with huge pressures on family life there is perhaps a breakdown in communication between fathers and their sons and between teachers and other male role models and boys under their care. The impact of family breakdown on fatherhood also needs to be measured. Within the 55,000 marriages likely to end in divorce in Australia, there are people—mothers, fathers, grandparents and children—who all bear the emotional costs of family breakdown. One very disturbing and startling statistic is that, just one year after divorce, 30 per cent of children have no contact with their biological father. One million children in Australia live with only one parent. Some of the children in these categories go from birth to the end of their primary schooling without significant male role models in their lives.
It is against this social backdrop and the rising notions of relativism and subjectivism creeping into Australian society that many young people, namely boys, are faced with the very serious social consequences of a dwindling male altruism. The number of male teachers in primary schools in 1992 equated to 25.8 per cent. In just over 10 years, this number has dropped to the present figure of 20 per cent. Speaking as a representative for a rural electorate, there is a real fear that youngsters in rural communities—in particular, young men and boys—are at a far greater risk of going off the rails and turning to the false glamour of drink and drugs, exacerbating a downward spiral into depression and loneliness stemming from the increased likelihood that there are fewer visible positive role models in their lives to provide those very positive examples.
Young women are certainly not excluded from this debate. Both boys and girls require a mix of both male and female teachers and role models in their formative years. But the problems currently facing boys—who, in society, are increasingly products of troubled social backgrounds with an increased exposure to disciplinary programs in schools—are the ones which need urgent attention and which we simply cannot ignore.
I have said before in this place that government cannot do all of the heavy lifting on every social problem. Governments cannot legislate for all human behaviour. But, when faced with the stark reality of the gender imbalance affecting our primary school students which, in effect, means that one in five will not be taught by a male in their primary school years, it would be negligence on the part of government not to explore all possible legislative changes that could be made in this area to ensure that we promote and encourage male teachers and, hopefully, increase the number of males entering the teaching profession. We have a very distinct responsibility to do what we can to give young boys a fair go before it is too late.
Colleen O'Brien, the Principal of Wangaratta Primary School, was recently reported in the Wangaratta Chronicle as saying, `It's just great to have gender balance in the work force and it's especially good for children coming from single parent families.' I agree with a new recruit to the teaching profession in Wangaratta, 23-year-old Leigh Symons, who recently took up a posting at St Bernard's Primary School in Wangaratta and who thought that the need to work on breaking the stigma associated with males entering the education system was desperately needed for the boys they teach. This is certainly true and it is why boys' education is a focal point of the government's $159 million Quality Teacher Program.
We should not forget the success of the Boys' Education Lighthouse Schools Program, which is committed to best-practice outcomes for boys' education. I am very pleased that Beechworth, Avenel, Myrrhee and Nagambie Primary Schools in my electorate of Indi have received funds to participate in the Boys' Education Lighthouse Schools Program to document and disseminate best practices in the education of boys. It is very pleasing to have in the gallery this afternoon students from another school in my electorate, Bandiana Primary School. I welcome them to the people's house today.
We do need more men to see teaching as a profession for the future, a vocation of service and a means of producing responsible, well-rounded citizens for our future. We on this side of the House in no way kid ourselves that this amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act will solve all of these problems overnight. But it is important to make a start. It is important to continue the reforms and do what we can to amend whatever legislation we believe will help to redress the gender imbalance in primary schools. This very commonsense, practical approach to amending the Sex Discrimination Act to enable more male teachers to be placed in our schools is deserving of bipartisan support and not derision. For these very reasons and from my passionate belief in providing the very best education for all of our primary school students, I commend the bill to the House and I implore those on the other side of the House to support this bill as well.",REPS,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Lawrence, Dr Carmen, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—I have to say at the outset that I do not really understand why we are taking the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 seriously, because the Prime Minister certainly does not. It is not actually about improving the performance of boys in schools, it is certainly not about increasing the number of male teachers in the school system and it is certain that it will achieve neither of those objectives anyway. Indeed, it is not about good public policy at all—that is, policy based on thorough and careful analysis of the problem and the interventions that are most likely to succeed. It is not that such analysis has not been done—indeed, it has, at the request of the government and at considerable expense to the taxpayer.
A parliamentary committee, chaired at one stage by the current Minister for Education, Science and Training, undertook a comprehensive inquiry into the education of boys, and reported to this parliament. Generously funded conferences have been held and research commissioned all around the country. Even a cursory inspection of DEST's and ACER's web sites turns up a veritable goldmine of relevant research—most of it focused on the policy responses that are actually needed to improve children's performance at school. What that meticulous and extensive research shows is that the measures contained in this bill to overturn the long-established principles protecting citizens against discrimination will do nothing to improve children's learning. The government knows from all this research what strategies will work and has so far done little or nothing to implement them.
This legislation is not about crafting good policy for the betterment of Australian children; it is about crude partisan advantage. It is a classic tactic of the Prime Minister, based on strategies that he has been employing since he was elected. The problem for the government now is that they have employed such tactics so often and so transparently that people are awake to their cynical ploys, to their partisan purpose. The tactics are familiar and have inevitably bred contempt. Like everything else about this government, they are tired and predictable. Australians know now, after watching him for nearly eight years in the role of Prime Minister, that John Howard is the quintessential politician, the sort of politician who gives politicians a bad name. His passion is with the game, with winning at all costs. As Mungo MacCallum put it in a recent essay, with this Prime Minister it is `not a question of the end justifying the means; the means has in fact become the end'. This Prime Minister does not see politics as a way of creating a better world, but as a world in its own right. The only reason he appears to want political power is for political power itself. Why else is he hanging on? He is doing nothing worth while.
Policy in the conservatives' hands is not for the public good; it is for the good of the coalition parties, for their political survival. This legislation, like most of the Prime Minister's initiatives, is a calculated political tactic aimed at using a potentially divisive social issue to political advantage. It has already been used on all the usual suspects: the people the Howard government has encouraged us to think of as `not one of us', such as Indigenous Australians, refugees, single mothers, the unemployed and homosexuals, to name a few who have been in the government's sights. In recent times, commentators have been inclined to label such tactics `wedge politics' and have treated the phenomenon as novel. It is not, of course. Menzies used such tactics to great advantage with his `reds under the bed' scares, tainting the entire labour movement of the time with the communist influence and splitting off the conservative Catholic wing of the Australian Labor Party.
As Shaun Wilson writes, wedge politics involves a political party stirring up populist feeling about an issue or a minority group and then tagging its political opponent with support for the unpopular cause or group. The object of wedge politics is to divide your political opponent's support base, to split away identifiable groups of voters. The goal is to weaken the support base of your political opponents in an attempt to win political ascendancy or to control the political agenda. It is usually based on—and has been in the past with this government—careful opinion polling to reveal the issues and groups which are likely to attract resentment or antipathy in the wider electorate. The strategists then work out the best way of creating resentment among a large group against a smaller one, preying on fear and prejudice. The Prime Minister's entire 1996 election campaign was based on depicting the Keating government as a captive of such `minority interests'. The Prime Minister caricatured our commitment to equality and reducing disadvantage as giving special and undeserved treatment to minority groups about whom he knew resentment could be cultivated. The coalition victory in 1996 gave the green light to such resentment and bigotry.
That is what this government are up to again with this legislation, although this time the tactic has backfired. They have picked the wrong issue and the wrong target. I think the government hoped, as they did with the inquiry into joint custody, that they could set disaffected men who are feeling dislocated by the economic and social changes of the last 20 years against the `politically correct' feminists just described by the previous speaker—who are, in the eyes of many conservatives, the cause of the problems in the first place. Women campaigning for equality have often been saddled with the responsibility for the ills of contemporary society and specifically for ruining men's lives. They make easy scapegoats. If boys are not doing as well at school as they used to, then it must be the fault of some woman—single mothers, their female teachers, the women who campaigned for better educational opportunities for girls.
What better way then to get at the new Labor leader—a leader who has genuinely recognised the problems that many, particularly working-class men and boys, are having in modern society and who, at the same time, leads a party which has pioneered measures to remove discrimination against women and to improve their status in our society. As I said, the trouble for this government is that what they are up to is all too obvious, and the players are not playing. The Catholic Education Office, in whose interest the bill was allegedly crafted, do not want the amendment. They have reached agreement with the coalition-appointed Sex Discrimination Commissioner, who has not unsurprisingly taken umbrage at being saddled with the `politically correct' label which the minister tried to attach to her. She was deeply offended, as she should be.
While introducing the bill with such an air of urgency was presumably meant to engender a sense of alarm that men were being prevented from becoming teachers by the nasty feminist legislation, all it signalled to the wider community was a government in panic about its declining political fortunes. The government's sudden introduction of this bill begs the questions: why now—and I think I have answered that—and why this measure, when all the evidence shows that it will be totally useless?
Every teacher in the country knows that discrimination against men is not the reason that there are fewer male than female teachers; indeed, the disproportionate number of men in promoted positions suggests that it is women who suffer discrimination in the education sector. There is a smaller proportion of male teachers than female teachers because men choose not to enter the profession—there are no discriminatory barriers to entry—and women do choose to enter the profession. It is because most men and boys with the ability apparently seek better-paid work in areas that are seen as more `masculine'. It is a symptom of the high degree of occupational segregation which still exists in Australia. To make teaching a more attractive career option for men would require the government to get serious about the pay and conditions which many women tolerate because they like working with children; because the structure of the working day and year in teaching makes it easier for them to balance their work and family commitments—and the government is not helping anyone else to do that; and because women still do most of the caring in our society.
The parliamentary committee that looked specifically at the issue of educating boys recommended that the government should:
... urgently address the remuneration of teachers with the payment of substantial additional allowances for skilled and experienced teachers as an inducement for them to remain in teaching and to attract new teachers by offering more attractive career paths.
That is the solution, if you are looking for it.
This bill is not about increasing the number of male teachers in the classroom at all. It is not that getting more male teachers, even if this were done, would necessarily improve the rates of retention of boys at school or their educational performance anyway. It was not among the committee's recommendations. They did not suggest that more males were needed in the classroom, because there is no strong evidence that having more male teachers improves boys' performance or behaviour at school. Sound curriculum development and good teaching that caters for a variety of learning styles are much more likely to make a difference, and so the committee found. Of course, you need the resources to make that happen. 
The problem may be miscast in the first place. There has been a lot written about sex differences in school retention and achievement, but they pale into insignificance when compared to socioeconomic differences. In fact, one of the major longitudinal studies on tertiary entrance performance concludes:
... gender differences in tertiary performance are small compared to differences according to socioeconomic background, school sector ...
In other words, your parents' education and income and the school you have gone to are more important than your gender.
While boys have a wider range of academic results than girls and are less likely to stay on at school, the differences in performance are not as marked as the popular press would sometimes have us believe. Indeed, in some states there are no differences between the average university entrance scores of boys and girls, and high achievers of both genders perform equally well. Australian research shows that, while there are gender differences, and we need to attend to them, socioeconomic status—your parents' income, occupation and educational level—makes a much larger difference than gender to performance at any level. Even in English, where girls generally do better than boys, it is socioeconomic status that is the bigger contributor to the difference. Socioeconomic status makes the largest difference to educational participation, particularly for boys. So working-class boys are the ones who miss out the most. Poverty is a major indicator of low participation and performance for both girls and boys, but I do not imagine we will hear very much about that from the current government.
These trends are even more marked for rural and remote areas and for Indigenous students. It is clear that students from poorer families start behind the eight ball when they go to school. The government is not giving them enough extra assistance with things such as poor study conditions at home. They also typically have less encouragement from their parents, whose own experiences of schooling may have been marred by low achievement. In poor homes there are often language and cultural barriers. There may be an absence of books and other educational resources, and the children probably attend schools with poorer facilities—I will come to that later—and a more diverse school population, including more children with behavioural and social problems and teachers working under pressure. And, sadly, there are often lower expectations of their capacity.
It is worth pointing out in this parliament, if we are going to have a serious debate about education—and I hope we do—that there are bigger gaps between the best and the worst performers in Australia now than in other developed countries. The gap is wider in Australia. OECD data confirm that, on measures of literacy, the poorest performing students here do worse than the poorest performing students in other wealthy countries, including most of Europe. The relationship between reading ability and social background is also more marked in Australia. We are one of the least equitable countries in the developed world. This points to inequalities in the functioning of our education system and a failure to compensate for pre-existing disadvantage. Now, that is the real debate.
Until recently the participation rate of lower socioeconomic groups in post compulsory schooling, including universities, was increasing. However, school retention and completion rates, after growing rapidly, stalled in the 1990s and our levels are now well below those of the United States and Canada. As members of parliament and as citizens, we should all be concerned about the failure to close the socioeconomic gap in performance and retention, particularly for males, where is it greater. The gap may indeed be widening. A similar trend towards lower participation is evident in vocational education and training for the most disadvantaged.
And what is this government doing about this glaring inequality? Exactly nothing. No, I am wrong about that—they are actually exacerbating the problem. They are making it worse. They are placing an increasing proportion of funds into the already well-funded schools, where the parents are increasingly drawn from higher income groups. In fact, the most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics data show that, particularly in the secondary school sector, there is an increasing concentration of high-income families in non-government schools and that such schools have substantially increased their share of enrolments of students from high-income families and reduced the proportion of those from low-income families. So they are giving more money to people who already have considerable wealth and opportunity.
Conversely, government schools now have greater proportions of students from low-income families and fewer students from high-income backgrounds. I think one of the reasons the Prime Minister has mounted the diversionary tactic which is this bill is in part because neither he nor the responsible minister have been able to mount a convincing argument—because there is not one—for cutting government schools' share of Commonwealth funding from 42.2 per cent to 34.7 per cent between their election in 1996 and 2001, when the enrolment share of the government sector declined by only 1.9 per cent. Neither can they argue for dramatically increasing funds to non-government schools from $3.36 billion last year to an estimated $4.74 billion in the coming financial year, with the lion's share going to the wealthiest schools.
The result is that, by 2005, total expenditure on state school students will be $2,000 a year a head less than for non-government school students, a figure some analysts describe as conservative. Some have estimated gaps as wide as $4,000 on average. When Catholic schools are excluded, because they tend to be lower fee schools, the National report on schooling reports that the funding for `independent' schools is about 26 per cent higher than the average for non-government schools, a difference of between $5,500 and $7,500 per student per year.
Some of the wealthiest schools now operate with 200 per cent of the resources available to government schools. The exclusive schools—who, in my view, are well named—do exclude the costly and difficult students and send them off to the government school system. These schools now receive massive taxpayer support, yet they extrude difficult or underachieving students, even preventing them from sitting university entrance exams altogether if they think the students will fail. Most of these students end up in the government school system, which actually plans for an influx of students at the end of the first semester as they are pushed out of the exclusive schools. Too many exclusive schools keep up their `standards' by washing their hands of those who really do need their help. Education support for severely disabled children is almost entirely the responsibility of the government system, with the extra costs this necessarily entails.
In my view, no school should receive taxpayers' funds unless it is prepared to be fully accountable for those funds; to provide programs for all students, no matter what their ability; to allow students to choose whether or not to sit their school exit examinations; and to retain all students who are enrolled until the end of their schooling, developing appropriate programs, as government schools do, for managing those with severe social and emotional problems. Funds should flow to schools on the basis of need—it is a very simple principle. Then performance tables and comparisons between the sectors might mean something.
The growing disparity in resources that we are seeing in Australia today will almost certainly lead to even greater inequalities in performance. Instead of front-end loading the schools who deal with the most disadvantaged, and systematically assisting those most likely to benefit from extra expenditure—where a dollar really does make a difference—the government provides derisory amounts to support isolated literacy and numeracy programs. Last year, for instance, they spent $115 million on advertising, while the current budget commits just $7 million for grants to foster literacy and numeracy.
In June last year, Ken Boston, the former head of education in New South Wales, argued passionately that Australia urgently needs to debate and resolve some fundamental questions about the future of school education, particularly its inherent unfairness to the less well-off. He asked rhetorically:
Do we want to educate our children mainly in government-assisted fee-paying private schools, based on an exclusive clientele identified by socio-economic status, religion, ethnicity or some other dimension? Or do we want them mainly to be in inclusive government-funded public schools, mixing with children from a wider range of backgrounds and experiences?
We need to debate in our community whether education should be something we purchase like soap powder, or a public good for which we all take responsibility through our governments. Boston makes a compelling case that choice is an ideology to which the Howard government gives precedence over equality and it should never be based on the fact that government schools are underfunded. Parents are now taking their children out of government schools because they think government schools are poorly funded and poorly resourced—an argument, I have to say, that is underlined by a lot of the recent figures.
Schools can either perpetuate or redress disadvantage. They work daily with young people who are disadvantaged in various ways and they are a crucial means of reducing such disadvantage. Schools must work with disadvantaged students to offset the practical, psychological, cultural and economic impediments to their education. They have to seek to confront the complex social causes of inequality. They need resources for these tasks and the commitment of the government. The entire nation's wellbeing is in jeopardy when young people are not able to participate fully in education and when their schooling is narrow and unsatisfying.
I have no doubt that the Howard government's polling is showing that people are starting to nominate education funding as one of the big issues—that is why we are being subjected to these diversionary tactics; that is why we are having this phoney debate about scholarships for male teachers and values in schools. In the past our inclusive education system helped reduce inequality; now it appears to be reinforcing privilege—now, that is a value that we should talk about!",REPS,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2004-03-24,"—I am delighted to rise to speak on the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004. I do so knowing that this bill has been generated by some of the challenges and crises in education for boys across Australia, but in particular within the Catholic primary educational system. I want to note that in my electorate of Flinders I have fantastic schools, such as St John the Baptist in Koo Wee Rup, St Mary's in Hastings, Our Lady of Fatima in Rosebud, St Joseph's in Crib Point, St Joseph's in Sorrento and St Brendan's in Somerville, all of which are part of the Catholic educational system. They do a tremendous job. But I know, from talking with some of the principals, that they have a challenge. One of the things that they most deeply desire is to have more male role models.
This is not a great ideological battle. It is a simple, practical element—providing male role models for students, many of whom come from disadvantaged backgrounds, and giving students an opportunity to live, learn and grow up in an environment which is to a certain measure balanced, that naturally has male teachers and female teachers, and that gives them an opportunity to learn from both. Unfortunately that is not the situation at present. What this bill seeks to do is amend the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. It provides that a person may offer scholarships for persons of a particular gender in respect of participation in a teaching course, and it cuts both ways: where there is an imbalance against women, women may benefit from this; where there is a significant imbalance against men, men may benefit from the proposed resolution.
I want to look briefly at three things. Firstly, I want to address the problem. What is the actual problem that this bill seeks to overcome? Secondly, I want to look at the principle behind the actions contained within it. Thirdly, I want to look at the solution which the Commonwealth is putting forward. The problem is simple: across Australia we find that boys on average are achieving at a significantly lower level than girls in almost all areas of the assessed cognitive curriculum—the thinking curriculum. This runs from early primary through to late secondary school, so it covers the full range of challenges.
In June 2003, the House of Representatives inquiry report Boys: getting it right identified an imbalance in the number of male and female teachers in schools. It is a significant problem that will affect the quality of boys' education and their capacity to learn. It is not universal, but, where there is a minimal presence of teachers within a school of either gender, that, of course, sets up an imbalance. The fact that only 24 per cent of the 55,577 domestic students enrolled in initial teaching courses in Australia in 2003 were male is a significant problem.
In practice we see that, in particular, Catholic primary schools have the lowest proportion of male school teachers overall. In Catholic primary schools, male teachers as a percentage of all teachers fell from 19.7 per cent—already low—in 1993 to 18.1 per cent in 2003. So only around one in six teachers is male in Catholic primary schools. This low percentage of male primary school teachers is consistent across the board. What is also evident is that the percentage of male teachers is continuing to decline. In government schools in 2003, only 21.1 per cent of teachers were male, which was a decline of 5.6 per cent over the last decade. In non-Catholic independent schools, only one-quarter of teachers were male—again declining. Across all primary schools we see a decline of 4.7 per cent in male teachers over the last 10 years. Across government, non-Catholic and independent schools there is a decline in male teachers.
That matters because of three things. Firstly, it means there is a lack of male role models in schools for boys and girls because of gender imbalance. Secondly, we find that there is evidence of some disciplinary problems. Thirdly, the problem perpetuates itself. It is a downward cycle. As it becomes rarer for men to be teachers, the environment becomes one in which they naturally feel less socially comfortable. So the problem, if unaddressed, will get worse. It does not have a natural corrective mechanism. That is the problem here.
Why is it the case? Partly, as some people have raised, it is a question of salary. That is a challenge. There is also a silent stigma attached in some circumstances, an implicit question mark raised over male primary school teachers. We have to address the issue that there is an inherent deterrent which is not being acknowledged. We have to do that firstly through social education and secondly through the simple step of getting male teachers in there and on the ground. 
This brings me to the question of the principle. What is the principle behind this bill? This bill is vital to addressing the current imbalance in the gender make-up of our teachers. The overall problem we suffer from is social typing. The effect, as we said, is a decrease in the number of male teachers and a loss of role models. So where can you apply some notion of affirmative action? As a government, we are not opposed to that; nor, as an individual, am I. I think it has to be based on two core principles. Firstly, there has to be a significant and identifiable social problem in terms of an imbalance which is preventing one particular group from any corner of society—whether it is based on race, ethnicity, gender or economic circumstances—from participating in a broad based social activity of benefit to society as a whole. Where there is a barrier which exists and which has an impact upon a demonstrable section of our society, then, as a starting point, there is a basis for taking action to redress that. This is the principle that I lay down, knowing that, in five, 10 or 20 years time, I will be held to account against it, and I welcome that. It is a principle which I hope to stand by 20 years from now, whether I am in or out of this place. A broad-ranging social typing or barrier which is not being addressed is the basis for some type of redressing action.
Secondly, the action itself must be a positive and constructive action—one which does not adversely affect another group, and one which does not in effect discriminate against them. We are not seeking to apply barriers to any other group; we are seeking to draw into the system additional males by offering them targeted opportunities. Where there are gaps in female numbers, this legislation will be used to attract female teachers. It may be that, within the area of PE teaching in government schools in future, they might need to attract women. It applies both ways. It is to address a specific problem. Those are the two core principles which I want to lay down now as being essential to my philosophy and my approach to these questions of social participation.
Then you look at the issue which is the third part of this debate—the solution. The solution outlined here is very simple. The new section set out in this act will only apply if it is redressing a gender imbalance in teaching. There is no basis for activity unless there is a predetermined gender imbalance. It is drafted in gender-neutral language, which means that the amendments will allow discrimination in favour of females if a gender imbalance exists in favour of males—a very important point—and it seeks in a simple, low-key way to address a problem which is real and which needs addressing, and to do so now.
I believe that the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 does two things. Firstly, it identifies a real and pressing social problem, which is the lack of male teachers within our primary school system. It recognises and brings into context that that is a problem within our society. Secondly, it seeks to take a non-invasive solution. It allows for the application of a general principle wherever it may be necessary, one which has been adopted by the government of Western Australia very recently and which, if it is not effectively ratified under this legislation, may prove to be illegal. It seeks to do two things: (1) it recognises the problem of the lack of male teachers, and (2) it seeks to apply a simple solution which is non-invasive and which allows action, wherever there is such a significant imbalance, to help students. At the end of the day, this bill is about providing role models—male role models where there are gaps now; female role models where there might be gaps in the future—for our students, be they in primary or secondary education. It offers a simple solution. I commend the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 to the House. I am delighted to support it.",REPS,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—The debate triggered by the Leader of the Opposition's commitment to tackle the problems afflicting many boys and young men in our society is very long overdue and, although I oppose the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 before the House today, I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution in the chamber on that debate. There is a crisis of masculinity in our community—a crisis that affects some but not all males. It reflects the huge structural change in our society which has decimated low-skilled manual jobs and has eroded the status and identity that was once attached to this dominant masculine contribution to our society. The crisis of masculinity can be seen in school retention rates. Not only is there a gap between boys and girls but that gap has been widening in recent years. It can be seen in suicide rates. If you go back to the late seventies and compare the pattern for suicide rates amongst younger men and younger women, the rate of increase amongst younger men is much more substantial than it is amongst younger women. It can be seen in the rapid increase in things like drug deaths, crimes of violence and even the emergence of phenomena like road rage.
There is a tide of alienation, a tide of anger and a tide of resentment surging through many younger Australian men. We have a responsibility to deal with it. The causes of this crisis are very complex, and I think we need to be very careful to avoid the kinds of simplistic responses that are common in these kinds of debates and can be seen in the government's proposal before the House. The old Right blames feminism and the sixties social revolution. The old Left blames economic rationalism and the eighties economic revolution. They are both wrong. The epidemic of social problems that we are experiencing in our society and in all Western societies is part of a broader wave of economic and social change which goes back 30 or 40 years, which has been driven primarily by technological change—by changes as diverse as the invention of the pill and television, all the way through to the Internet, the mobile phone and so forth. They are all part of the same thing. They are all part of the same phenomenon, not a set of discrete phenomena that are linked by a chain of cause and effect. We are not dealing with an issue that is caused by feminism. We are not dealing with an issue that is caused by economic rationalism. All of these things are part of the same picture. They are all part of the same broad wave of social and economic change that has completely turned our world upside down in recent decades.
It is absolutely essential that in tackling these issues we avoid the kind of facile gender conflicts which can so easily swamp debates of this kind. Tackling boys' problems does not have to mean hurting the interests of girls. Dealing with issues that tend to be gender specific is not a zero sum game. We are not dealing here with an equation where, if we do something that helps girls, that hurts boys or vice versa. We as a society and as a parliament have a responsibility to act in the interests of the entire society—men and women—and, in some cases, that will involve things that are specific to particular genders. 
The pursuit of genuine gender equality must continue and, while we are dealing with issues like boys and role models, we also have to be addressing issues like body image illnesses, sexual assault, sexual violence and tensions between career and parenting aspirations—issues of fundamental importance to women and girls. These important priorities are not arguments against helping struggling boys. We have to do both. Tackling the crisis of masculinity will help women as well as men. Who suffers from male sexual violence? Women. Who picks up the slack for bad fathers? Mothers. Who worries about the prospects for their teenage boys and the threat that they are going off the rails? Mothers as well as fathers. Whether helping young men in the transition to adulthood or tackling entrenched obstacles to gender equality, our aim is a better society, not one gender triumphing over the other.
Two years ago, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training examined the issues that are before the House today where they are most fundamental in our education system. In the committee report Boys: getting it right, the committee was rather dismissive of some of the more superficial arguments which have emerged in response to the mounting problems of boys in education. It did not, for example, endorse popular views that these problems are primarily due to too many single mothers or too many female teachers. Rather, the committee pointed the finger primarily at structural changes in our economy and the decline in the strength of communities and extended families. It did make some observations about teachers, but its primary focus was on the decline of extended families. Significantly, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, who now promotes the idea of discriminating in favour of male teachers in this legislation, chaired the committee for much of its time. The committee recommended equal scholarships—scholarships for male and female teachers of an equal number to help address these issues. Guess what the Catholic Education Office has just done? It has done precisely what the committee recommended and precisely what Labor members signed up to and still support.
There is an issue here that we cannot step away from, and that is the fundamental importance of the Sex Discrimination Act in our society. The flaw in the government's logic on these issues is the implication that somehow this is all a bit out of date—that it is all a bit 1970s, that we no longer have issues of gender equity to deal with in our society and that we can fiddle with the Sex Discrimination Act on an ad hoc basis whenever we like, because really that is a bit of an old agenda. The Sex Discrimination Act is still one of the fundamental pieces of legislation in our society. It is vitally important as a foundation stone for principles of gender equity in our community, and it is wrong to assume that we should, on an ad hoc basis, fiddle with it just because we have, from time to time, a specific issue which can be dealt with in other ways and which can be dealt with within the rubric of the legislation itself. The fundamental flaw in the government's position is the assumption that the Sex Discrimination Act is a relatively inconsequential piece of legislation that can be warped, shifted and fudged according to particular circumstances. 
There are still many major issues of gender equity and gender equality facing our community, and we as a society should remain committed to addressing those issues. The Sex Discrimination Act remains as one of the cornerstones of our approach as a society to deal with those issues. We are not proposing to have reserved positions for women in any particular occupation. It is difficult to see how it can be appropriate to have specific reserved positions for men in any occupation. It is wrong to undermine the fundamentally important framework of the Sex Discrimination Act and to pass this legislation.

"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—This matter of public importance debate is about the urgent crisis, which needs to be addressed, in Australia's health system. Unfortunately, the man responsible for it, the Minister for Health and Ageing, when interviewed in the past by Paul Kelly, has said:
We are all promoted to our level of incompetence, so sooner or later mine will be reached.
When the minister replies in this debate, if he is in any way frank he will be admitting that he has been promoted to his level of incompetence already and that the Australian people are wearing the result of the minister having been promoted to a job which is clearly beyond him. We all know that the health minister likes to play the strongman, the man of vision, the man of values. But the truth is he is not any of these things; it is all spin and no substance. When properly revealed, he is a weak man, a man without vision, a man lacking in values and a man who does not have the confidence to lead Australia during this current crisis in its health system.
There can be no greater demonstration of the weakness of the man who holds the job of minister for health than his fawning and pathetic devotion to the Prime Minister. He is a weak man in search of a leader, in search of a father figure. The minister for health has described himself as the political lovechild of the Prime Minister and the member for Mackellar.
—The member for Mackellar is now interjecting in defence of the political lovechild of the Prime Minister and the member for Mackellar. If Mary Shelley were still alive, that would be the next episode of Frankenstein. I am absolutely sure that that would be the next plotline for it. Imagine that—the Prime Minister and the member for Mackellar. The slavish and sickening devotion of this minister for health to the Prime Minister has led him to say this:
If I could be half the bloke that Howard was, I would probably be twice the bloke I am.
Minister, we agree with you—and that is not a compliment. We agree that if you could be half the bloke that Howard is you would probably be twice the bloke you now are. Imagine having to double your personal capacities to be half of the Prime Minister. What a high-jump bar that is to set for oneself over a lifetime. The sickening and slavish devotion of this minister for health has led him to make statements as absolutely stupid as that one. The minister for health likes to pretend, as he did in question time today, that he is the strong defender of the government. He likes to pretend that he is the hard man, the one they roll out in question time to do the big note performances. Of course, we see that day after day in this House.
But the truth is that this minister is more lap dog than attack dog. He is more corgi than coyote when it comes right down to it. In fact, in the way he goes about his job he reminds me of Nipper. Do we remember Nipper in the painting `His Master's Voice'—the dog straining to hear the sound of his master's voice over the gramophone to get his next set of instructions? That is really the minister for health with the way he does his job and the way he performs in relation to Australia's health system. When the master says, as the master frequently does, `Nipper, I know you've been out there doing something but I now want you to backflip and do something else,' the minister for health—more lap dog than attack dog; more corgi than coyote—is always ready to do what he is told to do next by his master's voice. 
Probably the best example of that was MPs' superannuation. The minister for health was out there batting up the argument, defending the MPs' superannuation scheme. Then obviously his master's voice came to him down the phone, `Nipper, I'm backflipping; it's time that you backflipped too.' What is really surprising and worrying about this minister for health is that when he is put in the position of being hung out to dry and abandoned by his Prime Minister, when he is left carrying the can and looking absurd, he actually seems to like it. The fact that he actually seems to like it has been recorded in the press. When he was in that position with MPs' superannuation, after being shamed, embarrassed and hung out to dry by the Prime Minister, he said: 
... I have never admired the Prime Minister more than I do now. It takes real guts ... to do the right thing under difficult political circumstances.
That is, it takes real guts to adopt the position that he was decrying as absurd just 24 hours before. But when Nipper hears his master's voice what does he do? Nipper is out there, always willing to do what his master says—the Prime Minister's lap dog.
Interestingly, the former Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, entered the health debate this week. The Victorians among us—and I know that a few of us are here—might remember that from time to time Jeff Kennett liked to muse on the topic of dogs and politics; we might remember some of those statements. But Jeff Kennett, when he entered the national debate this week, was not musing about dogs and politics as he was wont to do in the past; he was actually out there on the need for health reform. Jeff Kennett had to enter the national debate to deal with the health reform agenda, because he knows that this minister lacks any capacity to do so—he is not a strong man and he is not a man of vision. When it comes to providing national leadership on health, this minister is all jawbone and no backbone. This minister is Mr Flip and Mr Flop: all jawbone, no backbone and no vision at all. 
Everyone engaged in our health system knows that it is riddled with duplication and gaps and with cost shifting and blame shifting. The huge task facing this nation, the huge task facing a competent minister for health, is to get on with the job of reform. But that task is beyond this minister. When faced with such a major reform challenge, what does this minister do? He flips and then he flops and then he flips and then he flops.
On 5 February, so seized was he with the enormity of the challenge of health reform that he raised the concept of the Commonwealth taking over public hospitals by way of a joke. When asked a question during question time at a conference, he thought he would crack a joke and the joke he cracked was, `What about the Commonwealth taking over public hospitals?' Having finally—no doubt after a lifetime of trying—managed to crack a joke that a few people actually laughed at, he obviously spent the next few days wandering around endlessly repeating it to his colleagues. So he told his colleagues his new joke about the Commonwealth taking over the public hospital system and, by the time they were gathered in the Liberal party room on 9 March, the idea of the Commonwealth taking over the public hospital system was apparently all the rage, with backbenchers jumping up about this new health idea. But what is really interesting about the backbenchers jumping up about this new health idea is not that they were interested in a health policy advance for Australia; what they were interested in was trying to grab from anywhere a big bold idea, because they knew they needed to seize the political agenda. It was not that they were interested in health reform; they wanted something to help them break the media cycle. 
It just seems apparent to me that the politics of desperation do not breed good health policy, and they did not on this occasion. Yes, we need health reform, but not done by way of joke and then by way of desperate statement in a party room meeting. Then what happened during the course of that week? The Prime Minister came out and killed off the idea by stating that there were no plans for the Commonwealth to take over public hospitals. Mr Flip had been out there saying, `The Commonwealth is going to take over public hospitals. I've had this big new idea; it came to me as a joke and now it's a vision,' and then the Prime Minister was out there saying, `No, Nipper, we're not going to do that.'
—Order! I have given a good deal of tolerance to the member for Lalor. Her references to the minister could be more appropriately framed.
—I will try and apply the standards that the minister adheres to, Mr Speaker. 
—I hope the member for Lalor will try and apply the standards that the chair expects.
—But we know that by the time of his interview with Maxine McHugh the minister was straining hard on the lead. Even though he had been told by the great and the good—the Prime Minister—that this idea had been ruled out, by the time he had lunch with Maxine McKew he was so desperate for a story that it has appeared in today's Bulletin. But I will guarantee you this: the idea will be dead again very soon, because this is a minister who lacks the competence to engage in a national health reform process. 
So who is filling the gaps? Labor are. We have already outlined a national comprehensive reform process for health. Jeff Kennett is. Jeff Kennett, the most successful conservative Victorian politician of this generation, has backed Labor's plans this week. Of course, there is that very natural starter for dealing with the health reform agenda, David Koch. On Monday, in a forum on channel 7's Sunrise program, David Koch managed to broker a Commonwealth-state agreement on getting performance indicators in Australian health care agreements. A TV journalist managed to broker a new agreement on health, achieving something that the minister for health has never managed to achieve, while the minister sat in a chair. So we now have such a vacuum of leadership in health policy in this country that we have television journalists taking the lead for us, because this minister isn't competent to do it.
Yesterday in this place we saw a demonstration that this minister, who as I have said is not a strong man or a man of vision, is also not a man of values. In this place yesterday we saw one of the lowest attacks I have ever seen in this parliament, and I have to say that from this minister I have seen a few. No doubt desperate to break the media cycle away from the focus on this government's appalling treatment of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, they sent this minister in to have a rant and a rave about being tough on drugs. I say to you, Minister: noone should be playing politics with drugs policy.
—The member will address her remarks through the chair.
—Noone should be doing that. Some 5,000 Australians have died from drug overdoses while the Howard government has been in office, and that is a national tragedy. Every member on this side understands that, and if there was anything any one of us could ever do to stop someone walking down the path of drug addiction and substance abuse we would do it. For the minister to pretend that we would not do it is an absolute, offensive disgrace. How dare the minister play politics with an issue like that? There are 5,000 Australians dead. If there was ever anything that any person who sits over here could do to stop someone walking down the path towards alcoholism, towards heroin abuse, towards smoking tobacco, toward using amphetamines or towards using other forms of illicit drugs, we would do it. We would move heaven and earth to do it. For the minister to suggest anything else is an absolute, offensive disgrace.
Of course, what we know about this minister is that when it comes to dealing with these issues and dealing with them seriously he finds it absolutely impossible to do so. Look at the appointments that he has made to some of the most important boards which deal with these issues in Australia. Believe it or not, many of us would have thought the minister did not have too many mates, but those appointments reek of mateship; they do not reek of competence. So for this minister to stand here with his pious cant and criticise the Australian Labor Party on an issue like that is an absolute disgrace for which he should apologise. Indeed, there are many members over there who ought to be apologising too.
I conclude by saying: the minister is not a man of vision, he is not a man of values and he is not a strong man, but he is a man who has been written about in interesting terms in The Boy from Boree Creek—The Tim Fischer Story. This man and his character are recorded as follows:
Fischer's dislike of conflict and confrontation is well known amongst his colleagues. He was for instance bemused to hear of the rugby training ground rivalry between two of his Liberal ministerial colleagues, former Jesuits Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey, during their days at Sydney University. Goaded by Hockey in scrummaging practice one afternoon, Abbott, who won a boxing blue at Oxford, gave his younger rival two black eyes. On hearing this Fischer said, `I've never decked anyone in my life.'
I think that tells us something about the character of this man. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Health and Ageing: Reforms</title>,Matters of Public Importance,16,1
"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2004-03-24,"—The member for Lalor did absolutely nothing in her 15 minutes to talk about the subject of the MPI—the crisis in health—because there is no crisis in health. If we want authority for the statement that there is no crisis in health, I have no better than the Leader of the Opposition himself, who in yesterday's Wollondilly Advertisersaid that residents needed to have faith in Macarthur health services. If residents should have faith in Macarthur area health services and if there is no crisis in Camden and Campbelltown hospitals, there is no crisis anywhere at all. What we heard from the member for Lalor was a long, personal diatribe. Let me quote something:
The Australian public doesn't want to see ... negative ... whingeing ... that is playing the man and not the ball.
Let me repeat it:
The Australian public doesn't want to see ... negative ... whingeing ... that is playing the man and not the ball.
That was not me who said that. That was not the Leader of the Opposition. That was not the Prime Minister. That was the member for Lalor. She said that the Australian public does not want to see negative whingeing that is playing the man and not the ball, yet we had nonstop negative whingeing—15 minutes of vicious bile—from the member for Lalor which frankly was unworthy of this House and, I suspect, unworthy even of the member for Lalor.
The lowest moment in what was a particularly low speech by the member for Lalor was when she said of me that I was all jawbone and no backbone. Plagiarism is pretty bad at the best of times, but if you are going to be a plagiarist do not plagiarise against the author of the line. `All jawbone and no backbone' was what I said of the former Leader of the Opposition, and now that I look at the new Leader of the Opposition and the current Manager of Opposition Business I say, `Bring back Kim!' because, for all his indecisiveness and faults, he was a decent human being who would not stoop to the kind of depths which we have seen today from the member for Lalor.
Let me make it very clear: there is no crisis in Australia's health system. Yes, there are problems in Australia's health system. It could hardly be otherwise, given that Australia's health system involves some 3,000 nursing homes, some 1,000 hospitals, some 50,000 doctors, some 200,000 nurses—all up, 800,000 people. Of course, somewhere, sometime, someplace in that system there are going to be a few problems, and we have seen some problems. We have seen some problems in New South Wales public hospitals, amongst them the inability of New South Wales public hospitals in the southern district to pay the bills—the $7 million in bills—that decent, honest, hardworking contractors have run up with them. If there is any crisis at all in our health system, it is the crisis of mismanagement and ineptitude in a small number of New South Wales public hospitals. I do not think that is something that the member for Lalor wants to dwell on. She is much happier there, with her bucket of bile, her bucket of mud and slush, tipping it over people who are trying to do their best to improve our health system.
In the end what does all this talk of a crisis in our health system—all this carping like a cracked record, all of this big-lie technique practised constantly by members opposite—do? It defames and demoralises good people who are trying to do the right thing by those in Australia who are suffering ill health. Let me make it very clear: there is no crisis in Australia's health system. What we have is outstanding professionals, working long hours, undertaking heavy responsibilities, often going far beyond any call of duty to do the right thing by the people of Australia. What we have is a large number of institutions and, yes, many of them are under pressure, but they are fine institutions and they deserve support. They do not deserve to be defamed, day in, day out, as they are by the member for Lalor. There are certainly problems. There are always going to be problems. The job of good government, the job of responsible politicians, is not to damage the system, not to defame individuals and institutions but to address the problem—to play the ball and not the man; the total opposite of what we had from the member for Lalor.
There is no crisis in our health system today. The 10,000 or so general practices of this country are seeing patients in the normal way, delivering the normal standard of high-quality, affordable health care. The 10,000 or so specialist practices in this country are seeing patients in the normal way. The allied health professionals of this country are excited and invigorated by the new parts of the MedicarePlus package, including the allied health item, which for the first time brings allied health professionals into the Medicare network. There are hundreds of hospitals, public and private, in this country that are seeing patients and working daily miracles with sick people. They do not deserve the kinds of blackguarding that they get from the member for Lalor.
But, I tell you, there might be a crisis pertaining to health in this country if, come the end of the year, we find there is a Labor government; one of the first acts of a new Labour government would be to repeal the Howard government's safety net legislation. Labor are committed to repealing the Howard government's safety net legislation. That means that half a million Australians would suddenly be saddled, again, with high out-of-pocket health care costs. Labor will tell you that they have a plan. Their plan is to restore universal bulk-billing. There never has been universal bulk-billing, there never will be universal bulk-billing and, quite frankly, there never should be universal bulk-billing. Why should the member for Lalor, the member for Warringah, the Prime Minister or Kerry Packer—people who are able to pay some costs—be able to go to a doctor at all times, under all circumstances and demand to be bulk-billed? In the real world, not everyone is going to be bulk-billed. That is why the Howard government's safety net is necessary. That is why the Howard government's safety net is the biggest single improvement to Medicare since it commenced in 1983. That is what is going to be ripped off the decent, hardworking, struggling people of Australia if Labor ever get into government.
I am very proud to be part of the Howard government. I am very proud to serve in a ministry under the best Prime Minister since Menzies. I am very proud of that. I think loyalty, dedication, commitment and camaraderie are good things. These things, which were mocked in a despicable way by the member for Lalor, are good. One of the reasons why we have a good health system in this country is that we have a good government in this country, a government which works together to solve problems. If it was not for the support of the Prime Minister, if it was not for the support of the Treasurer, if it was not for the good work and encouragement of the former Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson, we would not have MedicarePlus—the Australian people would not have bulk-billing incentives, they would not have a brand-new safety net, they would not have 1,500 more doctors and 1,600 more nurses coming into general practice by 2007, and we would not have the new allied health item, we would not have the extra patient convenience. All these things have happened because this is a good government, working together, a government committed to Medicare, a government which understands that Medicare is not universal bulk-billing; Medicare is affordable access to high-quality health care. That is what this government is delivering. That is what this government has delivered. That is what this government will continue to deliver.
The member for Lalor thinks that by constantly spouting `crisis', by constantly claiming that the sky is falling in, Labor are somehow going to damage this government, Labor are somehow going to enhance their chances of winning the next election. Isn't it interesting, Mr Deputy Speaker: they have had two good poll results and they are complacent already—two good poll results, and they think that they do not have to do anything but rabbit on about crises to win the next election. There is no serious policy from members opposite. Members opposite are practising what the Leader of the Opposition, in his honest days, called the politics of scab lifting. The Leader of the Opposition, in his honest and truthful days, said that there were two types of opposition parties:
The first represents what I would call scab lifting.
Then he goes on to say:
This is an opposition which sees its role as exploiting the change process. It tries to feed off the discomfort governments inevitably encounter in having to manage the consequences of economic and social change. It constantly tries to lift the scab off the wounds of change ... Since 1996, federal Labor has been in scab-lifter mode.
That is exactly what we are seeing constantly from the ALP. We saw it under the member for Hotham. It was rightly identified by the member for Werriwa when his predecessors were in his current seat, but now, having got there, he has failed to be a man of conviction, he has failed to be a man of principle and he is now practising precisely that which he denounced in his predecessors.
We have an opposition that will say and do anything if they think it is going to get somewhere. They are accusing me of defaming them on drug policy. Let me quote one of their great heroes on drug policy. Let me quote someone who the Leader of the Opposition has been praising up hill and down dale over the last few days: none other than Commissioner Mick Keelty of the Australian Federal Police. Of the Labor Party's drug trial injecting room policy he says:
All these options take us along a path of saying that using drugs like heroin is okay, and where do we stop with a trial?
	...	...	...
By opening up heroin trials this simply feeds the addiction rather than dealing with the problem, so it treats the symptom and not the cause.
	...	...	...
Both heroin trials and injecting clinics reinforce an ambiguity about the situation that shouldn't be there. How can we produce a drug-free generation and at the same time sanction the use of illicit drugs for a portion of the community?
Mick Keelty is dead right. Labor's policy is dead wrong. The member for Lalor, if she really is concerned about the things that I said—quoting the member for the Werriwa, Labor politicians and Labor policy—should change the policy, because the policy at the moment has been denounced by none other than Mick Keelty himself.
What we have seen over the last few days is that inexperience shows. The Leader of the Opposition, in respect of our troops in Iraq, says:
I think it is a bad suggestion to say we should send people off to fight wars and risk their lives for the sake of trade agreements.
He is the alternative Prime Minister of this country and he says that the Australian government is sending people off to fight wars and risk their lives for the sake of a trade agreement. Shame on him for such a scurrilous suggestion! Laurie Oakes in today's Bulletin said:
Speaking of Latham ... the latest football scandal brought to mind his homilies on the crisis of masculinity ... Three young players from the Penrith rugby league club have been charged with assault after a fare dispute in which a taxi driver suffered facial injuries and a dislocated shoulder ... a cynic might be tempted to wonder whether their problem was the existence of a role model, rather than the lack thereof. Latham's thoughts on the subject would be fascinating.
That is the community standard—you belt up a taxi driver, you get charged and you are disciplined by your club. What do members opposite do? They make him the alternative Prime Minister. There may very well be a crisis in health in this country, and it will start later on this year if Labor gets into government.

"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—We all hoped that the Minister for Health and Ageing would get really fired up about dealing with health care issues. We all wait for him to get out of first gear when he is talking about health issues, but it never happens. We never see it. Today the minister's performance was more of the same. His heart is not in it when it comes to health. We saw him today get to the 10-minute mark in his 15-minute speech and start to flag, like a swimmer about two-thirds of the way down the length of the pool. He cannot keep up the momentum and he cannot keep up the passion when it comes to talking about the serious health issues that, as the minister for health, he is responsible for in this country. The reason for that is very simple—his great obsession is not health. His great obsession is Bob Santamaria. His instinct is not to help people in need; his instinct is to judge people. He is always quick to judge. In his personal relationships, his instinct is always to flatter.
Paul Kelly wrote an interesting article about this in a piece titled `The Abbot Confessional'. I think most people in this place understand that Paul Kelly is one of the most respected journalists in the press gallery. Paul Kelly observes, and I think he is dead right, that Tony Abbott's `capacity for flattery is immense'. He does not mind flattering himself, either. In an interview from August 1987 the minister talks about why he left the Catholic priesthood. It turns out that the Catholic priesthood was not up to his standard. At the time he depicted himself as seeking a spiritual and human excellence to which the church was no longer sure she applied. So the Catholic Church is not good enough for Tony Abbott. It is not up to his standard. He is pretty quick to judge the Catholic Church and to make comments about it.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for McMillan will refer to members by their seat or by their title.
—Ever since I came across the minister for health, I have been a bit troubled about him. People would say that he is a fairly troubling sort of character. People might even observe that is a troubled bloke. He has reminded me of someone I read about when I was younger, and it has taken me a little while to get my head around this and to remember who that character was. Some people here might have read John Bunyan's famous book The Pilgrim's Progress. I have certainly read it. Some of you might remember that the main character, the hero of the book, was called Christian. He makes his way through difficult circumstances and comes across some very interesting characters along the way. All this time I have been thinking: `Tony Abbott—who does he remind me of?'
—I assume that is the minister.
—It turns out it was a character from The Pilgrim's Progress, and the character's name is `the Flatterer'. In the book, the pilgrim is on his way through difficult circumstances, coming across some very shady, very dodgy characters and going through some real hardship. It reads:
And as they were thinking about the way, behold a man ... covered with a very light robe, come to them, and asked them why they stood there. They answered, they were going to the Celestial City, but knew not which of these ways to take. “Follow me,” said the man, “it is thither that I am going.” So they followed him in the way that but now came into the road, which by degrees turned, and turned them so far from the city that they desired to go to, that in a little time their faces were turned away from it; yet they follow him. But by and by, before they were aware, he led them both within the compass of a net, in which they were both so entangled that they knew not what to do ...
This is what the Flatterer does. The Flatterer takes people who are headed in the right direction and turns them around with his flattery and his tricky words. Then, in The Pilgrim's Progress, a good person comes along. He comes to Christian and his companion and helps them. The book continues:
Thus they lay bewailing themselves in the net.
The good person helps them out, asking what happened to them. They explain it to him and he says:
... It is Flatterer, a false apostle, that hath—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I really did not want to interrupt the sermon, but could you please bring the member for McMillan back to the subject of the MPI? I am really at a loss to know where he is going with this. I know they do not have a health policy and they are scrambling on the MPI, but please bring him back to the MPI.
—The member for Robertson will resume his seat. There is no bill before the House; it is a discussion. I do not think it matters what the member for McMillan might be saying.
—It is not too hard to confuse the member for Robertson. Let me finish the story. In any case, he might learn something. The good person says:
... It is Flatterer, a false apostle, that hath transformed himself into an angel of light.
It goes on:
He asked ... if the shepherds did not bid them beware of the Flatterer. They answered, Yes; but we did not imagine, said they, that this fine-spoken man had been he.
This is the work of the Flatterer—to use all sorts of words, all sorts of trickery, to confuse people and steer them away from the path that everyone understands they need to go along.
I think the Minister for Health and Ageing has a lot in common with Bunyan's Flatterer. He is a bloke who has a lot of fancy words. He has a lot of kind words. He has a lot of sucky words to say about the Prime Minister. And that is his style; this is how he ingratiates himself with people and gets ahead within the Liberal Party. In the Liberal Party you get a lot of rewards for a lot of sucking up. You get a lot of rewards for the type of behaviour that the minister for health has made into an art form. He is the Flatterer of the federal parliament. He is a bloke who distinguishes himself by ingratiating himself with the Prime Minister.
It really is to the detriment of the people of Australia that we have a bloke who spends so much time focusing on how he can ingratiate himself with the Prime Minister instead of focusing his time, his efforts and his energy on making sure Australia has the health system that it deserves. We are a country that is rich in resources, we are a country that is rich in people skills and we are a country that deserves a properly functioning health system. Under this minister, all we have had is cycle after cycle of spin—cycle after cycle of more of the trickery that we have seen from him and cycle after cycle of the schemes that he employs to try to confuse people about what is really happening with health care in Australia.
It is very easy, when you stick to the core issues, to see what the performance of the government has been. The government have been so ashamed of their bulk-billing performance that they have sought to have the term `bulk-billing' struck from the Department of Health and Ageing. We in this place understand it; we understand what people in our electorates are talking to us about when it comes to bulk-billing. Recently the member for Lalor was in my electoral district and we went to West Gippsland, which has gone from having rates of 64 per cent bulk-billing in 1996 down to 43 per cent today. That has not happened by accident; that has happened because of neglect by the Howard government—and, as is obvious from comments made by the health minister, it is not something they are seeking to address. It is not something that they are concerned about. As far as they are concerned, we can look forward to more of the same in Australia.
The only thing we can be sure of about the federal government and the health minister on this issue is that, whilst we know for sure that bulk-billing rates will continue to decline, particularly in outer suburban areas and in country districts, they will continue to mislead people on this issue. They will continue to mislead people on bulk-billing levels. They will continue to focus people's attention away from the important health care issues.
It is fundamental that we have a health minister who is a strong person, a person with the character and the fortitude to see through the important changes to Australia's health system that we need. But we do not have someone serving in the role who has those qualifications. He is someone who has distinguished himself by sucking up to the Prime Minister. He is someone who has distinguished himself not by telling the truth and being frank with people but by focusing his efforts on spinning and making all sorts of statements about health care which we all know are not true. He is the modern Flatterer of the Australian parliament. He is the person who seeks to take people away from the course of action on Australian health care that we all know needs to be taken. Australia deserves better than the minister for health that we have today. We need to make sure that we have a good health minister in this country so we can get a good health system.

"Worth, Trish, MP",LP,2004-03-24,"—My one regret today is that I look up above your chair, Mr Speaker, and I do not see a light on for broadcasting across Australia, but then perhaps somebody will report on this debate. The matter of public importance from the opposition today is the urgent need to address the crisis in Australia's health system. I would have thought that, being the subject of the debate today, health may have got some mention; perhaps some good ideas would be put forward about how we could improve things and perhaps even some detail of Labor policy. But that has not been the case. All we have heard today—as I say, I am only very sorry it has not been broadcast across the nation—is two speeches from members opposite who have defined themselves as those who muscle up, even if it is in talking about the health of the people of this nation.
Australia does not have a crisis in health. There are always things that can be done better and there are people on this side of the parliament and people in the work force around Australia endeavouring to do just that. Australia's health system is as healthy as our population. Members opposite actually might learn something about health if they had the courtesy to listen to what is now being said, as others gave them the courtesy. Australia has a healthy population. The World Health Organisation and OECD data paint a consistent picture—that Australia's health system is delivering health outcomes around or above the OECD average, for outlays less than the OECD average. According to the WHO's 2000 comparison of health system performance: on health equity, Australia shared the fourth highest score in the world, 1.2 per cent above the OECD average; on responsiveness of the health system, we shared the 11th highest score, which was four per cent above the OECD average, and on responsiveness distribution, we shared the third highest score, 0.6 per cent above the OECD average; on fairness of financing, we shared the 11th highest score, 0.7 per cent above the OECD average; and on overall health system attainment, we shared the ninth highest score, two per cent above the OECD average.
These are very good results that we should be proud of. But, as I have already said, we never rest on our laurels. The health system is complex. It is not just about bulk-billing rates, it is not just about how much is spent on public hospitals; it is about actually looking after a population and ensuring that it remains healthy. We have an ageing population but people are staying healthier and living longer. We have as part of our health system areas of public health importance, areas like tobacco control, where we are leading the world. Still, unfortunately, 19,000 people die every year of tobacco related disease, but it is something that this government has been working on and there are results to show. We have a safe food system and it is important that we do. That is part of our health system. If we have safe food, it also means we have fewer people ill and fewer people in hospital beds. We have a world leading system for ensuring that our medicines are safe and effective. In fact, countries like the UK and Canada seek advice from our own officials and our own government on how they can achieve those sorts of outcomes. 
We have had a commitment to private health insurance as well as other reforms. Under Labor, the level of private health insurance fell from 65 per cent to 34 per cent. We heard nothing today from those opposite about any commitment, which is something that the people of Australia want to know about. They want to hear that commitment to keep the 30 per cent rebate for private health insurance, which ensures that there is less impact on the public health system, that people have choice and that we have a good mixed system where those who are working in the private system work closely with the public system. The good mix of public and private is essential if we are to have a sensible health system in Australia.
I have heard the shadow minister say that people do not want politics to be brought into health. I could not agree more. Nothing drives people crazier than to hear arguments about cost shifting—
—Scare campaigns.
—scare campaigns, as the member says—and arguments about whether we are in crisis and about various rates et cetera. We should be proud of what we have but we should be working towards doing better. Today, very unfortunately, it has all been about personal abuse and quotes. Is this because they have no health policy? Is it because there is nothing that can be brought forward to be discussed? Is it because there are no good ideas other than putting a third layer of bureaucracy over what we already have, which is the only Labor commitment that I have heard to health policy should they win the election later this year and should the people of Australia therefore suffer from their lack of policy and their lack of commitment. 
The shadow minister did refer to illicit drugs, not in a complimentary way, although I do agree that something like this is not a matter for politics. In 1997, this government made a commitment to make every effort to address the illicit drug problem in Australia. So far, the government has allocated over $1 billion to the Tough on Drugs strategy. This commitment has resulted in significant progress and achievements to date. Members opposite should know and should be relieved that there was a 23 per cent reduction in the proportion of people using illicit drugs from 1998 to 2001. The latest available data shows there has been a 69 per cent decrease in the rate of opioid overdoses since 1999, from 1,116 to 364 in 2000. We are concerned not only about supply reduction but also about demand reduction, education, treatment and rehabilitation. The statistics show that what we are doing is working. Once again that is part of health and part of seeing that we have a healthy nation. 
We are doing things in suicide prevention and mental health. Dr Grace Groom wrote to the Prime Minister recently congratulating him on the work and leadership demonstrated by this government. In that letter she states:
It is fair to say that the Australian Government is the only government committed to mental health reform. The blame for the current crisis in mental health lies squarely with our State Governments.
So all is not bad and certainly we do not have a crisis in the health system. I will not stoop to the level that those opposite have stooped to in engaging in personal abuse. We have a government that has just got through the Senate the biggest reform to Medicare in many years—something that we can be very proud of and something that the minister for health can be very proud of achieving. 
I have no doubt that the opposition are mildly concerned, or very concerned, about the fact that they really had no part in it, because it was the four Independents who were able to sit down with the government and work out ways that MedicarePlus could be improved and ways to bring allied health workers into the system to work with GPs so that those people with chronic illnesses will receive better treatment and have greater access to care. Medicare and the health system are not just about doctors and hospitals; they are about keeping this population healthy.
The MedicarePlus package adds $2.85 billion to what is already there, to strengthen Medicare not only now but also for future generations. While this package was launched on 18 November last year and implementation took place from December last year, the MedicarePlus safety net legislation was passed by the Senate only on 11 March this year, no thanks at all to those opposite. They have fought this every inch of the way because, just like they have today, they have wanted to play politics with the health of the people of this country. They have done nothing constructive and have offered no good ideas.
The MedicarePlus safety net will meet 80 per cent of the out-of-pocket costs for medical services provided out of hospitals for families who receive family tax benefit A and Commonwealth concession card holders once an annual threshold of $300 is reached, and for all other individuals and families once an annual threshold of $700 per individual or family is reached. Importantly, GPs can claim an extra $5 each time they bulk-bill a visit by a Commonwealth concession card holder or a child under the age of 16, and a $7.50 incentive for bulk-billing concession card holders and children under 16 in rural areas.(Time expired)",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Health and Ageing: Reforms</title>,Matters of Public Importance,16,1
"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,2004-03-24,"—I move:
That the amendments be agreed to.
The government is very pleased that the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents Integrity Measures) Bill 2003, with amendments, has passed through the Senate with the support of all parties, and I certainly want to thank my parliamentary colleagues for their cooperation and assistance in this matter. There was general agreement on the need for a better system to identify and sanction those migration agents who behave inappropriately—that is, those who, in breach of the industry code of conduct, lodge unfounded and incomplete applications that have little or no chance of success.
Migration agents who operate ethically and in the best interests of their clients have nothing to fear from this bill. However, the small number of agents who exploit their clients or engage in vexatious activity will need to review their behaviour or leave the industry. I undertook to place on the record the criteria for determining if an agent's conduct warrants referral to the Migration Agents Registration Authority, the MARA. As foreshadowed, I intend to issue a ministerial determination stipulating that, firstly, the period for assessing applications will be six months; secondly, the minimum number of applications will be 10; and, thirdly, the refusal percentage will be 90 per cent for protection visas and 75 per cent for other visas.
I also undertook to place on record the factors to be taken into account when considering whether to refer to the MARA a migration agent found to have met the initial threshold for identifying vexatious activity. Accordingly, it is my intention to introduce regulations prescribing that the following factors be taken into account:
	whether the agent's client failed to meet the relevant visa criteria at the time of decision for grant of a visa, despite having been able to meet those time of decision criteria at the time of application;
	whether the agent's client failed to meet the relevant visa criteria due to a change in the criteria set out in legislation or policy between the time of application and the time of decision;
	whether the circumstances in a country of origin have changed sufficiently to cause the agent's client to have been refused a protection visa;
	whether any of the agent's clients' applications refused at primary or review stage have subsequently been granted, following judicial review proceedings or intervention by the Minister; and
	any other matter that the Minister considers relevant.
Further, I would like to immediately address two issues that were raised during the debate in the Senate. Firstly, I would like to clearly state on the record that the right of an agent to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has not been excluded at section 306AJ(3). Section 306AJ(1) of the bill clearly states:
An application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of a referral or a mandatory decision.
The second issue relates to concerns expressed about sanctioned agents no longer being able to practice once their registration year expires. For example, an agent sanctioned on 1 February whose registration year expires on 1 June will no longer be able to practice after 1 June by making an application for review of the sanction decision and then obtaining a stay order from the AAT of that decision.
I should point out that, since the MARA commenced as an industry regulator in March 1998, only 57 agents have had their registration suspended or cancelled. As a parliament, we need to weigh up the potential level of risk involved for clients and the reputation of the remaining 3,300 agents who are simply doing the right thing. Agents who wish to continue to practice following a sanction decision will now have an incentive to expedite the hearing process before the AAT. Current experience to date is that decisions are often delayed, with the effect that the sanctioned agent's registration is renewed after its original expiry date. For example, one case has been before the AAT since mid-2002—that is nearly two years.
Returning to the key elements of the integrity measures bill and the amendments made to the bill, I wish to state the government's support for these amendments. (Extension of time granted) One impact will be to expand the range of sanction powers available to the MARA in dealing with an agent referred to them because it appears they have breached the industry code of conduct. The MARA board, comprising professionals from within the migration advice industry, will exercise its judgment about the appropriate sanction to be applied in relation to an agent's conduct. Further, the legislation ensures that sanction decisions will be made in a timely manner and that consumers will be immediately able to find out about those decisions. This, in particular, I welcome. The clarification of notification requirements will ensure that those professionals who only provide preliminary advice will not come within the ambit of the provisions that target vexatious activity.
The wide range of new and strengthened powers included in these bills will do a great deal to protect consumers—that is certainly the government's focus and priority. We also want to protect the integrity of the migration program from those few unscrupulous agents within the migration advice industry. I believe these bills are a balanced and reasonable means of achieving these two goals. I certainly want to encourage hardworking migration agents who represent their profession—particularly those who have taken on representative roles in the Migration Institute of Australia and other organisations—to remain committed to improving the reputation of this relatively new industry as it evolves into a respected profession. Many of these agents get little thanks for their efforts, yet their commitment to the profession is deep and needs to be acknowledged.
One of the additional measures suggested by the Senate committee was a requirement that all agents hold professional indemnity insurance. This is accommodated in the amendments to the bill, and a discussion paper will be released shortly to the industry and insurers to ensure that the professional indemnity insurance cover is both affordable and accessible. A further suggestion of the Senate committee was for mandatory audited trust accounts. My department will be exploring that recommendation with the industry regulator—the MARA—and the Migration Institute of Australia in coming months.
Again I want to thank all parties involved with this. I gather the member for Reid also wants to speak on these amendments. I think we have negotiated our way through an important set of amendments to the bill. As the minister responsible, I believe that this has kept the focus and priority of the government on ensuring that consumers are well protected and encouraging this industry to evolve into one regarded generally in the public as a responsible and capable profession. Over time and through the encouragement contained within this legislation, I am sure that that will be the case.",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MIGRATION AGENTS INTEGRITY MEASURES) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,20,1
"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—As summarised by the minister, Labor are in agreement with the amendments to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents Integrity Measures) Bill 2003. I should say that this bill is 50 amendments better than when we started a few months ago. I salute the efforts of not only the minister and his office but also the departmental people that have worked on coming to this outcome. I will briefly touch on three points that are still at issue in some senses. I think the minister has touched upon all of them.
The first point is the Senate committee's recommendation that there be efforts to police trust accounts. The minister says that that will be explored with MARA over the next few months. Quite frankly, we agree with that. We feel that the problem in this regard might not be as prevalent as it is in the legal fraternity's work in general, but there is evidence of it in the field, and we would like to see that tackled. I do not think the minister mentioned the question of overseas agents, an issue which came out of the Spicer inquiry. There is apparently a discussion paper dealing with the way in which the current law does not capture overseas agents. People in the field put to us that this is an increasingly evident part of the market, so we urge some action on this.
—In time.
—In time. The other point of course is the issue the minister alluded to. If a suspension or cancellation is imposed by MARA, an agent may confront the very real problem that, if they appeal to the AAT, the period of delay before the AAT hears the appeal can have an effect on the practitioner, who could sometimes be forced out of business while awaiting the AAT determination. I hear what the minister says. The reality is that some people manipulate AAT hearings, delay them by saying they are not ready to go ahead et cetera and eventually withdraw them. But there are genuine people who can be affected by this legislation. There is a problem there which we wish to highlight again.
Going back in the history of this legislation, the opposition originally had a number of concerns, firstly in regard to profiling of agents. We were concerned that the number of cases to be profiled was too few, and I am pleased to say that the government has agreed that, in future, it will be 10 cases rather than the six it originally was, from recollection. It gives a better sample of cases. People might just be unlucky because they have tended to cultivate a certain ethnic community and DFAT's advice might go against a whole lot of cases from that country, religious group or political persuasion. People might be hit unfairly. That is not to say that we do not want to hit very hard those people who deliberately take cases that should not be operating at all.
Another concern was the way in which cases were to be attributed to an agent. It is now clarified that the agent's list of profiling cases will only be those where he or she actually agrees to represent the visa applicant. Another question was the issue of the `show cause' process. I am pleased to see that the government has agreed that the period for the agent to respond has been increased to 21 days. There was also a lack of detail in regard to what aspects the minister takes as alleviating circumstances. He has now agreed that there will be a specified list of those. Professional indemnity insurance has been a bugbear, and that has also been assented to.
There is greater transparency for MARA decisions. In future, MARA will be required to publish details of sanction decisions `as soon as possible' so that people are aware of what is happening in regard to practitioners. It will also be required to separately publish the names of all agents who cease to be registered, voluntarily or otherwise. In all those matters there has been a great step forward—great progress—since we commenced discussions with the government. 
There were originally concerns that there could be—and we have no evidence that this was the intention of the minister—a perception that, under the previous provisions, an agent could be targeted because they had become a thorn in the side of government policy by being critical of it et cetera. There seemed to be a lack of capacity for MARA to exercise any real judgment at all in the whole process. It was basically a fait accompli for MARA. There was a lot of dissent from people. I feel that, on balance, we have a worthwhile and respected group of people in MARA. The minister has made similar comments about them. They had a perception that they were not going to count for very much, that it would basically be: `This is the department's decision; you just operate the penalty.' That has been rectified.
There was an inflexible system of mandatory penalties. (Extension of time granted) They have been widened, with more options. On 10 March, there was a press release in regard to the large number of changes that had been agreed to, but in that press release we did not cover the fact that MARA can decide not to sanction an agent because of special circumstances. They can then refer it back to the minister for second consideration. We think this is reasonable. Let us hope—and I think history shows it will be the case—that MARA will be responsible in this matter. They represent the industry but they also have a public responsibility, and I am hopeful that they will treat it as a very serious matter to refer cases back to the minister after the department has done a profile and come to a conclusion that someone should be seriously looked at by MARA. We have the protection now that MARA will actually have that right but that, if it is referred back to the minister and he or she determines that the sanctions should stand, MARA must implement that sanction. There is a degree of protection there. We are pleased to see the telepathy of the Democrats in that, having discussed this matter with the government, they have come up with amendments very similar to the attitude we had in discussions with the government. 
In summary, both sides of politics want to ensure that people are not exploited. In what is a very vulnerable market, people are targeted by practitioners and agents who have entrees into various ethnic communities. Many of these communities do not have knowledge of our legal system. They are extremely desperate, and sometimes they are extremely keen to participate in manipulating the system themselves. We have a chronic problem in the system, in that people do launch vexatious claims and prolong the hearing processes for other people. More and more genuine cases have to wait years and years because others are just cluttering up the system with these kinds of cases. The government's legislation is necessary. We support it fully and recommend the legislation.",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MIGRATION AGENTS INTEGRITY MEASURES) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,20,1
"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,2004-03-24,"—Very briefly, I want to thank the member for Reid. There are some schoolchildren in the gallery and I think they need to know that the parliament actually does, in most cases, work through the detail of legislation in the way that we have. I appreciate the contact that the member for Reid and I have had on this. I will take things one step further. It is not just both sides of politics, I suspect; it is generally the view of all parties associated with this parliament in both this place and the other place that consumers need to be protected and that this industry needs to get clear signals to promote the people who are doing the right thing and to drive out the ones who are doing the wrong thing. I think that will make for good progress for this important industry.
The member for Reid and I share another point of common interest, both having very culturally diverse electorates. We both regularly see constituents who need the professional guidance of migration agents. I am sure that he joins with me in wishing to make sure that our constituents are served by those with integrity rather than by others. On that basis, I am very pleased about all the work we have done on this.

"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2004-03-24,"—On behalf of the Joint Statutory Committee on the Australian Crime Commission, I present the committee's report entitled Cybercrime, together with evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—The report I have just tabled had its genesis in the apparent proliferation of available opportunities to commit criminal acts using information technology. The committee had noted over a period of time that there were several key areas in which these opportunities were particularly evident, and wanted to assess what the Australian Crime Commission was doing and could do about it. The terms of reference required the committee to inquire into and report on recent trends in practices and methods of cybercrime, with particular reference to, firstly, child pornography and associated paedophile activity; secondly, banking, including credit card fraud and money laundering; and, thirdly, threats to national critical infrastructure. The terms of reference are authorised by paragraph 55(1)(d) of the Australian Crime Commission Act. The section lists the duties of the parliamentary joint committee and the Australian Crime Commission, one of which is to examine trends and changes in criminal activities, practices and methods, and report to both houses of the parliament any change which the committee thinks desirable to the functions, structure, powers and procedures of the Australian Crime Commission.
In 2001 the parliament enacted the Cybercrime Act, which amended a number of acts and inserted computer and related offences in the Criminal Code. The committee wanted to examine the place of the ACC in this scheme and to examine possibilities for prevention and detection to which the ACC might be able to contribute. The committee took evidence in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, and heard from a wide range of witnesses. Thirty-five submissions were presented to the committee, and have been placed on the committee web site. From the evidence and the submissions, the committee noted that there were four main community concerns: access by children to unsuitable Internet content; access to children by paedophiles; the regulation of Internet service providers; and the potential for crime in relation to Internet financial transactions.
During the inquiry there were incidents reported in the press which highlighted some of the issues canvassed by the committee. These included the proliferation of spam and the use of chat rooms by paedophiles to groom children for sexual purposes. The parliament has already responded with the introduction of the Spam Act 2003, to which is added the very recent government initiative to amend the telecommunications legislation, the Crimes Act 1914 and the Criminal Code Act 1996. Measures contained in this draft legislation include the creation of a range of offences designed to prevent use of a telecommunications device to transmit pornographic material, and to procure a person under the age of consent for sexual purposes.
The committee recommendations complement these initiatives. Included among them are: a recommendation that the regulation of Internet service providers be examined and the status of material held by them assessed; a recommendation that the government investigate partnerships for establishing a multimedia education campaign on the safe use of technology by children; a recommendation that Commonwealth, state and territory attorneys-general liaise to ensure consistent cybercrime and related legislation within Australia in accordance with Australia's international obligations; and recommendations that both the Australian Crime Commission and the Australian High Tech Crime Centre investigate the secure provision of general information on fraud trends to financial institutions and, with other law enforcement agencies, develop a national intelligence-gathering strategy for cybercrime in the banking industry.
The issues canvassed by the committee are among the most important facing our post-industrial society. Parliament and the government must respond quickly to the challenges thrown up by rapidly changing technology. The security of personal data, including banking and financial information, and the protection of our children from those who seek to use technology to prey upon them are essential to the healthy functioning of our families and our communities. The recommendations in this report are intended to assist this process.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Australian Crime Commission Committee</title>,Committees,21,1

"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—It is worth reflecting on the complex interaction between socioeconomic status and gender in the performance of children at school and in the situation that leads to the life paths that they are ultimately able to follow. Obviously, socioeconomic status and material background are fundamental in influencing the opportunity of a particular child and in influencing how they go in the education system. It is also clear, however, that gender plays a role. The data that we have available indicates that girls are outperforming boys in the education system, irrespective of what socioeconomic class they come from. Across all sectors of society there is a disparity, and it is tending to get worse. Although it is true to say that there is clearly a major issue about opportunity, about ensuring that we get better, more well-paid teachers, better resources and better funded government schools—a fundamental commitment of the Australian Labor Party—there is also a gender issue, which the House of Representatives committee report that I referred to previously did actually address.
It is important that we do not, in dealing with this issue, in any way detract from or demean the tremendous job that existing primary school teachers—80 per cent of whom are women—are doing. There is no question that we are fortunate in this country that we are blessed with a work force of highly dedicated and highly professional primary school teachers who do a tremendous job, and it should not in any way be suggested or implied that, because we are addressing this issue, there is something wrong with how they are doing their job. In fact, that is one of the core weaknesses in the government's approach and the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 that the government has put before the House today—that is, that underneath it is an implication that there is something wrong with how female teachers are teaching male students in primary schools.
I have a six-year-old son who is now in year 1. He had a female teacher in prep and he has a female teacher in year 1 in a government school. I would like to put on the record that I am absolutely happy and, indeed, proud of how they are teaching and have taught him. I have absolute confidence that in the school that he attends the quality of the teaching and the influences—the development of his values and his approach to life—that they will impart are beyond reproach. I think it is important that the government, while pursuing this misguided piece of legislation, should put on record its gratitude to the teachers of this country—particularly the primary teachers, who are the focus of this debate—for the tremendous work they do, in spite of the fact that often they are underpaid and overloaded in their work situation.
The other conclusion that can be drawn from the House of Representatives committee report entitled Boys: getting it right is that, in some respects, the debate about whether teachers are male or female is a bit of a side issue in the bigger picture about the crisis in masculinity. It is an issue, I concede that, and we do need to address it in some way. But the real issue is the decline in the availability of positive role models in the lives of young people, particularly boys, from the extended family or the local community—and that is identified in the committee's report. 
There is a crucial difference between the role played by someone from a young person's extended family or community and the role that is played by a parent or teacher. That difference is about authority. A parent or a teacher has the power to exercise relatively arbitrary authority over a child. That is as it should be. But that places a component in the relationship which, in many respects, gets in the way of the kind of role model activity that we would like to see being imparted to the young person. Often that use of arbitrary authority can be a barrier to the young person absorbing and adopting positive values from a parent or a teacher and following their guidance.
What is slowly declining and gradually disappearing from many parts of our society are the positive role models beyond parents and teachers—those who have to earn respect from young people and who do not have the capacity to exercise arbitrary authority over them. Therefore, when they do earn that respect, they have in a sense an unaffected ability to influence the approach of that young person to life, to education, and to their responsibilities to others. This conclusion has hit me very directly when I have been considering the issue of mentoring that the Leader of the Opposition asked me to deal with recently.
It is interesting that when you talk to people in mentoring programs—young people, mentors and people who run the programs, as I have been doing a lot of recently—one of the things that comes through very clearly is how the underpinning value of those programs is the inherent sense of core equality in the relationship between a mentor and a young person. The young person can bale out at any time. They can walk away from the relationship, and that gives them a degree of power in the relationship which makes them less suspicious, less resistant, less critical and more likely—if the mentor is contributing in a positive way, has been trained and knows how to go about it—to get value from that relationship.
There is no doubt that mentoring can fill much of the gap for many of the problems that boys in particular, but also girls, experience. Those problems can be ameliorated by the availability of mentors not to supplant but to add to the role of parents or teachers—to add a different dimension to the influences that are present in a young person's life. These are positive, responsible influences that, rather than being imposed through authority, are produced by respect, by dialogue and by somebody treating the young person seriously and seeking to assist them in a way that does not have any kind of imposition of authority or self-interest attached to it.
When I was a teenager in my first few years at university, kids that I grew up with were already starting to get married and buy houses. They had secure manual jobs and a reasonably predictable future. These days, pathways into adulthood are much less predictable. Traditional apprenticeships have declined, and more and more career opportunities are being accessed through informal networks rather than clear formal pathways. For those who have ready access to those networks, or a fast track on some of the more privileged pathways, the world of work is a world of opportunity. The world of adulthood beckons as a place where opportunity can be grasped. But for those who are not fortunate enough to have access to those networks—to the privileged sources of information, connections and contacts that would enable them to get on the inside and get those opportunities—the world of adulthood and work can appear pretty confusing and daunting from the age of 13 or 14. This is another area where mentoring comes in. As well as providing role models and advisers who can influence by example rather than by authority, mentors can help a young person connect with informal networks in the adult world that may have been previously inaccessible.
In my travels around various mentoring programs a few weeks ago, I met a young bloke called Trent, who wants to be a sound technician. He was pretty much drifting; he was 17, and he did not know what he wanted to do or how to go about it. He had a general idea about what he would like to do, but he had no idea how to pursue his goal, and it appeared that people at his school did not have the knowledge or the contacts to assist him. Fortunately, he entered a mentoring program and his mentor helped him to connect with several people in the industry. He now knows a lot more about how the industry operates, he has developed some contacts, and he knows what he needs to do to pursue his goal—and he is off chasing it. Significantly, his mentor was female. 
Mentoring can help fill the gap created by the decline of extended families and communities. It means giving a young person wider access to sympathetic adult advice and assistance from somebody who will treat the young person seriously and be helpful. Although mentoring can be of benefit to young men and women, there is no doubt that it can offer particular benefits for young people at risk, especially for boys at risk. Mentoring is only one of a number of strategies that we need to pursue to tackle the problems affecting young people and, in this case, the crisis in masculinity. Although there are many great mentoring programs, our national mentoring effort is nothing like what it should be. There is little genuine leadership from the federal government on the issue, and my first task as shadow minister for community relationships is to develop a national mentoring strategy that will address that.
As part of addressing the wave of social problems affecting young men and women in our society, Labor intends to elevate mentoring as a crucial national priority. That is the way we should be thinking in dealing with these issues. Changing the Sex Discrimination Act to allow for positive discrimination for male teachers fundamentally undermines that important piece of legislation, the core essence of the Sex Discrimination Act. It will not do very much, if anything at all, to solve the problem. The problems in education are much more complex. They relate to things like the status and remuneration of teachers and a variety of other issues. The government's proposal is essentially a window-dressing exercise, yet again designed to make it look like the government is doing something rather than doing the hard yards: tackling the problem issues and making a serious contribution to dealing with them.
Mentoring is one example within my portfolio that I will be pursuing to help tackle the crisis of boys and masculinity. It is not the only solution we need to pursue, but it is a fundamentally important one. I believe it will make a major contribution to gradually diminish these problems and ensure that all young people—young men and young women—get decent opportunities in life and get a chance to aspire to and achieve their goals.",REPS,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Ticehurst, Kenneth, MP",LP,2004-03-24,"—After parents and families, schools have perhaps the greatest influence on our children. During some of the most important years in a child's development, they spend most of their waking hours at school, so it can be said that schools have an important responsibility to provide positive role models for our children. The Australian government is extremely concerned about the decline in the number of male school teachers in Australian schools and the effect of this decline on the education of our children.
The depletion of male teachers, particularly in primary schools, means that boys grow up without enough male role models. This poses a serious risk to boys' learning and personal development. The Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 is directed at improving outcomes for our children. The bill amends the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to provide `that a person may offer scholarships for persons of a particular gender in respect of participation in a teaching course'. This section would apply only if the purpose of doing so is to redress a gender imbalance in teaching.
In 2003, of the students training to become primary school teachers, only 18.8 per cent were male. In my electorate of Dobell, Australian Bureau of Statistics figures reveal that less than a third of Central Coast schoolteachers are men. The problem occurs in both public and private schools. Wyong Grove Public School has six female teachers and one full-time male teacher. Our Lady of the Rosary Primary School at Wyoming has just two male teachers on its staff of 15.
Boys, on average, are achieving significantly lower levels than girls in all areas of the assessed cognitive curriculum from early primary to late secondary school in Australia. The situation worsens: males are three times more likely to be in a car accident, more likely to be involved in assault and drug related incidents and are five times more likely to take their own lives. Suicide rates for 15- to 24-year-olds have risen by as much as 50 per cent in the past 10 to 15 years. My electorate of Dobell has experienced some of the highest numbers of youth suicide across the country.
The President of the Central Coast Parents and Citizens Association of New South Wales, Ms Sharryn Brownlee, has publicly stated that a teacher's gender is not important. In the Daily Telegraph last week, she pointed out that there is a shortage of females in senior levels of management. With all due respect to Ms Brownlee, this bill is not about pitting men against women. Indeed, I know many female teachers who do an amazing job. I understand the feminist argument that men hold positions of power and earn more than women in certain industries, but we need to go beyond that. We need to look at the serious social and cultural issues that need to be addressed in young boys. In fact, a number of female principals have expressed to me their disappointment that they have trouble attracting male teachers into their schools.
When one considers the high incidence of divorce in my electorate on the Central Coast—a whopping nine per cent; well above the state average of 7.2 per cent—and that many children in my electorate are being single-handedly raised by their mothers, the situation becomes even more pressing. If boys complete primary school without a male role model, an environment is created for boys to become men who are unsure of their own masculinity.
Dr Peter West, head of the University of Western Sydney's research group on men and families explains the need for male role models in schools. He says that men and women are different, which is why they compete in separate categories in sporting events and are taught differently. Male teachers, West says, have louder voices, use more jokes, fewer words, organise more hands-on activities in the classroom and can relate more to boyish behaviour. I have five sons and one daughter, and I notice that my sons' relationship with me is totally different from their relationship with their mother. Indeed, my grandsons have a different relationship with me from the relationship with their own parents. I am able to discuss many of their school projects on a level that their parents cannot, because of my electrical engineering background. It is interesting to see the effect this has on the upbringing of boys. It is important for boys living in single parent families where the parent is a female to react with other males in positions of discipline or leadership. The importance of male teachers is not so much in their contribution to academic outcomes—males and females can learn from either sex—but in the boys' overall development. When children are spending six hours a day, five days a week, in a classroom, the people standing in front of them will be extremely influential.
It is also important to note that the measure is drafted in gender-neutral terms and permits strategies for addressing a gender imbalance in either direction. The bill is not directed at the specific case involving the Catholic Education Office. The Australian government wants educational authorities, private and public, to have the option of responding to the pressing shortage of males in teaching without having to contend with cumbersome processes. Some public school educators have been quite supportive of the bill. For example, last Tuesday the Woy Woy Peninsula Teachers Federation representative and Woy Woy South Public School teacher Rob Landow told the Central Coast Express Advocate that men-only university scholarships would be a good way to tackle the shortage of male schoolteachers on the Central Coast.
The government's prime concern is with educational outcomes for Australian children. Meanwhile, the Leader of the Opposition finally has the opportunity to do something with his concern about the need for male role models, yet he is failing the test by doing nothing. Who is he trying to appease this time? An ideological obsession with not changing a single word of the Sex Discrimination Act is more important to Labor than helping our kids.
This bill is only one aspect of the government's strategy to address the challenge of increasing educational outcomes for boys. Boys' education is a priority area for the $159.2 million Australian Government Quality Teacher Program. This includes $6 million committed to the Boys' Education Lighthouse Schools Program to identify best practice in boys' education, of which Wamberal and Pretty Beach primary schools on the Central Coast received $6,000 to implement a surf-lifesaving program. The program was responding to evidence that boys are falling behind in our education system. Wamberal Public School, under the leadership of principal Gary Crowther and the direction of program coordinator Rob Natara, has been doing a fantastic job showcasing how to develop and implement educational practices addressing boys' needs.
We have heard many of the members opposite talk about the fact that they do not want to interfere with sex discrimination. Yet, when selecting their own candidates for parliament, their preselection process involves EMILY's List, which provides a 20 per cent advantage to females. On the Central Coast this has enabled the Labor candidate for Robertson to be preselected over a male on the last two occasions. The member for Melbourne talked about gender equity. Labor need to be consistent. If you are going to have gender equity, you need to apply it across the whole range and, indeed, to party practices. The Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 is a reflection of the Australian government's commitment to achieving the best educational outcomes for male and female school students throughout Australia. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—I am very pleased to have the opportunity to talk about an issue that was very much part and parcel of two years of my parliamentary career. I was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training inquiry which looked at the question of boys and education and which handed down the interesting and fascinating report Boys: getting it right. That is the theme we are supposed to be talking about today, and I do not think the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 does get it right. I do not think it gets it right in terms of what it is trying to achieve—that is, improving educational outcomes for boys, and inducing and encouraging more males into the teaching profession.
I find it rather ironic that you can count on one hand the number of people who have spoken in this House over the last few years about the issue of boys and education. But, as soon as this knee-jerk legislation was put forward—legislation which has been described as a hammer to break a nut—many members on the other side became interested in the debate about boys and education. We have not heard them speak about this issue in the last two or three years—a strange situation, I believe. Of course, they come out of the woodwork when they are given the old template and notes for speeches, which we heard an example of a moment ago.
We know why we are here today discussing this legislation. The one advantage of it is that we are talking about boys and education. It is good to be talking about education full stop in this place. And we are also talking about the issue of trying to induce males into education as teachers. Indeed, the whole issue of inducing people into the teaching profession is a larger and very important one. But we are here today because of `follow the leader'. Over a number of years Mark Latham has raised the issue of boys and education and the issue of masculinity. A number of his publications—which most people in this House never bothered to look at until the rise and rise of Mark Latham—are replete with those issues. We are debating this legislation today because Mark Latham has given emphasis to issues that we should be talking about and that we should have been talking about over a number of years. 
What is the response from the government? They ask, `How can we wedge the opposition and try to make an issue out of this to embarrass the new Leader of the Opposition?' It is classical catch-up, knee-jerk stuff. `How can we do it? Let's have a quick fix; let's have a smart fix.' But anybody would know that this issue is too important and too long term for a smart fix or a quick fix. We know that a quick fix is not a smart fix and that this is too important, even though people from the other side have trotted out before us in this House over the last few days to try to politicise the issue by saying, `If we amend the Sex Discrimination Act, we can get men into the teaching profession.'
The very catalyst for this legislation—the Catholic Education Office's application for an exemption to the Sex Discrimination Act on this issue—has been withdrawn. The Catholic Education Office, and particularly its director, must have found mind-boggling the speed at which this government took over their application. We have the government running off on this catalyst. The Catholic Education Office has arrived at negotiation and agreement with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and adopted the recommendations in the report accepted unanimously by government members and members on our side of the House.
Recommendation 20 has been there since October 2002 and the Catholic Education Office has adopted it because it makes sense. The Catholic Education Office, through the very interesting 1999 report Men in primary teaching: an endangered species by investigators Lewis, Butcher and Donnan, have looked at a whole plethora of recommendations and evidence on the issue of trying to induce men into education.
We have an issue about boys in education. The report Boys: getting it right clearly demonstrates that, in comparative terms—this is not just in Australia, it is shared throughout all OECD countries—boys underachieve in comparison to their female counterparts. There is a whole host of indicators available and I will share some of these with you.
A key indicator includes measures of early literacy achievement. In the year 2000, 3.4 per cent fewer year 3 boys than girls and 4.4 per cent fewer year 5 boys than girls achieved the national benchmarks. Another indicator is school retention and in 2001 the retention rate of boys to year 12 was 11 percentage points lower than the retention rate of girls. There are other indicators such as suspensions and expulsions, which involve many more boys than girls. The indicators that scholars and observers use to demonstrate that boys underachieve compared with their female counterparts go on.
The issue of boys' education has been around for some time and it is great news that the majority of our states are tackling these issues, trying to implement programs so we have educational outcomes which are more suitable for and appropriate to many more boys. The important thing is that those outcomes should be achievable by all our students—not just males but females as well. That is a very important outcome to achieve.
The report clearly demonstrated that it is not the gender of the teacher involved in the role modelling that is going on in the classroom; it is the quality of the program and the quality of the relationships that take place. I know, and people on the other side have given evidence of this, that it is very important that we have male role models for our students, particularly males. But there is also evidence that to differentiate on gender misses the point; it is the quality of the relationship that takes place in the classroom. That was borne out no better than in the Flinders University study by Faith Trent and Malcom Slade, where something like 1,600 boys responded to a fairly comprehensive questionnaire related to schooling and disaffection. What emerged from that study were issues about the quality of the relationships that take place in the classroom and inside the school, the organisation of the school and the school culture. What did not emerge from the study was the issue of gender. That is not to deny the importance of trying to induce more males into education. The evidence is fairly stark of the numbers, or lack of numbers, of men involved in education. The report, under the heading `Male teachers' in chapter 6 under point 6.76, says:
There is a great deal of public and media interest in the decline in the number of male teachers in both primary and secondary schools.
Indeed there is.
Nationally, the proportion of male primary teachers fell from 26.3 per cent to 21.3 per cent between 1991 and 2001 ... and the situation is not likely to reverse itself in near future.
It goes on to say:
At the University of Western Sydney male primary teacher enrolments were only 15 per cent of the total in 1998 and some teacher education campuses report a proportion of male students in primary education as low as 10 per cent.
It continues:
A survey of over 1,400 Year 12 students in Catholic schools in Sydney found that only five per cent of boys, compared to 15 per cent of girls, were considering a teaching career. Also, most of the boys considering teaching were considering secondary teaching.
Those are alarming statistics. We need to then look at the question: what are the reasons that discourage males from entering teaching? We can also ask the same question about females.
What are these reasons? This so-called amendment of the Sex Discrimination Act seems to be premised on the argument that males—moi—cannot enter appropriate training courses; that is, I cannot get in; I do not merit a place in educational training courses. That is nonsense. If someone has the appropriate qualifications, they can enter training courses. The only thing stopping them would be the number of places available to them. That is the only thing that would stop them.
So there are other factors at work here. What are some of these factors? I noticed that a work cited by Armitage in 1999 included some factors limiting male participation as suggested by scholars Farquhar in 1997 and Janet Smith. Amongst other things, these included the low social status of the primary teacher—a sad indictment; poor wages in relation to the work performed; limited career path for those not seeking administrative roles; the labelling of male primary schoolteachers as homosexual or not real men—I do not know what amending the Sex Discrimination Act is going to do about that; the current media spotlight on allegations of child sexual abuse; the fear of being labelled as a paedophile; and the impact of child protection policies in schools. These are very significant factors discouraging males—and, no doubt, females—from entering the teaching profession.
So we have a national crisis on our hands about the status of the teaching profession in this country. I notice in the Boys: getting it right report, in relation to factors discouraging student teachers, particularly men—and this is again under the section headed `Male teachers'—the committee reported that:
Central to the issue of status is the public image of teaching and teachers, who are very well aware of negative public perceptions.
That is, the negative public perceptions of teaching. The committee continued:
For a range of other reasons teaching is now perceived to be a difficult occupation and one where the financial rewards do not recognise the difficulty.
The report goes on to say:
There is no doubt that child protection issues are a significant factor in men's attitude towards teaching, generally, and that this factor is magnified in relation to primary teaching. The community attitude towards male primary school teachers is a troubling paradox. People say they want more male primary teachers in schools while many harbour suspicions about men who want to work with children.
Let me suggest that that is what we should be dealing with. Those perceptions are what we should be dealing with, not making knee-jerk amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act on the pretext and the pretence that men will be encouraged into teaching if they are given men only scholarships. I think that is really self-evident as a non-argument. The report goes on to say:
The issue of teachers' salaries is a less complex factor than child protection but it is still difficult to resolve.
What was really interesting about the Boys: getting it right report was the committee's recommendation under the section `Factors discouraging male teachers'. Do you know what the recommendation was? It was not to amend the Sex Discrimination Act. Recommendation said:
The Committee recommends that State and Territory Governments urgently address the remuneration of teachers with the payment of substantial additional allowances for skilled and experienced teachers as an inducement for them to remain in teaching and to attract new teachers by offering more attractive career paths.
That is a solution; not a knee-jerk reaction to amend the Sex Discrimination Act. The factors I have just outlined here—which others have outlined before in this House—clearly indicate that it is not the ability to get a male only scholarship that is going to encourage men into the teaching profession; it is trying to tackle these quite serious factors of discouragement. I think we should be pretty honest about that.
The committee went on further in the report to look at teacher quality. It is very interesting. It said at point 6.89:
For its part, the Commonwealth Government could provide a financial inducement to attract quality students into teaching by providing HECS-free scholarships to the top brackets of high school graduates.
There is a pretty sensible inducement by the Commonwealth. Under the heading `Do male role models matter?', the general consensus was yes; where they can, it would be great to have male role models for students. Indeed, the anecdotal evidence suggests that would be highly beneficial.
It is in relation to that point in the committee's report that we have recommendation 20—the very recommendation that the Catholic Education Office has now taken up. But it is not the recommendation the federal government has taken up. Indeed, in its responses to the 24 recommendations of this committee, the government expressly rejects it. What an irony we have here. Recommendation 20, which goes to teacher quality and inducement, unanimously says:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth provide a substantial number of HECS-free scholarships for equal numbers of males and females to undertake teacher training. These would be based on merit and take into account other admission criteria developed in line with Recommendation 19. The scholarships would operate as a rebate of the HECS liability while the recipients were employed by a recognised teaching authority.
HECS-free scholarships for equal numbers of males and females is the very proposal that the Catholic Education Office has now taken up—but not this government.
We know why there is an amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act before us today. It has nothing to do with really tackling this issue in the short term and the long term; it is all about trying to point score over the new Leader of the Opposition. That is clear for everyone to see, as it was when the government attacked Commissioner Keelty. It is as clear as night follows day. That is what all this is about. It is a smart fix and a quick fix, but it does not fix anything and it does not fool anyone.",REPS,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Baldwin, Robert, MP",LP,2004-03-24,"—From the outset we should all agree that the most important things in this debate are the education of boys and role models for boys. We need to ask ourselves: who will benefit from the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004? The reality is that boys will benefit—which I will detail later in the speech—and girls will benefit. Why will girls benefit? They will benefit because we will see improved behaviour from boys at school through the increase in male role models.
The Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, said in this House, on 9 March:
We want the education system to nurture them and bring them to adult life as constructive, responsible, well-adjusted human beings.
That is exactly what this bill does: it starts the journey to remedy this national dilemma. The purpose of the bill is to facilitate measures to address the imbalance in the number of male and female school teachers and the effect of that imbalance on the education of male school students in particular. The existing provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, including in education, do not allow positive discrimination to redress the gender imbalance in the teaching profession, particularly the shortage of males in preschool and primary school teaching. This bill would amend the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to permit the provision of scholarships to persons of one sex in relation to courses in school teaching in Australia to redress gender imbalance in teaching. 
Importantly, this bill is not an attack on teachers, whether they be male or female. The teachers I have met in my electorate are high-quality teachers, and each of them is absolutely committed to quality education for our children. Those that I have spoken to all agree that we need natural male role models. There are strong arguments, as we have heard from all sides today, for increasing teachers' pay as an incentive for male teachers to come into the system. As I said in a speech in the House earlier this week, parents are looking for three things from the education system: values, discipline and identity. Those three things are critically important. When we look at discipline as one of those values, it is easier to apply discipline if we have natural role models for children to follow.
As I say, we have great teachers in our system and all of them are committed. But I would now like to mention a couple of statistics in relation to male teachers. The proportion of male primary teachers fell from 26.3 per cent in 1991 to 21.3 per cent in 2001, and only 20.9 per cent of primary school teachers in Australia now are men. Some teacher campuses have reported that the number of male students in primary education is as low as 10 per cent, and last year only 24 per cent of Australian students enrolled in teaching courses were male. Only 3.6 per cent of students training to be early childhood teachers were men. The number of male secondary teachers declined from 49.5 per cent to 45.1 per cent between 1991 and 2001.
Not satisfied with those statistics, I had my office do a small sample to find out how many male teachers we have in Paterson. We rang the preschools and found that there are no male preschool teachers at Grahamstown, Seaham, Williamtown, Nelson Bay, Tea Gardens-Hawks Nest, Bulahdelah, Clarencetown and Barrington. Paterson has one casual male teacher on its books; Kindiclub in Thornton has one male trainee; Forster had some casuals last year but now has none; Tuncurry has none now and has had two in 11 years; and Gloucester has one male trainee. It gets a little bit better in primary schools: Anna Bay has six male teachers out of 16; Beresfield has 4.5 out of 15; Booral has none out of five; Dungog has two out of 13, and one of them is leaving after the holidays; Medowie has four out of 14; Morpeth has two out of seven; Raymond Terrace has four out of 30; and Shoal Bay has two out of 15.
This has a dramatic effect on the education of boys. The low number of male teachers is directly reflected in the performance of boys at school. For example, boys are behind girls in years 3 and 5 reading benchmarks. There is a 3.4 per cent gap between boys and girls in year 3 and a 4.4 per cent gap in year 5. Boys far outweigh girls in the bottom 25 per cent of performance at school. Eighty per cent of students in school discipline programs are boys and almost all expulsions involve boys. More girls than boys will stay on to complete year 12. In New South Wales, the average tertiary entrance score for girls is more than 19 points higher than for boys. Young males are more likely than females to use illicit drugs and to commit assaults. Males are three times more likely to die in motor vehicle accidents. In 2000, nine times as many males as females were held in juvenile correctional institutions and, sadly, boys are five times more likely than females to die by suicide.
This is a crisis for this nation, and I am glad something is being done to address it. In my own area of Forster there is a group called the Self-Esteem Foundation. A friend of mine, John Stevens, is involved on the committee, and they have asked me to take up the position of patron of that organisation. We need to invest in the self-esteem of boys. Part of that investment in self-esteem begins at the very basis of their education. We have heard from the opposition and from the government many reasons why males are not entering the work force as teachers. There are three issues: firstly, poor pay; secondly, lack of career opportunities; and, thirdly, child protection issues. On the issue of poor pay, Mr Ian Carragher was quoted in the  inquiry's report Boys: getting it right as saying:
I worked hard at University to become an Honours Graduate with a distinction average and now, with 20 years experience on the job, I make about the average weekly wage. I see colleagues who need to bar tend to make ends meet. I see my 24 year old niece driving ferries on Sydney Harbour and making more money than me. Essentially a teachers salary is only seen as an adequate second income for a family. Hence the dearth of males.
As I said, it goes to a lack of career opportunities. Finally there are child protection issues. A submission to the boys education inquiry from Ed Lewis of the Australian Catholic University states:
... something that was of great concern ... was this business about physical contact with children and the possible allegations of child abuse ... This was something they said they carried around with them daily, all of the time ... one of the guys said he felt he was under scrutiny. He came as a casual teacher to take kindergarten and all the mums and dads were there waiting. The principal introduced him and built him up in a big way but he really felt that he was under scrutiny. He wondered whether a firstyear out female teacher would feel the same thing.
It is critical in education today to have male role models. It is important that all children have access to both male and female role models but currently, with the present decline in male teacher numbers, children have less access to male role models. As my small sample survey of schools has shown, the majority of preschool and primary school teachers are females, and there is a growing number of single parent families where the mother is the primary care giver. Children can be at home with mum, go to school and see their female teacher and then come home again to mum and not have any major contact with a male.
This is not just the case with single parent families. Through today's working pressures, we see a lot of families with a male and a female in the household but with the male working extended hours, long overtime and weekends and having no time for the children, and that has the same effect. In a submission to the inquiry, Richard Fletcher from the University of Newcastle wrote:
... it is important that we convey to boys that men value learning; not just later when you are in the work force ... but right now in that classroom in those early years. That is where we need to convince boys that men value learning. The best way to do that is to have men demonstrate that, obviously. You can imagine it is not quite as convincing for a female teacher to tell the boy that men value learning as it is for him to see men doing it.
There is a plethora of experts who give evidence on the value of educating boys and the need for male role models. Dr Flood, a research fellow with the Australia Institute, is quoted in the Canberra Times on 23 February 2004 as saying:
Fathers are the most important role models for boys, and the biggest barrier to fathers' involvement is the structure and culture of the workplace.
He went on to say:
Fathers feel pressured to choose between work and family, and they complain of inflexible working conditions and unsupportive bosses. 
Labor's only concrete policy proposal here is for 14 weeks of paid maternity leave. This will hardly make a difference to men's ability to spend time with their sons and daughters.
Perhaps one of the most telling submissions put to the education of boys inquiry was from Roger Button, who has a bachelor of education. He has experience as a year 8 level coordinator-counsellor. He said that boys develop an attitude from approximately kindergarten age through to about the age of eight to 14. He stated:
When investigating the background of boys referred to me for disciplinary reasons, I have found that the vast majority come from single parent homes. Of these single parent homes, almost always it is the mother who is raising the son singlehandedly. Children who do not live with their biological father constitute almost 50% of students in my current school.
Further he stated:
... boys are much more profoundly affected by their parents splitting up than are girls, as it is usually the boy who no longer has a role model to teach him how to be a young man.
He went on to say:
The same effect is also evident from boys whose fathers have little input in their upbringing—ie the `workaholic' father, `the interstate truckie', `the shift worker', `the general manager' or the chauvinistic father who considers child rearing to be the mother's role.
These are important lessons to learn from educational professionals. In fact, Glenn Marchant put a submission to that same inquiry. Glenn is from Pascoe Vale, Victoria, where he is a secondary schoolteacher with some 17 years of experience. He said:
Many boys in Australia take their role models from sport. Unfortunately, an explosion of flawed sporting heroes has had prominence in the media; especially Rugby League, Australian Rules and Cricket. ... High profile sporting stars who are aggressive, violent and anti-authority with little or no regard to intellectual pursuits have a detrimental impact on the learning of boys.
This was written before recent events as we have seen them in our area with the Bulldogs or indeed the Penrith Panthers where last week three players from the Penrith Rugby League Club were charged with assault after a fare dispute in which a taxi driver suffered facial injuries and a dislocated shoulder. We have to be careful whom we choose as role models. Glenn Marchant went on to say:
It is not unusual for a boy to go through primary school with only limited access to a male teacher. Even in secondary schools a boy may only have one or two male English teachers. This is highly undesirable for a number of reasons: boys need men to help them understand what it means to be a man, to deal with aggression and violence in a positive way, to see reading, writing and intellectual pursuits as something `masculine', to show emotion, care for others and to develop a host of other positive male characteristics. Unfortunately, many boys see women in schools and define themselves as men by being antifemale. This can lead to the rejection of reading and intellectual pursuits as `girly' or `sissy'. Many boys are reluctant to discuss emotional issues in front of girls and women. They do not want to be seen as weak in front of women and their peers.
It goes on, and many people have commented on this issue. In fact, Mr Murray Drummond, who is South Australia's specialist in men's health, said:
... male teachers provide boys with more than just an academic education.
He said that the most significant issue facing them was a `crisis in masculinity'. He went on:
Teachers do an extremely good job but, in terms of life skills and helping boys to understand their masculinity, this can only be achieved by male role models.
Because of family breakdowns, the only place boys are likely to find male role models now is at school.
Experts are saying that we need more males in the education system—males to be role models. As I look at the current crop of sporting role models who are in the media for the wrong reasons, it makes me wonder. It belies belief that these people can be seen and worshipped as heroes by these young children, who would then seek to emulate their activities and actions. But I am glad that my government under the leadership in education of Brendan Nelson has seen it as a priority to invest some $159.2 million in the Australian Government Quality Teacher Program, including $6 million committed to the Boys' Education Lighthouse Schools Program to identify best practices in boys' education, with a further $500,000 committed to research.
But there is a difference between when you talk the talk and when it comes time to walk the walk. For many months, the Leader of the Opposition stood up and expressed his concern about male role models and the need for them in society. But here is a classic opportunity for the Leader of the Opposition to show leadership and to do more than talk the talk. It is time to put on those running shoes and walk the walk. But the only walking he has done is away from boys' education. In fact, his muscling up for masculinity has turned into nothing more than flab. He is soft on substance but strong on the rhetoric, and that does not wash with people.
An article in the Australian on Friday, 12 March, called `Boys playing catch-up' by Samantha Maiden, says:
... Mark Latham's call to arms over a “crisis in masculinity”.
When Latham thanked his Ashcroft Primary School teacher, Neville Smith, in a speech to ALP national conference in January, he sent a powerful message about male role models.
“I see this in my own community, boys who have gone off the rails,” Latham said.
``I want a Labor government to find new answers to this problem, building bridges between people across generations, across cultures.”
That is talking the talk, but today is walking the walk. What we see is him walking away from boys and their education. The Leader of the Opposition is not alone in his ability to walk away from situations. In fact, the Democrats spokesman on legal affairs, Senator Brian Greig, said that he would oppose this bill and any watering down of antidiscrimination laws and that he believes the problem of too few male teachers can be addressed through other measures. This is a measure that starts to address that inequity.
We also need to look at the hypocrisy that goes on in the discussions of this. In a press released issued this week, the AttorneyGeneral, Mr Ruddock, said:
“The WA Minister for Education and Training has ... been critical of the Government's amendment, yet his Department has offered scholarships to enable males completing their degree at a WA university to obtain teaching qualifications.”
Last year, the WA Department of Education and Training offered 37 male-only scholarships worth $10,000 each as part of its scholarship program. The funds are paid as a lump sum and the recipient has to sign a two year employment contract.
I think that is a great idea. But it goes on:
I understand the WA Government has not sought an exemption from the Sex Discrimination Act for the scholarships and it is unclear whether they have sought an exemption from their own Equal Opportunity Act ...
I would hate to see where a government taking affirmative action was actually prosecuted for breach of this act when what we are trying to achieve here and what the most important thing is is the education of boys and the instalment of role models.
As I said, hypocrisy flies high. In Newcastle we have mostly female members of parliament. They are good people, and I take nothing away from them, but each of them utilised the affirmative action policy of the Labor Party, which gave them a voting base support of 20 per cent. So when it comes to affirmative action for females, the Labor Party will apply a 20 per cent loading but when it comes to the education of boys and supporting the installation of a greater range of role models, people who are respected members of the community, which teachers are—teachers committed to children's education and providing that nurturing—Labor are opposed to it.
As I say, it is time to finish talking the talk. It is time to walk the walk and step up to the side of the government and support this government's proposal to put more teachers in. We have a plan, and we will do more than just talk. We will vote with the government to support this bill—a bill that I strongly recommend because I can see the benefits to our community, I can see the benefits to boys and I can see the benefits to girls also because of the improved behaviour through having strong role models in the education system. I recommend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—I want to reassure the member opposite that I am not only prepared to talk the talk; I will walk the walk and I will wipe away all those tears after those emotional, moving speeches from coalition members, all aimed at getting 12 more male students a scholarship. We have tens of thousands of primary school teachers and tens of thousands of high school teachers, but the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 is about 12. I have been moved by so many words, such emotion, such feeling, such commitment and such concern. It has been like a flood washing over from the government benches to the opposition.
—Then vote for it.
 (Mr Barresi)—The member for Paterson has had his go.
—Never in my period in this parliament have I had to have a hanky in my hand, but I could be overwhelmed by them. I congratulate the member for Paterson. It was a moving speech, spending almost two minutes for every teacher that you hope to employ. I congratulate you—
—I have many more minutes for many more teachers.
—and I think we are going to get another speech.
—The member for Paterson will cease interjecting.
—The nature of the minister for education is such that question time is often used to abuse members of the opposition about educational matters, so I take this opportunity to clear the decks of a couple of matters. Yes, I am very proud of the University of Western Sydney. I was one of those federal members, along with state members, the Labor Party in Western Sydney and the community, who fought for the establishment of the University of Western Sydney. Of course I am proud about it. Of course I will always talk about the achievements of the University of Western Sydney and what it can do, and I will always speak up when I think this government has dealt, as it has, the university a lousy card in a funding distribution.
And, of course, I am proud of Mount Druitt TAFE. It was the late Tony Johnson, the state member for Mount Druitt—I happened to be his campaign director—who made a number of commitments, a number of promises, and one was a TAFE for Mount Druitt. I attended the turning of the sod ceremony for that TAFE, and I think we are up to about stage seven of the expansion of that TAFE. It has some 8,000 effective full-time students. Yes, the state government increasing fees by 300 per cent was unwelcomed by me. I think it was disappointing. I do not think it was justified. But, for the record, let me say a couple of things. Firstly, the fees were raised to the level of those of all other state governments. New South Wales does not have the highest fees; it merely raised fees to the level of those of all other state governments. There is not one vacant seat, not one spare spot, in Mount Druitt TAFE—and not one in any of the other TAFEs in the Western Sydney Institute. The state government of New South Wales increased fees by 300 per cent—which I did not appreciate, did not approve of—but, to be fair, it has the highest levels of exemptions, where students pay no fees, of any state. That is the sort of information you never get from the minister for education.
What an interesting debate this is. Here we have the minister for education, a former chairman of a parliamentary committee—I might say it is one of the committees that I once chaired in an earlier life; I am very fond of this committee and very proud of its work—with a good report, and I think he did a good job when he was chairman. He did not finished the report; that was left to the honourable member for Macquarie, and I think he did  a very good job. I commend the committee for the work it has done in its report Boys: getting it right. The committee highlighted that we need to do things. I have gone through the report of the committee that the minister for education was the former chairman of and I cannot find one recommendation that says that we need to make amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act.
I want to point out that I am not trying to be unfair to Dr Nelson, the minister for education—he was not the chairman when the report was finalised; the inquiry went over two parliaments—but doesn't he talk to the member for Macquarie? Is there a huge rift between the chairman of the committee and the minister for education such that there is no recommendation in this report about sex discrimination? We have got Aussies cafe here. We could have organised for them to have a little talkfest there. If this was the crucial change required, why was it not in the report of the committee that the minister himself chaired? That shows you how absurd the debate about this legislation is.
It comes as no news that the Prime Minister is on the back foot with the change of leadership in the Labor Party, and this issue was seized upon. The Catholic Education Office approached HREOC, wanting to offer 12—I repeat: 12—scholarships for male teachers, and HREOC at that stage had not given approval. So what does the Prime Minister do? He says, `We'll wedge the Labor Party.' Forget the substantial issues that are in this report, forget the fact that changing the antidiscrimination legislation is not in this report: `We'll fix them. We'll put the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party on the back foot on this issue. We'll get in good with the Catholic Education Office in every state. We'll bring down legislation which the Labor Party is bound to oppose.' There are tens of thousands of teachers at public and private primary schools and tens of thousands of teachers in public and private high schools, and this bill is all about 12 scholarships! What has happened? The Catholic Education Office have withdrawn their application. They have submitted another one, and now they are proposing 12 scholarships for males and 12 scholarships for females. So the very thing that allegedly triggered the Prime Minister's concern, that was the catalyst for all the outpouring of emotion from the government benches, is now null and void.
I might say that the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward—a wonderful person with excellent Liberal Party credentials, fulfilling her office, I think, to the letter of the law—is opposed to this legislation. She sees it as unnecessary. I agree with her. I would invite my learned colleague the minister for education to, when he makes a contribution on this bill, explain to me where in this excellent report there is a need to amend the Sex Discrimination Act.
It is a good thing to have more male teachers. At the end of the day as a society the way we credential occupations is by the way we pay them. If we think that teachers are crucial to our society then the way we remunerate them will be a function of the level of seriousness about that issue. If you go to a country like Japan, where education is seen as paramount, you find that their teachers' salaries are significantly higher than ours. I am in favour of increasing salaries for teachers. It would cost a lot, particularly for state governments—it is a huge burden on their budget—but I think we need to find a way to do it. In fact, that would facilitate a lot of males electing to become, in particular, primary school teachers.
We do have a number of other problems, including the three that have been repeated time after time in this debate—the pay, which I mentioned, the lack of a career path and child protection issues. The latter is very important. The nation has been horrified by the unravelling of paedophilia—and I do not think any state is immune from it—within the teaching profession. We have taken measures to address it, but it does put people in a very difficult position. For example, I have a very bad habit when I am in schools, particularly primary schools, of wanting to put my arm around the schoolchildren. Teachers are not allowed to do that. I am not saying that we should be in any way soft, but we should have a sensible review, just to make sure that the guidelines that are in place are effective. That, of course, is always worth while. We should ask whether the guidelines are too hard and whether they can in any way be relaxed without increasing any potential risk to children.
One of the issues that I do not think is in the report—and I could stand corrected—is the different way people now enter into the teaching profession. The system in the public sector used to be that a department would determine what its intake would be for a given year, it would offer scholarships—often bonded scholarships—and those people would then be guaranteed a place as a teacher. But it is very different now. When people decide to enter the profession of teaching, a very small number are guaranteed placement by the department at the time they graduate. So people embrace casual work and go from school to school until they can finally be placed on a permanent basis in a school. That can take quite some time. It can be in excess of 12 months before they are employed full-time in their chosen profession. That is a great hindrance. It is a big negative to people entering the profession, and I think we need to revisit it.
We are all subject to our prejudices and pet approaches, and I certainly have one in relation to the teaching profession—that is, I believe that there are insufficient adult recruits into teaching. The teaching profession is a very important one, but we do not make it easy for those people who started off going in another direction and at a mature age have decided: `This is what I would like to do; this is where I feel I can make a career.' Mr Deputy Speaker, you would know only too well that the armed services does not only recruit officers at the base entry level—the youngest recruits. There is a significant stream of people who have already had occupations outside the defence forces that come in for officer training—yes, in specialities, but also in general areas—so you get adult recruitment into the armed forces.
I admire the people in the audience. The gallery should really be full. Never have we had such a long debate with so much emotion and such feelings of sincerity and difficulty about an important problem in society that at the end of the day is all about 12 scholarships. I apologise, I should have worked out what those 12 scholarships represent as a percentage of those employed in the teaching profession, but it would not be great. It could be missed on the radar.
I should also respond to a comment made by the member for Indi that people on the Labor side have been captured by the old guard feminists in the Labor Party. That is the first time that accusation has ever been made about me, and I am going to wear it like a real badge of honour. I think it is really great. I usually get comments in the other direction.
—You old feminist, you.
—I am getting soft and cuddly in my old age.
—Not just in your old age.
—Of course not; we would not be ageist. The issues surrounding improving boys' education are critical. In my electorate, as I said, we have been a crucible for reform in education, with the university, the first ever senior public high school and now a senior high school for Mount Druitt—and the list goes on. There is another big problem, particularly in my state, of the lack of what I would call appropriate vocational opportunities, particularly for boys. I think that we could transform year 11 and 12 for those boys who see the world of work as their destination if we gave them vocational education that would almost guarantee them a job. I make no apologies for saying, when we were arguing about what Chifley college would and would not deliver, that I wanted to push the envelope in this direction. I was not successful. You do not always win first up, as I have learned, but that is to come.
We as a nation—it is one of the most sacred responsibilities, I think, of any government, state or federal—need to develop the potential of our young people. Whatever their potential, they should have the opportunity to develop it to the maximum extent possible. Things like this bill today are just a scam and a farce. The bill is indicative of a Prime Minister on the back foot, grappling with great difficulty with a new Leader of the Opposition, seizing on his old politics of `another wedge opportunity with the Labor Party' and then having HREOC pull the rug from under him because the matter is settled. The legislation is irrelevant. There will be 24 scholarships: 12 for men and 12 for women.
As the Boys: getting it right report says, if you want more male teachers then offer HECS-free university places for teachers and you will attract more into the profession. Even if it is merit based, you will attract more into the profession. This is a report that the minister for education, as a former committee chairman and in his capacity as education minister, should be proud of, but he should not deviate from it. There is no need to; it is a comprehensive report. For the life of me, if you want to deviate, please explain why. Please explain why in this final report there is nothing about the Sex Discrimination Act. We reject this bill for the rubbish that it is. We reject this for the wedge that it is. We on the opposition side are into solutions. We want measures that really address the issues at hand, particularly in boys' education. This bill is nothing more than a sideshow and it is rejected by the opposition.",REPS,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Smith, Anthony, MP",LP,2004-03-24,"—What we have just heard from the previous speaker, the member for Chifley, and all those before him on the other side of the House is confirmation that, whilst the Labor Party are quite able to identify a problem, they have no solution. The member for Chifley tells us that the entire problem of male teachers revolves around an imbalance of 12 teachers, whereas we have known for a long time that there is a huge problem due to the shortage of teachers. We know that because the member for Chifley's own leader has identified it; we know that because many politicians and educational experts have identified the problem. The Labor Party's solution is to do nothing—to look at the problem and do nothing.
The Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 seeks to deliver a practical solution to a problem that has arisen in our schools over a considerable period. This bill, which amends the Sex Discrimination Act, allows for important changes in the way teachers are recruited and encouraged to remain in the profession that is so critical to our nation's future. Most constituents I talk to instinctively understand the important role they play as parents and seek to ensure that their children have every possible opportunity to have the best education that can be provided. They do all that is in their power, providing out of hours assistance to the school, such as at school fetes and working bees—anything they can do—to make sure that their kids receive the best possible education. They know only too well the significant responsibilities they face in raising their kids as their kids become teenagers and as they grow into adulthood.
From discussions I had at the start of this school year at many schools across the Casey electorate, it is clear that parents do not like to be lectured. They do not like to be preached to by governments, opposition politicians or the media. They fully understand their responsibilities and know how to raise their children. The last things parents want to hear are glib statements that signal to them that as parents they do not know what they are doing or that they could do things differently. What is also clear is that parents have a deep understanding of the education system and a deep understanding of some of the problems and that, when they identify problems, they want to see them addressed in a sensible and pragmatic way. That is why our government is introducing this bill—specifically, to address a well-known and growing deficiency in our state schools.
The Minister for Education, Science and Training has highlighted some disturbing trends in the education of boys. Studies and reports that previous speakers on this side of the House have identified have demonstrated that the education outcomes for boys are falling behind the outcomes for girls. Boys on average are achieving at significantly lower levels than girls across all areas of both primary and secondary education and right across Australia. Part of the problem is the significant imbalance in the number of male and female teachers, which this bill seeks to address.
As the minister has said, the figures speak for themselves. It is worth looking at the core statistics, the statistical outcomes for Australian schools, to see the gravity of the problem. Just under 21 per cent of primary school teachers today are men. Last year, men constituted 24 per cent of the more than 55,000 domestic students enrolled in teaching courses across Australia. Men made up just under 19 per cent—18.8 per cent—of those training to become primary school teachers and just 3.6 per cent of those training to become kindergarten or preschool teachers.
It is clear for a range of reasons that young men are not attracted to a teaching career, but we all know that male role models and having that critical balance of male and female teachers is very important, especially for boys. It is fair to say that male classroom teachers add to and complement the role played by fathers, and many speakers of this side of the House have highlighted that. For boys growing up in single parent families, which unfortunately is a growing trend in our society, without significant contact with their fathers or, for that matter, other male family members, the time spent with male teachers is particularly crucial to their development.
The Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister in particular and others on this side of the chamber have a long record of and commitment to developing and delivering family policies that have a sensible, pragmatic and tangible outcome for parents. I would be the first to admit that concern over these disturbing educational trends has not just been from this side of the House; there has been concern from all members of this place, particularly about the lack of male mentoring. In that regard, the Leader of the Opposition has made something of a feature of this problem in his earliest days in his new job, but it has to be noted that rhetoric without practical solutions will be seen for what it is.
The parents of Australia want action, not rhetoric. They can diagnose the problem as easily as anyone else can; what they cannot do is solve it on their own. The rhetoric of the Leader of the Opposition counts for naught if he is not prepared to back it with action. That is what we are seeing from him and from every other member on the other side of the House. The parents of Australia will not fall for this. They know that empty words just spluttered out at random to grab a cheap headline during a National Press Club speech or on a school visit amount to nothing other than an attempt to gain some political attention. In contrast, on this side of the House the federal government is committed to displaying national leadership through straightforward, practical solutions to this and related educational issues. That is what this amendment is about: we are backing words with action—and concrete action.
This amendment is part of a broader educational agenda in that vein. Whilst not directly running schools or employing classroom teachers—as the previous speaker pointed out, that is a state responsibility—nevertheless the federal government seeks to encourage young Australians to take on key roles in our nation's schools. We want more males to train and work as professional educators. This bill amends the Sex Discrimination Act to provide that scholarships may be offered to people of a particular gender in respect of their participation in a teaching course. I think this is an important point. The bill as drafted does not refer only to males; it is gender neutral, meaning that the operation of proposed section 38A of the act in future will allow discrimination in favour of females if we ever reach a situation where that imbalance is reversed.
As previous speakers have said, this bill has arisen out of a very well-publicised practical difficulty the Catholic Education Office has recently had in attracting male teachers. The fact that there has been something of a resolution in recent days does not in any way lessen the need to deal with the wider problem. Those earlier statistics tell the story. Contrary to the recent assertions by those opposite, the minister for education and the former and current attorneys-general have been working on this issue for a considerable period of time. The legislation is not a short-term fix dreamed up just to gain some advantage, as those opposite suggest; it is part of a much broader educational agenda.
We want schools to offer a well-developed curriculum that addresses all the key requirements, including literacy and numeracy, and gives encouragement and opportunities to students. We recognise that parents want choice as to where they send their kids. As taxpayers, they deserve government assistance to help send their kids to an independent school, if that is their choice. An example of this commitment is found in our recently announced funding package.
In the Casey electorate and in the Yarra Valley particularly, one federal government program that focused on the educational needs of boys took place throughout 2003. A cluster of schools in the Yarra Valley were part of the innovative Boys' Education Lighthouse Schools Program. Seville Primary School and others in the region through this program were able to initiate activities that promoted relationship building and increased understanding between grade 5 and 6 boys and their fathers. Through a camp and other specially designed activities the bonds between sons and dads were strengthened. Like the need for additional male teachers, this lighthouse program is seeking to ensure that young people experience strong and well-rounded relationships.
Labor and the Greens, I have to say, have dismissed this bill—they will vote against it—but, as I said earlier, Australians know that talk without action just represents empty words, not solutions. While the Howard government is providing national leadership in the key areas of education, the states also have to face up to their responsibilities. The states employ by far the largest number of teachers across Australia. It is the states that determine teachers' salaries, the parameters of their career progression, their professional development and other employment related conditions.
State governments, such as the Bracks Labor government in my home state of Victoria, must also take responsibility for sorting out this problem. From my interaction, it is clear that families and local communities know what they want from their local schools. As I indicated earlier, they will be very disappointed with the position of not just the opposition but also the Greens on this bill, who as usual are offering little substance. The Greens' opposition, together with that of the Labor Party, in practical terms seeks to have the effect of preserving the current inadequate situation and, more than that, preventing improvement. While the government seeks to get more male teachers into schools through a practical solution, it will not be lost on the parents of Australia that the Labor Party and the Greens are standing in the way.
In the Senate there will soon be a repeat of the recent debate over the MedicarePlus legislation, when Labor and the Greens opposed the introduction of sensible measures just for the sake of opposition. They defaulted on taking a positive approach and, in doing so, left it to the government and the four Independent senators to negotiate the framework of that policy.
My constituents have made it clear that they want governments to act responsibly and in their best interests—and they want action, not words. This legislation represents action that is understood and that will have a real impact in starting to reverse the decline we have seen develop over many years. We all recognise that it will not solve the problem overnight; rather, it is a positive mechanism to start to reverse the trend and to solve the problem into the future to ensure that our kids get the best possible education. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2004-03-24,"—If there is such a crisis in the male teaching profession and, indeed, in the position of young males in our society, I wonder where the Minister for Education, Science and Training is while we debate the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004.
I would like to put on the record some of the statistics that I have noticed over a long career that included teaching and teacher training. In 1964-65, I went to Alexander Mackie College in Sydney as a primary trained teacher, and I was in a group of 12 young men and 60 women. While that had various social advantages, as one could understand, it underlined the fact that, even in those days, the attraction of primary school teaching was predominantly one for young women. I have observed over the years that nothing much has changed. The number of males in primary teaching has not changed dramatically over the years. Indeed, infants teaching has always been exclusively a job for young women entering the teaching profession. We have seen women retiring after having been infants teachers. I saw an article in the paper today which stated that older teachers are being treated as premium products—as they should be—because of their experience, not because they are burnt out. There are teachers who have been in the profession for many years, have contributed a lot and continue to contribute, particularly in the infants sector, which I believe is the most creative, difficult and important area of teaching, along with preschool teaching, followed by primary teaching and, to a lesser degree, secondary teaching.
If you look at the figures that have been prepared for me by the Parliamentary Library you can see that, in August 1996, 46 per cent of secondary teachers were male; in November 2003, 45.2 per cent of secondary teachers were male. So there is not such a critical difference in the number of male teachers in the secondary sector. When we look at the primary sector we see that in 1996 19.2 per cent of teachers were male. The figure is now 17.5 per cent. That is the area where there is a gradually diminishing number of male teachers. I dispute the idea that by meddling with the Sex Discrimination Act we begin to address this problem in any real way. As others have said—and as I have noticed over many years, with my sisters and brothers also teaching—the issues that are most important today in teaching are pay, career structure and the status of teaching in the general community. The status is not particularly high, when I believe it should be the highest of professions.
Child protection concerns have turned some young men off the profession. We can no longer offer the comforting hug that we would have given in earlier days to a small child who may have fallen over in the playground. More and more these days that child comes from a dysfunctional family background and is in great need of the sort of nurturing and care that the teacher can provide. So how do we attend to those things while making teaching an attractive proposition for young men? I do not think we do it by amending the Sex Discrimination Act. I think that, as we have more and more emphasis on males in particular chasing the big dollars, and as peer pressure is applied to them in their senior school years by their male friends, there is a macho aura built around some careers compared with a career like teaching. I think those perceptions are hugely important—as is the perception that a university education is the be-all and end-all when in fact we should be concentrating far more of our resources and our school careers advisers into channelling young people into the TAFE stream and into vocational training that can offer less stressful and far more satisfying outcomes than the wrong route, in many cases, of a university education.
It is in areas like those where I think that young men are getting the wrong message about teaching, and the wrong messages are being emphasised by the media and by many of us when we speak out about the parlous conditions that have existed in some areas of the public education system and in the poorer areas of the Catholic school sector over the years. I think that we all contribute to a negative perception of teaching, when it should be, and could again be, the highest of career aspirations for a young person, male or female.
When I was a trainee teacher I went to stay with some friends down in the Camden area who were Italian-born farmers. My friend introduced me to them. I was only a trainee teacher but they embraced me and I think the term they used was `el maestro, el maestro'—`the master, the master'. I was of huge importance in the Italian community. I do not know whether that perception of teaching still holds in Italy these days. I sense that perhaps it does. There is a sense of the value of the teacher as a crucial part of the whole family structure, particularly in societies that value extended families and can see that an important part of the child's upbringing is their associations not only with the teacher but also in the home.
When we look at amending the Sex Discrimination Act, we make some pretty fundamental blunders. The Catholic Education Office has shown in its negotiations with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission that it recognises the need for amendments to the legislation to enable it offer 12 more scholarships. It realises now that the solution reached within the processes that already exist was a quite satisfactory outcome. On the commission's web site Ms Pru Goward said:
I am pleased that the Catholic Education Office recognises that this scholarship scheme alone will not attract more men into teaching. We need to focus on offering better conditions for teachers across the board, as well as promoting teaching as an attractive profession for men.
As I said, that is the key point. Are we also going to change the act to address, as Ms Goward asks, why only eight per cent of directors in Australia's top 200 companies are women and why women are also underrepresented in the judiciary and in other professions? We could open up a Pandora's box of claims for add-on amendments to this process. But it is a nonsense when we have a system that has delivered a 12-12 outcome in this case, with no abuse of the discrimination requirements of the legislation, and that has achieved a perfect outcome. The Catholic Education Office did not seek any change to the act. It was purely an exemption under the existing law, and that has been achieved by the existing processes.
The report that has been referred to many times in debate in this parliament, Boys: getting it right, and the Trent and Slade report of declining rates of achievement and retention firmly demonstrate that the most important thing in the education of boys is that they have good teachers. It is good teaching styles, assessment and curriculum that make a difference to students. Indeed, that was reinforced in the national press today, which noted the opinion of students about their teachers. Students want and appreciate teachers who know their stuff and can give them good advice and sound knowledge, particularly in senior school. They do not seem to care whether it is a man or a woman, provided the quality of the teacher is sufficient.
That brings us to another area of teacher intake. I have been horrified by some of the TERs that have been accepted over recent years. It is as if the teacher intake has been forced down by the premium placed on other careers in the scramble for positions in law, commerce and positions that the male students, over recent times—in the individualistic, materialistic last 20 years—have deemed to be the most rewarding. The demand has been such that those courses are the ones that have attracted the highest TER requirements, and we have seen teaching slip further and further down the scale to the point where scores of around 48 are accepted for general primary teaching.
I am not questioning the ability of some of these students to improve their marks at later stages as they enter the reality of adult education, but, heavens above, we should be setting a standard for the intake of teacher trainees that reflects the rigour and the requirements necessary to deliver a teacher product that not only is the creme de la creme of the academic environment but also has the skills and ability to take on the philosophy, the psychology and all of the other elements that are required to produce an all-round teacher. That is an area that we should look at to elevate the image of teaching and to attract the best possible recruit. Once we have done that, we send a signal to young people that teaching is valued. Along with that, we should have salary scales that are within the range of those we offer to some of the less productive, but more lucrative, careers in our economy, such as those in the banking and commercial sector like screen jockeying, futures market trading and so on. We are talking about educating young people to be the teachers of the doctors, lawyers, surgeons and teachers of the future, and it is they who must be the creme de la creme of university intakes. 
It is important that we do not find a simplistic answer to the problem of the breakdown of families by getting more teachers into the primary school sector. We have never had male teachers in any significant number in primary schools. It has been an asterisk on the statistics in the infant sector, yet the crucial infant and preschool sector are regarded by all educationalists as the key areas in which we make an impact on a child's psyche—their understanding, their values and all of those things that they will take forth into their primary, secondary, tertiary and adult life.
We are talking about more male teachers. No-one has mentioned the need to have male role models and teachers in the infant sector, and maybe that is something we could look at. But I wonder how macho and sexy preschool teaching might be for a young man. It should be valued but I think that, in the football-idolising society we have in this country, we would battle to persuade young men that it is an area that should be pursued. Yet I suggest that we as leaders should look very seriously at encouraging more men into that area—not by amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act but by positive messages, proper salary ranges and an elevation of the TERs required before we take people into training.
The number of school principals by gender is in almost directly opposite proportion to the statistics about male teachers. For primary schools, males make up 61 per cent of the principals. For secondary schools, it is 72.5 per cent and, for all schools, it is 63.1 per cent. I would suggest that this skewing reflects not the capability of the individuals involved but a male psyche in the education administration system that has filtered down over the years from our ministers—the lack of women in politics—and the heads of departments. The regional administrators, in my memory, have until very recent times nearly always been male, and that has flowed through from the old days of the inspectors. They were nearly always men, to my knowledge. Here, again, we have headmaster numbers reflecting that.
We need to look at keeping all the best teachers in the classroom, not elevating them to administrative roles and wasting their teaching talents. We need to make teaching an attractive profession and use and reward their skills in the classroom for as long as we possibly can. I would suggest that instead of putting our energy into this fruitless legislation we put it into looking at things like a degree in educational administration. We could train people in the administrative part of education—the running of school budgets and so on—and make classroom teaching an equally valuable profession, right up until retirement age. I think of my brother, who retired recently as a science master. He said that he wished he had spent far more years in the classroom than he was able to, but the pressures were to move into an administrative role.
There is an average salary of $65,000 or thereabouts in New South Wales government schools. Is this the value we place on teachers? Compare that to the money we pay out for corporate positions or to plumbers—important as they are—coalminers or members of parliament. Do we really need to go much further to find the reasons why teaching is not a particularly attractive proposition, particularly for men?
To wind up, I will quote briefly from Janet Albrechtsen, who is usually a fan of this government. She said today:
The Federal Government may just have fired the opening shot in an affirmative-action arms race. Introducing exemptions to sex discrimination laws to allow special scholarships for male teachers reeks of special privileges based on something other than merit.
She went on to say that men-only scholarships will change none of the problems causing the lack of male teachers. This situation does not need an amendment. Otherwise, we might have police profession, political profession, sex industry profession or defence force profession amendments to this act in the years and months ahead. It has been shown that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Catholic school sector can work this out, as can others who want to seek special exemption. This might be designed to wedge the opposition. There may be some perceived electoral advantage; I do not know. But I do know that this bill is not necessary and is a gross waste of this parliament's time.",REPS,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Barresi, Phillip, MP",LP,2004-03-24,"—The Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 brings to point an issue that is important to all Australians, particularly young families and the youngest members of our society. I take issue with the member for Calare: this bill is not a waste of time for this parliament. In fact, this is a debate that we must have in this nation, and I am pleased to see that this bill and the amendments highlight the problem that our young people are facing. I am referring to the falling proportion of male teachers in Australian schools and its adverse effect on the education of boys. This bill also highlights the shallowness of the Leader of the Opposition's concerns about the decrease in masculinity in Australia. It highlights that the ladder of opportunity he talks about is riddled with termites. It is hollow and has no substance. This bill allows the Leader of the Opposition and members on the other side to put some substance to their talk, rather than constantly talking and not acting.
We have heard it said before but it is true: the youth of Australia are the building blocks of this country. Like a house, our youth need a solid foundation and require careful nurturing. However, unlike a house, the youth of Australia do not require mortar; they require a steady upbringing. Central to this is a balanced and well-rounded education. I have always maintained—and I am sure that there would be very few who would disagree—that the single most important responsibility that any parent has is to give their children the best possible education within their means.
This bill highlights a driving concern to the government and many in the education community. Over the last decade the proportion of male teachers in schools has fallen quite dramatically. In addition to this, the number of male school leavers entering teaching courses has fallen. A combination of these facts shows that boys in the education system are increasingly missing out on the vital guidance and mentoring that can be offered by a male role model in the classroom.
When we combine the changing demographics in the schoolyard and the high level of marital break-ups, which is approaching 50 per cent, we can see that a real crisis has emerged affecting young boys and girls in our society. This bill seeks to amend the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 by inserting a new provision to redress the gender imbalance in teaching if it arises. The bill establishes that scholarships may be offered to specific persons of a particular gender with regard to enrolment in teaching courses and provides practical assistance to education authorities and others within the teaching profession. The initiative of providing scholarships targeted towards male students will encourage more men into teaching as their career of choice.
At face value those on the other side of this chamber argue that this bill flies in the face of the government's notable resistance to affirmative action measures. These arguments, however, miss the critical point that this proposed amendment is gender neutral. If need be, the amendment would allow for discrimination in favour of females if a gender imbalance occurred either generally, regionally or within a particular teaching sector.
Let us put the size of the problem into perspective and go through some of the demographic changes which have taken place in the past decade. We know that the proportion of male school teachers has declined at an alarming rate. In 1992, 25.8 per cent of primary school teachers were male. Additionally, men accounted for 49.4 per cent of teachers. So a quarter of primary school teachers and almost 50 per cent of teachers in secondary schools were male. But by 2003, a decade later, these figures had fallen to only 20.9 per cent of teachers in primary schools and 44 per cent in secondary schools being male. I would say that most males in the primary schools would be in very senior positions such as principals and vice-principals.
This damning appraisal of teaching numbers is further compounded when teaching places at higher education institutions are taken into account. In 2003, only 18.8 per cent of students training to become primary school teachers were male. That is a drop from the current 20 per cent, and a drop from the 25 per cent back in 1992. There are fewer males going into teaching courses. When we view this in the context of our youngest children, the figures are even more pessimistic. Of over 7,000 students training to become teachers in the early childhood sector, a mere 3.6 per cent are male.
An additional male employment opportunity is not the essential focus of this bill and, although I welcome the prospect of more men entering the teaching profession, we cannot lose sight of the fact that early childhood development, particularly in boys, is the key focus of this amendment. The decline in male role models is detrimental to the social development of young boys. Evidence shows that, on average, boys are achieving at a rate significantly lower than that of girls in all areas of the assessed cognitive curriculum. There are various theories as to why this is so and one of those theories is the lack of male teachers. This applies to boys from early primary to late secondary levels. Across all sectors boys are suffering from a lack of male educational role models in the vital early development years.
I would like to bring the attention of the House to the dispersion of teaching places in my home state of Victoria. The Australian Bureau of Statistics publication Schools Australia 2003 found that, of the 27,900 teachers in Victorian primary schools, only approximately 5,600 are male. When compared to the student figures from the 2002 mid-year census, this results in 81 students for every male primary school teacher. The figures alone do not illustrate this problem. As the father of three children, I can personally testify that my two eldest children did not have a male teacher until they reached grade 6—and an excellent teacher he is. This is in no way meant to be a reflection on the teachers they had in the preceding years. They had teachers who provided high-quality teaching in a learning environment that brought out the best in them—all, of course, through the government school system. Examples of this kind highlight the additional responsibility of all adult male family members or family friends to fill the role model void left at school. 
This bill will facilitate bringing the number of male and female teachers in Australia into balance. The incentive provided by targeting scholarships to male school leavers and prospective mature age students will bring educational benefits to Australian children. I am pleased that a practical measure is being taken to redress the imbalance. I implore members on the other side to also consider the obvious benefits of this amendment. The Leader of the Opposition makes noises about a lack of male role models for boys; however, it is the government that is offering practical solutions on this issue, rather than utopian motherhood statements that have no substance but have populist appeal to an unscrutinising media.
This bill complements significant strategies already undertaken by the government to address the challenges of increasing educational outcomes for boys. In its response to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training report, Boys: getting it right, the government established the Australian Government Quality Teacher Program. Through this program we see an allocation of $159 million to the priority area of boys' education. Included in this is $6 million committed to the Boys' Education Lighthouse Schools Program, which seeks to identify best practice in boys' education. I am pleased to see that this program is being run in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Additionally, the quality teacher program has committed another $500,000 towards further research in the area.
I was fortunate enough to sit on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations inquiry into the education of boys in the last parliament. I was pleased to be able to go around Australia and listen to the various examples from teachers, students and academics about the growing disparity between boys' and girls' education. I would like to draw to the attention of the House a submission made to the inquiry by a school in my electorate of Deakin—Southward Boys Grammar School, located in Ringwood; a school that I am proud to have played a small part in getting established back in 1999. It is closely affiliated with Tintern Girls Grammar School, located in Ringwood East and established in 1877.
Tintern school's principal, Mrs Sylvia Walton, made an interesting point in a submission to the inquiry. She referred to an article in the Times Education Supplementabout feminisation within the teaching profession. She told the inquiry:
The education profession is feminised in terms of teachers in classrooms. This has had an effect on both boys and girls. Particularly since the 1960s changes in the Marriage Act, families have changed and as a consequence so has school experience.
Mrs Walton's comments highlighted the rapid growth in the proportion of female teachers within the profession. Additionally, she argued that children require male and female role models within the school environment. In particular, she stated that `boys are particularly in need of strong, energetic male role models'. Most significantly, Mrs Walton reiterated that brain research indicates a correlation between gender and infant, primary and secondary learning. This highlights different patterns in the way that boys and girls recognise difference.
The views of Mrs Sylvia Walton and the Tintern Girls Grammar Board were not mere rhetoric. Mrs Walton, after all, is one of the few teaching professionals in this country to have received national recognition and has achieved the highest possible academic teaching prize that is on offer. In fact, I believe that at that time she was the only person in the education system, outside of tertiary education, to have received that award. She knows what she is talking about. Her experiences and her knowledge are certainly paving the way at Southward Boys Grammar. I trust that her experience and her knowledge will be used to good effect with regard to the plight of boys' education in all schools, whether they be government or non-government schools.
Southward Boys Grammar School was founded on principles of parallel education. This is creating a suitable environment for boys to receive an education modelled on the then 124-year-old Tintern program. Where possible, Southward proposed adapting and modifying the Tintern curriculum to assist boys in their learning, their growth and their development. Central to this, according to Mrs Walton, is assisting boys to `feel equal to and proud of their boyhood and their manhood'. I would have thought that that would be a sentiment that the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa, would have embraced and that he would have realised needed to be addressed—as is being done through this legislation.
The Tintern and Southward submission raised several key points regarding masculinity and education. The tenets behind the development of Tintern and Southward may appear difficult to apply to the issue of male teacher shortage; however, Mrs Walton raised a key point that is of major significance to this debate. With regard to boys' educational needs, she stated:
We have found that some of our older boys have had difficult experiences in their primary schools and therefore they have felt less than adequate because their literacy skills were not formally and properly addressed.
The key to Mrs Walton's statement is boys `feeling less than adequate' when faced with an educational difficulty. It is essential that we as a government and as a community do something to address these problems at a young age. Having an accessible male role model within the school environment is the best means of tackling problems with masculinity in our school system.
The experience at Tintern and Southward champions the value of separate gender education. While this bill does not pay respect to this issue, the male values enshrined in the basis of Southward Boys Grammar do apply to the general education system. Boys learn in a different fashion to girls and react differently to different styles of teaching across different curriculum. It is important to note that this bill in no way degrades or belittles the fantastic contribution of female teachers to the teaching profession. Indeed, the government's recent focus on boys' education is underpinned by the clear statement that men and women are equally good teachers. This is highlighted in the response to the Boys: getting it right report, which stated:
... men and women can be equally good teachers of both boys and girls and the quality of a teacher is more important than his or her gender.
The amendment proposed through this bill to the Sex Discrimination Act is gender neutral. It provides for gender bias in favour of either sex when a gender imbalance is evident.
At present, the only non-legislative measure available for an exemption under the Sex Discrimination Act is to go before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Since being elected in 1996, the Howard government has not amended the act. At present the only legislative exemptions relate to groups such as charities, religious bodies, religious-purpose educational institutions and voluntary organisations. It is important that educational bodies have the option of responding to gender imbalance when the need arises and without the delay of the cumbersome commission process. As has been seen with the Catholic Education Office's application for an exemption, gender imbalance is a genuine issue of concern in the teaching profession and one which requires an across-the-board approach.
It is encouraging to witness some potential for a bipartisan approach to the issue of boys' education. In Western Australia, a range of teaching scholarships are on offer to areas in need. Interestingly enough, male primary teachers are one of these six areas. However, as a party, the Labor members on the opposite side of this chamber appear to hold a steadfast resistance to doing something tangible and addressing the shortfall. After all of his talk about male role models for boys, I find it preposterous that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Latham, has been critical of this amendment bill.
Clearly, the central concern of this bill is the educational outcome for children, particularly young boys. We cannot lose sight of that and we cannot lose sight of the fact that figures show that gender imbalance in teaching is growing. It is important for all of us in this chamber to recognise the changes that are taking place in the schoolyard. It is important for us to put our minds to addressing the imbalances that are taking place. It is for these reasons that I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—I am pleased to be able to speak on the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 but, frankly, I wonder why we are debating it. There is absolutely no doubt that this bill is unnecessary. The government claims that the bill facilitates measures to address the problem of an imbalance in the numbers of male and female schoolteachers and the particular effect of that imbalance on the educational outcomes for male students. The government refers to the House of Representatives report Boys: getting it right as part of the reason for taking that action. Labor will be opposing this bill because we think it is absolutely unnecessary.
It is worth while to briefly put this bill in context. In August 2002, the Catholic Education Office in Sydney applied for an exemption under section 44 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 in order to offer 12 teacher training scholarships to male HSC students. The application was considered by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. On 23 February 2004, the commission declined to grant the exemption. The Catholic Education Office was in the process of appealing this decision to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and a hearing was set for April this year. Not only has the government pre-empted this process by introducing this piece of legislation but there are previous examples where amendments have been made to the Sex Discrimination Act in response to reports by HREOC. In one case, a report was delivered by HREOC in June 1999 and the government response was delivered in November 2000, some 17 months later—not a month or six weeks later but 17 months later. The bill to effect the change was not introduced until February 2002 and was assented to in October 2003. It took four years for the legislative response to be pursued.
We know that this Prime Minister and this government are no fans of HREOC and no fans, really, of the Sex Discrimination Act. Yet they have sought to intervene in this process—in this instance, in the midst of a process that was going to be heard as an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal—purely and simply for crude political purposes. With the Leader of the Opposition talking about the need to have greater recognition for boys in education, the Prime Minister, looking for some sort of issue to create yet another wedge in Australian politics, decided that this was an opportunity to wedge the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party by seeking to amend the Sex Discrimination Act to discriminate in favour of scholarships for boys—and there were only 12 scholarships—to satisfy the needs of the Catholic Education Office in Sydney.
I do not know what the Prime Minister thinks we are, but we are not fools. We might be a lot of things, but we are not fools and we are not silly; neither is the Australian community. The Australian community understands exactly what this is about. We know that the Catholic Education Office had not requested that the government take this action. In fact, they had not been advised of it; they were not involved in the decision to do it. It came as a surprise to them. The director of schools for the Sydney Archdiocese, Brother Kelvin Canavan, has said: `We had not asked Canberra to do anything. I was taken quite by surprise by their announcement.'
We need to put this is in the context of the report, which the government says it has referred to in the context of these propositions. Having read this report, I think it is quite good. It has a number of important recommendations. One of those is recommendation 20, which is significant in the context of this discussion. It states:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth provide a substantial number of HECS-free scholarships for equal numbers of males and females to undertake teacher training. These would be based on merit and take into account other admission criteria developed in line with Recommendation 19.
The scholarships would operate as a rebate of the HECS liability while the recipients were employed by a recognised teaching authority.
I would have thought it was not a bad idea to open up the field and offer a series of scholarships. Of course, after negotiations with the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, that is exactly what the Catholic Education Office in Sydney has done: it has offered scholarships to males and females. Yet the government has rejected that proposition on the grounds that other means of achieving the objective of this recommendation should be explored.
The objective of the recommendations of the House of Representatives report Boys: getting it right is based on the reasoning that more male teachers are needed because of the importance of providing good role models to boys. Boys: getting it right also argues that women and men can be equally good teachers of both boys and girls and that the quality of a teacher is more important than his or her gender. The government is sympathetic to this line of reasoning; however, it rejects the proposed Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) free scholarship mechanism for a number of reasons.
I ask you: if the government were fair dinkum, why would it reject a proposition which would provide an equal number of scholarships to male and females in particular recognition of the need to have more male teachers? It is instructive to know why the government has responded in this way. It has said:
It is likely to have little impact on the gender balance among teachers in schools because such scholarships would inevitably be limited in number and many would probably go to students, whether male or female, already committed to teaching.
What has changed? But all of a sudden it has to change the Sex Discrimination Act to provide for 12 only-male scholarships for the Catholic Education Office in Sydney. How bizarre. We know what this is about. As I have said earlier, this is about a wedge—and not a very sophisticated one at that. 
The government also say that the evidence suggests that HECS is not a major determinant in student choices and that such scholarships would set an undesirable precedent, as the same principle could be applied to many university courses that have unequal gender representation. What is going on here? What is the logic of this position? On the one hand they argue that we should not be doing it because there are other courses which will have unequal gender representation and we might have to do something about them; then they have the temerity to come into this chamber and say that we, the Labor Party, are weak on the issue of boys in education because we will not give the government the right to amend the Sex Discrimination Act in favour of 12 scholarships for male teachers in Sydney.
—It's a drop in the bucket.
—Not only is it a drop in the bucket; it is absolutely asinine. We have the minister for education—who is unfortunately not in the chamber to respond to this—trying to convince the Australian community that somehow this is a massive step in changing the way in which boys are taught and the outcomes for males in the education system. How fundamentally stupid. It is a stupid proposition which will be opposed by the Labor Party.
We all know—and I think it is one of the interesting aspects of the debate that is occurring around this piece of legislation—that both sides of the chamber recognise there is an important issue at stake here. And it is not these scholarships; it is not the stupidity and crass nature of the attempt by the government at political intervention, the attempt by the government, as it has done historically, at wedging—a wedge which commonsense says that the Australian community will see as a wedge. They know that this issue is a lot broader than 12 scholarships for men in the education system of New South Wales. The report Boys: getting it right is a very good document for seeing just how silly the government is. As I have said, had they actually been fair dinkum, they would have accepted this recommendation 20, which I spoke about earlier.
By doing this and being preoccupied with its agenda to shift resources to well-established private schools at the expense of the sector in general, the government has ignored the problem. The government is failing to realise fully the impact the lack of male teachers is having on the culture of our schools and the wider community in general. What is required on this issue is leadership and proactivity and a realisation that this issue is an opportunity to address the wider community concern about the role of males and why there should be more male teachers in our primary and secondary schools. We need to take stock of the fundamental changes that have happened in our schools over the past 30 years. If we document those changes, we might appreciate what is going on—and I do not think this minister or the government have even thought about it.
I entered the education system as a teacher almost 30 years ago. My partner is a teacher and has been teaching for almost that length of time. I am a very keen observer of the changes that have occurred in education. I have a vested interest: we have four children and they are in the education system; they are all at school. So we are very interested in the outcomes of the education system. I was able to work in schools and I was proud to be able to work in schools, as many in this place have been, because it is a noble profession—badly treated but a noble profession. We need to understand that there have been dramatic changes in the workplace. Those changes in the workplace have affected the way in which opportunities arise, not only for male teachers but for teachers generally.
From looking at the data we know that education has become a field where over the last generation women have been far more assertive and have achieved significant results in getting fair and appropriate treatment in the workplace. I might note however, as a previous speaker has already, that the proportion of women in leadership positions in schools is far smaller than the proportion of women as a whole in the teaching profession. One would ask why that is the case and others have addressed that this evening, and I will come back to it shortly if I have time.
But we know that student populations are very different. When I was a young teacher in the seventies and the teaching profession was young, I could see opportunities opening up. We now know that the average age of teachers is in the late 40s. So when young people enter the profession the opportunities that they may have seen once are simply not so close at hand. We have to understand that the sorts of workplace issues to attract people into the education system, to attract teachers, need to be fundamentally addressed—and they have not been.
We need to understand that there is a great deal of work we need to do to provide attractive options for both men and women to enter the education system. We understand the issue of role models. I fully understand it. At the primary school at which my partner teaches and which one of my children still attends, there are around 300 students but there is not one male teacher. That has been the case for some time. That creates its own problems and issues. I know that the women who are teaching at that school are attempting, by very innovative teaching methods, to change the outcomes for the boys who are in that school. They have to do that because noone else will.
We need to be encouraged by the fact that there are professionals within the education system who are attempting to assert themselves in recognising and understanding the particular learning requirements of young boys and are doing what they can to change the way in which boys are treated and taught in schools. But they are not going to do it by treating boys necessarily differently, because it has to be a process which is inclusive. What I think we have learned to our detriment from the past is that, whilst there had to be a focus to improve the outcomes for women in education, at the same time we needed to, in parallel, make sure that we were keeping step with the requirements of young boys in the education system, and unfortunately we failed to do so.
In my view, offering scholarships is not necessarily going to get male teachers to stay in the profession. We have to do something different. We need to give teachers proper recognition and support. They deserve proper consideration and respect. In my view, teachers generally have not been, and are not being, given the respect and consideration they properly deserve. We need to do this for the obvious reason—teachers are dealing with our nation's future and greatest resource. They are providing the promises that we have given: that every child should have the opportunity to achieve to their best ability and that we will give them better than the generation before them received.
I am concerned that this government has not looked at the larger picture. In its crass attempt at creating a political wedge, with its hideous approach to this issue, it has not considered the larger question. It is rushing through legislation in a veiled attempt to cover its incompetence. Boys: getting it right is a very good document. The HECS free scholarship proposal is, as I mentioned earlier, a good way of recognising need and addressing a particular issue. We know that HREOC has commented that it believes the affirmative programs of the type that the government requires should not be used in this context. The government's proposal is both unhelpful and unfair. HREOC has said—and I believe it is true—that even if these schemes were created they would not by themselves address the gender inequity issues. Rather, there is a need to investigate and implement further non-discriminatory strategies, such as have been recommended in the report Boys: getting it right. We need to do something.
We know that since 1991 the proportion of male primary school teachers has declined. In 1991, 26.3 per cent of primary school teachers were male, but in 2001 it was 21.3 per cent. In my own electorate in the Northern Territory, in 1991 the figure was 25 per cent, but it dropped to 18.5 per cent in 2001. These figures become even more startling when you consider the higher proportion of male teachers in leadership positions. We need to do a great deal more to address the needs of male teachers and of teachers generally. We need to give respect to the teaching community—respect which it richly deserves and which has not been afforded to it thus far. We need to do something about addressing the particular needs of boys in education. That is clear. We are not going to do it in a way which will satisfy our requirements, or their requirements and needs, by passing this piece of legislation this evening.",REPS,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—I rise to also oppose the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 and outline concerns I have with the motives of the government in introducing this bill. As many members have said in relation to this matter, this is about playing politics, not enacting good policy. It would appear that the reason the government saw fit to take that option is it is a government that is looking for diversion and distraction; it is a government that is, as the member for Lingiari indicated earlier, looking to divide people on matters and not provide what is required for the education system. 
As we are aware, this matter particularly has been sorted out. As we know, an application was made by the Catholic Education Office for 12 new scholarships, and at the time that was not accepted by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission on the grounds that it was discriminatory. As we also know, last week the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission granted the Catholic Education Office a temporary exemption from the operation of certain provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to offer 24 new scholarships for male and female student teachers in each of the next five academic years. So the fact is, as has been mentioned time and time again in this debate, this is more about playing politics than ensuring good policy. It is about time that the government seriously looks at what are clearly deficiencies in our education system.
There is no doubt—this is the one thing that we seem to be unanimous on—that there are certain areas in our education system where there is a paucity of male teachers. That is unequivocal. That is axiomatic. However, the next point is: how do we deal with it? As someone said earlier in the debate, this bill is like using a sledgehammer to crack an acorn, because it is not really going to bring about what is required in this area. What is required is not 12 male teachers but many hundreds—if not thousands—of male teachers coming into the education system and redressing the imbalance that is there.
I think it is important to note that schools are workplaces. My personal observation is that when you do get, as close as possible, a gender balance in workplaces it makes for a better workplace. We have many industries and workplaces that have a high proportion of one gender or the other. We have certain occupations that attract one gender over the other. That is for historic reasons and sociological reasons, and it is not something that would be resolved overnight. Even if we were to introduce policies, I am sure that they would not ensure a balance in every workplace or in every occupation. But I think, for example, we would be better off if there were more male nurses; we would be better off if there were more female politicians; we would be better off if there were more women in the construction industry. I think there are a lot of arguments we could wage about providing better workplaces and, as a result, ensuring that workers are more productive—and, if you like, workplaces would be more wholesome if we were to attend to some of those areas.
But tonight we are looking at the problems we have in the education system, and we are agreed that there are concerns in this area. But what we see from the government is a bill that would fundamentally alter the principles upon which the Sex Discrimination Act is based, in order to make a political point. As we know, the problem for the government is that the wind has been taken out of their sail. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has granted an exemption for the Catholic Education Office to have 24 new scholarships, which would seem to me to satisfy what was originally the problem. On that basis, the Catholic Education Office has withdrawn its application that was to go before the AAT. You would expect that that would be the end of the matter. If there was a concern raised by a particular group and that concern was satisfied, you would think, therefore, that the government would move on and look at the substantial problems we have in the system, as opposed to running this bill through the chamber in order to play politics. But, unfortunately, it would appear that the government seek to do just that.
I think it is important, therefore, for us to reflect upon some of the segments of the decision by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in order to understand its view. It is not the case, as some have asserted on the other side of the chamber, that the commission did not have regard properly to the application made. In fact, in a lengthy decision the commission paid particular regard to the submissions made by the Catholic Education Office and made a number of points that I would like to refer to. Firstly, it said:
The Commission is of the view that the Exemption Application should be declined on the basis that the granting of that application would be inconsistent with the objects of the Act and unreasonable in that the discriminatory effects that would be caused by the proposed scholarship scheme outweigh the reasons advanced in favour of it ...
Further, the commission indicated:
Based on the evidence ... the Commission's findings on material questions of fact relating to the Exemption Application are as follows.
... A significantly higher number of females than males are employed as primary school teachers—
as we know—
... The reasons for the gender imbalance in the primary teaching profession are many and complex, with the material before the Commission indicating that those reasons include status of teachers in the community, child protection issues and the pay and conditions of primary school teachers relative to other occupations.
In other words, the commission—quite rightly—had regard to broader concerns in relation to this matter. In its decision the commission referred to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training inquiry into boys and education, entitled Boys: getting it right. I think, quite rightly, the commission made its view clear. The commission had regard to a parliamentary committee's long-deliberated concerns about this issue and incorporated into its decision the report handed down by that committee. Unfortunately, this government—the minister and Prime Minister—had little regard for those issues. It would be preferable if, rather than playing politics with this matter, the minister would look at ways to implement some, if not all, of the recommendations outlined in that report. It is a very good report, and it has the unanimous support of members in the chamber. It is something that should be properly considered. This bill is purely to allow the Prime Minister, in particular, to attempt to divide the community; it is a very simplistic and crude implement with which to do so.
It was very interesting to read in the Australian today an article by Ms Janet Albrechtsen—not my favourite journalist—who attacked the government for, as she said, imposing affirmative action. She went on to argue that affirmative action is not the best approach. Whilst I may not agree with the arguments waged by this journalist, they underline the point that the government is introducing, more correctly, positive discrimination to make a political point. I did not think I would see the day when the Prime Minister would look to amend the Sex Discrimination Act in order to allow for positive discrimination towards a particular gender. It shows that the Prime Minister is quite happy to move away from what he says are his fundamental beliefs—ensuring there is no type of affirmative action or even positive discrimination. He is happy to depart from the principles he holds when he thinks he can score a political point by amending this act.
It is also worthy to note some of the comments made by the federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward, on this matter. I think that she was right when she said that there are a `number of programs that can be introduced in conjunction with this scholarship scheme to encourage more men into primary teaching—programs that are not discriminatory under the Sex Discrimination Act'. She went on to say—and I think this is the nub of the matter:
I am pleased that the Catholic Education Office recognises that this scholarship scheme alone will not attract more men into teaching. We need to focus on offering better conditions to teachers across the board, as well as promoting teaching as an attractive profession for men. We need to properly value this important profession ... 
She further added:
... the Commission considers temporary exemptions on a case-by-case basis, but generally does not grant temporary exemptions unless they are appropriate in light of the objects and scheme of the Sex Discrimination Act.
We now know that the commission did grant an exemption and it has provided 24 scholarships for an equal number of male and female teachers to take up. It has effectively fixed the problem—the problem that has been cited in the bill as one to be fixed. The only thing left is the bill, which is now effectively redundant, but it has been introduced into this House for some other motive. We can only conclude that this bill has been introduced into this House for some reason other than fixing up the problem of the 12 scholarships, which was the original basis upon which the minister and Prime Minister argued for its introduction.
The fact that this matter has been resolved lays bare the motives of this government in effectively trying to play wedge politics with a very important matter—one that was properly deliberated upon by government and Labor members in a very significant, comprehensive report which handed down comprehensive recommendations regarding the complexities of this matter. Those recommendations were to redress the imbalance by more than 12 male teachers coming into the system. That is the reality. Instead of looking at and acting upon that report, the minister is playing cheap politics. I think everyone is a loser as a result. Indeed, the education system is not the winner of the games being played by this government. I ask government members and the minister to reconsider playing politics with education by looking to fundamentally alter the Sex Discrimination Act. The government is going down a very dangerous path when it does so.
In conclusion, we understand the basis upon which the bill was introduced. We know that, even if you accept that it was done in good faith to fix up a particular problem raised by the Catholic Education Office, that problem has now been attended to through an amended application accepted by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. This government is pursuing wedge politics, cheap politics, over good policy. I therefore recommend that all members of this House vote against this bill because it does nothing to redress our fundamental concerns: namely, ensuring that we have more male teachers in our education system, particularly at the primary level.",REPS,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2004-03-24,"—in reply—I thank members for their contributions to the debate on the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004. I might thank in particular the member for Gellibrand, but I note that unusually we have had a very long list of speakers and there have been a very significant number of contributors, so I will not thank them individually, although I will point to a number of remarks made during the debate as I reply.
The bill reflects the government's commitment to having high-quality male and female teachers involved in the education of Australian children, to secure the best possible education for Australian children. As it currently stands, the Sex Discrimination Act as interpreted by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission prohibits the offering of scholarships directed specifically at men studying to prepare themselves for teaching. That is a barrier to a practical and sensible option—that is, the offering of scholarships which can help to improve the educational outcomes for our children and in particular address the pressing need to provide a more effective learning environment for boys. I would like to emphasise, however, that the amendment is drafted in gender neutral terms. If a shortage of women teachers emerged in an Australian school sector or even in a specific school, this amendment would allow scholarships for females to redress that imbalance.
The government's concern is about ensuring that there are adequate numbers of men and women teaching in schools in Australia. I would like to address, therefore, a number of points that were raised in the course of the debate. Addressing the special measures option, the member for Gellibrand suggested that scholarships that target men to encourage them into teaching can be offered under the Sex Discrimination Act as it stands. That is not correct. But, if the member for Gellibrand believes that we are simply clarifying something that can already be done under the provisions enacted by Labor, it is hard to understand why she would oppose this amendment.
The honourable member suggested that the special measures provision in the Sex Discrimination Act—namely, section 7D—could be used to offer male scholarships only. The purpose of the special measures provision in the Sex Discrimination Act is to permit measures that address substantive inequality between males and females. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission dismissed this option when it rejected the initial scholarship proposal by the Catholic Education Office. The member for Gellibrand also suggested that the exemption mechanism under the Sex Discrimination Act is available where scholarships for males are proposed. The ultimate resolution of the Catholic Education Office's case shows that the exemption mechanism in section 44 of the act is not a viable alternative if we want to give educational authorities the flexibility to address the shortage of males in teaching.
It took the Catholic Education Office 18 months to obtain an exemption, which in the end was not the exemption it had first sought. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission administers the exemption mechanism and has indicated its opposition to male-only scholarships unless framed in accordance with its preferred approach—that is, coupled with other scholarships for females. The government wants flexibility in this area. It would be ridiculous if every single authority that wanted to offer scholarships for men had to go through this lengthy process with HREOC and were limited in the way in which they could offer such scholarships. Many educational authorities need to be able to take action now on these matters.
The members for Gellibrand and Jagajaga made the obvious point that this bill alone will not solve the shortfall of males in teaching. That is a reasonable assertion, but it is no reason to stand against this useful and sensible measure that can help to address the issue. As the Sex Discrimination Act is within federal jurisdiction and has been shown to be a barrier to scholarships for males, this is an area where we as a federal parliament can act now. The bill complements the existing government initiatives to overcome the educational disadvantage facing boys in schools. For example, the government has committed $6 million to the Boys' Education Lighthouse Schools Program to identify best practice in boys' education, with a further half a million dollars committed to research. This has been funded through the $159.2 million Australian Government Quality Teacher Program.
The member for Jagajaga mounted an argument that men are not discriminated against in entering the teaching profession. The basis for this bill is not that there is discrimination against men in the teaching profession; rather, it is that there are serious barriers to men entering the teaching profession, which include the perception that the profession is not sufficiently valued. Surely the opposition would agree that these barriers exist; they are why there are so few men teaching, especially at the preschool and primary school levels. Most importantly, our concern is with achieving an outcome that will provide better educational outcomes for our children by encouraging more high-quality male teachers into the profession, thereby ensuring that there are male and female role models and teaching styles in our schools.
I would like to address the suggestion put by a number of members of the opposition that this bill is an attack upon the Sex Discrimination Act. Legislative exemptions from the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 are not made lightly. In fact, since the government came to office in 1996, there have been no new exemptions to the Sex Discrimination Act. This is a specific and targeted exemption in gender neutral terms that is based on commonsense to address an identified problem.
The member for Brisbane mounted an argument that this bill will only give rise to 12 scholarships. That reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of this bill. The bill is not about any particular case; it is about opening up a sensible option so that educational authorities wanting to offer scholarships to encourage males into teaching will have that choice open to them. The principle is correct: this option should be open. If government or private school authorities want to address the pressing shortage of males in teaching by offering scholarships, why should they be barred? The opposition's reasoning on this matter is nonsense.
I would like to address the argument put forward by the member for Jagajaga, amongst others, that this bill is no longer necessary because of the agreement reached between the Catholic Education Office and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The exemption from the Sex Discrimination Act granted to the Catholic Education Office in no way renders the government's bill redundant. The bill is not directed at the specific case involving the Catholic Education Office but is framed generally to facilitate measures to address the Australia wide shortage of males in teaching. The Catholic Education Office first sought an exemption from the Sex Discrimination Act on 30 August 2002—that is, more than 18 months ago. The government wants educational authorities to have the option of responding to the pressing shortage of males in teaching without having to contend with long delays or cumbersome processes. The government wants educational authorities to be able to rely on a clearly defined exemption written directly into the Sex Discrimination Act.
I would like to deal with the issue of Western Australian scholarships. The member for Jagajaga sought to explain away the clear inconsistency between the opposition's position on this bill and the approach that has been taken in Western Australia under a Labor government. The Western Australian Department of Education and Training offers a range of scholarships to people completing their final year of a degree leading to a teaching qualification at a Western Australian university. The relevant degrees are a graduate diploma in education, a Bachelor of Education and a Master of Teaching. Each year the Western Australian department identifies areas of need in relation to which scholarships are directed. In 2004, male primary teachers were identified as one of the six areas of need.
The opposition and the Western Australian Labor government's criticisms of the moves by the federal government to increase the number of male primary school teachers is, of course, hypocritical, given that the Western Australian Minister for Education and Training's own department has offered scholarships to enable males completing their degrees at a Western Australian university to obtain teaching qualifications. Although some scholarships were targeted at men and women, some were also specifically targeted towards male primary teachers, to use the minister and his department's own words.
The Western Australian Department of Education and Training scholarships information guide specifically sought applications from people who would qualify as, among other things, mathematics teachers, physical science teachers and male primary teachers. The Western Australian Minister for Education and Training in his own press release of 31 January said:
We have launched a teacher recruitment campaign which includes a combination of targeted scholarships ... 
He went on to say that the campaign:
... also aims to increase the number of male primary teachers ...
It is simply misleading to suggest that scholarships for the area of need of primary male teachers were open to women. It is simply ridiculous when you have male only scholarships to argue that both men and women were eligible for those scholarships—as I think some people have suggested. But that is the opposition's reply to the concern—
—I will, because I have got the statements that are here on the record. The Western Australian Department of Education and Training apparently recognises the need for a sensible and practical strategy to encourage men to enter the primary teaching profession. It is a pity that the Western Australian Labor government and the federal opposition were not so enlightened. The Western Australian government, along with the opposition, lost sight of the importance of this issue for our children and instead are choosing to play politics with our children's futures.
In conclusion—which may surprise some of my colleagues—the shortage of male teachers in schools is a problem recognised by all sides of politics. As my colleague the Minister for Education, Science and Training has pointed out, it will do this country no good if we spend the next decade hand-wringing and clinging to misplaced but well-intentioned ideological purity and produce a generation of young men who are disengaged and disillusioned and who feel ill-prepared for the future. The proportion of male primary school teachers has fallen to 20.9 per cent, and only 18.8 per cent of students training to become primary school teachers are men.
This government is not content to ignore the problem—the education of our children is too important for that, and for that reason I not only commend the bill to the House but table for the information of members two statements. One is the Western Australian Department of Education and Training scholarship information guide. That document makes it very clear that there are scholarships for which the department is seeking applications from people who will qualify—that is, technology and enterprise teachers, Indonesian teachers, special needs education teachers, mathematics teachers, physical science teachers and male primary teachers. It was clearly on their web site in the document that identified areas of need, which makes it abundantly clear that males were entitled to scholarships from the Western Australian government.
I also table the statement from the Western Australian Minister for Education and Training of 31 January 2004, in which he made it very clear that the granting of these scholarships aimed to increase the number of male primary school teachers, because, quite frankly, they had no intention of granting male scholarships to females.
Opposition members interjecting—
—You may go back and seek to get an explanation from those who want to try to avoid any embarrassment to the Labor Party.
Opposition members interjecting—
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—Order!
—If you want to encourage me, I have got another 10 minutes, and then maybe I will ask for some more time. Clearly this is a situation in which the Labor opposition is so embarrassed that it goes off to its colleagues in Western Australia—
—How many quorums do you want tomorrow?
—Order! The member for Melbourne!
—and says, `Please, fellows, get us off the hook by saying that we would have seriously offered male only scholarships and expected females to apply and would have awarded them to females.' I think it makes very clear the political approach that the Labor opposition are taking in relation to this matter and their absolute failure to get the Leader of the Opposition off the hook in relation to the approach that he has taken in arguing for male role models when the Labor Party are quite prepared to oppose any measure that would work to achieve a better outcome.
Question put:

"Sercombe, Bob, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—Last night in the Mural Hall, the Australian Film Commission had a function that was attended by a number of members and people from the film industry. Amongst the most interesting of the people attending the function, from the point of view of the film industry, was Adam Elliot, the director and writer of the recent Australian Oscar-winning animated movie Harvie Krumpet. He was accompanied by the producer of the film, Melanie Coombs.
The function was held in the context of an Australian film industry that is certainly doing it tough, with significant declines over recent times in feature film and TV drama production. It is also true to say that the US free trade agreement is a real, ongoing concern for this particular industry. Australia is a net importer of audiovisual material, with a growing trade deficit reflecting the growth in the use of pay TV and DVDs. The free trade agreement, as proposed, represents a historic concession of Australian policy capacity resulting from negotiations with the world's audiovisual superpower. In this context, the comments of US trade representative Robert Zoellick are very revealing:
In broadcasting and audiovisual services, the FTA contains important and unprecedented provisions to improve market access for US films and television programs over a variety of media including cable, satellite, and the internet. 
The position of Mr Zoellick sits very uncomfortably with the Australian government's claims about protecting Australian culture and ensuring the health and vibrancy of our industry by ensuring that Australian stories with Australian voices for Australian audiences are supported into the future. The industry remains deeply worried about many aspects of the agreement. In the time available, I can only deal very briefly with some of them.
In the provisions for investment under the free trade agreement, tax concessions for investment in Australian cultural activity can be maintained. The problem, however, is that direct federal and state government support for individual film and TV projects is provided not by way of subsidies or grants but by investment in intellectual property. Harvie Krumpet is an interesting case in point. Investments of this kind are subject to restrictions called `performance requirements'—a requirement to achieve a given level or percentage of domestic content cannot be imposed under the agreement. This would preclude the kind of local content test covering subject matter, place of production and postproduction, source of finance, copyright ownership and personnel, which are preconditions of the Australian Film Finance Corporation and AFC investment. This would dramatically and adversely affect Melbourne's Docklands, Sydney's Fox and Warner Roadshow's Gold Coast studio complexes.
A further area of concern for the industry is intellectual property. The agreement extends copyright by 20 years on a wide range of materials. For creators of new works that make use of archival material, such as documentary and web producers, longer copyright terms represent a formidable practical and financial obstacle. Australia's right to introduce local content requirements on new media is tightly limited under the free trade agreement. Problems for the future development of new media capacities in Australia include: firstly, quota style measures cannot be introduced for digitally delivered e-cinema, which is a possible new media development; secondly, in future, Australia material might be technically available online to Australian audiences via servers, but the search engines and electronic guides that are generally used to make viewing or using choices might not readily lead the user to this Australian material; and, thirdly, services directly transmitted from outside Australia without any local presence cannot, under the free trade agreement, have even the limited Australian interest measures used to protect them.
Because of the time involved, I will not deal with the issue of quotas, but similar very serious concerns exist there. A serious concern exists in relation to aspects of the operations of the ABC and SBS. Australia appear to have a quite inadequate deal with the United States. We have not got the concessions that we should have got, particularly in important areas such as agriculture. In the cultural industries, we expose our industries to quite inadequate arrangements, given the rapid rate of technological change in the areas of film and television. The government is producing a situation where there must be serious doubts indeed about our longer term capacity for Australian audiences to be exposed to Australian stories in Australian voices. As noted Australian media academic Jock Givven of Swinburne University says, the free trade agreement `institutionalises much lower aspirations about what level of Australian content in emerging media systems ought to be exposed to the Australian community'.

"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—I rise to speak briefly about the situation facing Indigenous Australians within our society today. There is often much public comment about the circumstances facing Indigenous Australians, and often that comment is characterised by a great deal of ignorance and sensationalism, so I thought I would take some details from a recent story that ran on the wire services, regarding the results of the Australian Bureau of Statistics yearbook for 2004. It points to a range of interesting comparisons regarding the circumstances of Indigenous Australians versus the rest of society.
I will go through some examples. Indigenous Australians tend to die younger, smoke more and earn less than the national average. The average life expectancy of Indigenous men is 56 years versus 77 years for those in general society, and for women it is 63 years versus 82 years. We are also looking at a situation where only three per cent of Indigenous Australians are aged over 65 years, against the national average of 13 per cent. Lifestyle probably affects mortality. Indigenous Australians were more than twice as likely to smoke and were significantly more prone to being overweight or obese. Interestingly, on the other hand, heavy drinking and lack of exercise were around the national average, which, again—certainly on the heavy drinking aspect—tends to fly in the face of popular perceptions.
Indigenous workers earned much less. The estimated one-person household income was $364 a week versus the national average of $585 a week. Their jobs are disproportionately low paying; that is, of course, if they have a job—not to forget that we are talking about an unemployment rate of some 20 per cent versus the national rate of seven per cent, with some 48 per cent not in the labour force versus the national position of some 37 per cent. Education is also a key issue when we look at this area. Indigenous attendance at government schools declined gradually through years 1 to 9 and the decline accelerated through years 10 to 12. Retention rates have risen by 5.9 per cent through secondary schooling over the last five years, through to 2002. This occurred across the nation, except in the Northern Territory, but Indigenous students in higher education in 2002 totalled 8,871—up 2.4 per cent in a year.
Indigenous prisoners, totalling some 4,494, made up 20 per cent of Australia's prison population. They are in prison for mainly short sentences, most commonly for crimes like assault. Only two per cent were sentenced for drug offences. All this points to the fact that there is a range of misconceptions out there in the community about what is actually facing Indigenous Australians and those perceptions need to be addressed. This sort of data does, I think, address some of those issues. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Indigenous Affairs</title>,Statements by Members,25,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2004-03-24,"—I move:
That this bill be now read a second time.
This bill, the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2003, contains amendments to the Australian Crime Commission Act 1987, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 and the Australian Postal Corporations Act 1989.
In April 1992 the Commonwealth and the states and territories agreed to replace the National Crime Authority with a new body with a strong focus on national criminal intelligence needs.
The agreement recognised that serious and organised crime cuts across jurisdictional boundaries and needs to be addressed at a national level.
The new body, the Australian Crime Commission, was established by Commonwealth legislation on 1 January 2003.
Since then practical experience and the drafting of corresponding state legislation have revealed a need for some minor adjustments to the Australian Crime Commission Act.
This bill will address this need so as to ensure there is a fully workable legislative framework in place to enable the Australian Crime Commission to effectively combat serious and organised crime across Australia.
The bill adds provisions to the current legislation to ensure that state laws can more effectively enable the Australian Crime Commission to deal with state offences.
The bill also facilitates an effective transition from the National Crime Authority to the Australian Crime Commission by addressing transitional issues that have arisen since the establishment of the Australian Crime Commission.
The bill demonstrates the continuing commitment of the government to combating serious and organised crime in this country through cooperation with the states and territories.
This legislation has already been through the other place. I am particularly pleased to be able to commend it to the chamber. I present the explanatory memorandum and also a correction to the explanatory memorandum.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN CRIME COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,26,1
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—The Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2003 is not controversial and is fully supported by the opposition. The Australian Crime Commission commenced operations on 1 January 2003, bringing together the former National Crime Authority, the Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Office of Strategic Crime Assessments. We agree the bill largely addresses technical issues identified during the establishment of the ACC. A number of amendments rectify issues identified by the states, in fact, during the preparation of the complementary state legislation under the cooperative scheme which underpins the ACC. For example, the bill would enable state laws to confer functions, powers and duties on the intergovernmental committee of the ACC and members of the ACC board.
The Main Committee will recall that the board—made up of the Commonwealth, state and territory police commissioners, five Commonwealth agency heads and chaired by the Australian Federal Police Commissioner—can authorise the use of the ACC's special coercive powers of investigation, and the intergovernmental committee, made up of police and justice ministers, oversees the board's authorisations. This bill would, for instance, enable state and territory legislation to give the intergovernmental committee power to revoke a board determination to use those powers. Also in this area, the bill would repeal section 15 of the ACC Act which deals with the conferral of powers by state legislation on examiners who are independent statutory office holders responsible for exercising these coercive powers. The repeal of section 15 will leave this matter to be governed by section 55A of the act, which contains greater safeguards in fact than the former section on the kinds of functions, powers and duties that can be conferred on examiners. 
The bill would also insert a definition of `relevant act' to include corresponding state and territory acts, which is relevant to several provisions of the ACC legislation—namely, the offence of recording, divulging or communicating information acquired in the course of ACC duties and the privilege against producing such information in court. Lastly in this area, the bill would allow information and documents to be passed by current and former employees of Australia Post to the ACC where this disclosure is required by corresponding state law. 
In a different vein, the bill would give the minister the power to suspend the chief executive officer of the ACC while allegations of misbehaviour against the CEO were investigated. We understand the omission of this power was an oversight in the 2002 legislation rather than, of course, any reflection on the competence of the current CEO, who has the support of both sides of the House. The power will complement the existing power of the minister to suspend the CEO for unsatisfactory performance should that arise in the future. The bill also includes a new transitional provision to address gaps in the existing transitional provisions identified since the establishment of the ACC. 
Finally, the bill would amend the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act to clarify that there is no obligation to give reasons for a decision regarding intelligence operations carried out by the ACC or a decision in connection with investigations of state offences that have a federal aspect. Currently the exemption from this obligation only covers decisions linked to investigations of offences against a law of the Commonwealth or a territory. Clearly, it is appropriate to rectify this anomaly. 
After more than a year of operation, the ACC has commenced special investigations or operations which may involve the use of coercive powers in a range of areas, including firearms, trafficking, amphetamines, money laundering and identity crime. The opposition certainly welcomes these activities and the cooperation between the federal and state authorities that they involve. I am pleased to have had the opportunity to meet with the CEO, Mr Alastair Milroy, late last year to discuss the work of the commission. As I indicate, Mr Milroy certainly has the full support of both sides of the House in the important work undertaken by the ACC.
We live in a dangerous neighbourhood—that is unquestionably the case—and it is vitally important that Australia has a strong criminal intelligence capacity to fight organised criminal networks that extend not only within Australia but also beyond our shores. I should observe that the integration of policing and intelligence in the ACC makes a nonsense of the Prime Minister's recent attempts to argue that these functions are discrete, in the context of his attacks on Commissioner Keelty. As the chairman of the ACC board, Commissioner Keelty has a key role in determining criminal intelligence priorities and the dissemination of criminal intelligence assessments. The criminal intelligence assessments may include, at the most grievous end of criminal conduct, terrorism activities. To pretend, as the Prime Minister did, that Commissioner Keelty has no competence in intelligence matters is, quite frankly, insulting not only to the commissioner but to all Australians who understand the value of intelligence led policing and, indeed, the valuable role undertaken by the ACC. Having made that point, I can reaffirm that the opposition's support of this noncontroversial piece of legislation is straightforward. Again we congratulate and underline the importance of the work being undertaken by the ACC in making Australians safer from organised crime of all descriptions.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN CRIME COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,26,1
"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2004-03-24,"—It is appropriate that this House supports the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2003. The bill is noncontroversial and of a technical nature. It supports the work of the Australian Crime Commission, which continues to do an excellent job under Alastair Milroy, the new head of the Australian Crime Commission. Its track record has been impressive. The cooperation that it receives from the various state governments around Australia is excellent. I believe that we are involved in a new era of cooperation of the states with the Commonwealth. They are sharing resources in terms of personnel and intelligence gathering, with the aim of making Australia a safer place. They are sharing intelligence in relation to some of the criminals who operate in the areas of drug trafficking and people trafficking. One of latest areas that they have become involved in is sexual servitude. The indications to date are that they are doing a very good job in that area. Using people from the various state areas to supplement the staff of the ACC is a good step forward. I hear very positive comments on the ACC by the various police forces around Australia. In terms of hearings that we have had in relation to the Australian Crime Commission, it is good to see that the state police forces are looking to the leadership of the Australian Crime Commission in a number of areas. This bill makes some technical amendments to enable them to operate more effectively.
The first item is the repealing of section 15 of the ACC Act, which empowers ACC examiners to conduct functions under state laws, in cooperation with their responsibilities under the act, with the consent of the Minister for Justice and Customs. This section of the act was made redundant by the ACC Establishment Act 2002. The repealing of the section will avoid any inconsistencies in the performance of state powers. The other changes to the ACC Act include an amendment to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. This means that exemptions can be provided where examiners are meant to provide full reasons as to why they made a decision. I certainly remember, in terms of the recommendations of the committee that looked at the original legislation, that we thought this was an appropriate way to go, but I see that they are outlining where it is not necessary in certain situations. In terms of assisting with the overall administration of the ACC, that is a wise step forward, and I certainly support that change.
The other change is also a technical one. It relates to the Australian Postal Corporation. It will enable staff of the Australian post office to provide information and documents which they obtain during the course of their employment with Australia Post to the Australian Crime Commission under state law if required to do so. The need to tie that up in legislation is obviously important as much of the material examined by the Australian Crime Commission is sent via the post. The change in terms of this section of the act will be significant.
These are technical amendments. They address some of the problems that have been highlighted in the operation of the ACC in working through the legislation at the moment. It is an organisation which continues to perform well in maintaining law and order in Australia. The relationship with the state and territorial police services continues to improve under Alastair Milroy. Its mission to enhance Australia's law enforcement capacity to counter serious and organised crime by providing quality intelligence and investigative services is working and growing. The organisations that are involved—the police force and other organisations around Australia, the Attorney-General's office, ASIO, ASIC and the Australian Customs Service—are all working together well. The parliamentary committee, which I chair, is satisfied to date with the performance of the new organisation. We will continue to monitor it, but we are certainly encouraged by the performance to date.
The importation of illicit drugs, the investigation of crime groups in the region, money laundering, tax fraud and violence are some of the areas that are being looked at. The money laundering aspect in relation to illegal operations, firearms, the trafficking of amphetamines and other synthetic drug importation and manufacture has been a significant part of the ACC's work and is ongoing at this point in time. While there have been some criticisms relating to civil liberties, I do not believe that they are valid in terms of the current context of the act and the operation of the ACC. We need to ensure that the Australian Crime Commission operates at its full potential without hindrance from unnecessary legislative requirements. I believe that these technical changes will meet this requirement. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN CRIME COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,26,1
"Somlyay, Alex, MP",LP,2004-03-24,"—Crime at the local level is a top-of-the-mind issue in every survey that is conducted by members of parliament, the media and professional market researchers. Crime is the major concern of people at the grassroots level. You cannot underestimate the importance of the link between organised crime and crime at the local level, especially as it is related to drugs, home invasions and home break-ins.
The purpose of the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2003 is to make some minor technical amendments to the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 to ensure that the authority established under that act—the Australian Crime Commission—is able to deal with organised crime across state and territory borders in the way intended under the act. While these amendments are part of the government's stance on both its law and order and national security agenda, they in no way alter the focus or intent of the original act. If we establish an authority and confer on it certain powers to fight crime, we must also ensure those conferred powers are not inadvertently distorted or diminished by technical errors in the drafting of the legislation.
This bill is designed to overcome technical shortcomings in the practical operation of the ACC Act which became obvious only after the commencement of the act. To understand why these amendments are necessary, let me give a brief background to the ACC. Its establishment was a key initiative from the Commonwealth-state Leaders Summit on Terrorism and Transnational Crime, held in Canberra in April 2002. As members know, each state and territory makes its own criminal laws, but the 2002 summit resulted in agreement between all parties—the Commonwealth, states and territories—on a series of federal arrangements to support a new national framework for dealing with terrorism and transnational crime. Serious criminals and organised crime do not care about borders, states or even laws. Australia needs a serious body with the powers to deal with crime and terrorism across state borders.
To meet the threats posed by nationally significant crime, the ACC replaced a number of existing bodies. It replaced the National Crime Authority—and I was a member of the National Crime Authority committee of this parliament—the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence and the Office of Strategic Crime Assessments. The ACC is empowered to conduct criminal intelligence operations and to investigate federally relevant criminal activity and serious offences under state laws. 
The ACC Act provides for functions, duties and powers to be conferred on the ACC under state legislation to enable it to investigate and conduct intelligence operations in relation to serious organised crimes that are offences under state law—that is, the act enables the states and territories to confer functions and powers on the ACC as part of the cooperative legislation scheme that arose from the 2002 Commonwealth-state summit. This ability to legislate cooperatively is the key to the summit's scheme to fight transnational crime. This ability to legislate cooperatively against organised crime and terrorism, regardless of the politics of the federal or state government, must be good for Australia—and it is—and hopefully very bad for transnational crime.
However, there were a couple of minor technical problems. For instance, item 1 of this bill repeals section 15 of the act because another section of the act does the same thing—and does it better. The existing section 55A of the act already provides greater safeguards than the repealed one on the powers, functions and duties that can be conferred on the ACC under state laws. The Howard government believes that, in good government, when you confer the power you also need to balance that power with safeguards. This bill retains the section with the greater safeguards and deletes the redundant, less effective section.
Along the same lines, the CEO of the ACC can currently have his or her appointment terminated if, in the minister's opinion, the CEO has behaved or performed unsatisfactorily, but he or she cannot be suspended pending an investigation. This bill allows a minister, with advice from the board, to suspend the ACC CEO while any allegations of misbehaviour are investigated. This is a further safeguard because the government believes in empowerment with responsibility and accountability. It also believes in safeguards to ensure that balance works.
The bill addresses a range of transitional issues by inserting a retrospective amendment that ensures that the National Crime Authority is taken to have continued in existence with its name altered to the Australian Crime Commission. This is a case where retrospectivity is definitely warranted and essential. This means that any references in legal instruments or proceedings to the body under its old name, the NCA, will be construed as referring to the same body under the new name of the ACC for continuation of duties, investigations and court cases—that is, if there is provision for something to be done under the NCA and there is corresponding provision under the ACC Act, it can be done as if the NCA continued in existence with an altered name.
The bill also ensures that an authorised function or direction can still legitimately be carried out, even if it has been reallocated to a different position or if hierarchical changes have been made under the ACC Act. That is why this item of the bill will apply retrospectively from the date of establishment of the ACC—to ensure a smooth transition between the NCA and the ACC, especially as regards legal proceedings which may already have been under way at the commencement of the act.
The other amendments in this bill relate to the divulging of information. Section 51, covering the secrecy provisions of the ACC Act, prohibits the making of records, disclosure of information or producing of documents in court, except for the purposes of the act or in connection with duties under the act. This bill allows those disclosures to be made under a relevant act—a state law under which the ACC performs a duty or function or exercises a power in accordance with section 55A of the ACC Act. It is commonsense, really. If ACC personnel are empowered to investigate under a state law, they should also be able to give evidence in ensuing court proceedings regarding those investigations.
As other speakers have said, this is not a controversial bill. It has the support of both sides. It does not confer any extra power on the ACC but simply removes some technical anomalies inadvertently included in the original act. I therefore commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN CRIME COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,26,1
"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2004-03-24,"—It is with pleasure that I rise today to support the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2003. This bill again underscores the support and diligence that the Howard government shows towards putting good legislation into effect for the Australian people—in this case, in the area of law and order, which is so important to so many Australians. I am a member of the Joint Statutory Committee on the Australian Crime Commission that sits in this parliament, and we were charged with the responsibility for drafting legislation for the transition of the NCA into the Australian Crime Commission.
From the time that the Prime Minister made the decision that the Australian Crime Commission should be formulated, it had at its very base the view that the new body would bring together a number of other bodies, including the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, the National Crime Authority and a number of other intelligence agencies. The Prime Minister at that time, I know, had the view that if we were to combat transnational crime and the very serious drug syndicates that operated both in Australia and internationally then we needed to equip a new body, in the form of the Australian Crime Commission, with up-to-date legislation and technologies and provide up-to-date benefits for the Australian law enforcement and intelligence agency bodies to combat these evils of crime.
The main objectives of this bill are largely uncontroversial. While it might be said that the powers of the ACC impinge on some civil liberties, and certainly some people hold that view, the amendments largely are really only to give the ACC powers it already has or was intended to have either under state law or in its former guise as the NCA.
Item 1 of schedule 1 repeals section 15 of the Australian Crime Commission Act. Section 15 currently provides that examiners may exercise functions and powers under state laws concurrently with their responsibilities under the ACC Act—that is, provided that the intergovernmental committee consents and that the Minister for Justice and Customs:
... is satisfied that those functions or powers may conveniently be performed or exercised in conjunction with the performance or exercise by the ACC of its functions or powers under this Act ...
I think the section probably would have been repealed when section 55A was amended by the ACC Establishment Act 2002, and it is now effectively redundant. Section 15 was part of the earlier NCA regime, in which the intergovernmental committee had extensive powers of the sort currently exercised by the board of the Australian Crime Commission. The intergovernmental committee now only has a general oversight role, rather than a role in authorising specific operations as it did in the past. The repeal of section 15 may avoid inconsistencies in the performance of state functions and powers under sections 15 and 55A.
There are a number of other amendments, essentially of a technical nature. Item 17, I suppose, would appear to be the most substantive of all the proposed amendments, because it is intended to act and operate retrospectively. However, its purpose is to insert a new section 55D into the ACC Act to provide further transitional arrangements for the transfer of power and operations from the NCA to the ACC. This provision is deemed to have commenced on 1 January 2003, when the ACC was established. It invokes the operation of section 25B of the Acts Interpretation Act—which deals with the alteration of names and constitutions—to provide that, where the NCA Act empowered the NCA to do a thing or deal with a matter and there is a corresponding provision in the ACC Act for the ACC to do such a thing et cetera, then the NCA may do the thing under the ACC Act.
In other words, section 25B of the Acts Interpretation Act operates to provide that the NCA continues in existence under the new name of the ACC so that its identity is not affected. Certain paragraphs, including 25B(1A) and 25B(2), operate to provide that the alteration of the NCA's constitution does not affect any legal or other proceedings brought against the NCA before its name change. Also, the alteration does not affect any investigation or inquiry brought or proposed to be brought by any tribunal, authority or person, such as the Ombudsman, into the NCA. According to the explanatory memorandum, item 17 also honours an undertaking given by the Minister for Justice and Customs to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances to address, through amendment to the ACC Act, the transition of the ACC telecommunications warrants issued to the NCA.
This bill provides some further refinement of the establishment of the ACC and the legislation under which it operates. It certainly provides for a better basis for the ACC to go forward. It would have been ridiculous had there been legal problems with investigations that were carried over from the NCA to the ACC. Although many people have problems with retrospective legislation—and I know that the Senate committee did have some issues with that proposal—it would have been an unenviable position for the ACC to have been placed in to have serious investigations compromised simply because the body had been taken through a transition into a new and better organisation called the Australian Crime Commission.
It is timely to look at some of the successes that the Australian Crime Commission has already had to date. There have been many. The Australian Crime Commission, as this House knows and as my constituents in Dickson know, works well with the state law enforcement authorities. It has stated publicly that it is working on firearms trafficking, which is a special investigation that it is undertaking. There is a special investigation into South-East Asian organised crime, as there is into established criminal networks. It is also investigating matters concerning money-laundering and tax fraud on the Commonwealth. There are investigations into amphetamines and other synthetic drugs, vehicle rebirthing and identity crime. I am aware that it has done a considerable amount of work in relation to credit card skimming and a number of other investigations which are unable to be made public at this point in time.
The debate today gives me the opportunity to express to the parliament the very serious concerns that my constituents in Dickson have about the issue of law and order. In particular, the elderly residents in my electorate have grave concerns about safety in their own homes. I say to them today that the Australian Crime Commission works very well with federal and state bodies to try to stamp out crime whenever it can. Certainly, it deals with the larger issues, particularly in relation to drug importation and trafficking. We know that many local crimes are caused by people who need the money to buy drugs from the people that the Australian Crime Commission and other law enforcement agencies are trying to tackle. I want to commend the Australian Crime Commission on the work that it continues to do. I also commend the Australian Federal Police, who have a joint role with the Australian Crime Commission and work hand in glove with it. Each complements the work of the other. The liaison, the professional behaviour and the contact between each of the organisations and agencies has never been as good as it is under the Australian Crime Commission.
I want to mention today an operation that led to a massive drugs seizure back in September. It was the culmination of a considerable amount of work by the ACC, the AFP and indeed the Cambodian national police. It resulted in the largest seizure ever in Australia of pseudoephedrine, with a wholesale value of $40 million. The haul was disguised in decorative wall plaques which weighed approximately 750 kilograms and was discovered by Customs officers during an examination of a shipping container in Sydney on 4 September. Four Australian residents were arrested on trafficking charges. The Chief Executive Officer of the ACC, Alastair Milroy, said:
A lengthy and proactive operation mounted by the ACC has led to this excellent result. Ongoing surveillance by ACC officers detected the container and with assistance from Australian Customs, the container was searched.
He went on to say:
The success of the operation has required the effort of the ACC, AFP, Customs and the Cambodian National Police which demonstrates the necessity of law enforcement agencies, both nationally and internationally, working together.
The seizure of the pseudoephedrine is the third stage of a joint operation between the ACC, the AFP and the Cambodian National Police who previously arrested an Australian national, four Cambodian nationals and others in connection with 24 kgs of heroin at an estimated street value of AUD24 million ... 
The reason I raise that particular issue today is that the very real outcome of this matter, had those people not been arrested and the drugs seized, would have been that those drugs would have filtered their way down to the streets and houses in electorates like mine in outer metropolitan areas of Australia.
One of the great afflictions of Australian youth and Australian society in this day and age has been the terrible and treacherous effect that drugs have on young people. In commending this bill to the House today, I also want to take the opportunity to congratulate Alastair Milroy and all the officers and support staff within the Australian Crime Commission on the fine work they have done over what I know and acknowledge is a difficult transition period. These sorts of major transitions are always difficult for staff, because people do not know what the outcomes will be. But we know in hindsight what the outcomes have been, and we know that, through the Howard government's formulation of and support for the Australian Crime Commission, as well as the ongoing support given by this government to the law enforcement agencies of this country, the ACC is providing on a regular basis tangible and decent outcomes for the people of Australia. It is with great pleasure that I support this bill before the House today.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN CRIME COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,26,1
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2004-03-24,"—I am delighted to rise to speak in support of the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2003. This bill is ultimately about helping the Australian Crime Commission in its work to combat organised crime and the outcome of organised crime—that is, the spread and scourge of drugs throughout Australia. Overnight, we saw the death of another member of Melbourne's underworld. By some accounts, that killing represents the 23rd recent killing of an underworld figure in Melbourne. It shows that there is a significant organised crime network in one city in Australia. This network is at war with itself. It is real, established and involved in activities such as drugs, prostitution, the illegal importation of substances throughout Australia and standover activities. It is also having a deleterious, destructive and cancerous effect on our society.
In focusing on the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2003, let us not forget for a moment that it is about the good of society. It is about dealing with these things that strike at the very notion of everything that we believe in and which reach into and rip apart lives of ordinary citizens. That is what the Australian Crime Commission is about. It is about breaking down organised crime in Australia. Organised crime, in turn, is about widespread drug use, preying upon those who are most vulnerable—and in addition to that widespread drug use it is about other associated activities, be they organised prostitution, illegal import and export, standover tactics or any of the other elements which are associated with organised crime. The effect on society is to break down certainty for people in their own homes and to break down the capacity of businesses to go about their affairs without feeling threatened or intimidated. That is why this bill is important.
One thing we have seen is a significant decrease in the quantity of heroin used over the last five years in Australia. That comes from the work of the National Crime Authority and its successor, the Australian Crime Commission, and the Australian Federal Police and the respective state jurisdictions. There has been an extraordinary decrease in the use and level of heroin and related opiates in our society over the last five to six years. That is a breakthrough, but it is still a problem so you can never ever be complacent. That is the heart and soul of what this bill is about and it is what the Australian Crime Commission focuses on.
Very briefly, I support this bill because it has a simple proposition: it helps the Australian Crime Commission to establish itself in its transition as the successor to the National Crime Authority. The Australian Crime Commission was established on 1 January 2003. It was the culmination of a decade long process to bring together a series of bodies. In April 1992, the Commonwealth, states and territories agreed to replace the National Crime Authority with a new body with a strong focus on national criminal intelligence needs. The agreement recognised that there is a level of serious and organised crime in Australia, that it cuts across jurisdictional boundaries and that it needs to be addressed at a national level. That is where the Australian Crime Commission fits in, so it was established on 1 January 2003. As a consequence of its establishment, there are some minor amendments. 
But what is the Australian Crime Commission? It is a body which was established as the successor to the National Crime Authority, the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence and the Office of Strategic Crime Assessments with a vision of reducing the incidence and impact of serious and organised criminal activity. That is a clear and simple vision. Its specific mission flowing from that vision is to enhance Australian law enforcement's capacity to counter serious and organised criminal activity by: (1), providing quality intelligence and investigative services; (2), responding effectively to the needs of the relevant police and jurisdictional bodies throughout Australia; and, (3), working with those agencies. 
The Australian Crime Commission has six core functions: firstly, to collect and disseminate criminal information and intelligence; secondly, to provide the ACC's board with strategic criminal assessments based on that intelligence; thirdly, to advise the board on criminal intelligence priorities; fourthly, to undertake criminal intelligence operations—so to get out there and do the work; fifthly, to investigate matters relating to federally relevant criminal activity; and, finally, to report to the board on the outcomes of intelligence operations and investigations. So those elements—intelligence collection, operations, and monitoring and review—constitute the essence of what the Australian Crime Commission is about. In that context, this bill helps facilitate the transition from its forerunners.
I want to conclude with a reference to local policing and community policing concerns within my own electorate. Whilst we are fortunate not to have a major organised crime problem in the electorate of Flinders, we are not free of it—not for one moment do I think that. In the large and growing town of Somerville, the residents, which include young families and retirees, are seriously concerned that there is no police station. The area has a consistent low-level problem with criminal activities and with law and order, particularly on the streets late in the evening and on the weekends—
—Why won't the Victorian government put in a police station?
—They should be putting in a police station. I thank the parliamentary secretary for his remarks. We have made it a specific policy to fight for and deliver a police station for Somerville. We made it a specific policy to fight for and deliver a secondary college for Somerville, against the wishes of the state government. Now, having won that battle, the next battle is to deliver a police station for the people of Somerville.
—You sound like an effective local representative.
 (Hon. B.C. Scott)—Order! The parliamentary secretary will refrain from interjecting.
—I put on the record that goal of a critical need for local policing. It is complementary to the concept of national policing and national investigation contained within this bill. I commend the National Crime Authority on its work while it was in existence and I commend the work of the Australian Crime Commission, as its successor and the body that now brings together Australian criminal investigation activities in relation to organised crime. I push forcefully for the need for a police station on the ground in Somerville, providing practical policing. I commend this bill to the House, and I urge its speedy passage.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN CRIME COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,26,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2004-03-24,"—in reply—From the debate in the chamber it is pretty clear that members on both sides, even though only one opposition member spoke, feel that crime these days is not something which is restricted to a particular jurisdiction. There is a very high level of cooperation between the Commonwealth on the one hand and the various states and territories on the other. Our community understands that governments are required to cooperate to get the best possible outcomes to make sure that as a nation together we are able to fight organised crime. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the shadow Attorney-General and honourable members on this side who have spoken for their contributions and support for the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2003.
Those honourable members who spoke covered the individual aspects of the bill, and some honourable members touched on other matters not directly relevant to the bill but certainly relevant to their own electorates. The member for Flinders, I think, is widely recognised in his own community as a very strong fighter for the people whom he represents in this place. I am constantly impressed by the way that he has been prepared to take the fight up to the state Labor government. Even when it is not a federal issue, the member for Flinders is prepared to stand up—as he did in this place a moment ago, to fight for a police station in the Somerville area. If the member for Melbourne Ports has any influence with his colleagues in the state Labor government, maybe he might be able to put a good word in, because it is pretty clear that the member for Flinders was speaking from the heart. He knows how important this police station is for his local community and he knows how important the secondary college is that he spoke about. So I just want to commend him and applaud his representations on behalf of those people he is privileged to represent in the federal parliament. He also spoke up for Port Nepean. He was a very strong advocate for the community there. I have to say that he is clearly recognised by his constituents as a person worthy of ongoing support.
I would also like to commend the members for Cook, Fairfax and Dickson for their contributions to the debate on this bill. The member for Cook has taken a great interest in this area of the law over a very long period of time, as has my colleague and parliamentary neighbour, the member for Fairfax, who together with me is privileged to represent, in the Australian parliament, the most beautiful part of Australia—namely, the Sunshine Coast. The member for Dickson is something of an icon because he ensured that his predecessor, Ms Kernot, retired. In relation to law and order issues and crime, the member for Dickson is someone who has not hesitated to speak out on a whole range of issues. I was particularly pleased to listen to his contribution on the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2003. The member for Dickson speaks from the heart. He is an excellent local representative—as the member for Petrie well knows. She of course is a parliamentary neighbour of the member for Dickson and she works very well on behalf of her community and his, particularly in the area of fighting crime.
This bill will make some minor adjustments to the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 and the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989. The need for these amendments has been revealed through practical experience since the establishment of the Australian Crime Commission on 1 January 2003 and through the preparation of corresponding state legislation. The amendments are necessary to ensure that there is a workable legislative framework in place to enable the Australian Crime Commission to effectively combat serious and organised crime across Australia. The worthy objectives of this bill have been recognised by members on both sides of the House. I thank the shadow Attorney-General for his support and I commend the bill to the House.

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—I am speaking in continuation on the report on the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD entitled Intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. I was saying that I believe the government insulted the Australian people by not levelling with them about the real reasons that they saw fit to commit our young personnel to an invasion of Iraq. I notice that on a number of occasions when our personnel have returned to Australian shores the Prime Minister has said, as he said on 16 June 2003:
We went to war in a just cause, on a proper legal basis, to liberate an oppressed people ...
He also said, on 13 March 2003 at the National Press Club:
Well I would have to accept that if Iraq had genuinely disarmed, I couldn't justify on its own a military invasion of Iraq to change the regime. I've never advocated that. 
On 18 March 2003, the liberation of the people of Iraq from the tyrannical government of Saddam Hussein was seen as a benefit of an invasion of Iraq, not as a major cause for the invasion, yet thereafter it has allegedly become the primary reason that Australia joined with the so-called coalition of the willing to invade Iraq.
The report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD has made a number of claims concerning what can only be termed as exaggeration or omission, in not taking into account qualifications made by our intelligence agencies—intelligence agencies, we would have to say, which were greatly underresourced when their information and their assessments were taken into account by the government in going into Iraq. I notice that this government, belatedly, has now made a great public fanfare of increasing resources and finances to our intelligence agencies—something that we should have been doing long before the decision to go into Iraq. I think everyone on all sides of the parliament would agree with that, because intelligence is the key to carrying out a successful war on terrorism. 
The conclusion I make about Australia's involvement in Iraq is that, in many ways, it was a diversion of important resources that should have been directed to the war against terrorism. What I would say since—and what Commissioner Keelty has said since—is that our involvement in Iraq has made Australia even more of a potential recipient of terrorist activities. That is known by 99.9 per cent of Australians who think about this—it is just commonsense. Commissioner Keelty was remonstrated with by the Prime Minister and other senior ministers and, of course, the `minister for over the top', the `minister for clowns'—the foreign minister—carried out his continual insults—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order: I ask you to have him withdraw that highly offensive comment and refer to the minister by his appropriate title.
 (Hon. B.C. Scott)—I was about to do that before the member for Petrie stood and sought the call. The member for Braddon will withdraw those offensive remarks. 
—I withdraw the offensive remarks that you deem to be offensive.
—Thank you. You will facilitate the Main Committee if you will withdraw them unreservedly. The member for Braddon will proceed.
—The foreign minister, in his usual over-the-top performance, equated the comments of our highly reputable commissioner to the continuing propaganda of al-Qaeda. What an insult! He labelled anyone who opposed this war as an appeaser and anyone who argued against Australia's involvement in that war, once more of the truth became obvious about why we were in there, as a supporter of Saddam Hussein. That is the type of nonsense that the foreign minister has been involved with in this debate, and it is a pity he debases this debate so much by those accusations.
The report clearly demonstrates that our intelligence agencies needed more resources, and it is good to see that those resources in part will be forthcoming. Of course, the report also talked about our intelligence failure. It concluded that 78 per cent of the intelligence material on which the Office of National Assessments relied in the lead-up to the war was from untested sources; that ONA used this intelligence despite doubts expressed at the time about its trustworthiness; and that Australian intelligence agencies relied heavily on US and UK documents which were apparently flawed.
On the exaggeration aspect, the report details at least 12 instances where the Howard government overstated the prewar WMD threat to the public based on the information at its disposal at the time. Let us work our way through some of these. For example, the report says:
... the case made by the government was that Iraq possessed WMD in large quantities and posed a grave and unacceptable threat to the region and to the world, particularly as there was a danger that Iraq's WMD might be passed to terrorist organisations.
Indeed, that is the highlight of the Prime Minister's speech to parliament on 18 March 2003—those very claims. But the report continues:
This is not the picture that emerges from an examination of all the assessments provided to the Committee by Australia's two [intelligence assessment] agencies.
That is in paragraphs 5.16 and 5.17 in the report. Statements by the Prime Minister were more strident `than most of the Australian intelligence community judgments'. This was in part because they quoted directly from UK and US agencies. The conclusions by those agencies the committee described as:
... an exaggeration of the available intelligence, since established as an exaggeration of the facts.
This is in paragraph 5.20 of the report. Mr Downer warned of the immediate threat posed by Iraq's WMD; whereas the report concluded that Australia's intelligence agencies:
... provided hardly any explicit assessment on the question of the immediacy of threat posed by Saddam Hussein.
That is in paragraph 2.40 of the inquiry's report.
The Prime Minister's statement that Iraq's WMD threat was `real and unacceptable':
... was not a judgement that DIO would have made.
That is paragraph 5.21. Finally:
... Australian agencies did not think the amounts of WMD to be large ... and the Defence Intelligence Organisation always expressed doubts about any production of biological or chemical weapons beyond 1991.
Whereas, the report unanimously concludes:
The presentations by the government seemed to suggest large arsenals and stockpiles, endorsing the idea that Iraq was producing more weapons and that the programs were larger and more active than before the Gulf War in 1991.
That is paragraph 5.32. The parliamentary report clearly indicates that there was exaggeration. Subsequent events in Iraq and the failure to find weapons of mass destruction merely demonstrate again to the Australian people that their intelligence was insulted by this government's failure to give the true reasons for invading Iraq.

"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—It is a privilege to speak on this report. I was surprised when my learned colleague the member for Melbourne Ports pointed out that there is not one coalition member speaking on this report this morning, as I understand it. This is staggering. I wanted to start my remarks by saying how much I welcomed the initiative of establishing the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. I would have thought that this is part of an initiative of the Howard government that you should be proud of. The fine balance between the need to have matters of intelligence kept tightly and the need for appropriate and proper parliamentary scrutiny is a difficult area. Here we have probably one of the most important reports that committee has brought down. This is not a Labor Party report—I do not want to speak to a Labor minority report—this is a unanimous report of the committee on a most important subject: intelligence on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. It is very critical, and they have done a very good job.
It pains me, and I am sure it pains you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, that this is the most leaked report of any parliamentary committee. Why do I say that? It had but three recommendations. The most important recommended a further inquiry, and that was totally leaked before the tabling of the report. I know the members of that joint committee and I have absolutely every confidence in each and every one of them, and I am confident that not one of them leaked that report. We know where the report leaking came from. It is a requirement of the heads of the committee to give an advance copy of the report to relevant ministers so that they can ensure that nothing is disclosed publicly which should not otherwise be disclosed. In fact, that happened. I think a word is blacked out in the report so we know that it could not have come from the committee—but it came from ministers of state, or their staff, responsible, on behalf of Australia, for intelligence matters.
I want to express my profound disgust and dismay that such a parliamentary report should be leaked out of ministers' offices. That is terrible. It is shocking. It is a precedent that I hope is never followed by any government. It was a good initiative to set up this committee. We need to explore the limits of what their jurisdiction should be. Indeed, in the report they say that there are areas they were not able to examine. So, to that extent, the report is incomplete in their minds. I and those on the Labor side hold the idea, notion and practice of parliamentary accountability to be of absolute and paramount importance. It is fundamental to our democracy. In this area we have been pushing the envelope quite successfully, I think, but, in the case of this excellent report, it was with dramatic and unfortunate results. It was not the committee that people believed would be irresponsible and unable to handle confidential information. It was not the committee members or the committee that leaked this report. We know and are fairly confident that it came out of ministers' offices. But not one inquiry has been commissioned about the leaking of this report. I just wonder why.
As I said, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who takes a great deal of interest in matters of intelligence, has told me that there is not one coalition member speaking. If there had been, I would have had to say: `Please don't accuse us, as has repeatedly happened in the House, of somehow wanting Saddam Hussein still as leader in Iraq. Don't try and justify what has happened in terms of Australia's intelligence and the execution of that intelligence by saying that the opposition side is comfortable or uncomfortable that there has been regime change.' I want to point out that the Prime Minister himself, on 13 March at the National Press Club, said, `I am not committing troops to Iraq to achieve regime change.' He said he was not doing it for that reason, even though, day in and day out in question time, we have the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs saying: `That's what we've achieved. We've achieved our objectives and you, the opposition, would have been happy to see Saddam still there.' What a lie. What a falsehood. What a misstatement of the truth. What dissembling on the original objectives of sending troops there, based on intelligence, to what has happened now. I think the Australian public is starting to wake up about it.
I also wanted to put on the public record that one of the key figures in the intelligence community has been badly traduced by the government. I know a number of people in the intelligence community. I had the opportunity in a different role to work very closely with the head of ASIO. I have a profound respect for the head of ASIO. I have been briefed by DIO. I have a respect for what DIO does and produces. But I am not talking about DIO. I have been briefed in a different role by the head of ASIS and I was very indebted for that briefing. Up to that point, I had no idea of the effectiveness of that organisation, its reach or what it was capable of producing.
But I am not speaking about that; I am of course speaking about the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mick Keelty. I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, have a profound respect for the profession of law enforcement. You would understand how shocking it was that when the Federal Police Commissioner went on to national TV and said that he felt that, because of our involvement in Iraq, Australia had a greater threat of attacks by terrorist organisations he should be heavied by the office of the Prime Minister and forced into issuing a humiliating press release backing down from a statement that, by the way, 65 per cent of Australians believe is utterly accurate and utterly unremarkable.
Worse than that, for 24 hours he considered resigning after the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has direct responsibility for ASIS, said that the commissioner was making statements similar to the propaganda being spread by al-Qaeda. What a shocking accusation to make about a police commissioner! No wonder he thought about resigning. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, this was a low blow from the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It was low. It was cheap. It demeaned the high office that he upholds not only as Minister for Foreign Affairs, directing the diplomatic activity between Australia and the countries of the world, but as head of the portfolio responsible for ASIS.
What is national security coming to? What is the intelligence of Australia's organisations coming to when we see the head of an organisation like the Australian Federal Police being heavied in the cheapest, most demeaning way by the office of the Prime Minister—not the Prime Minister himself—and when we have a question time where for question after question the Prime Minister utterly refuses to say what his own direct involvement was and what the involvement of his staff was in contacting the head of the Australian Federal Police and in dictating the press release that was released subsequently under the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police? What are we coming to?
I can say this: no-one can foretell the future. But we will be relying on our intelligence organisations to provide the best information. This report does not say the minister lied to us and does not say that the Prime Minister lied to the people of Australia, but it does suggest that they did not fully tell the truth. They did not paint the picture and were happy to exaggerate the intelligence we received. We cannot trifle with terrorist organisations. It is too serious a business. They are unlike traditional enemies or other states, which one can identify. One can see the build-up. One can recognise the danger. But terrorist organisations, of themselves, are opaque. They are hard to identify, difficult to locate and almost impossible to trace. We must be reliant on the best from our intelligence organisations.
Last but not least, this is not a report about whether it was right or wrong for us to go to war in Iraq. But I do want to make one point. That is that, whether we were right or wrong to go into Iraq, we seemed to take our eye off the terrorist game. We seemed to lose focus in Afghanistan, where al-Qaeda had based themselves. It is only now that we are searching for the key people in the mountains of Pakistan and on the borders of Afghanistan. We cannot rest easy about hunting down terrorists and terrorist organisations. No country is immune from them. If we think that we are immune because we are Australia, located away from so many other countries, we are deluding ourselves.
I want to commend the report. I think this is an excellent report. I hope I am never in this place again complaining that a report by this joint committee is leaked by ministers. I hope the Australian people understand and will judge the government by the fact that they have so poorly treated this committee and its worthwhile recommendations.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>ASIO, ASIS and DSD Committee</title>",Committees,27,1
"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—One of the great mysteries of the last year and a half is the failure of intelligence on Iraq, as identified by the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. As the member for Chifley has just emphasised, the members and senators on this committee produced a nonpartisan report, which includes many important recommendations that need to be taken up from the point of view of the nonpartisan concern that this parliament has for the security of the Australian people. The great mystery as far as Iraq is concerned was best identified in the writings of Mr Ken Pollack in the January issue of the Atlantic monthly. Mr Pollack, who wrote The Threatening Storm: The Case for Invading Iraq, has subsequently amended his stance outlined in the January issue of Atlanticcalled `Spies, lies, and weapons: what went wrong?' Pollock argues in that very profound article that we had an ongoing informed misperception—I think that is the phrase he uses—by the intelligence services of the fact that Saddam Hussein had previously had a build-up of weapons of mass destruction and that after the inspectors left in 1998 this had continued.
The important intelligence failure identified by this very important joint parliamentary committee is absolutely crucial in these days, when threats of a mega attack on civilians throughout the world are being made, because if we have a repeat of this failure of intelligence, as Senator Ray has said, this will potentially lead to great danger to our citizens. As to the government's attitude to the crucial nature of weapons of mass destruction providing a causus bellum for the war in Iraq, the members for Braddon and Chifley, speaking prior to me, have properly identified the fact that the Prime Minister said that this was the primary reason for intervention in Iraq.
The government might have said that Saddam Hussein is an evil dictator who killed over 200,000 of his own people in political repression over the last 30 years, invaded two of his neighbours and used chemical weapons against his own people and that he should therefore be removed from power in order to liberate the people of Iraq from his oppressive rule, but this is not the case that they made as the primary issue. I heard the foreign minister of East Timor, Jose Ramos Horta, make precisely such a case in a brilliant speech, saying that he had supported the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia to prevent the genocide of Pol Pot, that he had supported the NATO intervention in Bosnia to save the Albanian or Kosovar Muslim people and that he had supported UN intervention in Somalia because humanitarian intervention, according to Mr Horta, is one of the primary reasons that the UN should act in these kinds of situations. But unfortunately this was not the case.
I do sympathise with Iraqis, including Iraqis living in Australia, who do point out that, with the removal of the tyranny of Saddam Hussein, things have improved. Seventy per cent of people respond that the situation is preferable to what it was. This is in the Oxford Research International poll, published last month as an authoritative overview of current Iraqi attitudes. According to 56 per cent of Iraqis, life is better than it was before, and 71 per cent said that life in Iraq is overwhelmingly positive now.
A letter from an Iraqi citizen, Riadh Al-Mahaldi, in the Melbourne Age last weekend said that, whatever Australians' views are of the motivation and the politics of the war in Iraq, we should continue to bear in mind the situation of the Iraqi people when we do look at these situations. I think there is a great deal of concern for them across all sides of politics, and we ought to keep them in mind when we are making future decisions on Australian involvement in that part of the world.
I also sympathise with the Iraqi Governing Council, which claims that there have been oceans of ink spilt over the issue of pre-war intelligence but that virtually no-one is looking into the scandalous oil for food program and the corrupt—and that is the only way of describing it—and gigantic scam that appears to have been run in that program. Apparently, KPMG and the international law firm Freshfields Brookhouse Deringer are now investigating this. It seems that billions of dollars were put through a French bank and have been misappropriated, people paid huge service fees and various people who were supporting Saddam Hussein's regime were paid off in this ostensibly humanitarian program that was exploited to sustain a bloody dictatorship.
All of these things are true and should be considered as well. It does not mean that the Australian government should get off the hook for their failure to properly identify intelligence on Iraq. In my view, the government should have said: `We do not have specific intelligence now that Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction, although we know that Saddam used them on the Kurds in Halabja in the past. Nevertheless, Saddam Hussein has not met the UN obligations he entered into after the war in 1991—in particular, an obligation to give an account of what happened to those weapons. In the context of the global war against terrorism, this is not acceptable. Unless Saddam immediately complies with the requirements, we will take action against him.' That was a ground, but it was not the primary ground. As with the issue of humanitarian interventionism, as it is described by Jose Ramos Horta, the government should have given that higher priority. The government might have also said, `We have no firm evidence that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction. We have evidence from the Iraq Survey Group that Saddam's regime retained the desire and the ability to re-acquire such weapons. This is not an acceptable risk in the post-September 11 world.'
In a brilliant speech to his constituency a week and a half ago, Tony Blair explained this best. He said that this is:
 ... not a time to weigh the risks to an infinite balance; not a time for the cynicism of the worldly wise who favour playing it long. Their worldly wise cynicism is actually at best naivete and at worst dereliction. When they talk as they do now of diplomacy coming back into fashion in respect of Iran or North Korea or Libya, do they seriously think that diplomacy alone has brought about this change? ... Libya has taken the courageous step of owning up not just to a nuclear weapons program but to having chemical weapons, which are now being destroyed. Iran is back in the reach of the IAEA—
that is, the International Atomic Energy Agency. Blair went on to say that North Korea is in talks with China and the group of six over its WMD and, above all, for this part of the world, that the A.Q. Khan nuclear proliferation network, which was operating out of Malaysia and manufacturing nuclear components in Malaysia, is now being shut down, its trade slowly but surely being eliminated.
All of these reasons were important reasons for intervention in Iraq, but the government said that its sure knowledge of weapons of mass destruction, based on the information from the intelligence services, was the key and primary reason. As this non-partisan report of the committee—chaired by Mr Jull and including various other people, such as Senator Ray and the member for Brand—has shown, this was, as Ken Pollack described it, `informed misperception'. This misperception is a very important issue for this chamber and for this parliament because of the implications that it has for the safety of the Australian people.
Many people might still have opposed the Australian government if it had identified that it was taking military action against Iraq on the basis of humanitarian intervention or on the basis that we did not know what weapons of mass destruction Iraq had but that there was some potential for it to use them. The government would at least have been telling the truth in those circumstances. As we now know, the government did not possess sufficient specific intelligence that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. This is a very sorry situation in a world where we are increasingly reliant, as the member for Braddon said, on the intelligence services to prevent a mega-attack—as happened in Madrid or in the United States on September 11—from happening again in this part of the world. We Australians know, with nearly 90 dead in Bali, that this is a very real and important issue. Such a mega-attack on Australian civilians will be prevented only if there is sufficient, comprehensive and thorough work being done by the intelligence services.
I thought the member for Braddon, like the shadow spokesman for homeland security, identified a very important issue when he said that it was very good, now that the intelligence services are being beefed up, to be able to consider these things in the light of this non-partisan report. As Senator Ray said repeatedly in media interviews after the release of the report, that is the important thing that this parliament has to consider, even above our partisan views on the war in Iraq—and particularly the opposition's view that the government exaggerated its specific knowledge of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. I want to elaborate a bit on my concerns. I am not convinced that the intelligence services have all the people they need—people who work in a calm, rational way and who have a profound understanding of foreign languages, including Arabic and Indonesian. They need people who not only know how to translate those languages but also have a deep understanding of the mentality and modus operandi of the various franchises of al-Qaeda, such as Jemaah Islamiah, and who know in a profound way what they are up to. Only now are we seeing an increase to these agencies that will perhaps prevent such attacks in the future.
In my view, a good case could have been made for the removal of Saddam Hussein from power: he was an evil dictator and he was in violation of a series of UN resolutions. But this case was not made by the Australian government, which relied on a grave misperception, from existing intelligence at the time, about the nature of weapons of mass destruction. We did not know that, because the inspectors were out of Iraq. Some people have said that the government resorted to scare tactics. This report does not specifically attack the government for those scare tactics. The report may well do the government some political damage, but that is not the real issue. The real issue is the failure of intelligence and its potential to damage Australian national security by fostering the belief that the war against terrorism was somehow advanced by us going into Iraq to destroy weapons of mass destruction that it now seems Iraq did not possess.
David Martin Jones, a senior lecturer at the School of Political Science and International Studies at the University of Queensland, concluded an important article he wrote in the Financial Review by saying:
Events since 2001 have certainly amplified the risk of mass casualty attack globally, in Australia, Europe and the US. To allow such heightened risk to give credence to the Chomskyite fallacy that it is all our fault anyway would only reinforce al-Qaeda's belief that democracy is frail and a hideously fragmented enterprise.

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—In speaking to this committee report, I must say that it seems the Prime Minister's staff have had to work overtime in the last few weeks to ensure that the government's line is preserved. We have had the exhibition of the Minister for Foreign Affairs publicly attacking the Federal Police Commissioner as essentially being a mouthpiece of al-Qaeda—a person pushing their propaganda!—to the point where the commissioner was on the point of resignation, and yesterday we had another example from the government. Late yesterday the Minister for Defence had to come out clarifying a doorstop he gave earlier yesterday in which he said—and it is pretty clear:
Yes, well I just said that we went to war in Iraq to support the Security Council which had to be assured that Saddam Hussein had got rid of his weapons of mass destruction. Now we are confident that there are no weapons of mass destruction and there is no dictator that will use them against his own people ...
You can issue 25,000 clarifying points, but that wording is emphatically clear. Early yesterday the Minister for Defence said that there were no weapons of mass destruction. After Arthur Sinodinos—or a nun or somebody—got on to him yesterday afternoon, the minister came out with the following comment concerning Saddam Hussein:
... we can be confident that there are no weapons of mass destruction related to the removal of a threat—
He did not say anything about `removal'; he said there were none. That is emphatically clear. I do not blame the minister for moving towards a bit of veracity and truth in this matter. We even had this comment from the Prime Minister of Australia on 3 February: `In the fullness of time it might be demonstrated that the advice was inaccurate.' So that was the beginning of the possibility that the government would come clean on these matters.
The government has made a lot of comments in the last week or so about politics in Spain—the foreign minister has been frothing at the mouth, frantically running around the place trying to tell the Spanish government what to do. Each week for 20 years, I have read the Guardian Weekly as a kind of Bible, and I was particularly interested in last week's edition, which had a comment that perhaps the foreign minister of Australia should listen to, rather than giving advice to the Spanish electorate. Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said, `Mr Blair and Mr Bush must do some reflection. You can't organise a war on lies.' I think that is interesting on a number of points. The new leader is saying, as the Spanish people did in many public opinion polls over the war period, that essentially he does not believe in the position of the United States and Britain. What is interesting is that he did not even mention the Prime Minister of this country. The Prime Minister was running around Crawford, Texas, buying 25 mugs, if he could get hold of them, of him, Aznar, Bush and Blair. He was being slapped on the back at the barbecue at Crawford, trying to make it appear as if he was a person of some international substance. But there we have the Prime Minister of Spain not even mentioning this fourth important coalition leader, as the Prime Minister would picture himself. He was not even mentioned.
The same edition of the Guardian Weekly had a cartoon by Steve Bell that showed a fearsome bull having chucked Aznar on the ground, while the Prime Minister of Britain and the President of the United States were still on it. Once again, there was no mention of the Prime Minister of this country, the man who essentially has tried to indicate to the Australian people that we have somehow enhanced our importance by being such an obsequious, obedient slave of US foreign policy. 
It reminds me, and I have referred to this previously in the parliament, of when we saw the Prime Minister running around Washington, doing his jogging, at the time of the bombings in New York. He was on national television every five minutes. In the United States, one of the major television stations said, `We're now crossing to the only world leader here in the United States at the time of this bombing.' I guess the coalition members thought, `They'll have the Prime Minister of Australia on there now.' No. The only world leader they put on TV was the President of Lithuania, a country of 3.7 million people. I have no disrespect for Lithuanians. I have a lot of time for them. I enjoy the cuisine at their club in Sydney and have reasonable contact with them. But that is the kind of level that this country has reached. The supposed prominence we have due to our servility is not reflected by even European interest in us—nor by US media coverage of our leader.
Previous speakers have referred to the lack of speakers from the coalition on this matter. The coalition have a view that essentially this is irrelevant, that the Australian electorate does not care and that it will not matter. Well, I think they have got some problems. We are seeing that in the aftermath of the attacks on Keelty for saying a realistic thing—that security problems have probably increased as a result of Iraq. He was disciplined for telling people the way he saw it. Whether he is right or wrong, he has a position, he has authority, he has advice, and that is the way he judged it. Unfortunately for this government, 67 per cent of the electorate thinks the same way. Increasingly, despite the fact that the government did have broad public support for its original engagement in this war, this is a political problem for the government.
As many people have said—and I notice the member for Chifley referred to this—the report was leaked. I agree with the member for Chifley about that issue:  if you look at the personnel on this committee, on either side of politics, you see that they are people of high repute. One must question how aspects of this report were leaked and the lack of interest of the government in pursuing the source of those leaks. Fundamentally it is clear that leaks that occurred in relation to this matter were from government ministerial sources.
The other thing that the government have put on the agenda in a big way in recent months is that the supposed justification of Iraq is now that Saddam Hussein was a tyrant and that anyone that opposed the war is a friend and supporter of his et cetera. The Prime Minister himself was emphatically clear about this on 13 March 2003:
... I couldn't justify on its own a military invasion of Iraq to change the regime.
That is what he said. These are not words that we put in his mouth. That was his clear, emphatic statement—that justification for the war could not be based on regime change alone. No-one disputes that it is clearly a change for the better that that regime has gone. I note very clearly that many people on this side of politics were far more critical of Saddam Hussein's regime over many decades—for its activities against the Kurds and Shiites and other religious minorities—than many coalition members. It really is stomach-turning to see these people coming out now and saying that Saddam Hussein was the worst thing in the world and that basically we intervened to get rid of him. It is not true historically—they were not interested. This is essentially an excuse after the event.
Internationally, there is mounting questioning of this. We have had Richard Clarke, the former counterterrorism coordinator of the United States government, and Paul O'Neill, the former United States Treasury Secretary, both saying that the Bush administration was obsessed with Iraq and that it failed to really understand the far more fundamental international danger that was presented by militant extremist Islamic groups. Romano Prodi, the European President, said last week:
I don't think that in reality the situation in the fight against terrorists is better because of the war in Iraq, clearly it's not.
So a wide variety of people internationally are saying that we are not in a safer world because of what is happening. We are clearly in a worse situation. For all of its evil treatment of its people, its aggression against Kuwait and its other acts, historically Iraq was not on the Islamic fundamentalist bandwagon. By Middle Eastern standards it was essentially secularist. The government has failed to understand that what we now have in Iraq is a very difficult situation. The Shiahs have essentially been forced at gunpoint to go along with the making of the constitution—we all know that that is not going to be a good enough long-term result for them—and the Kurds have grave concerns that they will be left on the bench in the long term.
There is an interesting film out at the moment called The Fog of War, with Robert McNamara talking about his experience in the Cuban crisis and in Vietnam. The Americans are now in a quagmire in Iraq. They have grave difficulties extricating themselves from a situation where, daily, police are killed; where people at training bases are attacked; where bombings are occurring; and where terrorist organisations are attempting to increase the hostility between Sunnis and Shiahs. All of these things are not advancing the struggle against terrorism.
We have a situation here where essentially there is no predictability about what is going to occur in Iraq, and there is great interest by the Iranian authorities—they have extensive influence over the Shiah leadership—so the so-called undermining of the terrorist threat is indeed extremely doubtful.
I want to turn to another aspect of this, which is the question of the way in which the United States and Britain essentially seem to have discussed the possibility of bugging other members of the Security Council. The Guardian Weekly of 4-10 March said:
Yet both Ms Short's allegations and Katherine Gun's leaking of a US invitation to Britain to eavesdrop on the six “swing” nations on the UN security council in the run-up to war underline the fact that a level of reassurance is needed that the existing structure does not supply ... Lord Butler should be asked to investigate Ms Short's claims. In the longer term, a case for a proper parliamentary committee, chosen by MPs rather than the prime minister, hearing evidence in open session from MI5 ... and MI6 ... is surely now unanswerable.
So we have questions about the way these countries have operated to try to push this war along and that is now under extreme pressure in the UK.
I heard the other day in parliament selective quoting of David Kay, the CIA's on-the-ground person with regards to weapons of mass destruction. He said quite a few other things that are of more interest to the Australian electorate than the selective references given the other day, I think. He has very much stated emphatically that he doubts the weapons will be found, because they simply were not there. I have a report here that states he welcomes the creation of a bipartisan commission to investigate prewar intelligence on Iraq and has said that the wide-ranging US investigation was more likely to get to the truth than the Butler inquiry in Britain. He, of course, resigned from the Iraq Survey Group, which the CIA appointed him to lead in the hunt for weapon stockpiles, saying that resources had been diverted in the fight against Iraqi insurgence. He said:
I was more worried that we were still sending teams out to search for things that we were increasingly convinced were not there ...
His call for a frank admission is an embarrassment to the White House. He goes on to talk about coming clean with the American people. So the person that the Minister for Foreign Affairs conveniently tries to bring in as a person endorsing part of his position has essentially said that the Bush administration should come clean in regards to the intelligence manipulation that occurred before the war.
On 23 January, in an interview with Reuters, he was asked about what happened to the `stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons that everyone expected to be there'. His reply was, `I don't think they existed.' He was also asked: `You came away from the hunt you have done believing that they did not have any large stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons in the country?' His answer was, `That is correct.' He was asked about the destruction of the weapons: `Do you think that they destroyed them?' He replied: `No, I don't think they existed'. This is the person who was appointed to lead the US examination of stockpiles.
So overall we have a situation where a report has come down and it has clearly said that there are matters of massive concern with regard to intelligence, the way it was used, its provision et cetera. The government has clearly changed its position. It has moved away from ridiculous propositions, which were exposed very early on—such as that there had been contracts with Niger for the purchase of uranium. Within days they were exposed. The minister who had supposedly signed the contracts had not been in the administration of the country for quite a number of years. Internationally, they were exposed at that stage.
We have had a situation since then where the Israelis have said that they knew that Iraq was incapable of—that major allegation—delivering within 15 minutes. The Israelis said, `We knew all along that that was preposterous and wrong, but we did not tell the US or Britain.' Why would they? Quite frankly, if I were the Israelis I would not make that clear to them either, because Iraq does of course present a major problem for Israel. So we have a government that is in retreat. We have a situation where the defence minister yesterday went on the record saying that there were no weapons of mass destruction, we have a Prime Minister who admitted—a year ago even—that it was increasingly doubtful that those weapons would be found. He is still hopeful that they might find something, but it appears they will not.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>ASIO, ASIS and DSD Committee</title>",Committees,27,1
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—Almost a year ago I spoke in the House of Representatives against the Prime Minister's motion on Iraq. I said then, speaking for the fourth time against the Howard government's plan to involve Australia in a pre-emptive strike on Iraq, that the terrible division in Australia over fundamental issues like international and national security was caused by the government's failure to be open and honest with the people of Australia. It is now obvious that the Howard government committed Australia to support a US attack on Iraq when the Prime Minister met with President Bush in July 2002. The government did not take the Australian people into its confidence on this issue and it then did not bother to properly argue the case for the war. The government shamelessly accused anyone opposed to war in Iraq of America bashing, of supporting Saddam Hussein and his horrendous regime and of not supporting Australian troops. All these accusations are offensive, to say the least.
I argued that it was not acceptable for the government to commit Australia to war and place the lives of Australian service men and women under threat and their families under terrible strain without first exhausting every diplomatic option and without providing any evidence of a link between the Iraqi regime and the terrorists that committed the terrible crimes in New York, Bali or anywhere else. The Prime Minister told the Australian parliament and the Australian people that the invasion of Iraq—an invasion that did not have the support of the United Nations; an invasion supported by only a small coalition of the willing which supported President Bush—was necessary to eliminate stockpiles of completed biological and chemical weapons and the reconstitution of Iraq's nuclear weapons capability.
The Howard government committed Australian troops and put the lives of Australian service men and women at risk, making the most serious and important decision any Prime Minister can make, in order to remove stockpiles of weapons so that they could not get into terrorists' hands. In addition to insisting that there were stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, for months before committing Australian troops the Howard government claimed that Iraq's weapons posed an immediate threat to global security. Foreign Minister Downer said publicly on 18 July 2002:
... I don't think there's any doubt about Saddam Hussein having stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons.
For months, this assertion was repeated over and over again. The Prime Minister said on 6 March last year, two weeks before finally committing Australia to war, inter alia:
... why we are concerned about Iraq is that she continues to have chemical and biological weapons ... And there is always the danger that those weapons will get into the hands of terrorists ...
In addition, on 13 March 2003, the Prime Minister told the National Press Club:
... our interests and the interests of a stable peaceful world require that Iraq be disarmed.
The parliamentary joint committee report on Iraq's WMD that we are considering today confirms that, at best, this series of Howard government assertions are fairly described as exaggerations. This report contains at least 12 examples of exaggerations of the Iraqi WMD threat. For example, we now know that the Office of National Assessments report of 6 September 2002 admits that intelligence on Iraq is `slight on the scope and location of Iraq's WMD activities'. We now know from the joint report that the Australian intelligence agencies:
... provided hardly any explicit assessment on the question of the immediacy of threat posed by Saddam Hussein.
When does a series of exaggerations become so constant that they are more fairly or more accurately described as lies? I believe it is when they are used for a base political purpose and risk the lives of Australian service men and women. The Australian people now know this is what has happened here. The Australian people know because, as the war in Iraq progressed and then after the war, the search for weapons suddenly changed to a search for `weapons programs'. As my colleague the member for Griffith and shadow minister for foreign affairs, Mr Kevin Rudd, has correctly said, there is a world of difference between an arsenal and a whiteboard.
In an attempt to defend the indefensible, the Howard government is now arguing that the end justifies the means—that is, the invasion of Iraq was designed to eliminate a dictator so this justifies Australia's participation in the pre-emptive strike. I do not accept this, and I believe Australians deserved to be told the truth about the regime change motive prior to Australia's commitment. Instead, before committing Australia to war, the Prime Minister said that if Iraq had genuinely disarmed, he could not justify an invasion on the basis of regime change. Removing the dictator did not feature once in the formal government legal opinion tabled in the parliament outlining the government's case for war.
The government continually accuses the opposition of supporting Saddam Hussein's regime. Australians understand how offensive that argument is and they also understand that there is the basic argument in democracy that if a government is taking the grave decision of taking the nation to war, the government should be truthful about the reasons for going to war, not invent fresh legal justifications after the event. Recently, the Howard government has claimed that the invasion of Iraq was an integral part of the war against terrorism and that the invasion was necessary to reduce the terrorist threat to Australia and the world. Australians know, and the Howard government knew, the Iraq regime had nothing to do with September 11, Bali or Madrid. All three, and other attacks, were the work of al-Qaeda.
One of the key pieces of intelligence advice the government did not pass on before the war was from the British Joint Intelligence Committee. One month before the war, it asserted that the threat posed by al-Qaeda and associated groups, `would be heightened by military action against Iraq.' We are now slowly learning the full extent of the political cynicism involved in President Bush's decision to focus on Iraq, instead of concentrating all American efforts to combat al-Qaeda, who we know are principally based in Afghanistan. It is obvious the Howard government never bothered to even question the validity of the United States desperately focusing on disarming Iraq instead of facing the more difficult but more urgent task of tackling al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden.
Yesterday, the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill, admitted there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which I believe confirms that the Howard government simply accepted the more politically saleable option of taking out a dictator instead of seriously focusing on al-Qaeda. Through media reports made this week, we now learn that Mr Richard Clarke, President Bush's counterterrorism coordinator at the time of the September 11 attacks, was concerned that the Bush administration was ignoring the threat from al-Qaeda prior to those attacks. In a Sunday Age article last Sunday titled, `Rumsfeld pushed Iraq as “good target”', Ted Bridis reports that Mr Clarke said:
... Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld complained on September 12—
2001—
after the Administration was convinced that al-Qaeda was to blame—that, `there aren't any good targets in Afghanistan, and there are lots of good targets in Iraq'.
...	...	...
He told CBS News he believed the Administration sought to link Iraq with the attacks because of long-standing interest in overthrowing Saddam Hussein.
`I think they wanted to believe that there was a connection between Iraq and the al-Qaeda attacks in the US' ... 
Mr Clarke also explains:
`There's no just connection' ... `There's absolutely no evidence that Iraq was supporting al-Qaeda.'
The base political reaction from the Bush administration that this represents was obviously accepted by the Howard government to its eternal shame.
The Howard government now expects Australia to believe that Australia's participation in the war against Iraq has not increased the terrorist threat against Australia. Australians have seen in recent weeks that the Howard government does not like senior security policy professionals like the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mr Mick Keelty, or Australia's leading terrorism expert, Dr Clive Williams, or the world's leading authority on al-Qaeda, Dr Rohan Gunaratna, stating the obvious or telling Australians the truth. After all, one of the Howard government's supporters—US Ambassador to Australia, His Excellency Mr Tom Schieffer—has suggested the recent Madrid train bombings were probably carried out in reprisal for Spain's support of the Iraq war.
The Howard government prefers to play political word games and, at its worst, savagely rebuke and humiliate—in the case of AFP Commissioner Keelty—anyone who tells the Australian people the truth about the threat to Australia's security. This joint committee report on Australia's prewar intelligence is a damning indictment of the Howard government's handling of this critical international and national security issue. I believe this is a shameful way for any government to handle issues of national security. I do not believe that Australians can trust the Howard government with Australia's national security. The Howard government is always playing politics, putting narrow political interests above the national interest. It is evidence that the Howard government is tired and arrogant and has been in power for far too long. 
You only need to look at Senator Hill's honesty this week—although once again he is retreating and backtracking because doubtless there is pressure from the Prime Minister—with regard to his admission that he does not believe that weapons of mass destruction will be found. I think it is refreshing that Commissioner Keelty was able to come out and tell the truth. Most people, as verified by the Newspoll this week, believe that we are at greater risk of terrorist attack following the tragic events of Madrid. I must also say that I do not think General Peter Cosgrove did himself any favours by coming out to try and effectively neutralise the honesty of Commissioner Keelty.
The government have a lot to account for. We went to war on a false premise. We were fed the argument that there were weapons of mass destruction—nuclear, biological and chemical—and we now know there are not any weapons to be found. Yes, on this side of the House we are glad that the brutal dictator Saddam Hussein has been removed, but we have to live with the consequences of being linked to the coalition of the willing, and who knows what the future holds for Australia as a result of our participation in the war in Iraq.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>ASIO, ASIS and DSD Committee</title>",Committees,27,1
"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—We are debating here today a report from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD into the nature and accuracy of intelligence services relating to Australia's involvement in the war in Iraq. The main reason given by the government for our involvement in the war was that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and therefore there was a threat to the outside world. The Labor Party agreed that Saddam Hussein should be removed but believed that this should have been achieved through the United Nations. No weapons of mass destruction have been found and in hindsight what is critical whenever Australia takes military action, particularly in support of another nation in a faraway country, is that the Australian public at least know the real reasons for our involvement. The people of Australia deserve the right to know. This was never going to happen in the case of Iraq. 
In the chairman's foreword to this report, reference is made to the limitations imposed under which the committee conducted its inquiries:
The Committee's conclusions, therefore, must be qualified. The Committee recommends that a more comprehensive inquiry should be conducted by suitable experts into Australia's intelligence sharing and intelligence liaison arrangements.
The Labor Party has called for the next inquiry to have royal commission status because of the committee's agreed position that it had limited access to intelligence assessment on this particular occasion. It stands to reason that, because of Australia's limited intelligence capacity compared to the United States and the United Kingdom, we would have to rely on the intelligence provided by these two nations and, to some extent, we would be led by the nose by this foreign intelligence.
To support that position, I want to refer to two quotes. One is from Hans Blix, who, of course, has deep knowledge of these particular issues, being a United Nations weapons inspector. The other is from Mr Pritchett, who was the Secretary to the Department of Defence. I will first refer to Hans Blix's comments on the issues that we are debating here today. I refer to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of Wednesday, 10 March. The article is headed, `Stand apart from US, Blix urges'. It says:
The former chief UN weapons inspector, Hans Blix, has called on Australia to be more independent from the US when deciding `questions of war and peace'.
The article goes on, again quoting Hans Blix. It says:
Much of the intelligence supplied to Western leaders had been based on information supplied by Iraqi defectors who `often come up with things interrogators want to hear' or satellite images subsequently shown to have `weaknesses'.
`Perhaps the regret they [coalition leaders] have now is they did not let us continue with inspections for some months,' ... `We would have gone to even more sites given by intelligence, and since there weren't any weapons of mass destruction we wouldn't have found any. They would have realised the intelligence they had was not good.'
`It seems they paid too much attention to what [Iraqi] defectors were saying.'
That is a fairly damning statement, I believe, by Hans Blix, relating to whether there were weapons of mass destruction there in the first place. To back that statement up, I refer to a comment on page 42 of the report. The report quotes Mr Pritchett, former Secretary to the Department of Defence. It says:
Mr Pritchett ... argued that there was an inbuilt imbalance in our relationship with our allies and that as a result `our understanding and our policy can be, or is, already largely shaped'. Independence was, he believed, an unrealistic expectation. He warned that there was a need to be sensitive to any `unconscious bias in Australian intelligence advice supportive of US and British plans.
Quite clearly, Mr Pritchett is saying that we were unnecessarily influenced by the information supplied by the intelligence people from the US and the United Kingdom.
It has been suggested that Saddam Hussein was trying to convince the world that he had weapons of mass destruction. This was hardly a good enough reason to go to war. The Australian government and the Australian people needed to know exactly what weapons of mass destruction Saddam Hussein had, not what deception he was trying to impose on the rest of the world. I would like to refer to page 88 of the report where, in paragraph 5.4, the Prime Minister is quoted as saying:
`Our goal is disarmament.' `I couldn't justify on its own a military invasion of Iraq to change the regime. I've never advocated that.' Central to the threat, he—
that is, the Prime Minister—
said, was Iraq's `possession of chemical and biological weapons and its pursuit of nuclear capability'.
So, using the Prime Minister's own words, the military invasion was unjust because all it did was change the regime, which on its own, as the Prime Minister himself said, did not justify military invasion.
The report also refers to comments made by the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, who supported the Prime Minister's position. The minister is quoted as saying: 
Locating, securing and disposing of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities must and will be a major objective for the coalition. We must achieve the disarmament of Iraq. The focus will be on weapons and delivery systems, biological and chemical agents, weapons and dual-use infrastructure, and Iraq's technical and scientific expertise.
So the major objective of going to war in Iraq disappeared into thin air as there were no weapons of mass destruction found by the United Nations weapons inspectors before the invasion and none found by the United States forces after the invasion. There may have been good reasons to believe that Saddam Hussein did have weapons of mass destruction. As the report said: 
History informed the expectations of Saddam Hussein's behaviour: he had used the weapons before, so he would use them again. Iraq had a `record of aggression and a willingness to use weapons of mass destruction ... He has used them against his neighbours. He has used them against his own people.' `Militarism and aggression are the foundations of his empire.'
So, hypothetically, it could be said that he had weapons of mass destruction but in fact he did not, and that is the big difference. That is really what our intelligence agencies are there to advise us on—what is the hypothetical position and what is the true position? This is where our intelligence, which was supplied by the United States and the United Kingdom, possibly fell down.
It could be said, therefore, that the Australian government sent Australians to war in an area outside our sphere of influence based on what was clearly only circumstantial evidence. One of the good outcomes of the inquiry is that the next inquiry should focus on how to improve outcomes of Australia's intelligence agencies. This would be in Australia's best interest. This inquiry established that the government was loose with the truth on national security. The report highlighted intelligence failures and that this government was selective in its use of this intelligence. This government decided to go to war without concrete evidence about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. This report proves that. The joint parliamentary committee, which included government members, found that the government's claim that Iraq `posed a grave and unacceptable threat' was not backed by Australia's spy assessments.
I will quote from an article in the Financial Review on 2 March entitled `Howard fails intelligence test', which claims that the government is in deep denial over the intelligence it received in the lead-up to military action. The article begins: `Denial or deception? Or both?' It then states:
The Prime Minister, John Howard, and Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer led the charge, with Downer telling parliament the inquiry had shown the government did not “sex up” intelligence or the threat from Saddam Hussein's Iraq. 
Downer made this claim despite the plain language of paragraphs 5.16 and 5.17 on page 93 of the committee report. 
The article then quotes those two paragraphs: 
“5.16: Therefore, the case made by the government was that Iraq possessed WMD in large quantities and posed a grave and unacceptable threat to the region and the world, particularly as there was a danger that Iraq's WMD might be passed to terrorist organisations.
“5.17: This is not the picture that emerges from an examination of all the assessments provided to the committee by Australia's two analytical agencies [the Office of National Assessments and the Defence Intelligence Organisation].”
The article itself then says: 
Make no mistake; this is a very damaging report for the government. It is also damaging to the Office of National Assessments, which is shown, after mid-September 2002, to have been “inconsistent and changeable” on critical questions and to have become increasingly assertive under the influence of claims being made in Britain and the United States.
So the joint committee's report clearly highlights some serious problems. The government was selective in the use of its intelligence. This government grossly exaggerated Iraq's weapons of mass destruction for its own political gains. This is again spelt out in paragraph 5.20 of the report:
The statements by the Prime Minister and Ministers are more strongly worded than most of the AIC judgements. This is in part because they quote directly from the findings of the British and American intelligence agencies. In particular, in the 4 February 2003 speech to the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister quoted the findings of Joint Intelligence Committee of the UK and the key judgements of the National Intelligence Estimate of the CIA. In both of these documents the uncertainties had been removed and they relied heavily on the surge of new and largely untested intelligence, coming, in the US at least, from Iraqi defectors.
Clearly we see once again where Australia's government used information provided by the intelligence agents of these other organisations—information that, in fact, was not factual.
The report specifically warned about the dangers of policy driven studies where analysts are indirectly pressured to make their assessments conform with policy decisions taken by governments. The committee unanimously goes on to say that mere weapons programs alone are not sufficient to provide a basis for justifying a war. As I mentioned earlier, the Prime Minister, in his own words, stated that he could not justify military invasion solely on the basis of regime change—he never advocated that; his goal was disarmament. So quite clearly, based on his own words, the decision to go into Iraq was incorrect.
Finally, we talk about disarmament, but disarmament of what? There was no real evidence that Iraq possessed these weapons of mass destruction. Maybe they had them at some stage in the past but certainly not at the time of the invasion. The Prime Minister joined the coalition of the willing to change the regime in Iraq, even though, in his own words, he could not justify it. He sent our troops off to war without solid evidence of these weapons of mass destruction, so he misled the Australian people. Labor believes that any independent inquiry should not be led by a recent head of an intelligence agency, nor should it be headed by anybody without sustainable intelligence expertise. Especially in this current climate, the Australian people deserve to have first-class intelligence agencies. They should be able to feel confident that these agencies are fulfilling their duties to the Australian public and are free from political interference—such as telephone calls from the Prime Minister's chief of staff.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>ASIO, ASIS and DSD Committee</title>",Committees,27,1
"George, Jennie, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—The unanimous all-party parliamentary report on prewar intelligence makes very compelling reading. The government should take no comfort from its findings. I think it is a very damaging report for the Howard government. The report exposes the deception and the spin that was used by the government when it agreed to follow the United States into a pre-emptive military attack on Iraq. The Australian people will not be fooled. Sending people to war, putting lives at risk, is a decision that transcends party politics, and people expect and should be told the truth. This report exposes just how loose with the truth this government was in the lead-up to the war on Iraq.
In the many months preceding the war, we heard the government repeat their arguments in support of joining the coalition of the willing. Essentially they had four main arguments to defend their position. The first was that Iraq's possession of chemical and biological weapons and its pursuit of a nuclear capability posed a threat to the security and stability of the world and Australia. The second was that, despite the efforts of the UN, Iraq had held onto its WMDs and that our goal as a nation was to join to disarm Iraq.
The Prime Minister consistently indicated that the imperative was disarmament and not regime change, although I note that now the defence has changed somewhat. But he did say that on numerous occasions, and I will quote just one example from the Prime Minister:
... I couldn't justify on its own a military invasion of Iraq to change the regime. I've never advocated that.
So the goal essentially was to disarm Iraq and the argument was advanced that Iraq could potentially pass on its WMDs to terrorist organisations. If you look at the report, these constant themes are repeated in speeches made by both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
That weapons of mass destruction existed is really taken for granted in all the government's statements in the lead-up to the war. For example, in February 2003 the PM stated:
... Iraq must not be allowed to possess weapons of mass destruction ... it must be disarmed.
Similarly, he said:
The Australian government knows that Iraq still has chemical and biological weapons and that Iraq wants to develop nuclear weapons.
So from the beginning this government was always definitive about the existence of weapons of mass destruction. The report of the parliamentary joint committee shed some interesting light on how the government came to these conclusions. How was it that the government could be so definitive? Page 89 of the report states:
The evidence evinced in support of these arguments within the government's speeches was not merely a matter of quoting intelligence. The arguments were based on a mixture of historical experience, first principle hypotheses, deductive logic, assumption and assertion, as well as specific intelligence.
Therefore, the committee argues, the case made by the government was that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction in large quantities and posed a grave and unacceptable threat to the region and the world, particularly as there was a danger that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction might be passed on to terrorist organisations. But in the very exact next statement, the committee concludes as follows:
This—
that is, the government's conclusion—
is not the picture that emerges from an examination of all the assessments provided to the Committee by Australia's two analytical agencies.
That in itself is an amazing statement, for the committee is saying that the government's public utterances and their rationale for war on Iraq went well beyond the assessments being provided to them by Australia's intelligence agencies.
Australia went outside the framework of the UN Security Council because we were told that intelligence had revealed that Iraq continued to possess and indeed was increasing its store of weapons of mass destruction. The consequent danger that Iraq posed, we were told, was considered to be serious enough to warrant a pre-emptive war in order to forcibly disarm Iraq. We could not even wait for the weapons inspectors to finalise their work. The coalition of the willing rejected the case put by Hans Blix and others for more time to conclude the task that the UN had given them. And yet I again repeat the committee's conclusion that the picture that was presented by the government did not conform with an `examination of all the assessments' being provided by Australia's two analytical agencies.
The report notes, at page 54, that changes occurred in the nature and tone of some assessments and that the sudden variation in the assessments provided from ONA between 12 September and 13 September is, in the words of the committee, `difficult to explain'. They go on to say:
It is so sudden a change in judgement that it appears ONA, at least unconsciously, might have been responding to `policy running strong'.
What do these words—`policy running strong'—mean? The best explanation is provided in Hansard by comments made by the shadow minister for foreign affairs and international security. He says `policy running strong' means:
... an intelligence community which sees the fact that government, to all intents and purposes, has made an internal decision to go to war—a policy and political decision already taken—and then subtle, indirect, covert influence being exercised on the intelligence community to shape their analyses in a manner which fits the policy and political decision already taken. If you look back at the chronology of 2002, that is precisely what happened. The intelligence community is made up of intelligent people. They saw a government whose Prime Minister and foreign minister went to Washington in the middle of 2002. They saw a Prime Minister address the US Congress and come back. Internally, the debate then began in Canberra as to what quantum the Australian military commitment would be to Iraq—not whether there would be one but what quantum it would be. The internal debate began about whether there would be an Australian battalion committed to Iraq, and we all remember that debate well. It surfaced from time to time in parts of the Australian media.
The intelligence community, therefore, by September 2002 had gotten the message loud and clear that this government was taking us off to war. 
DIO retained sceptical views throughout the period under examination. As I said earlier, according to the committee the ONA assessments changed at about 13 September and they became more assertive and less qualified in their advice.
The assessments provided to the government, together with the response to the Prime Minister's visit to the United States, make it very clear that `policy running strong' meant that the intelligence agencies knew full well what the thinking and commitments were on the part of the Prime Minister. Now the world has heard from the Iraq Survey Group and it is now unchallenged that this group is the final arbiter on the accuracy of the prewar intelligence. Its head, Dr David Kay, reported to the US Congress on 1 October 2003. He reported that the team had found no evidence of actual weapons of mass destruction or of recent weapons of mass destruction related production.
This committee report found that insofar as Australia's intelligence assessments are concerned:
... the pre-war assessments that now appear to be most accurate are those that were most sceptical. These were, after September 2002, largely the assessments provided by DIO.
So the government's emphatic claims about the existence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction have now been totally exposed. Just as importantly, on the question of the immediacy of a threat from Iraq the committee found there was a `gap' on this matter. The report states:
Assessments by Australian agencies about possible degradation of agents and restricted delivery capability cast doubt on the suggestion that the Iraqi `arsenal' represented a `grave and immediate' and a `real and unacceptable' threat.
The report of this committee confirms for me that my opposition to a pre-emptive military intervention and war on Iraq was the correct position. Peaceful and diplomatic means to compel Iraq to comply with UN Security Council resolutions had not been exhausted before pre-emptive military action was taken. The hawks in the US administration were always about regime change and it is of no surprise that they continued to exaggerate Iraq's capabilities and to inflate the risk. Our Prime Minister, while arguing that Australia's intervention was not about regime change, conveniently uses that as a justification for his own position now that weapons of mass destruction have not been found.
The committee rightly ask, at paragraph 4.77:
Did we—
that is, Australia—
test the US motives and intentions and make an analysis against our own interests?
By that they mean, I think: `Did at all times the government put Australia's national interest at the fore?' The report states:
None of the assessments presented to the Committee contained any assessments of US motives. Some discussion occurred at the hearings. DIO said that such assessments were made. Beyond the following comment, however, the Committee saw no such assessments.
The comment the committee draw on was made in transcript by DIO and it is, I think, a very critical comment. DIO said:
We made a judgement here in Australia, too, that the United States was committed to military action against Iraq. We had the view that that was, in a sense, independent of the intelligence assessment.
Having read the report and carefully considered its contents, I think it is reasonable for me to conclude that the Howard government acted in a precisely similar manner—that it was committed to support its ally the United States in a pre-emptive military attack on Iraq and that the government's decision was in a sense independent of the aggregated intelligence assessments it was receiving.
I want to conclude by quoting a comment made in the report by the US deputy commander in Iraq on 26 June 2003. General Abizaid said:
Intelligence was the most accurate I've seen on the tactical level, probably the best I've seen on the operational level and perplexingly incomplete on the strategic level with regard to Weapons of Mass Destruction.
He continues:
It is perplexing to me ... that we have not found weapons of mass destruction when the evidence was so persuasive that it would exist ... I can offer no reasonable explanation.
On that, I rest my case.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>ASIO, ASIS and DSD Committee</title>",Committees,27,1
"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—The report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD asks the basic question: was the intelligence dodgy or did the government just make it up as it went along? I think the answer, if you read report, is: it was a little bit of both. The government response to the intelligence that it was receiving was selective at best. It is very important, as the member for Throsby has pointed out, that the report looks at the issue that it was not just the government responding to the intelligence but also the intelligence responding to the government—the report points to the issue of policy running strong. Why does this matter? It matters for a very important reason. We have put Australian men and women, our soldiers, in harm's way on the basis of misinformation, mistakes and dodgy intelligence. It matters also because the cost to Iraq has been enormous. The Prime Minister gets up day after day and the Minister for Foreign Affairs gets up day after day and they say that any opposition to this war in Iraq is the same thing as supporting the regime of Saddam Hussein. It is not the same thing at all. When we send troops to war they should be sent on the basis of sound logic, sound reasoning and established international principles. This has just not been the case in this instance.
It has been made very clear to us, now that there have been no weapons of mass destruction found, that really the government was concerned all along about Saddam Hussein's human rights record. I think it is fair to say that there has been no concern about his human rights record for decades and that this is an ex post facto excuse to explain the fact that the government's stated reasons for going to war have been unfulfilled. This is important, not just because of our soldiers and what the people of Iraq have suffered but also because we cannot run international relations in this way. We cannot make it up as we go along—invade a country and then say afterwards, `It wasn't an imminent threat we were worried about; it was their human rights record.' That is not a way for us to behave in the world.
It is pretty clear—from Clarke's book, as well as all of the information that we had during and even before the war—that President Bush saw an invasion of Iraq as finishing the job that his father had started and that there was an obsession within the Bush administration with going to war with Iraq. This is not something that I am saying; this is something that people who are experts in American intelligence are saying and have said all the way along. It is clear that the disarmament and inspections regimes were never going to be allowed to do their work properly, because if they ran their course and Iraq was effectively disarmed then whom would President Bush have gone to war with? What is particularly concerning about this is that the government is saying in this report, `Oh well, I suppose maybe we did get it wrong. Maybe the intelligence that was coming to us was not 100 per cent.' The report says in particular that the Australian agencies claim that they did not know until very late that there were dissenting views within the US agencies on issues like uranium from Africa because the classified US national intelligence estimate was not supplied to them for four months after its US release in 2002. But you did not need classified information to have doubts about the intelligence that we were basing our decision to go to war on.
There was a great deal of information in the public domain that made people sceptical about the decision to go to war. I know that you, Madam Deputy Speaker Corcoran, along with the member for Throsby, the member for Oxley and many others—the vast majority of people in the Labor opposition and the minor parties—were very sceptical about the information that we were receiving from the Australian government and about what was coming out of the UK and the US. It is not that we have any particular access to any information that the Australian intelligence agencies did not have access to; on the contrary, we were just looking at what was available on the public record.
If you look at the information contained in the Hans Blix reports of 27 January 2003, 14 February 2003 and 7 March 2003, it would lead you to say that verification was proceeding pretty much according to plan and that, given enough time, the United Nations would be able to be confident that there were not weapons of mass destruction. Indeed, in his report dated 19 March, Dr Blix outlines his: 
... sadness that three and a half months of work carried out in Iraq have not brought the assurances needed about the absence of weapons of mass destruction or other proscribed items in Iraq ...
So he says that, no, there are not assurances, and: 
... no more time is available for our inspections and armed action now seems imminent.
From his earlier reports and from that comment you can see how Dr Blix was eager to have further reporting time. In the report given to the UN Security Council on 27 January 2003, Dr Blix says:
In the past two months during which we have built up our presence in Iraq, we have conducted about 300 inspections in more than 230 different sites. 
	...	...	...
By the end of December, UNMOVIC began using helicopters both for the transport of inspectors and for actual inspection work. We now have eight helicopters. They have already proved invaluable in helping to `freeze' large sites by observing movement of traffic in and around the area.
	...	...	...
We have now an inspection apparatus which permits us to send multiple inspection teams, every day, all over Iraq, by road or by air. 
In his report of 14 February Dr Blix talks about the build-up of inspection capability. He says that they have got eight helicopters and 400 inspectors, all without notice to the Iraqis. He says that they always have had access promptly given, that they have been given access to a wide range of sites, that they have obtained a good knowledge of the industrial and scientific landscape of Iraq, that more than 200 chemical and 100 biological samples have been collected at different sites and that the results to date—and I stress this—have been consistent with Iraq's declarations.
Dr Blix also said: `We're fully aware that many governmental intelligence organisations are convinced and assert that proscribed weapons, items and programs continue to exist. Governments have many sources of information that are not available to inspectors.' He said:
Inspectors, for their part, must base their reports only on the evidence, which they can, themselves, examine and present publicly. Without evidence confidence cannot arise.
So Dr Blix is saying that, with fairly good access, they—both UNMOVIC and the International Atomic Energy Agency—are fairly confident that the period of disarmament could be short.
There was also, a great deal of information from alternative sources. There was an excellent book by Scott Ritter, the American assistant to Mr Richard Butler, who was the head of the first UNSCOM team. The book by Scott Ritter, War on Iraq—What Team Bush Doesn't Want You to Know, was written before the pre-emptive strike on Iraq. It pointed out, on the very good basis of Mr Ritter's own research and inspection experience in Iraq, that the reasons that were given for going to war were thin. Mr Ritter pointed out that, in relation to nuclear weapons, in 1998 the infrastructure and facilities were 100 per cent eliminated, although the organisation of scientists remained. He said in his book:
... for Iraq to re-acquire a nuclear weapons capability, they would have to basically build from the ground up, enrichment and weaponisation capabilities that would cost tens of billions of dollars.
They also would have needed electrical production much in excess of their capability, and what they would have produced and used would have been easily detected.
In relation to chemical weapons, which were originally produced at the Muthamama state establishment, that establishment was bombed during the first Gulf War. Its total destruction was supervised by the United Nations after the war. Any hidden chemicals would have been, to quote Mr Ritter, `harmless goo', because the shelf life of most chemical weapons is about five years. So his conclusion is that the talk of Iraq having chemical weapons was no longer valid. Mr Ritter also talked about biological weapons in much the same way. He said Iraq had no biological weapons because both the anthrax and botulin toxin are useless. He said:
For Iraq to have biological weapons today, they'd have to reconstitute a biological manufacturing base.
Remnant quantities of these substances would have been useless after three years. Further, in relation to a delivery system, in 1998 Iraq was, according to optimistic estimates, five years away from having a delivery system, even if the sanctions had been lifted—that is, a delivery system that would have threatened the United States and its interests. The bottom line is that Iraq does not have the capability to fire long-range ballistic missiles.
Finally, the fallback position that the Bush administration used and that John Howard was happy to support was that Iraq had terrorist links. There are probably more terrorists in Iraq today than there were before the war. Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator, but at least he was a secular dictator. When it comes to linking him with fundamentalist organisations like al-Qaeda, there is no proven evidence of such links. Indeed, there is evidence that Osama bin Laden has called Saddam Hussein an apostate and suggested that he was not hardline enough about the radical Muslim cause. So the idea that somehow going to war with Iraq was going to help fight terrorism has, I think, been pretty firmly knocked on the head.
It is interesting to look at what people were saying overseas. In 2001 Colin Powell declared this about Saddam Hussein: 
He has not developed any significant capability with respect to weapons of mass destruction ... our policies have strengthened the security of the neighbours of Iraq ...
Tony Blair told the House of Commons in November 2000:
We believe that the sanctions regime has effectively contained Saddam Hussein ...
That seemed to be the view of the overseas intelligence services and weapons inspectors of the time. It seems that most of the intelligence that has been marshalled to justify the case for war comes from untested sources. Our own joint committee report says:
Only two in 10 reports came from tested sources and it was not clear how many actual sources were involved in this increased reporting. The Committee was unable to examine the quality and clarity of this information received from overseas.
The problem is that our intelligence organisations were not examining that either. A lot of the reports seemed to come from Mr Chalabi's Iraqi National Council and its paid sources. The idea that Australia would make decisions about putting our troops in harm's way and going to war against Iraq on the basis of untested intelligence information—much of which was paid for, with the middleman being the person who stood to gain the most from the US attacks on Iraq—to me seems like a case of incredibly sloppy decision making and our country has certainly been the worse for it.

"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—I am happy to join my colleagues who are speaking on the report produced by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD entitled Intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. This gives us a chance to not only reflect upon what the committee looked at but also to take into account the fact that the committee undertook the task of looking at these issues because there were a series of fundamental questions about the accuracy of the intelligence before the war and there were related questions about the government's use of that intelligence, however accurate or inaccurate it was.
I think at the outset I can say that, if you want to have a war and if you want to go to war, it is often best if you can actually organise and marshal your arguments and organise and marshal agencies to give you a set of reasons for going to war. We know that prior to going to war with Iraq the one fundamental, simple, direct position put by the Australian government was that Iraq, under the despotic leadership of Saddam Hussein, had a massive program of weapons of mass destruction and Australia's participation in the war was bent towards stopping the dangerous things that would occur in the region and the world because of the existence of that pile of chemical, biological and—potentially—nuclear weapons. That justified Australia's part in being one of the members of the troika that went to war with Iraq, with some attendant assistance. So, joining the United States and Britain, that was Australia's fundamental reason.
We know that there have been investigations in the United States as well. They are referred to in the back of this report. There is an appendix on judgments made in the United States in 2002 and 2003 on the accuracy of intelligence that the United States relied on. We also know in fact that the United States had not one but about five reasons to go to war, and one of the reasons that they had five reasons instead of one is that the executive government in the United States could not come to a final and determined position in relation to the question of what to do with Iraq. The executive government was split.
On the one side we had Colin Powell, the former commander of US forces—directly involved in prosecuting the original Gulf War against Iraq in 1990-91—effectively taking a dovish position on the question of what to do in relation to Iraq. On the other side were the real military hardheads—Wolfowitz and others—who were bent upon building the case for war against Iraq, for a range of reasons. The first reason was the supposed existence of massive arsenals of weapons of mass destruction, and the second was the fact that regime change was needed and demanded in Iraq. President Bush, in arguing his case, fundamentally argued the hardline approach of Wolfowitz, Perle and others of his advisers—and of Vice President Dick Cheney—and they eventually took that road. The approach was based more on their preconceptions than on the intelligence they had received.
What is dealt with here in this report in terms of the adequacy of Australian intelligence is an astounding story of just how poorly our intelligence agencies coped with the task they were given of trying to work out whether or not Iraq had a weapons of mass destruction program. In part you cannot blame them, because this was a relatively closed society with a past history of weapons of mass destruction programs. We know that in the war between Iraq and Iran the United States actively supported Iraq logistically. They did so because Iraq was a secular state fighting against a state that had undergone a fundamentalist Islamic revolution. That was an eight-year war in which more than one million people died, and the logistic support from the United States and the training of Iraqi troops helped Iraq to fight more effectively against the United States in the Gulf War of 1990-91.
We also know, from what was uncovered as a result of the Gulf War, that there were stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons. We know that they had been used against the Kurds. We know that they were used against the Marsh Arabs and the Shiah in the South. We know that the world effectively turned a blind eye to that, as it turned a blind eye to the use of weapons of mass destruction during the Iraq-Iran war. In that long period after the Gulf War the world did not go in and intervene because inappropriate weapons—chemical and biological—had been used or because there was a great threat of their use. Instead, the world attempted to use the sanction regime against Iraq and tried to screw down Iraq's inappropriate behaviours.
We also know that part of the background to this report, in terms of the intelligence, was Richard Butler's work in attempting to do what Hans Blix later tried to do, which was to verify whether there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq or not. The great fundamental lesson to come out of this is that intelligence agencies and governments reliant upon those reports that come through need to take into account the fact that they can have the wool pulled over their eyes by someone who has not got the resources. In this case it was someone who, prior to the Gulf War, presented himself and his government as pretenders to regional power. The Syrians wanted to be a regional power in the Middle East, and Iraq had a much greater pretension to that role. When it went into Kuwait, it sought to establish its hegemony over the area, not just in words but in deeds. There was a lot of bluff and bluster. That was actually matched by weapons of mass destruction in the Iraq-Iran war and the existence of those prior to the Gulf War, but the great thing that has been uncovered finally after this last war is the fact that Saddam Hussein was tremendous at bluff and bluster.
You would have thought the intelligence agencies should have been able to carve their way through that bluff and bluster to get some idea of the fact that this bloke did not have much at all—that all of the attempts to frustrate the work of Richard Butler and others, four years before this last war, constituted a mechanism to hide the fact that this was an emperor with no clothes when it came to weapons of mass destruction. I cannot blame the agencies for being so deluded or governments around the world for being so deluded, but it is something we need to take into account when assessing the perils that face us. If we do not have a much better intelligence assessment of what is going on—if we do not have people on the ground or people from within those communities and countries, closed as they might be, to get an intelligent assessment of what we are actually facing—then we cannot take the appropriate responses.
Iraq was one of three countries that the Bush regime identified as posing a fundamental threat to world order and peace. We know that the two other identified countries—North Korea and Iran—really do have weapons of mass destruction programs. We know that they have nuclear programs. It is demonstrable in relation to North Korea and it has also been demonstrable in the past in relation to Iran. They are countries which have not been taken to task for the possession of weapons of mass destruction when we know that possession of such weapons is palpably the case. But one of the lessons from this report is the fact that, if you base your approach to these countries on a moral or ethical ground and you determine—whatever the source of intelligence available to you—that you are going to go to war with those countries or that you will disarm them and break their weapons of mass destruction programs, then maybe you had better have some really decent intelligence to start off with. If you do not know what you are fighting, you can get yourself into a total quagmire.
It is one of those instances in terms of openness and accountability, as I spoke of yesterday, where you can say that there is a whole series of problems. If the intelligence agencies have been deficient then one of the reasons they might have been deficient is that the government really did not want to know the answers anyway. In the Yes Minister program—which is instructive in a whole range of areas, including this one—we could look at cabinet secretary Sir Arnold, Sir Humphrey Appleby's friend. In the opening episode of the series, I think, he said, `If people don't know what you're doing, they can't know what you're doing wrong.' So if you do not ask the questions of the intelligence agencies that would lead to sensible answers, if you pretend that you have not had information presented to you which in fact you have or you deny knowledge of it, or if you try to build a case without an adequate foundation, then you can attempt to get away with just about anything and everything.
We have seen that over the past year or so and it worries me. The sensible thing would be to say that the government have a difference of opinion with some of their agencies, some of the people who work for them, people who are commenting or the opposition. They have a different point of view. They thought we were justified in going into Iraq, and that was on the single basis of the expectation that there were weapons of mass destruction. What is wrong with the government just coming forward and saying, `The intelligence might have been a bit faulty, but we didn't expect this bloke to be all bluff and bluster'?
Basically, they have not found any of those weapons yet because there are not any. Saddam seems to have done away with most of them after the Gulf War. He said he had, but no-one believed him, because you could not believe this bloke anyway. You are left with a situation where the government is now making a great show of the fact that weapons programs were discovered. Those issues are dealt with in this report as well, but the shadow minister for foreign affairs and international security has been quite correct in saying that there is a whole world of difference between an arsenal and a whiteboard. An arsenal is going to do a great deal of damage; a whiteboard will not do much damage, except to selected ministers in past governments and maybe future ones. 
The question of how reliant we should be on our intelligence agencies is always a fundamental one for any government. Playing politics with how you get information out of those agencies or with what they give you—in this case, in trying to justify what I think was an unjustifiable approach in terms of the government's reasoning behind why they went to war—is unacceptable. They could have said, `It's not just weapons of mass destruction.' There are four other instances where one of the coalition partners stated a whole range of other reasons. Ex post facto, the Prime Minister has laid a great deal of stress, as has the foreign minister, on regime change as being the fundamental reason they have gone in. The fact of Saddam Hussein's regime having fallen justifies everything else, even if there were not too many weapons of mass destruction to be found.
The core issue here is a disjunction between intelligence agencies and the work they have done—however well or poorly they have been able to operate—and the fact that the government really were not concerned about finding out what the core realities were, because what they may have found out would have been uncomfortable for them. They wanted to proceed to war without knowing too much about what might be problematic. Case after case in what the parliamentary committee has looked at shows you that, if you blunder ahead with a war purpose in mind, you can get yourself into a hell of a lot of trouble.
In particular, this government, in trying to explain itself out of the situation afterwards, has found that it is not really a great idea to overbuild a case and, in overbuilding that case, to say that you were then reliant upon the intelligence information that you got. It is exactly the same problem that the Blair government faces. Overbuilding and overselling on the basis of an inadequately examined series of postulates can lead you to an unfounded reason for doing the most important thing a government can do—that is, put the lives of its citizens at risk in sending them to war. I am grateful that this report has been done so well by both sides of the parliament. I am happy to comment on it, because we should learn a great deal from it.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—I too rise to make some comments upon the inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD into the handling of prewar intelligence on Iraq. I agree with many of the comments made by Labor members in commending the members and the secretariat of the parliamentary joint committee. It is important to note that this report is a great example of the parliament operating effectively and in a nonpartisan way to try to elicit the facts from what is a very blurred subject—that is, what did go on and what intelligence was being received and handed to our government before the decision was made by the Prime Minister and the executive to embark upon a war without the sanction of the United Nations and, as we know now, without the main justification for embarking upon that war? It is incumbent upon parliamentary committees to inquire properly into these matters. There can be no greater decision for any government of any nation than to prosecute a war against another sovereign state. Therefore, it is critical that we analyse dispassionately any deficiencies and commend any strengths of our processes in making such important decisions.
I think it is fair to say that, notwithstanding the fact that the report was handed down unanimously, there are some clear concerns that have to be raised in this forum and in the public domain at large. The fact is that, firstly, it is clear that the evidence upon which the Prime Minister relied to embark upon a war was not unequivocal and was not certain. Indeed, it is important to note that the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and other members of the government made comments prior to going to war that exaggerated or contradicted in some areas the intelligence they were receiving from our agencies. That is not to say that the agencies' conduct was perfect or that the system that we have in place is by any means perfect. But I think if we are to blame anybody for some of the deficiencies that led to the reasoning behind the government's decision, we have to look at the way in which the Prime Minister chose to use information that he was receiving and that his cabinet were receiving to make these decisions. 
I think that, as members have already indicated, it is fair to say that we have had the Prime Minister revise history since the official end of the war. We have had the Prime Minister shift fundamentally from the need to remove so-called weapons of mass destruction from the hands of Saddam Hussein, from his regime—because, in the Prime Minister's view, it posed a threat to our nation and our citizens—to the need for regime change. It does not take a scholar to glean from all of the public comments by the Prime Minister, either in the parliament or elsewhere, prior to making the decision to send our young men and women to war, that regime change featured very little in his consideration. That may well be because he did not believe he would be able to convince the public at large that we should send thousands of our young men and women so far away to fight in a war, prosecute a war, on that basis. There is no doubting that the regime that has come to an end was an awful, autocratic, violent regime. I think all members of the House are happy to see that regime come to an end. But there is a question of accountability. I think there has been a failure on the part of the Prime Minister to properly deduce from the information received and then to properly deliberate upon this matter. 
In the short time I have before this debate is adjourned, I would like to point out some of those failures that were recorded in the report. The report says that there are four intelligence issues—uranium for Africa, importation of aluminium tubes, mobile biological laboratories and UAVs for biological weapons programs—that were considered fundamental to the existence of weapons of mass destruction and the capacity of Iraq to use them.
The first three issues were used at various stages by the Howard government—the Prime Minister in particular—to establish his case for weapons of mass destruction. Indeed, the report says in sections 1.38 to 1.49 that these issues were either wrong or disputed or both. And the fourth issue remains unproven. So it would appear that the Prime Minister had already failed to have proper regard to the caveats placed by the intelligence agencies on those matters before using them as some of the reasons at least for this country embarking upon a war.
I would like to proceed with some other matters which go to further intelligence failures—that is, between the agency and the government, and indeed some of the areas where I think the government misled the parliament and the Australian people—but I am mindful of the time. I do not want to be cut off mid-sentence, but there are a whole host of things I wish to comment on once this matter returns to the House. I therefore seek leave to continue my remarks when the debate is resumed.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—I am speaking in continuation on the report on the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD entitled Intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. I was saying that I believe the government insulted the Australian people by not levelling with them about the real reasons that they saw fit to commit our young personnel to an invasion of Iraq. I notice that on a number of occasions when our personnel have returned to Australian shores the Prime Minister has said, as he said on 16 June 2003:
We went to war in a just cause, on a proper legal basis, to liberate an oppressed people ...
He also said, on 13 March 2003 at the National Press Club:
Well I would have to accept that if Iraq had genuinely disarmed, I couldn't justify on its own a military invasion of Iraq to change the regime. I've never advocated that. 
On 18 March 2003, the liberation of the people of Iraq from the tyrannical government of Saddam Hussein was seen as a benefit of an invasion of Iraq, not as a major cause for the invasion, yet thereafter it has allegedly become the primary reason that Australia joined with the so-called coalition of the willing to invade Iraq.
The report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD has made a number of claims concerning what can only be termed as exaggeration or omission, in not taking into account qualifications made by our intelligence agencies—intelligence agencies, we would have to say, which were greatly underresourced when their information and their assessments were taken into account by the government in going into Iraq. I notice that this government, belatedly, has now made a great public fanfare of increasing resources and finances to our intelligence agencies—something that we should have been doing long before the decision to go into Iraq. I think everyone on all sides of the parliament would agree with that, because intelligence is the key to carrying out a successful war on terrorism. 
The conclusion I make about Australia's involvement in Iraq is that, in many ways, it was a diversion of important resources that should have been directed to the war against terrorism. What I would say since—and what Commissioner Keelty has said since—is that our involvement in Iraq has made Australia even more of a potential recipient of terrorist activities. That is known by 99.9 per cent of Australians who think about this—it is just commonsense. Commissioner Keelty was remonstrated with by the Prime Minister and other senior ministers and, of course, the `minister for over the top', the `minister for clowns'—the foreign minister—carried out his continual insults—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order: I ask you to have him withdraw that highly offensive comment and refer to the minister by his appropriate title.
 (Hon. B.C. Scott)—I was about to do that before the member for Petrie stood and sought the call. The member for Braddon will withdraw those offensive remarks. 
—I withdraw the offensive remarks that you deem to be offensive.
—Thank you. You will facilitate the Main Committee if you will withdraw them unreservedly. The member for Braddon will proceed.
—The foreign minister, in his usual over-the-top performance, equated the comments of our highly reputable commissioner to the continuing propaganda of al-Qaeda. What an insult! He labelled anyone who opposed this war as an appeaser and anyone who argued against Australia's involvement in that war, once more of the truth became obvious about why we were in there, as a supporter of Saddam Hussein. That is the type of nonsense that the foreign minister has been involved with in this debate, and it is a pity he debases this debate so much by those accusations.
The report clearly demonstrates that our intelligence agencies needed more resources, and it is good to see that those resources in part will be forthcoming. Of course, the report also talked about our intelligence failure. It concluded that 78 per cent of the intelligence material on which the Office of National Assessments relied in the lead-up to the war was from untested sources; that ONA used this intelligence despite doubts expressed at the time about its trustworthiness; and that Australian intelligence agencies relied heavily on US and UK documents which were apparently flawed.
On the exaggeration aspect, the report details at least 12 instances where the Howard government overstated the prewar WMD threat to the public based on the information at its disposal at the time. Let us work our way through some of these. For example, the report says:
... the case made by the government was that Iraq possessed WMD in large quantities and posed a grave and unacceptable threat to the region and to the world, particularly as there was a danger that Iraq's WMD might be passed to terrorist organisations.
Indeed, that is the highlight of the Prime Minister's speech to parliament on 18 March 2003—those very claims. But the report continues:
This is not the picture that emerges from an examination of all the assessments provided to the Committee by Australia's two [intelligence assessment] agencies.
That is in paragraphs 5.16 and 5.17 in the report. Statements by the Prime Minister were more strident `than most of the Australian intelligence community judgments'. This was in part because they quoted directly from UK and US agencies. The conclusions by those agencies the committee described as:
... an exaggeration of the available intelligence, since established as an exaggeration of the facts.
This is in paragraph 5.20 of the report. Mr Downer warned of the immediate threat posed by Iraq's WMD; whereas the report concluded that Australia's intelligence agencies:
... provided hardly any explicit assessment on the question of the immediacy of threat posed by Saddam Hussein.
That is in paragraph 2.40 of the inquiry's report.
The Prime Minister's statement that Iraq's WMD threat was `real and unacceptable':
... was not a judgement that DIO would have made.
That is paragraph 5.21. Finally:
... Australian agencies did not think the amounts of WMD to be large ... and the Defence Intelligence Organisation always expressed doubts about any production of biological or chemical weapons beyond 1991.
Whereas, the report unanimously concludes:
The presentations by the government seemed to suggest large arsenals and stockpiles, endorsing the idea that Iraq was producing more weapons and that the programs were larger and more active than before the Gulf War in 1991.
That is paragraph 5.32. The parliamentary report clearly indicates that there was exaggeration. Subsequent events in Iraq and the failure to find weapons of mass destruction merely demonstrate again to the Australian people that their intelligence was insulted by this government's failure to give the true reasons for invading Iraq.

"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—It is a privilege to speak on this report. I was surprised when my learned colleague the member for Melbourne Ports pointed out that there is not one coalition member speaking on this report this morning, as I understand it. This is staggering. I wanted to start my remarks by saying how much I welcomed the initiative of establishing the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. I would have thought that this is part of an initiative of the Howard government that you should be proud of. The fine balance between the need to have matters of intelligence kept tightly and the need for appropriate and proper parliamentary scrutiny is a difficult area. Here we have probably one of the most important reports that committee has brought down. This is not a Labor Party report—I do not want to speak to a Labor minority report—this is a unanimous report of the committee on a most important subject: intelligence on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. It is very critical, and they have done a very good job.
It pains me, and I am sure it pains you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, that this is the most leaked report of any parliamentary committee. Why do I say that? It had but three recommendations. The most important recommended a further inquiry, and that was totally leaked before the tabling of the report. I know the members of that joint committee and I have absolutely every confidence in each and every one of them, and I am confident that not one of them leaked that report. We know where the report leaking came from. It is a requirement of the heads of the committee to give an advance copy of the report to relevant ministers so that they can ensure that nothing is disclosed publicly which should not otherwise be disclosed. In fact, that happened. I think a word is blacked out in the report so we know that it could not have come from the committee—but it came from ministers of state, or their staff, responsible, on behalf of Australia, for intelligence matters.
I want to express my profound disgust and dismay that such a parliamentary report should be leaked out of ministers' offices. That is terrible. It is shocking. It is a precedent that I hope is never followed by any government. It was a good initiative to set up this committee. We need to explore the limits of what their jurisdiction should be. Indeed, in the report they say that there are areas they were not able to examine. So, to that extent, the report is incomplete in their minds. I and those on the Labor side hold the idea, notion and practice of parliamentary accountability to be of absolute and paramount importance. It is fundamental to our democracy. In this area we have been pushing the envelope quite successfully, I think, but, in the case of this excellent report, it was with dramatic and unfortunate results. It was not the committee that people believed would be irresponsible and unable to handle confidential information. It was not the committee members or the committee that leaked this report. We know and are fairly confident that it came out of ministers' offices. But not one inquiry has been commissioned about the leaking of this report. I just wonder why.
As I said, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who takes a great deal of interest in matters of intelligence, has told me that there is not one coalition member speaking. If there had been, I would have had to say: `Please don't accuse us, as has repeatedly happened in the House, of somehow wanting Saddam Hussein still as leader in Iraq. Don't try and justify what has happened in terms of Australia's intelligence and the execution of that intelligence by saying that the opposition side is comfortable or uncomfortable that there has been regime change.' I want to point out that the Prime Minister himself, on 13 March at the National Press Club, said, `I am not committing troops to Iraq to achieve regime change.' He said he was not doing it for that reason, even though, day in and day out in question time, we have the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs saying: `That's what we've achieved. We've achieved our objectives and you, the opposition, would have been happy to see Saddam still there.' What a lie. What a falsehood. What a misstatement of the truth. What dissembling on the original objectives of sending troops there, based on intelligence, to what has happened now. I think the Australian public is starting to wake up about it.
I also wanted to put on the public record that one of the key figures in the intelligence community has been badly traduced by the government. I know a number of people in the intelligence community. I had the opportunity in a different role to work very closely with the head of ASIO. I have a profound respect for the head of ASIO. I have been briefed by DIO. I have a respect for what DIO does and produces. But I am not talking about DIO. I have been briefed in a different role by the head of ASIS and I was very indebted for that briefing. Up to that point, I had no idea of the effectiveness of that organisation, its reach or what it was capable of producing.
But I am not speaking about that; I am of course speaking about the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mick Keelty. I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, have a profound respect for the profession of law enforcement. You would understand how shocking it was that when the Federal Police Commissioner went on to national TV and said that he felt that, because of our involvement in Iraq, Australia had a greater threat of attacks by terrorist organisations he should be heavied by the office of the Prime Minister and forced into issuing a humiliating press release backing down from a statement that, by the way, 65 per cent of Australians believe is utterly accurate and utterly unremarkable.
Worse than that, for 24 hours he considered resigning after the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has direct responsibility for ASIS, said that the commissioner was making statements similar to the propaganda being spread by al-Qaeda. What a shocking accusation to make about a police commissioner! No wonder he thought about resigning. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, this was a low blow from the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It was low. It was cheap. It demeaned the high office that he upholds not only as Minister for Foreign Affairs, directing the diplomatic activity between Australia and the countries of the world, but as head of the portfolio responsible for ASIS.
What is national security coming to? What is the intelligence of Australia's organisations coming to when we see the head of an organisation like the Australian Federal Police being heavied in the cheapest, most demeaning way by the office of the Prime Minister—not the Prime Minister himself—and when we have a question time where for question after question the Prime Minister utterly refuses to say what his own direct involvement was and what the involvement of his staff was in contacting the head of the Australian Federal Police and in dictating the press release that was released subsequently under the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police? What are we coming to?
I can say this: no-one can foretell the future. But we will be relying on our intelligence organisations to provide the best information. This report does not say the minister lied to us and does not say that the Prime Minister lied to the people of Australia, but it does suggest that they did not fully tell the truth. They did not paint the picture and were happy to exaggerate the intelligence we received. We cannot trifle with terrorist organisations. It is too serious a business. They are unlike traditional enemies or other states, which one can identify. One can see the build-up. One can recognise the danger. But terrorist organisations, of themselves, are opaque. They are hard to identify, difficult to locate and almost impossible to trace. We must be reliant on the best from our intelligence organisations.
Last but not least, this is not a report about whether it was right or wrong for us to go to war in Iraq. But I do want to make one point. That is that, whether we were right or wrong to go into Iraq, we seemed to take our eye off the terrorist game. We seemed to lose focus in Afghanistan, where al-Qaeda had based themselves. It is only now that we are searching for the key people in the mountains of Pakistan and on the borders of Afghanistan. We cannot rest easy about hunting down terrorists and terrorist organisations. No country is immune from them. If we think that we are immune because we are Australia, located away from so many other countries, we are deluding ourselves.
I want to commend the report. I think this is an excellent report. I hope I am never in this place again complaining that a report by this joint committee is leaked by ministers. I hope the Australian people understand and will judge the government by the fact that they have so poorly treated this committee and its worthwhile recommendations.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,27,2
"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—One of the great mysteries of the last year and a half is the failure of intelligence on Iraq, as identified by the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. As the member for Chifley has just emphasised, the members and senators on this committee produced a nonpartisan report, which includes many important recommendations that need to be taken up from the point of view of the nonpartisan concern that this parliament has for the security of the Australian people. The great mystery as far as Iraq is concerned was best identified in the writings of Mr Ken Pollack in the January issue of the Atlantic monthly. Mr Pollack, who wrote The Threatening Storm: The Case for Invading Iraq, has subsequently amended his stance outlined in the January issue of Atlanticcalled `Spies, lies, and weapons: what went wrong?' Pollock argues in that very profound article that we had an ongoing informed misperception—I think that is the phrase he uses—by the intelligence services of the fact that Saddam Hussein had previously had a build-up of weapons of mass destruction and that after the inspectors left in 1998 this had continued.
The important intelligence failure identified by this very important joint parliamentary committee is absolutely crucial in these days, when threats of a mega attack on civilians throughout the world are being made, because if we have a repeat of this failure of intelligence, as Senator Ray has said, this will potentially lead to great danger to our citizens. As to the government's attitude to the crucial nature of weapons of mass destruction providing a causus bellum for the war in Iraq, the members for Braddon and Chifley, speaking prior to me, have properly identified the fact that the Prime Minister said that this was the primary reason for intervention in Iraq.
The government might have said that Saddam Hussein is an evil dictator who killed over 200,000 of his own people in political repression over the last 30 years, invaded two of his neighbours and used chemical weapons against his own people and that he should therefore be removed from power in order to liberate the people of Iraq from his oppressive rule, but this is not the case that they made as the primary issue. I heard the foreign minister of East Timor, Jose Ramos Horta, make precisely such a case in a brilliant speech, saying that he had supported the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia to prevent the genocide of Pol Pot, that he had supported the NATO intervention in Bosnia to save the Albanian or Kosovar Muslim people and that he had supported UN intervention in Somalia because humanitarian intervention, according to Mr Horta, is one of the primary reasons that the UN should act in these kinds of situations. But unfortunately this was not the case.
I do sympathise with Iraqis, including Iraqis living in Australia, who do point out that, with the removal of the tyranny of Saddam Hussein, things have improved. Seventy per cent of people respond that the situation is preferable to what it was. This is in the Oxford Research International poll, published last month as an authoritative overview of current Iraqi attitudes. According to 56 per cent of Iraqis, life is better than it was before, and 71 per cent said that life in Iraq is overwhelmingly positive now.
A letter from an Iraqi citizen, Riadh Al-Mahaldi, in the Melbourne Age last weekend said that, whatever Australians' views are of the motivation and the politics of the war in Iraq, we should continue to bear in mind the situation of the Iraqi people when we do look at these situations. I think there is a great deal of concern for them across all sides of politics, and we ought to keep them in mind when we are making future decisions on Australian involvement in that part of the world.
I also sympathise with the Iraqi Governing Council, which claims that there have been oceans of ink spilt over the issue of pre-war intelligence but that virtually no-one is looking into the scandalous oil for food program and the corrupt—and that is the only way of describing it—and gigantic scam that appears to have been run in that program. Apparently, KPMG and the international law firm Freshfields Brookhouse Deringer are now investigating this. It seems that billions of dollars were put through a French bank and have been misappropriated, people paid huge service fees and various people who were supporting Saddam Hussein's regime were paid off in this ostensibly humanitarian program that was exploited to sustain a bloody dictatorship.
All of these things are true and should be considered as well. It does not mean that the Australian government should get off the hook for their failure to properly identify intelligence on Iraq. In my view, the government should have said: `We do not have specific intelligence now that Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction, although we know that Saddam used them on the Kurds in Halabja in the past. Nevertheless, Saddam Hussein has not met the UN obligations he entered into after the war in 1991—in particular, an obligation to give an account of what happened to those weapons. In the context of the global war against terrorism, this is not acceptable. Unless Saddam immediately complies with the requirements, we will take action against him.' That was a ground, but it was not the primary ground. As with the issue of humanitarian interventionism, as it is described by Jose Ramos Horta, the government should have given that higher priority. The government might have also said, `We have no firm evidence that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction. We have evidence from the Iraq Survey Group that Saddam's regime retained the desire and the ability to re-acquire such weapons. This is not an acceptable risk in the post-September 11 world.'
In a brilliant speech to his constituency a week and a half ago, Tony Blair explained this best. He said that this is:
 ... not a time to weigh the risks to an infinite balance; not a time for the cynicism of the worldly wise who favour playing it long. Their worldly wise cynicism is actually at best naivete and at worst dereliction. When they talk as they do now of diplomacy coming back into fashion in respect of Iran or North Korea or Libya, do they seriously think that diplomacy alone has brought about this change? ... Libya has taken the courageous step of owning up not just to a nuclear weapons program but to having chemical weapons, which are now being destroyed. Iran is back in the reach of the IAEA—
that is, the International Atomic Energy Agency. Blair went on to say that North Korea is in talks with China and the group of six over its WMD and, above all, for this part of the world, that the A.Q. Khan nuclear proliferation network, which was operating out of Malaysia and manufacturing nuclear components in Malaysia, is now being shut down, its trade slowly but surely being eliminated.
All of these reasons were important reasons for intervention in Iraq, but the government said that its sure knowledge of weapons of mass destruction, based on the information from the intelligence services, was the key and primary reason. As this non-partisan report of the committee—chaired by Mr Jull and including various other people, such as Senator Ray and the member for Brand—has shown, this was, as Ken Pollack described it, `informed misperception'. This misperception is a very important issue for this chamber and for this parliament because of the implications that it has for the safety of the Australian people.
Many people might still have opposed the Australian government if it had identified that it was taking military action against Iraq on the basis of humanitarian intervention or on the basis that we did not know what weapons of mass destruction Iraq had but that there was some potential for it to use them. The government would at least have been telling the truth in those circumstances. As we now know, the government did not possess sufficient specific intelligence that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. This is a very sorry situation in a world where we are increasingly reliant, as the member for Braddon said, on the intelligence services to prevent a mega-attack—as happened in Madrid or in the United States on September 11—from happening again in this part of the world. We Australians know, with nearly 90 dead in Bali, that this is a very real and important issue. Such a mega-attack on Australian civilians will be prevented only if there is sufficient, comprehensive and thorough work being done by the intelligence services.
I thought the member for Braddon, like the shadow spokesman for homeland security, identified a very important issue when he said that it was very good, now that the intelligence services are being beefed up, to be able to consider these things in the light of this non-partisan report. As Senator Ray said repeatedly in media interviews after the release of the report, that is the important thing that this parliament has to consider, even above our partisan views on the war in Iraq—and particularly the opposition's view that the government exaggerated its specific knowledge of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. I want to elaborate a bit on my concerns. I am not convinced that the intelligence services have all the people they need—people who work in a calm, rational way and who have a profound understanding of foreign languages, including Arabic and Indonesian. They need people who not only know how to translate those languages but also have a deep understanding of the mentality and modus operandi of the various franchises of al-Qaeda, such as Jemaah Islamiah, and who know in a profound way what they are up to. Only now are we seeing an increase to these agencies that will perhaps prevent such attacks in the future.
In my view, a good case could have been made for the removal of Saddam Hussein from power: he was an evil dictator and he was in violation of a series of UN resolutions. But this case was not made by the Australian government, which relied on a grave misperception, from existing intelligence at the time, about the nature of weapons of mass destruction. We did not know that, because the inspectors were out of Iraq. Some people have said that the government resorted to scare tactics. This report does not specifically attack the government for those scare tactics. The report may well do the government some political damage, but that is not the real issue. The real issue is the failure of intelligence and its potential to damage Australian national security by fostering the belief that the war against terrorism was somehow advanced by us going into Iraq to destroy weapons of mass destruction that it now seems Iraq did not possess.
David Martin Jones, a senior lecturer at the School of Political Science and International Studies at the University of Queensland, concluded an important article he wrote in the Financial Review by saying:
Events since 2001 have certainly amplified the risk of mass casualty attack globally, in Australia, Europe and the US. To allow such heightened risk to give credence to the Chomskyite fallacy that it is all our fault anyway would only reinforce al-Qaeda's belief that democracy is frail and a hideously fragmented enterprise.
We don't do that. We say that the government's views on WMD were fundamentally— (Time expired)",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,27,2
"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—In speaking to this committee report, I must say that it seems the Prime Minister's staff have had to work overtime in the last few weeks to ensure that the government's line is preserved. We have had the exhibition of the Minister for Foreign Affairs publicly attacking the Federal Police Commissioner as essentially being a mouthpiece of al-Qaeda—a person pushing their propaganda!—to the point where the commissioner was on the point of resignation, and yesterday we had another example from the government. Late yesterday the Minister for Defence had to come out clarifying a doorstop he gave earlier yesterday in which he said—and it is pretty clear:
Yes, well I just said that we went to war in Iraq to support the Security Council which had to be assured that Saddam Hussein had got rid of his weapons of mass destruction. Now we are confident that there are no weapons of mass destruction and there is no dictator that will use them against his own people ...
You can issue 25,000 clarifying points, but that wording is emphatically clear. Early yesterday the Minister for Defence said that there were no weapons of mass destruction. After Arthur Sinodinos—or a nun or somebody—got on to him yesterday afternoon, the minister came out with the following comment concerning Saddam Hussein:
... we can be confident that there are no weapons of mass destruction related to the removal of a threat—
He did not say anything about `removal'; he said there were none. That is emphatically clear. I do not blame the minister for moving towards a bit of veracity and truth in this matter. We even had this comment from the Prime Minister of Australia on 3 February: `In the fullness of time it might be demonstrated that the advice was inaccurate.' So that was the beginning of the possibility that the government would come clean on these matters.
The government has made a lot of comments in the last week or so about politics in Spain—the foreign minister has been frothing at the mouth, frantically running around the place trying to tell the Spanish government what to do. Each week for 20 years, I have read the Guardian Weekly as a kind of Bible, and I was particularly interested in last week's edition, which had a comment that perhaps the foreign minister of Australia should listen to, rather than giving advice to the Spanish electorate. Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said, `Mr Blair and Mr Bush must do some reflection. You can't organise a war on lies.' I think that is interesting on a number of points. The new leader is saying, as the Spanish people did in many public opinion polls over the war period, that essentially he does not believe in the position of the United States and Britain. What is interesting is that he did not even mention the Prime Minister of this country. The Prime Minister was running around Crawford, Texas, buying 25 mugs, if he could get hold of them, of him, Aznar, Bush and Blair. He was being slapped on the back at the barbecue at Crawford, trying to make it appear as if he was a person of some international substance. But there we have the Prime Minister of Spain not even mentioning this fourth important coalition leader, as the Prime Minister would picture himself. He was not even mentioned.
The same edition of the Guardian Weekly had a cartoon by Steve Bell that showed a fearsome bull having chucked Aznar on the ground, while the Prime Minister of Britain and the President of the United States were still on it. Once again, there was no mention of the Prime Minister of this country, the man who essentially has tried to indicate to the Australian people that we have somehow enhanced our importance by being such an obsequious, obedient slave of US foreign policy. 
It reminds me, and I have referred to this previously in the parliament, of when we saw the Prime Minister running around Washington, doing his jogging, at the time of the bombings in New York. He was on national television every five minutes. In the United States, one of the major television stations said, `We're now crossing to the only world leader here in the United States at the time of this bombing.' I guess the coalition members thought, `They'll have the Prime Minister of Australia on there now.' No. The only world leader they put on TV was the President of Lithuania, a country of 3.7 million people. I have no disrespect for Lithuanians. I have a lot of time for them. I enjoy the cuisine at their club in Sydney and have reasonable contact with them. But that is the kind of level that this country has reached. The supposed prominence we have due to our servility is not reflected by even European interest in us—nor by US media coverage of our leader.
Previous speakers have referred to the lack of speakers from the coalition on this matter. The coalition have a view that essentially this is irrelevant, that the Australian electorate does not care and that it will not matter. Well, I think they have got some problems. We are seeing that in the aftermath of the attacks on Keelty for saying a realistic thing—that security problems have probably increased as a result of Iraq. He was disciplined for telling people the way he saw it. Whether he is right or wrong, he has a position, he has authority, he has advice, and that is the way he judged it. Unfortunately for this government, 67 per cent of the electorate thinks the same way. Increasingly, despite the fact that the government did have broad public support for its original engagement in this war, this is a political problem for the government.
As many people have said—and I notice the member for Chifley referred to this—the report was leaked. I agree with the member for Chifley about that issue:  if you look at the personnel on this committee, on either side of politics, you see that they are people of high repute. One must question how aspects of this report were leaked and the lack of interest of the government in pursuing the source of those leaks. Fundamentally it is clear that leaks that occurred in relation to this matter were from government ministerial sources.
The other thing that the government have put on the agenda in a big way in recent months is that the supposed justification of Iraq is now that Saddam Hussein was a tyrant and that anyone that opposed the war is a friend and supporter of his et cetera. The Prime Minister himself was emphatically clear about this on 13 March 2003:
... I couldn't justify on its own a military invasion of Iraq to change the regime.
That is what he said. These are not words that we put in his mouth. That was his clear, emphatic statement—that justification for the war could not be based on regime change alone. No-one disputes that it is clearly a change for the better that that regime has gone. I note very clearly that many people on this side of politics were far more critical of Saddam Hussein's regime over many decades—for its activities against the Kurds and Shiites and other religious minorities—than many coalition members. It really is stomach-turning to see these people coming out now and saying that Saddam Hussein was the worst thing in the world and that basically we intervened to get rid of him. It is not true historically—they were not interested. This is essentially an excuse after the event.
Internationally, there is mounting questioning of this. We have had Richard Clarke, the former counterterrorism coordinator of the United States government, and Paul O'Neill, the former United States Treasury Secretary, both saying that the Bush administration was obsessed with Iraq and that it failed to really understand the far more fundamental international danger that was presented by militant extremist Islamic groups. Romano Prodi, the European President, said last week:
I don't think that in reality the situation in the fight against terrorists is better because of the war in Iraq, clearly it's not.
So a wide variety of people internationally are saying that we are not in a safer world because of what is happening. We are clearly in a worse situation. For all of its evil treatment of its people, its aggression against Kuwait and its other acts, historically Iraq was not on the Islamic fundamentalist bandwagon. By Middle Eastern standards it was essentially secularist. The government has failed to understand that what we now have in Iraq is a very difficult situation. The Shiahs have essentially been forced at gunpoint to go along with the making of the constitution—we all know that that is not going to be a good enough long-term result for them—and the Kurds have grave concerns that they will be left on the bench in the long term.
There is an interesting film out at the moment called The Fog of War, with Robert McNamara talking about his experience in the Cuban crisis and in Vietnam. The Americans are now in a quagmire in Iraq. They have grave difficulties extricating themselves from a situation where, daily, police are killed; where people at training bases are attacked; where bombings are occurring; and where terrorist organisations are attempting to increase the hostility between Sunnis and Shiahs. All of these things are not advancing the struggle against terrorism.
We have a situation here where essentially there is no predictability about what is going to occur in Iraq, and there is great interest by the Iranian authorities—they have extensive influence over the Shiah leadership—so the so-called undermining of the terrorist threat is indeed extremely doubtful.
I want to turn to another aspect of this, which is the question of the way in which the United States and Britain essentially seem to have discussed the possibility of bugging other members of the Security Council. The Guardian Weekly of 4-10 March said:
Yet both Ms Short's allegations and Katherine Gun's leaking of a US invitation to Britain to eavesdrop on the six “swing” nations on the UN security council in the run-up to war underline the fact that a level of reassurance is needed that the existing structure does not supply ... Lord Butler should be asked to investigate Ms Short's claims. In the longer term, a case for a proper parliamentary committee, chosen by MPs rather than the prime minister, hearing evidence in open session from MI5 ... and MI6 ... is surely now unanswerable.
So we have questions about the way these countries have operated to try to push this war along and that is now under extreme pressure in the UK.
I heard the other day in parliament selective quoting of David Kay, the CIA's on-the-ground person with regards to weapons of mass destruction. He said quite a few other things that are of more interest to the Australian electorate than the selective references given the other day, I think. He has very much stated emphatically that he doubts the weapons will be found, because they simply were not there. I have a report here that states he welcomes the creation of a bipartisan commission to investigate prewar intelligence on Iraq and has said that the wide-ranging US investigation was more likely to get to the truth than the Butler inquiry in Britain. He, of course, resigned from the Iraq Survey Group, which the CIA appointed him to lead in the hunt for weapon stockpiles, saying that resources had been diverted in the fight against Iraqi insurgence. He said:
I was more worried that we were still sending teams out to search for things that we were increasingly convinced were not there ...
His call for a frank admission is an embarrassment to the White House. He goes on to talk about coming clean with the American people. So the person that the Minister for Foreign Affairs conveniently tries to bring in as a person endorsing part of his position has essentially said that the Bush administration should come clean in regards to the intelligence manipulation that occurred before the war.
On 23 January, in an interview with Reuters, he was asked about what happened to the `stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons that everyone expected to be there'. His reply was, `I don't think they existed.' He was also asked: `You came away from the hunt you have done believing that they did not have any large stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons in the country?' His answer was, `That is correct.' He was asked about the destruction of the weapons: `Do you think that they destroyed them?' He replied: `No, I don't think they existed'. This is the person who was appointed to lead the US examination of stockpiles.
So overall we have a situation where a report has come down and it has clearly said that there are matters of massive concern with regard to intelligence, the way it was used, its provision et cetera. The government has clearly changed its position. It has moved away from ridiculous propositions, which were exposed very early on—such as that there had been contracts with Niger for the purchase of uranium. Within days they were exposed. The minister who had supposedly signed the contracts had not been in the administration of the country for quite a number of years. Internationally, they were exposed at that stage.
We have had a situation since then where the Israelis have said that they knew that Iraq was incapable of—that major allegation—delivering within 15 minutes. The Israelis said, `We knew all along that that was preposterous and wrong, but we did not tell the US or Britain.' Why would they? Quite frankly, if I were the Israelis I would not make that clear to them either, because Iraq does of course present a major problem for Israel. So we have a government that is in retreat. We have a situation where the defence minister yesterday went on the record saying that there were no weapons of mass destruction, we have a Prime Minister who admitted—a year ago even—that it was increasingly doubtful that those weapons would be found. He is still hopeful that they might find something, but it appears they will not.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,27,2
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—Almost a year ago I spoke in the House of Representatives against the Prime Minister's motion on Iraq. I said then, speaking for the fourth time against the Howard government's plan to involve Australia in a pre-emptive strike on Iraq, that the terrible division in Australia over fundamental issues like international and national security was caused by the government's failure to be open and honest with the people of Australia. It is now obvious that the Howard government committed Australia to support a US attack on Iraq when the Prime Minister met with President Bush in July 2002. The government did not take the Australian people into its confidence on this issue and it then did not bother to properly argue the case for the war. The government shamelessly accused anyone opposed to war in Iraq of America bashing, of supporting Saddam Hussein and his horrendous regime and of not supporting Australian troops. All these accusations are offensive, to say the least.
I argued that it was not acceptable for the government to commit Australia to war and place the lives of Australian service men and women under threat and their families under terrible strain without first exhausting every diplomatic option and without providing any evidence of a link between the Iraqi regime and the terrorists that committed the terrible crimes in New York, Bali or anywhere else. The Prime Minister told the Australian parliament and the Australian people that the invasion of Iraq—an invasion that did not have the support of the United Nations; an invasion supported by only a small coalition of the willing which supported President Bush—was necessary to eliminate stockpiles of completed biological and chemical weapons and the reconstitution of Iraq's nuclear weapons capability.
The Howard government committed Australian troops and put the lives of Australian service men and women at risk, making the most serious and important decision any Prime Minister can make, in order to remove stockpiles of weapons so that they could not get into terrorists' hands. In addition to insisting that there were stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, for months before committing Australian troops the Howard government claimed that Iraq's weapons posed an immediate threat to global security. Foreign Minister Downer said publicly on 18 July 2002:
... I don't think there's any doubt about Saddam Hussein having stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons.
For months, this assertion was repeated over and over again. The Prime Minister said on 6 March last year, two weeks before finally committing Australia to war, inter alia:
... why we are concerned about Iraq is that she continues to have chemical and biological weapons ... And there is always the danger that those weapons will get into the hands of terrorists ...
In addition, on 13 March 2003, the Prime Minister told the National Press Club:
... our interests and the interests of a stable peaceful world require that Iraq be disarmed.
The parliamentary joint committee report on Iraq's WMD that we are considering today confirms that, at best, this series of Howard government assertions are fairly described as exaggerations. This report contains at least 12 examples of exaggerations of the Iraqi WMD threat. For example, we now know that the Office of National Assessments report of 6 September 2002 admits that intelligence on Iraq is `slight on the scope and location of Iraq's WMD activities'. We now know from the joint report that the Australian intelligence agencies:
... provided hardly any explicit assessment on the question of the immediacy of threat posed by Saddam Hussein.
When does a series of exaggerations become so constant that they are more fairly or more accurately described as lies? I believe it is when they are used for a base political purpose and risk the lives of Australian service men and women. The Australian people now know this is what has happened here. The Australian people know because, as the war in Iraq progressed and then after the war, the search for weapons suddenly changed to a search for `weapons programs'. As my colleague the member for Griffith and shadow minister for foreign affairs, Mr Kevin Rudd, has correctly said, there is a world of difference between an arsenal and a whiteboard.
In an attempt to defend the indefensible, the Howard government is now arguing that the end justifies the means—that is, the invasion of Iraq was designed to eliminate a dictator so this justifies Australia's participation in the pre-emptive strike. I do not accept this, and I believe Australians deserved to be told the truth about the regime change motive prior to Australia's commitment. Instead, before committing Australia to war, the Prime Minister said that if Iraq had genuinely disarmed, he could not justify an invasion on the basis of regime change. Removing the dictator did not feature once in the formal government legal opinion tabled in the parliament outlining the government's case for war.
The government continually accuses the opposition of supporting Saddam Hussein's regime. Australians understand how offensive that argument is and they also understand that there is the basic argument in democracy that if a government is taking the grave decision of taking the nation to war, the government should be truthful about the reasons for going to war, not invent fresh legal justifications after the event. Recently, the Howard government has claimed that the invasion of Iraq was an integral part of the war against terrorism and that the invasion was necessary to reduce the terrorist threat to Australia and the world. Australians know, and the Howard government knew, the Iraq regime had nothing to do with September 11, Bali or Madrid. All three, and other attacks, were the work of al-Qaeda.
One of the key pieces of intelligence advice the government did not pass on before the war was from the British Joint Intelligence Committee. One month before the war, it asserted that the threat posed by al-Qaeda and associated groups, `would be heightened by military action against Iraq.' We are now slowly learning the full extent of the political cynicism involved in President Bush's decision to focus on Iraq, instead of concentrating all American efforts to combat al-Qaeda, who we know are principally based in Afghanistan. It is obvious the Howard government never bothered to even question the validity of the United States desperately focusing on disarming Iraq instead of facing the more difficult but more urgent task of tackling al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden.
Yesterday, the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill, admitted there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which I believe confirms that the Howard government simply accepted the more politically saleable option of taking out a dictator instead of seriously focusing on al-Qaeda. Through media reports made this week, we now learn that Mr Richard Clarke, President Bush's counterterrorism coordinator at the time of the September 11 attacks, was concerned that the Bush administration was ignoring the threat from al-Qaeda prior to those attacks. In a Sunday Age article last Sunday titled, `Rumsfeld pushed Iraq as “good target”', Ted Bridis reports that Mr Clarke said:
... Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld complained on September 12—
2001—
after the Administration was convinced that al-Qaeda was to blame—that, `there aren't any good targets in Afghanistan, and there are lots of good targets in Iraq'.
...	...	...
He told CBS News he believed the Administration sought to link Iraq with the attacks because of long-standing interest in overthrowing Saddam Hussein.
`I think they wanted to believe that there was a connection between Iraq and the al-Qaeda attacks in the US' ... 
Mr Clarke also explains:
`There's no just connection' ... `There's absolutely no evidence that Iraq was supporting al-Qaeda.'
The base political reaction from the Bush administration that this represents was obviously accepted by the Howard government to its eternal shame.
The Howard government now expects Australia to believe that Australia's participation in the war against Iraq has not increased the terrorist threat against Australia. Australians have seen in recent weeks that the Howard government does not like senior security policy professionals like the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mr Mick Keelty, or Australia's leading terrorism expert, Dr Clive Williams, or the world's leading authority on al-Qaeda, Dr Rohan Gunaratna, stating the obvious or telling Australians the truth. After all, one of the Howard government's supporters—US Ambassador to Australia, His Excellency Mr Tom Schieffer—has suggested the recent Madrid train bombings were probably carried out in reprisal for Spain's support of the Iraq war.
The Howard government prefers to play political word games and, at its worst, savagely rebuke and humiliate—in the case of AFP Commissioner Keelty—anyone who tells the Australian people the truth about the threat to Australia's security. This joint committee report on Australia's prewar intelligence is a damning indictment of the Howard government's handling of this critical international and national security issue. I believe this is a shameful way for any government to handle issues of national security. I do not believe that Australians can trust the Howard government with Australia's national security. The Howard government is always playing politics, putting narrow political interests above the national interest. It is evidence that the Howard government is tired and arrogant and has been in power for far too long. 
You only need to look at Senator Hill's honesty this week—although once again he is retreating and backtracking because doubtless there is pressure from the Prime Minister—with regard to his admission that he does not believe that weapons of mass destruction will be found. I think it is refreshing that Commissioner Keelty was able to come out and tell the truth. Most people, as verified by the Newspoll this week, believe that we are at greater risk of terrorist attack following the tragic events of Madrid. I must also say that I do not think General Peter Cosgrove did himself any favours by coming out to try and effectively neutralise the honesty of Commissioner Keelty.
The government have a lot to account for. We went to war on a false premise. We were fed the argument that there were weapons of mass destruction—nuclear, biological and chemical—and we now know there are not any weapons to be found. Yes, on this side of the House we are glad that the brutal dictator Saddam Hussein has been removed, but we have to live with the consequences of being linked to the coalition of the willing, and who knows what the future holds for Australia as a result of our participation in the war in Iraq.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,27,2
"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—We are debating here today a report from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD into the nature and accuracy of intelligence services relating to Australia's involvement in the war in Iraq. The main reason given by the government for our involvement in the war was that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and therefore there was a threat to the outside world. The Labor Party agreed that Saddam Hussein should be removed but believed that this should have been achieved through the United Nations. No weapons of mass destruction have been found and in hindsight what is critical whenever Australia takes military action, particularly in support of another nation in a faraway country, is that the Australian public at least know the real reasons for our involvement. The people of Australia deserve the right to know. This was never going to happen in the case of Iraq. 
In the chairman's foreword to this report, reference is made to the limitations imposed under which the committee conducted its inquiries:
The Committee's conclusions, therefore, must be qualified. The Committee recommends that a more comprehensive inquiry should be conducted by suitable experts into Australia's intelligence sharing and intelligence liaison arrangements.
The Labor Party has called for the next inquiry to have royal commission status because of the committee's agreed position that it had limited access to intelligence assessment on this particular occasion. It stands to reason that, because of Australia's limited intelligence capacity compared to the United States and the United Kingdom, we would have to rely on the intelligence provided by these two nations and, to some extent, we would be led by the nose by this foreign intelligence.
To support that position, I want to refer to two quotes. One is from Hans Blix, who, of course, has deep knowledge of these particular issues, being a United Nations weapons inspector. The other is from Mr Pritchett, who was the Secretary to the Department of Defence. I will first refer to Hans Blix's comments on the issues that we are debating here today. I refer to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of Wednesday, 10 March. The article is headed, `Stand apart from US, Blix urges'. It says:
The former chief UN weapons inspector, Hans Blix, has called on Australia to be more independent from the US when deciding `questions of war and peace'.
The article goes on, again quoting Hans Blix. It says:
Much of the intelligence supplied to Western leaders had been based on information supplied by Iraqi defectors who `often come up with things interrogators want to hear' or satellite images subsequently shown to have `weaknesses'.
`Perhaps the regret they [coalition leaders] have now is they did not let us continue with inspections for some months,' ... `We would have gone to even more sites given by intelligence, and since there weren't any weapons of mass destruction we wouldn't have found any. They would have realised the intelligence they had was not good.'
`It seems they paid too much attention to what [Iraqi] defectors were saying.'
That is a fairly damning statement, I believe, by Hans Blix, relating to whether there were weapons of mass destruction there in the first place. To back that statement up, I refer to a comment on page 42 of the report. The report quotes Mr Pritchett, former Secretary to the Department of Defence. It says:
Mr Pritchett ... argued that there was an inbuilt imbalance in our relationship with our allies and that as a result `our understanding and our policy can be, or is, already largely shaped'. Independence was, he believed, an unrealistic expectation. He warned that there was a need to be sensitive to any `unconscious bias in Australian intelligence advice supportive of US and British plans.
Quite clearly, Mr Pritchett is saying that we were unnecessarily influenced by the information supplied by the intelligence people from the US and the United Kingdom.
It has been suggested that Saddam Hussein was trying to convince the world that he had weapons of mass destruction. This was hardly a good enough reason to go to war. The Australian government and the Australian people needed to know exactly what weapons of mass destruction Saddam Hussein had, not what deception he was trying to impose on the rest of the world. I would like to refer to page 88 of the report where, in paragraph 5.4, the Prime Minister is quoted as saying:
`Our goal is disarmament.' `I couldn't justify on its own a military invasion of Iraq to change the regime. I've never advocated that.' Central to the threat, he—
that is, the Prime Minister—
said, was Iraq's `possession of chemical and biological weapons and its pursuit of nuclear capability'.
So, using the Prime Minister's own words, the military invasion was unjust because all it did was change the regime, which on its own, as the Prime Minister himself said, did not justify military invasion.
The report also refers to comments made by the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, who supported the Prime Minister's position. The minister is quoted as saying: 
Locating, securing and disposing of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities must and will be a major objective for the coalition. We must achieve the disarmament of Iraq. The focus will be on weapons and delivery systems, biological and chemical agents, weapons and dual-use infrastructure, and Iraq's technical and scientific expertise.
So the major objective of going to war in Iraq disappeared into thin air as there were no weapons of mass destruction found by the United Nations weapons inspectors before the invasion and none found by the United States forces after the invasion. There may have been good reasons to believe that Saddam Hussein did have weapons of mass destruction. As the report said: 
History informed the expectations of Saddam Hussein's behaviour: he had used the weapons before, so he would use them again. Iraq had a `record of aggression and a willingness to use weapons of mass destruction ... He has used them against his neighbours. He has used them against his own people.' `Militarism and aggression are the foundations of his empire.'
So, hypothetically, it could be said that he had weapons of mass destruction but in fact he did not, and that is the big difference. That is really what our intelligence agencies are there to advise us on—what is the hypothetical position and what is the true position? This is where our intelligence, which was supplied by the United States and the United Kingdom, possibly fell down.
It could be said, therefore, that the Australian government sent Australians to war in an area outside our sphere of influence based on what was clearly only circumstantial evidence. One of the good outcomes of the inquiry is that the next inquiry should focus on how to improve outcomes of Australia's intelligence agencies. This would be in Australia's best interest. This inquiry established that the government was loose with the truth on national security. The report highlighted intelligence failures and that this government was selective in its use of this intelligence. This government decided to go to war without concrete evidence about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. This report proves that. The joint parliamentary committee, which included government members, found that the government's claim that Iraq `posed a grave and unacceptable threat' was not backed by Australia's spy assessments.
I will quote from an article in the Financial Review on 2 March entitled `Howard fails intelligence test', which claims that the government is in deep denial over the intelligence it received in the lead-up to military action. The article begins: `Denial or deception? Or both?' It then states:
The Prime Minister, John Howard, and Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer led the charge, with Downer telling parliament the inquiry had shown the government did not “sex up” intelligence or the threat from Saddam Hussein's Iraq. 
Downer made this claim despite the plain language of paragraphs 5.16 and 5.17 on page 93 of the committee report. 
The article then quotes those two paragraphs: 
“5.16: Therefore, the case made by the government was that Iraq possessed WMD in large quantities and posed a grave and unacceptable threat to the region and the world, particularly as there was a danger that Iraq's WMD might be passed to terrorist organisations.
“5.17: This is not the picture that emerges from an examination of all the assessments provided to the committee by Australia's two analytical agencies [the Office of National Assessments and the Defence Intelligence Organisation].”
The article itself then says: 
Make no mistake; this is a very damaging report for the government. It is also damaging to the Office of National Assessments, which is shown, after mid-September 2002, to have been “inconsistent and changeable” on critical questions and to have become increasingly assertive under the influence of claims being made in Britain and the United States.
So the joint committee's report clearly highlights some serious problems. The government was selective in the use of its intelligence. This government grossly exaggerated Iraq's weapons of mass destruction for its own political gains. This is again spelt out in paragraph 5.20 of the report:
The statements by the Prime Minister and Ministers are more strongly worded than most of the AIC judgements. This is in part because they quote directly from the findings of the British and American intelligence agencies. In particular, in the 4 February 2003 speech to the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister quoted the findings of Joint Intelligence Committee of the UK and the key judgements of the National Intelligence Estimate of the CIA. In both of these documents the uncertainties had been removed and they relied heavily on the surge of new and largely untested intelligence, coming, in the US at least, from Iraqi defectors.
Clearly we see once again where Australia's government used information provided by the intelligence agents of these other organisations—information that, in fact, was not factual.
The report specifically warned about the dangers of policy driven studies where analysts are indirectly pressured to make their assessments conform with policy decisions taken by governments. The committee unanimously goes on to say that mere weapons programs alone are not sufficient to provide a basis for justifying a war. As I mentioned earlier, the Prime Minister, in his own words, stated that he could not justify military invasion solely on the basis of regime change—he never advocated that; his goal was disarmament. So quite clearly, based on his own words, the decision to go into Iraq was incorrect.
Finally, we talk about disarmament, but disarmament of what? There was no real evidence that Iraq possessed these weapons of mass destruction. Maybe they had them at some stage in the past but certainly not at the time of the invasion. The Prime Minister joined the coalition of the willing to change the regime in Iraq, even though, in his own words, he could not justify it. He sent our troops off to war without solid evidence of these weapons of mass destruction, so he misled the Australian people. Labor believes that any independent inquiry should not be led by a recent head of an intelligence agency, nor should it be headed by anybody without sustainable intelligence expertise. Especially in this current climate, the Australian people deserve to have first-class intelligence agencies. They should be able to feel confident that these agencies are fulfilling their duties to the Australian public and are free from political interference—such as telephone calls from the Prime Minister's chief of staff.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,27,2
"George, Jennie, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—The unanimous all-party parliamentary report on prewar intelligence makes very compelling reading. The government should take no comfort from its findings. I think it is a very damaging report for the Howard government. The report exposes the deception and the spin that was used by the government when it agreed to follow the United States into a pre-emptive military attack on Iraq. The Australian people will not be fooled. Sending people to war, putting lives at risk, is a decision that transcends party politics, and people expect and should be told the truth. This report exposes just how loose with the truth this government was in the lead-up to the war on Iraq.
In the many months preceding the war, we heard the government repeat their arguments in support of joining the coalition of the willing. Essentially they had four main arguments to defend their position. The first was that Iraq's possession of chemical and biological weapons and its pursuit of a nuclear capability posed a threat to the security and stability of the world and Australia. The second was that, despite the efforts of the UN, Iraq had held onto its WMDs and that our goal as a nation was to join to disarm Iraq.
The Prime Minister consistently indicated that the imperative was disarmament and not regime change, although I note that now the defence has changed somewhat. But he did say that on numerous occasions, and I will quote just one example from the Prime Minister:
... I couldn't justify on its own a military invasion of Iraq to change the regime. I've never advocated that.
So the goal essentially was to disarm Iraq and the argument was advanced that Iraq could potentially pass on its WMDs to terrorist organisations. If you look at the report, these constant themes are repeated in speeches made by both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
That weapons of mass destruction existed is really taken for granted in all the government's statements in the lead-up to the war. For example, in February 2003 the PM stated:
... Iraq must not be allowed to possess weapons of mass destruction ... it must be disarmed.
Similarly, he said:
The Australian government knows that Iraq still has chemical and biological weapons and that Iraq wants to develop nuclear weapons.
So from the beginning this government was always definitive about the existence of weapons of mass destruction. The report of the parliamentary joint committee shed some interesting light on how the government came to these conclusions. How was it that the government could be so definitive? Page 89 of the report states:
The evidence evinced in support of these arguments within the government's speeches was not merely a matter of quoting intelligence. The arguments were based on a mixture of historical experience, first principle hypotheses, deductive logic, assumption and assertion, as well as specific intelligence.
Therefore, the committee argues, the case made by the government was that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction in large quantities and posed a grave and unacceptable threat to the region and the world, particularly as there was a danger that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction might be passed on to terrorist organisations. But in the very exact next statement, the committee concludes as follows:
This—
that is, the government's conclusion—
is not the picture that emerges from an examination of all the assessments provided to the Committee by Australia's two analytical agencies.
That in itself is an amazing statement, for the committee is saying that the government's public utterances and their rationale for war on Iraq went well beyond the assessments being provided to them by Australia's intelligence agencies.
Australia went outside the framework of the UN Security Council because we were told that intelligence had revealed that Iraq continued to possess and indeed was increasing its store of weapons of mass destruction. The consequent danger that Iraq posed, we were told, was considered to be serious enough to warrant a pre-emptive war in order to forcibly disarm Iraq. We could not even wait for the weapons inspectors to finalise their work. The coalition of the willing rejected the case put by Hans Blix and others for more time to conclude the task that the UN had given them. And yet I again repeat the committee's conclusion that the picture that was presented by the government did not conform with an `examination of all the assessments' being provided by Australia's two analytical agencies.
The report notes, at page 54, that changes occurred in the nature and tone of some assessments and that the sudden variation in the assessments provided from ONA between 12 September and 13 September is, in the words of the committee, `difficult to explain'. They go on to say:
It is so sudden a change in judgement that it appears ONA, at least unconsciously, might have been responding to `policy running strong'.
What do these words—`policy running strong'—mean? The best explanation is provided in Hansard by comments made by the shadow minister for foreign affairs and international security. He says `policy running strong' means:
... an intelligence community which sees the fact that government, to all intents and purposes, has made an internal decision to go to war—a policy and political decision already taken—and then subtle, indirect, covert influence being exercised on the intelligence community to shape their analyses in a manner which fits the policy and political decision already taken. If you look back at the chronology of 2002, that is precisely what happened. The intelligence community is made up of intelligent people. They saw a government whose Prime Minister and foreign minister went to Washington in the middle of 2002. They saw a Prime Minister address the US Congress and come back. Internally, the debate then began in Canberra as to what quantum the Australian military commitment would be to Iraq—not whether there would be one but what quantum it would be. The internal debate began about whether there would be an Australian battalion committed to Iraq, and we all remember that debate well. It surfaced from time to time in parts of the Australian media.
The intelligence community, therefore, by September 2002 had gotten the message loud and clear that this government was taking us off to war. 
DIO retained sceptical views throughout the period under examination. As I said earlier, according to the committee the ONA assessments changed at about 13 September and they became more assertive and less qualified in their advice.
The assessments provided to the government, together with the response to the Prime Minister's visit to the United States, make it very clear that `policy running strong' meant that the intelligence agencies knew full well what the thinking and commitments were on the part of the Prime Minister. Now the world has heard from the Iraq Survey Group and it is now unchallenged that this group is the final arbiter on the accuracy of the prewar intelligence. Its head, Dr David Kay, reported to the US Congress on 1 October 2003. He reported that the team had found no evidence of actual weapons of mass destruction or of recent weapons of mass destruction related production.
This committee report found that insofar as Australia's intelligence assessments are concerned:
... the pre-war assessments that now appear to be most accurate are those that were most sceptical. These were, after September 2002, largely the assessments provided by DIO.
So the government's emphatic claims about the existence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction have now been totally exposed. Just as importantly, on the question of the immediacy of a threat from Iraq the committee found there was a `gap' on this matter. The report states:
Assessments by Australian agencies about possible degradation of agents and restricted delivery capability cast doubt on the suggestion that the Iraqi `arsenal' represented a `grave and immediate' and a `real and unacceptable' threat.
The report of this committee confirms for me that my opposition to a pre-emptive military intervention and war on Iraq was the correct position. Peaceful and diplomatic means to compel Iraq to comply with UN Security Council resolutions had not been exhausted before pre-emptive military action was taken. The hawks in the US administration were always about regime change and it is of no surprise that they continued to exaggerate Iraq's capabilities and to inflate the risk. Our Prime Minister, while arguing that Australia's intervention was not about regime change, conveniently uses that as a justification for his own position now that weapons of mass destruction have not been found.
The committee rightly ask, at paragraph 4.77:
Did we—
that is, Australia—
test the US motives and intentions and make an analysis against our own interests?
By that they mean, I think: `Did at all times the government put Australia's national interest at the fore?' The report states:
None of the assessments presented to the Committee contained any assessments of US motives. Some discussion occurred at the hearings. DIO said that such assessments were made. Beyond the following comment, however, the Committee saw no such assessments.
The comment the committee draw on was made in transcript by DIO and it is, I think, a very critical comment. DIO said:
We made a judgement here in Australia, too, that the United States was committed to military action against Iraq. We had the view that that was, in a sense, independent of the intelligence assessment.
Having read the report and carefully considered its contents, I think it is reasonable for me to conclude that the Howard government acted in a precisely similar manner—that it was committed to support its ally the United States in a pre-emptive military attack on Iraq and that the government's decision was in a sense independent of the aggregated intelligence assessments it was receiving.
I want to conclude by quoting a comment made in the report by the US deputy commander in Iraq on 26 June 2003. General Abizaid said:
Intelligence was the most accurate I've seen on the tactical level, probably the best I've seen on the operational level and perplexingly incomplete on the strategic level with regard to Weapons of Mass Destruction.
He continues:
It is perplexing to me ... that we have not found weapons of mass destruction when the evidence was so persuasive that it would exist ... I can offer no reasonable explanation.
On that, I rest my case.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,27,2
"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—The report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD asks the basic question: was the intelligence dodgy or did the government just make it up as it went along? I think the answer, if you read report, is: it was a little bit of both. The government response to the intelligence that it was receiving was selective at best. It is very important, as the member for Throsby has pointed out, that the report looks at the issue that it was not just the government responding to the intelligence but also the intelligence responding to the government—the report points to the issue of policy running strong. Why does this matter? It matters for a very important reason. We have put Australian men and women, our soldiers, in harm's way on the basis of misinformation, mistakes and dodgy intelligence. It matters also because the cost to Iraq has been enormous. The Prime Minister gets up day after day and the Minister for Foreign Affairs gets up day after day and they say that any opposition to this war in Iraq is the same thing as supporting the regime of Saddam Hussein. It is not the same thing at all. When we send troops to war they should be sent on the basis of sound logic, sound reasoning and established international principles. This has just not been the case in this instance.
It has been made very clear to us, now that there have been no weapons of mass destruction found, that really the government was concerned all along about Saddam Hussein's human rights record. I think it is fair to say that there has been no concern about his human rights record for decades and that this is an ex post facto excuse to explain the fact that the government's stated reasons for going to war have been unfulfilled. This is important, not just because of our soldiers and what the people of Iraq have suffered but also because we cannot run international relations in this way. We cannot make it up as we go along—invade a country and then say afterwards, `It wasn't an imminent threat we were worried about; it was their human rights record.' That is not a way for us to behave in the world.
It is pretty clear—from Clarke's book, as well as all of the information that we had during and even before the war—that President Bush saw an invasion of Iraq as finishing the job that his father had started and that there was an obsession within the Bush administration with going to war with Iraq. This is not something that I am saying; this is something that people who are experts in American intelligence are saying and have said all the way along. It is clear that the disarmament and inspections regimes were never going to be allowed to do their work properly, because if they ran their course and Iraq was effectively disarmed then whom would President Bush have gone to war with? What is particularly concerning about this is that the government is saying in this report, `Oh well, I suppose maybe we did get it wrong. Maybe the intelligence that was coming to us was not 100 per cent.' The report says in particular that the Australian agencies claim that they did not know until very late that there were dissenting views within the US agencies on issues like uranium from Africa because the classified US national intelligence estimate was not supplied to them for four months after its US release in 2002. But you did not need classified information to have doubts about the intelligence that we were basing our decision to go to war on.
There was a great deal of information in the public domain that made people sceptical about the decision to go to war. I know that you, Madam Deputy Speaker Corcoran, along with the member for Throsby, the member for Oxley and many others—the vast majority of people in the Labor opposition and the minor parties—were very sceptical about the information that we were receiving from the Australian government and about what was coming out of the UK and the US. It is not that we have any particular access to any information that the Australian intelligence agencies did not have access to; on the contrary, we were just looking at what was available on the public record.
If you look at the information contained in the Hans Blix reports of 27 January 2003, 14 February 2003 and 7 March 2003, it would lead you to say that verification was proceeding pretty much according to plan and that, given enough time, the United Nations would be able to be confident that there were not weapons of mass destruction. Indeed, in his report dated 19 March, Dr Blix outlines his: 
... sadness that three and a half months of work carried out in Iraq have not brought the assurances needed about the absence of weapons of mass destruction or other proscribed items in Iraq ...
So he says that, no, there are not assurances, and: 
... no more time is available for our inspections and armed action now seems imminent.
From his earlier reports and from that comment you can see how Dr Blix was eager to have further reporting time. In the report given to the UN Security Council on 27 January 2003, Dr Blix says:
In the past two months during which we have built up our presence in Iraq, we have conducted about 300 inspections in more than 230 different sites. 
	...	...	...
By the end of December, UNMOVIC began using helicopters both for the transport of inspectors and for actual inspection work. We now have eight helicopters. They have already proved invaluable in helping to `freeze' large sites by observing movement of traffic in and around the area.
	...	...	...
We have now an inspection apparatus which permits us to send multiple inspection teams, every day, all over Iraq, by road or by air. 
In his report of 14 February Dr Blix talks about the build-up of inspection capability. He says that they have got eight helicopters and 400 inspectors, all without notice to the Iraqis. He says that they always have had access promptly given, that they have been given access to a wide range of sites, that they have obtained a good knowledge of the industrial and scientific landscape of Iraq, that more than 200 chemical and 100 biological samples have been collected at different sites and that the results to date—and I stress this—have been consistent with Iraq's declarations.
Dr Blix also said: `We're fully aware that many governmental intelligence organisations are convinced and assert that proscribed weapons, items and programs continue to exist. Governments have many sources of information that are not available to inspectors.' He said:
Inspectors, for their part, must base their reports only on the evidence, which they can, themselves, examine and present publicly. Without evidence confidence cannot arise.
So Dr Blix is saying that, with fairly good access, they—both UNMOVIC and the International Atomic Energy Agency—are fairly confident that the period of disarmament could be short.
There was also, a great deal of information from alternative sources. There was an excellent book by Scott Ritter, the American assistant to Mr Richard Butler, who was the head of the first UNSCOM team. The book by Scott Ritter, War on Iraq—What Team Bush Doesn't Want You to Know, was written before the pre-emptive strike on Iraq. It pointed out, on the very good basis of Mr Ritter's own research and inspection experience in Iraq, that the reasons that were given for going to war were thin. Mr Ritter pointed out that, in relation to nuclear weapons, in 1998 the infrastructure and facilities were 100 per cent eliminated, although the organisation of scientists remained. He said in his book:
... for Iraq to re-acquire a nuclear weapons capability, they would have to basically build from the ground up, enrichment and weaponisation capabilities that would cost tens of billions of dollars.
They also would have needed electrical production much in excess of their capability, and what they would have produced and used would have been easily detected.
In relation to chemical weapons, which were originally produced at the Muthamama state establishment, that establishment was bombed during the first Gulf War. Its total destruction was supervised by the United Nations after the war. Any hidden chemicals would have been, to quote Mr Ritter, `harmless goo', because the shelf life of most chemical weapons is about five years. So his conclusion is that the talk of Iraq having chemical weapons was no longer valid. Mr Ritter also talked about biological weapons in much the same way. He said Iraq had no biological weapons because both the anthrax and botulin toxin are useless. He said:
For Iraq to have biological weapons today, they'd have to reconstitute a biological manufacturing base.
Remnant quantities of these substances would have been useless after three years. Further, in relation to a delivery system, in 1998 Iraq was, according to optimistic estimates, five years away from having a delivery system, even if the sanctions had been lifted—that is, a delivery system that would have threatened the United States and its interests. The bottom line is that Iraq does not have the capability to fire long-range ballistic missiles.
Finally, the fallback position that the Bush administration used and that John Howard was happy to support was that Iraq had terrorist links. There are probably more terrorists in Iraq today than there were before the war. Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator, but at least he was a secular dictator. When it comes to linking him with fundamentalist organisations like al-Qaeda, there is no proven evidence of such links. Indeed, there is evidence that Osama bin Laden has called Saddam Hussein an apostate and suggested that he was not hardline enough about the radical Muslim cause. So the idea that somehow going to war with Iraq was going to help fight terrorism has, I think, been pretty firmly knocked on the head.
It is interesting to look at what people were saying overseas. In 2001 Colin Powell declared this about Saddam Hussein: 
He has not developed any significant capability with respect to weapons of mass destruction ... our policies have strengthened the security of the neighbours of Iraq ...
Tony Blair told the House of Commons in November 2000:
We believe that the sanctions regime has effectively contained Saddam Hussein ...
That seemed to be the view of the overseas intelligence services and weapons inspectors of the time. It seems that most of the intelligence that has been marshalled to justify the case for war comes from untested sources. Our own joint committee report says:
Only two in 10 reports came from tested sources and it was not clear how many actual sources were involved in this increased reporting. The Committee was unable to examine the quality and clarity of this information received from overseas.
The problem is that our intelligence organisations were not examining that either. A lot of the reports seemed to come from Mr Chalabi's Iraqi National Council and its paid sources. The idea that Australia would make decisions about putting our troops in harm's way and going to war against Iraq on the basis of untested intelligence information—much of which was paid for, with the middleman being the person who stood to gain the most from the US attacks on Iraq—to me seems like a case of incredibly sloppy decision making and our country has certainly been the worse for it.

"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—I am happy to join my colleagues who are speaking on the report produced by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD entitled Intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. This gives us a chance to not only reflect upon what the committee looked at but also to take into account the fact that the committee undertook the task of looking at these issues because there were a series of fundamental questions about the accuracy of the intelligence before the war and there were related questions about the government's use of that intelligence, however accurate or inaccurate it was.
I think at the outset I can say that, if you want to have a war and if you want to go to war, it is often best if you can actually organise and marshal your arguments and organise and marshal agencies to give you a set of reasons for going to war. We know that prior to going to war with Iraq the one fundamental, simple, direct position put by the Australian government was that Iraq, under the despotic leadership of Saddam Hussein, had a massive program of weapons of mass destruction and Australia's participation in the war was bent towards stopping the dangerous things that would occur in the region and the world because of the existence of that pile of chemical, biological and—potentially—nuclear weapons. That justified Australia's part in being one of the members of the troika that went to war with Iraq, with some attendant assistance. So, joining the United States and Britain, that was Australia's fundamental reason.
We know that there have been investigations in the United States as well. They are referred to in the back of this report. There is an appendix on judgments made in the United States in 2002 and 2003 on the accuracy of intelligence that the United States relied on. We also know in fact that the United States had not one but about five reasons to go to war, and one of the reasons that they had five reasons instead of one is that the executive government in the United States could not come to a final and determined position in relation to the question of what to do with Iraq. The executive government was split.
On the one side we had Colin Powell, the former commander of US forces—directly involved in prosecuting the original Gulf War against Iraq in 1990-91—effectively taking a dovish position on the question of what to do in relation to Iraq. On the other side were the real military hardheads—Wolfowitz and others—who were bent upon building the case for war against Iraq, for a range of reasons. The first reason was the supposed existence of massive arsenals of weapons of mass destruction, and the second was the fact that regime change was needed and demanded in Iraq. President Bush, in arguing his case, fundamentally argued the hardline approach of Wolfowitz, Perle and others of his advisers—and of Vice President Dick Cheney—and they eventually took that road. The approach was based more on their preconceptions than on the intelligence they had received.
What is dealt with here in this report in terms of the adequacy of Australian intelligence is an astounding story of just how poorly our intelligence agencies coped with the task they were given of trying to work out whether or not Iraq had a weapons of mass destruction program. In part you cannot blame them, because this was a relatively closed society with a past history of weapons of mass destruction programs. We know that in the war between Iraq and Iran the United States actively supported Iraq logistically. They did so because Iraq was a secular state fighting against a state that had undergone a fundamentalist Islamic revolution. That was an eight-year war in which more than one million people died, and the logistic support from the United States and the training of Iraqi troops helped Iraq to fight more effectively against the United States in the Gulf War of 1990-91.
We also know, from what was uncovered as a result of the Gulf War, that there were stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons. We know that they had been used against the Kurds. We know that they were used against the Marsh Arabs and the Shiah in the South. We know that the world effectively turned a blind eye to that, as it turned a blind eye to the use of weapons of mass destruction during the Iraq-Iran war. In that long period after the Gulf War the world did not go in and intervene because inappropriate weapons—chemical and biological—had been used or because there was a great threat of their use. Instead, the world attempted to use the sanction regime against Iraq and tried to screw down Iraq's inappropriate behaviours.
We also know that part of the background to this report, in terms of the intelligence, was Richard Butler's work in attempting to do what Hans Blix later tried to do, which was to verify whether there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq or not. The great fundamental lesson to come out of this is that intelligence agencies and governments reliant upon those reports that come through need to take into account the fact that they can have the wool pulled over their eyes by someone who has not got the resources. In this case it was someone who, prior to the Gulf War, presented himself and his government as pretenders to regional power. The Syrians wanted to be a regional power in the Middle East, and Iraq had a much greater pretension to that role. When it went into Kuwait, it sought to establish its hegemony over the area, not just in words but in deeds. There was a lot of bluff and bluster. That was actually matched by weapons of mass destruction in the Iraq-Iran war and the existence of those prior to the Gulf War, but the great thing that has been uncovered finally after this last war is the fact that Saddam Hussein was tremendous at bluff and bluster.
You would have thought the intelligence agencies should have been able to carve their way through that bluff and bluster to get some idea of the fact that this bloke did not have much at all—that all of the attempts to frustrate the work of Richard Butler and others, four years before this last war, constituted a mechanism to hide the fact that this was an emperor with no clothes when it came to weapons of mass destruction. I cannot blame the agencies for being so deluded or governments around the world for being so deluded, but it is something we need to take into account when assessing the perils that face us. If we do not have a much better intelligence assessment of what is going on—if we do not have people on the ground or people from within those communities and countries, closed as they might be, to get an intelligent assessment of what we are actually facing—then we cannot take the appropriate responses.
Iraq was one of three countries that the Bush regime identified as posing a fundamental threat to world order and peace. We know that the two other identified countries—North Korea and Iran—really do have weapons of mass destruction programs. We know that they have nuclear programs. It is demonstrable in relation to North Korea and it has also been demonstrable in the past in relation to Iran. They are countries which have not been taken to task for the possession of weapons of mass destruction when we know that possession of such weapons is palpably the case. But one of the lessons from this report is the fact that, if you base your approach to these countries on a moral or ethical ground and you determine—whatever the source of intelligence available to you—that you are going to go to war with those countries or that you will disarm them and break their weapons of mass destruction programs, then maybe you had better have some really decent intelligence to start off with. If you do not know what you are fighting, you can get yourself into a total quagmire.
It is one of those instances in terms of openness and accountability, as I spoke of yesterday, where you can say that there is a whole series of problems. If the intelligence agencies have been deficient then one of the reasons they might have been deficient is that the government really did not want to know the answers anyway. In the Yes Minister program—which is instructive in a whole range of areas, including this one—we could look at cabinet secretary Sir Arnold, Sir Humphrey Appleby's friend. In the opening episode of the series, I think, he said, `If people don't know what you're doing, they can't know what you're doing wrong.' So if you do not ask the questions of the intelligence agencies that would lead to sensible answers, if you pretend that you have not had information presented to you which in fact you have or you deny knowledge of it, or if you try to build a case without an adequate foundation, then you can attempt to get away with just about anything and everything.
We have seen that over the past year or so and it worries me. The sensible thing would be to say that the government have a difference of opinion with some of their agencies, some of the people who work for them, people who are commenting or the opposition. They have a different point of view. They thought we were justified in going into Iraq, and that was on the single basis of the expectation that there were weapons of mass destruction. What is wrong with the government just coming forward and saying, `The intelligence might have been a bit faulty, but we didn't expect this bloke to be all bluff and bluster'?
Basically, they have not found any of those weapons yet because there are not any. Saddam seems to have done away with most of them after the Gulf War. He said he had, but no-one believed him, because you could not believe this bloke anyway. You are left with a situation where the government is now making a great show of the fact that weapons programs were discovered. Those issues are dealt with in this report as well, but the shadow minister for foreign affairs and international security has been quite correct in saying that there is a whole world of difference between an arsenal and a whiteboard. An arsenal is going to do a great deal of damage; a whiteboard will not do much damage, except to selected ministers in past governments and maybe future ones. 
The question of how reliant we should be on our intelligence agencies is always a fundamental one for any government. Playing politics with how you get information out of those agencies or with what they give you—in this case, in trying to justify what I think was an unjustifiable approach in terms of the government's reasoning behind why they went to war—is unacceptable. They could have said, `It's not just weapons of mass destruction.' There are four other instances where one of the coalition partners stated a whole range of other reasons. Ex post facto, the Prime Minister has laid a great deal of stress, as has the foreign minister, on regime change as being the fundamental reason they have gone in. The fact of Saddam Hussein's regime having fallen justifies everything else, even if there were not too many weapons of mass destruction to be found.
The core issue here is a disjunction between intelligence agencies and the work they have done—however well or poorly they have been able to operate—and the fact that the government really were not concerned about finding out what the core realities were, because what they may have found out would have been uncomfortable for them. They wanted to proceed to war without knowing too much about what might be problematic. Case after case in what the parliamentary committee has looked at shows you that, if you blunder ahead with a war purpose in mind, you can get yourself into a hell of a lot of trouble.
In particular, this government, in trying to explain itself out of the situation afterwards, has found that it is not really a great idea to overbuild a case and, in overbuilding that case, to say that you were then reliant upon the intelligence information that you got. It is exactly the same problem that the Blair government faces. Overbuilding and overselling on the basis of an inadequately examined series of postulates can lead you to an unfounded reason for doing the most important thing a government can do—that is, put the lives of its citizens at risk in sending them to war. I am grateful that this report has been done so well by both sides of the parliament. I am happy to comment on it, because we should learn a great deal from it.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2004-03-24,"—I too rise to make some comments upon the inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD into the handling of prewar intelligence on Iraq. I agree with many of the comments made by Labor members in commending the members and the secretariat of the parliamentary joint committee. It is important to note that this report is a great example of the parliament operating effectively and in a nonpartisan way to try to elicit the facts from what is a very blurred subject—that is, what did go on and what intelligence was being received and handed to our government before the decision was made by the Prime Minister and the executive to embark upon a war without the sanction of the United Nations and, as we know now, without the main justification for embarking upon that war? It is incumbent upon parliamentary committees to inquire properly into these matters. There can be no greater decision for any government of any nation than to prosecute a war against another sovereign state. Therefore, it is critical that we analyse dispassionately any deficiencies and commend any strengths of our processes in making such important decisions.
I think it is fair to say that, notwithstanding the fact that the report was handed down unanimously, there are some clear concerns that have to be raised in this forum and in the public domain at large. The fact is that, firstly, it is clear that the evidence upon which the Prime Minister relied to embark upon a war was not unequivocal and was not certain. Indeed, it is important to note that the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and other members of the government made comments prior to going to war that exaggerated or contradicted in some areas the intelligence they were receiving from our agencies. That is not to say that the agencies' conduct was perfect or that the system that we have in place is by any means perfect. But I think if we are to blame anybody for some of the deficiencies that led to the reasoning behind the government's decision, we have to look at the way in which the Prime Minister chose to use information that he was receiving and that his cabinet were receiving to make these decisions. 
I think that, as members have already indicated, it is fair to say that we have had the Prime Minister revise history since the official end of the war. We have had the Prime Minister shift fundamentally from the need to remove so-called weapons of mass destruction from the hands of Saddam Hussein, from his regime—because, in the Prime Minister's view, it posed a threat to our nation and our citizens—to the need for regime change. It does not take a scholar to glean from all of the public comments by the Prime Minister, either in the parliament or elsewhere, prior to making the decision to send our young men and women to war, that regime change featured very little in his consideration. That may well be because he did not believe he would be able to convince the public at large that we should send thousands of our young men and women so far away to fight in a war, prosecute a war, on that basis. There is no doubting that the regime that has come to an end was an awful, autocratic, violent regime. I think all members of the House are happy to see that regime come to an end. But there is a question of accountability. I think there has been a failure on the part of the Prime Minister to properly deduce from the information received and then to properly deliberate upon this matter. 
In the short time I have before this debate is adjourned, I would like to point out some of those failures that were recorded in the report. The report says that there are four intelligence issues—uranium for Africa, importation of aluminium tubes, mobile biological laboratories and UAVs for biological weapons programs—that were considered fundamental to the existence of weapons of mass destruction and the capacity of Iraq to use them.
The first three issues were used at various stages by the Howard government—the Prime Minister in particular—to establish his case for weapons of mass destruction. Indeed, the report says in sections 1.38 to 1.49 that these issues were either wrong or disputed or both. And the fourth issue remains unproven. So it would appear that the Prime Minister had already failed to have proper regard to the caveats placed by the intelligence agencies on those matters before using them as some of the reasons at least for this country embarking upon a war.
I would like to proceed with some other matters which go to further intelligence failures—that is, between the agency and the government, and indeed some of the areas where I think the government misled the parliament and the Australian people—but I am mindful of the time. I do not want to be cut off mid-sentence, but there are a whole host of things I wish to comment on once this matter returns to the House. I therefore seek leave to continue my remarks when the debate is resumed.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.
