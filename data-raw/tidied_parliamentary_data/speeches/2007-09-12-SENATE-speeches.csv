"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-09-12,"—At the request of the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation, Senator Abetz, I move:
That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a first time.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (DEMOCRATIC PLEBISCITES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>First Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2007-09-12,"—Australians have a particular fascination with sport, which escalates during major sporting events. Outside of immediate matters political, the nation is once again focused on major sporting events internationally and at home, with the recent Rugby World Cup in France, the World Athletics Championships having concluded in Japan, football finals taking place right across this country and the Beijing Olympics less than a year away. We all enjoy watching such spectacles, and we love to cheer on our sporting heroes as they participate at the very highest levels and perform at their very optimum. We wear our patriotism on our sleeves for all to see during times like this. As one, we share in the triumphs and the trials of our athletes and our representatives.
But sporting heroes are not made simply in the 40 minutes on the field or in the sub 10 seconds on the track; they are the result of years of very hard work by not only the athletes themselves but the committed coaches, organisations and clubs right across this country. As a nation, we enjoy the fruits of such dedication. It has seen us excel in a myriad of sports: cricket, cycling, swimming, rowing—the list could go on. May I add, for the record of Hansard, that we have the benefit of the presence in the gallery today of a great Australian rowing champion in Alastair McLachlan, a good South Australian.
Our sporting achievements are really remarkable when put into the context of the place our nation occupies in the world. At the Athens Olympics we finished fourth on the medal tally, an amazing feat, given we are a country of around only 21 million people. Our closest competitors on that medal tally were Germany, a nation of 80 million, and the Peoples Republic of China, with a population of around 1.2 billion.
But we cannot take for granted our sporting success. We cannot afford to rest on our laurels. We cannot assume that we will maintain our position as one of the world’s most successful sporting nations. We must do more to ensure continued success. I say this because it is oft remarked that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. So, as a nation, successive governments should be flattered that our successful programs, our ground-breaking sporting programs, are being copied by other countries. Countries such as the UK, Germany, France and China have all developed their very own version of the Australian Institute of Sport. It is obviously not called the Australian Institute of Sport but they have their sporting centres of excellence. We should not only take this as a compliment and recognition of the great strides and achievements we have made but also recognise it as a potential threat to our continued sporting success.
The results of these competing programs are already becoming evident. China has developed into a sporting superpower. In 1932, for instance, China sent a single athlete to the Olympics. In 2004, China came second on the Olympic medal tally, with 32 gold medals. The Chinese have a particular approach that is applicable only to that country. But similar methods are being implemented right across the world. In the lead-up to the London Olympics, the UK is deploying formidable resources to ensure their sporting success. Not only have they established their very own sporting centre of excellence; they are recruiting second generation migrants from Africa and the Caribbean. They are recruiting Australian coaches. They are recruiting managers and sports scientists from this country who are being lured to work offshore in not only the UK but other countries on the promise of hefty pay packets and virtually unlimited budgets. As a nation we cannot afford to lose this local expertise—and it is very important when once again we consider the relatively small pool of talent that Australia has available to it.
I would like to put this in perspective. Let us assume that around 10 per cent of the population aged between 10 and 19 have the capacity to become elite athletes. Countries such as China have a talent pool of 22.8 million potential elite athletes; the USA, about 4.2 million; and Australia, around 280,000. This is a very rough estimation, of course, but it illustrates the enormous challenge facing Australian sport and the very real need to make the most of the talent pool we have. We need to ensure that we can retain Aussie ingenuity and Aussie know-how in this country, not only for the development of our athletes but for the future development of our coaches. We need to ensure that young talent is prepared to replace our existing pool of athletes as they retire or move on to other careers. We in Australia very much need to look forward and focus on the future of the Australian sporting system in order to maintain our sporting influence worldwide.
It is fair to say that our sporting future changed with the development of the Australian Institute of Sport in 1981. I think that every time we witness the success on the international stage of an individual or a team, or we see our national flag being raised in victory, we are witnessing the demonstration of the success of the AIS. It remains one of the most innovative sporting organisations in the world, and our results are testament to the programs themselves. But in an increasingly competitive sporting environment, in a world where many countries have their own sports institutes, what is going to take Australian sport to the next level? What is going to be the AIS of the next 20 or 30 years? At the very base level we need to ensure that we have more children, in particular, participating in sport, because participation rates have, quite frankly, been dropping. It is an issue that has led to a number of health and welfare constraints across the country. It is an issue on which I think quite frankly the state Labor governments have dropped the ball, because they have not committed, over many, many years, to supporting physical activity as a core part of the education policy.
But the federal government has recognised the importance of this, not only to sport but also to the health and wellbeing of the future generations of our entire country. We have done this through the Active After-school Communities program. Through the AASC program, children have the opportunity to develop the mobility skills that will serve them very well throughout their life, whether they become an elite athlete or even a competitive athlete. Children now have the opportunity to become interested in sport, and we need to ensure that young people have the interest and the ability to participate as fulsomely as they can so that we can develop any sporting talents they may have.
We need to encourage more young people into the sports system. An active after-schools program can do just that. We need to also review how best to support them once they get into the sports system and how best to develop their natural talents because it is in the early stages that future elite athletes—or, indeed, people of any walk of life—develop a number of skills. They develop their dedication, work ethic and commitment—and build their character—that will stand them in very good stead.
Right now we are entrusting our sporting future to a number of very well-meaning, very well-intentioned and very dedicated parents and volunteer coaches. One can never understate the contribution that these people make to our nation, the history of volunteerism and the development of the potential and character of every child. But our best and brightest sporting talent need our best and brightest coaching talent. We need that to ensure that Australia’s sporting potential is fulfilled. We need to be able to identify at a very early age our best and brightest sporting talent and take them as far as they can go. We also need to identify which coaches offer the most innovative development of sporting potential in this country. We need to identify those at a very early age too.
I believe that Australia’s sporting future lies in talent identification, which was pioneered by the AIS some 20 years ago. I was involved in the early stages of that development. They must have used me to discover what not to get in an elite sportsman; nevertheless, I was one of their early guinea pigs. Since then talent identification has been a big part of the AIS and the Australian Sports Commission. One of the aims of the program was to identify and develop athletes in preparation for the Barcelona and Atlanta Olympics. The focus initially was on eight sports, including athletics, cycling, swimming, rowing and weightlifting. Over the years the program has progressed and become more important, especially in the lead-up to the Sydney Olympics.
Talent ID was used in schools to identify those children with the physical potential to develop in a chosen sport. We have had a number of successes with this approach. According to the Australian Sports Commission, the program aims to identify and subsequently fast-track the development of potential athletes to Olympic and world championship levels. It also contributes positively to our sporting culture by increasing participation, increasing the depth of our competitive field and developing our coaches.
This program also allows us to target particular sports where Australia can achieve early success. Perhaps the best known success is the skeleton project of 2004. Skeleton is an unusual sport. It is a sport which involves sliding headfirst down a bobsled track—it is not for the faint of heart! Ten women were identified as having enormous potential to succeed in this sport. These women came from areas such as surf-lifesaving and beach sprinting. A few of them had not seen snow or a bobsled track ever before. They trained these 10 women very hard and they participated in international competitions. Some 18 months later we had a junior world champion and a skeleton crew member qualifying for the Torino Winter Olympics in 2006. This demonstrates very clearly that Australia has the talent, the capacity and the ability to succeed in a range of areas based on identifying the talents and potential of athletes.
The federal budget in 2006 allocated $55.7 million to the Australian Sports Commission to enhance the performance of our elite athletes. This was part of a $125 million package given to the ASC to deliver excellence in sports performance over 2006 and 2007. Importantly, $4.8 million was earmarked for the development of a national identification network, involving regional talent identification initiatives and the implementation of a talent transfer program. Further funding of $4.6 million was also allocated over four years to identify, develop and retain elite coaches. This is a very far-sighted allocation of funds and it will stand the Australian sporting network in very good stead.
We also have an Indigenous talent ID program. This program aims to develop the athletic ability of the Indigenous population, who are very well regarded and very well known for their enormous sporting potential. You just have to look at the football field or see the success of Cathy Freeman to understand that. We have programs in athletics, boxing, basketball and a whole range of other areas. One example of success in this program is Patrick Mills, a 19-year-old basketball player who was selected to join the Boomers on their European tour. His performance there earned him a spot in the Olympic qualifying series against New Zealand. So we are already producing results.
We are taking multi-talented athletes with a background in one sport and identifying those people who have an interest in sport and channelling them into an area where they can achieve not only success and enjoyment but a great deal for Australia. We did it with Alisa Camplin, who went from gymnastics to aerial skiing, and Jane Saville, a former ironwoman in surf-lifesaving turned race walker and triple Commonwealth gold medallist.
Many other talent identification programs are being undertaken because we need to know how many potential Cathy Freemans are out there. How many potential Ian Thorpes are swimming in the backyard pool, unseen by those who could catapult them to glory? This is a way of allocating our scarce resources—the human resources, the human potential and the talent pool I referred to earlier—and applying our funding model in the most consistent manner possible.
Australia cannot afford to leave the discovery of our successful athletes and our potential gold medallists simply to chance. With the small population that we have we cannot wait for accidents or coincidences to identify future successful athletes. ID programs are essential for the future of Australian sporting success. To remain competitive we must focus on these programs and support them wholeheartedly. International sporting success is a vital part of our cultural identity. We cannot afford to leave any stone unturned in seeking to achieve these aims.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Sport</title>,Matters of Public Interest,2,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2007-09-12,"—My question is to Senator Coonan, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. Will the minister confirm that the contract with OPEL for $958 million of taxpayers’ money has been signed and, despite the fact that she cannot reveal the technical specifications of the network, including where the 1,316 new towers will be built, how the OPEL network will reach 99 per cent of Australians? What will the minimum broadband speeds be, what will the maximum retail price be and how much money is OPEL contributing? How can the minister award one of the largest single government grants to a private company in Australia’s history without being able to reveal the most basic requirements of the agreement?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Broadband</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2007-09-12,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Given that the minister cannot reveal the most basic requirements of an already signed agreement, how can government MPs continue to mail out fraudulent propaganda like this which misleads the Australian public? Can the minister confirm that these maps show a 20 km radius around the tower but OPEL have admitted that the range is only in the order of 6 km from their towers, slashing your claimed coverage in these fraudulent maps that you are distributing?
—I remind Senator Conroy of standing orders and the waving of documents in the chamber.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Broadband</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2007-09-12,"—I thank Senator Conroy for his usual misconceived question. It is very good to see the Labor Party taking such a strong interest in this nation-building broadband initiative, because this comprehensive plan—the Australian Broadband Guarantee and the OPEL contract—will ensure that all Australians will be able to access fast broadband regardless of where they live. More and more Australians are getting the message that within two years fast broadband will be a reality and, unlike Labor’s fraudulent proposal, Australians will not have to wait until 2013 to receive improved services. Unlike the Labor Party, our plan covers all Australians regardless of where they live, instead of leaving out three million households and the most needy Australians.
This is a complex piece of technology with a complex contract that is being rolled out. As I said the other day, the implementation will be subject to a detailed implementation plan together with consultation with all stakeholders as to the optimum placement of towers for the rollout. This is in stark contrast to the Labor Party, which for the past five months has not even had a plan, has had no idea where any network would go and has been absolutely misleading about the capacity of its plan to deliver even to about three-quarters of Australians, let alone to all Australians. I can understand that it is agitating the Labor Party enormously that this government has been successful in being able to roll out a whole new independent network that has absolutely nothing to do with—
—I rise on a point of order. Mr President, can you draw the attention of the minister to the question that I asked. I specifically asked what the minimum broadband speeds will be, what the maximum retail price will be and how much money OPEL will be contributing. This contract is already signed.
—I am listening carefully to the minister’s answer and there is no point of order.
—Under the new initiative, 1,361 new WiMAX sites will be built, 426 very fast ADSL2+ exchanges will be enabled, about 15,000 kilometres of backhaul will be built, and that will deliver approximately a 30 per cent reduction in the wholesale price of backhaul. The speeds have been well and truly publicised and were put out again in my press release. I do not know whether Senator Conroy is having trouble reading, but it has now been said ad nauseam that the speeds will be 6 to 12 megabits by 2009 and that retail metropolitan prices will be between $30 and $35 to $60. The Labor Party does not have any prices at all. This is a farce on the part of the Labor Party.

Come clean with your costings, your coverage maps and your technical details about your broadband proposals for the full scrutiny of the Australian public.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-09-12,"—I have an answer for Senator Siewert in relation to the matter that she raised during question time. Woodside’s proposed Pluto project, including onshore and offshore construction, was referred under the EPBC Act. In deciding whether or not to approve the project, the minister will take into account any conditions placed on the project by the Western Australian environment minister.
The minister has recently received applications for both emergency and long-term protection under sections 9 and 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act in relation to site B on the Burrup, part of the Woodside Pluto gas project. The minister will of course give careful consideration to their application according to law. In the case of the section 10 application for long-term protection, this will include considering a report from an independent person on the matters required under the act.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Heritage: Preservation</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,4,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2007-09-12,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
What we are seeing here is a government flailing around desperately trying to cover up the deliberately misleading information it is providing about its 17th and 18th plans. That is right; in case you have not counted them, these are the federal government’s 17th and 18th broadband plans in 11 years.
Government senators interjecting—
—You are so deluding yourselves that you are sending around information in pamphlets like the one I have here issued by Ms Fran Bailey. While you are in the chamber, let me take you through some of your self-delusions. The pamphlet starts off by saying:
Did you know?
Labor says its plan to roll out fibre to every home—
that’s funny; I thought we were rolling out fibre to the node—
will cost taxpayers $4.7 billion.
However, South Korea—a country half the size of Victoria—used the same system, but it cost $50 billion.
As Senator Coonan continually says—and accuses us of doing—Labor is rolling out fibre to the node. Labor has no plan to roll out fibre to the home, but that has not stopped Fran Bailey from distributing this nice, colour brochure.
She then goes on in her brochure to talk about all the wonderful things about the WiMAX product. There is only one problem with that: you bought an obsolete version of WiMAX. You bought fixed wireless. The brochure tells us that WiMAX chips will be incorporated in a whole raft of electronic devices, such as computers and laptops. That is true: WiMAX chips will be incorporated in those devices. But there is one problem: you bought an obsolete version of WiMAX. Not one computer or laptop in this country produced today or that will be produced in the future will actually receive your dog of a product of OPEL—not one laptop. You will not be able to take it for a walk down to the shed, like Senator Coonan told you in the party room. I am sure she said, ‘Don’t you worry; we’ll be able to pick up a laptop and walk down to the shed.’ It is not true. Not one laptop will receive it. And of course there are those very colourful maps that you all had distributed. I note that not all of you have taken the option of posting them out, like Fran Bailey has. Some of you probably looked at them and said, ‘Umm, that can’t be right; that can’t possibly be true.’ Let me be clear: this government is offering Australians, particularly the millions and millions of Australians who live in regional, rural and outer-suburban Australia, a second-class plan designed to lock them into an outdated, obsolete technology that they will not be able to upgrade from in their lifetime.
But let us go back to the issue of coverage. I will read from the government’s panel in Australia Connected, as distributed by you and by the minister, which says:
Coverage—Proven to reach 100% of the population.
Actually, the minister is only claiming 99 per cent. So that is the first mislead. The second is:
Speeds—12-50 mbps.
I know it may seem like the words ‘up to’ are not important but, if a company was not using the words ‘up to’, it would be fined by the ACCC. WiMAX, particularly the OPEL fixed wireless, cannot deliver 12 megabits. OPEL themselves have admitted that actual speeds will be less due to distance and traffic. If you want 12 megabits you will need to be standing underneath the tower at midnight on a Saturday and praying that you are the only person using it. That is the only way that you are going to get 12 megabits out of this dog that you have bought. But I will continue quoting. The next point is ‘Radius from each site’. The maps in the brochure are particularly important at this point. The nice green circles are around base stations. What did the government claim? The government claimed:
Minimum 20km from base station.
What does Mr Peter Ferris, the General Manager of Technology and Planning for Optus, say about the reach of the OPEL product? He says that the systems trial by Optus requires line of sight—and I will come back to that—connection between tower and user and then six kilometres from the towers. (Time expired)

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2007-09-12,"—It is always entertaining to listen to Senator Conroy talk about truth in advertising and in supplying the facts. It is a very strange form of entertainment. Perhaps it is better for me to listen to it than to have my children suffer nightmares after watching Senator Conroy on the TV, as they did the other day. They rang up and asked, ‘Dad, do all senators behave so badly?’ I say to the 80,000 listeners today that I am very disappointed you have heard that spray from the Labor Party. They criticise a very good initiative to roll out broadband to 99 per cent of Australia, to give access to 99 per cent of Australians to fast, efficient broadband at a cost which is a fraction of the cost of this mythological program which the Labor Party purports it will roll out.
Senator Conroy talked about how we have had a number of approaches to supplying broadband to people in this country in as efficient and cost-effective a manner as is possible. Of course we have had a number of approaches because the technology has been changing over the entire duration of this government, and it will continue to change. The Labor Party are suggesting that their answer is the only answer. It is going to cost $4.7 billion. They are going to raid the future posterity of this country, taking money from our children and taxpayers to pay for a technology that will not be delivered for probably a decade or more, if they manage to honour their promises.
The Labor Party have a history of not honouring their promises. We deliver on our commitments and they know that over there. I am really disappointed that they cannot acknowledge that we are using taxpayers’ money in an efficient manner to deliver results that are going to be far superior to anything they are offering. But that is the Labor Party way: they oppose for opposition’s sake.
I would like to put a couple of things on the record. We are aiming to reach 100 per cent of the Australian population with broadband and 99 per cent of the people with high-speed broadband. The Labor Party are claiming they will reach 98 per cent, and I give them credit for that, but they are likely to reach only 75 per cent. They are talking about 12 megabits per second; we are talking about between 12 and 50 megabits per second. We are doing it with a range of technologies to speed it up. We are talking about extending coverage as new technologies come out. This is an incremental program to ensure that we are always at the very forefront of technology. Let us have a think about this. The Labor Party are going to charge $4.7 billion to the taxpayers of Australia. That is simply not right. And they are going to do it to provide an undisclosed service to consumers. They are not prepared to talk about a commercial operation with companies making a contribution as well.
We are putting $600 million into the Broadband Connect Infrastructure Program. We are allocating a subsequent $358 million to guarantee affordable and comparable prices for all Australians. And what is important is that we are starting on this immediately. When are Labor going to start? In the never-never. We do not know because Labor’s promises are all spin, all style and no substance, and they are designed to deliver in 2050, 2035 or 2020. There is no meaningful policy debate or contribution; it is all about clichés and trite attacks on the government because they are paid to be outraged. Every time we have tried to take a step forward in this country, it has been opposed by the Labor Party. They become increasingly hysterical with their shrieking. They try to alarm the general populace, the voting public, but they will not swallow it. They cannot believe the Labor Party because they have broken every single promise they ever made.
You talk about economic conservatism, yet you vote against it all. You talk about prudent fiscal management; it is simply not true. We hear it time and time again. The Australian public will not believe the Labor Party. The country cannot afford to believe the Labor Party. The Labor Party have destroyed economies in three years or less. We cannot take the risk. Look at Whitlam. Look at Keating. Look at Hawke. They destroyed the Australian economy in less than a term of government. We cannot afford to go back to Labor. The Australian public cannot afford to go back to Labor. We know that the Labor Party cannot deliver. (Time expired)

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2007-09-12,"—What this country cannot afford is to re-elect a government that has no vision or plans for the future. Let’s face it, when Kevin Rudd, on behalf of the Labor Party and with Senator Conroy, announced our broadband plan early this year it was because there is a vision for the future and some foresight in the Labor Party. It was announced because this government fails the test of the future. After dithering around for 11 long years and not getting on the program when it comes to keeping up to date with telecommunications and the infrastructure, finally this government is forced to react and come up with something. It has come up with a half-baked idea which is a concoction between SingTel, Optus and Intel. If you have a look at the substantive nature of this infrastructure, you see that it buys out old technology, when young kids, businesses and the families of our nation want not today’s technology but tomorrow’s technology today. This certainly will not deliver it.
I think this government is hoping that the general public will be dazzled by technology words and IT concepts that they will not understand. When people go to their computer to access the internet, they want real-time, fast service. I notice a suggestion that this OPEL deal will access 99 per cent of the population—Senator Bernardi suggested 100 per cent just now in his reply. In fact, that is absolute piffle.
If you have a look at the copy of the map that I have in front of me of the OPEL coverage for the Northern Territory—and I will seek leave to table this map—compared to what Telstra already delivers commercially, you will see that all it is simply going to do is affect Darwin and Palmerston. Funny about that: Darwin and Palmerston happen to be in Solomon. The rest of the Northern Territory has no black dot marks or circles anywhere on this map. Of course the rest of the territory happens to be in Lingiari. But the issue of whether this is perhaps going to be rolled out in marginal seats is a debate for another time. If you are not living in Darwin or Palmerston and you live somewhere else in the Northern Territory, what do you get out of this deal? Zero; nothing. If you live in Jabiru or Katherine, let alone Borroloola, Tennant Creek or even Alice Springs, you get absolutely nothing out of this deal. This map proves it. This map has only two little dots on it, over some of Darwin and over some of Palmerston. Anywhere else south of those lights at the Palmerston Centre you will get absolutely nothing, nothing at all, out of this deal.
Mr Howard’s plan is for a high-speed service but only if you are in one of the major capital cities in the states. You will get a low-speed service if you anywhere else in this country and absolutely no speed if you live in the Northern Territory outside of Darwin and Palmerston. Our plan is worth $4.7 billion; the government’s plan is worth $900 million. The reason that our plan costs a lot is that it will actually roll out fibre optic to the node, not just in the capital cities—and in marginal seats—but beyond the capital cities and into rural, regional and remote Australia. Territorians are being held back, and our options are even more limited because we do not have the level of internet access that is acceptable in the 21st century. I put it to you that if you live in the heart of Melbourne or Sydney then your internet access needs are not as crucial as those of someone who lives on a cattle station, out bush or in a remote community because the people out there are now relying on internet services for their day-to-day access to information.
The OPEL network that the government is suggesting is based on obsolete technology. It has fixed wireless WiMAX with connection speeds that are shared and the more users on the network the slower the speed. In fact, industry experts have indicated that the network is on average capable of delivering only 512 kilobits per second at twice today’s average speed. I have already mentioned that Optus have admitted that wireless will have only a six-kilometre penetration and it will be less behind hills—not 20 to 50 kilometres as the minister stated in her press release in June. So the Howard government is proposing an antiquated, back-to-the-past broadband connection. (Time expired)

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2007-09-12,"—We have heard today yet another great spiel from Senator Conroy attempting to flog his dead horse of a policy, and I am being generous by even calling it a policy. He is trying to flog his dead horse of a press release, a press release that he likes to call a policy, which he and the Leader of the Opposition pretend is a policy statement. It was nothing more than a headline-grabbing media stunt earlier this year. I applaud them for their success in grabbing the headlines at the time but since then it has been demonstrated that the policy, the media release, lacks substance, any substantive follow-up and—as the government has outlined with its far more comprehensive plan to deliver broadband services to the people of Australia—it is flawed as well.
Senator Conroy spoke of taking the laptop down to the shed. I am wondering whether he has been spending a little too much time in the shed and not enough time actually out there talking to people in industry, talking to small businesses and talking to the community about the flexibility that is required to deliver appropriate broadband services. Perhaps, rather than sitting in the shed, Senator Conroy should in fact be calling the Broadband Now service set up by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Coonan, and the government recently. He should be checking it out on the web to see the sorts of services that are available that will ensure Australians get access to the type of wide-ranging, high-speed broadband that they require.
Under this government, 4.3 million households and small businesses have already accessed high-speed broadband. Our plan is to ensure that it is rolled out to be accessible by 99 per cent of Australians—no ifs and buts but the right blend, the right mix, of technology to ensure that that is available to that 99 per cent. To do so, we firstly start with the OPEL network. I particularly welcome the OPEL network, a combination of a consortium involving both Optus and Elders. I know that Senator Wortley would join me in welcoming the hundreds of jobs that that successful consortium, based in the home state of Elders, will create in our home state of South Australia—great news for South Australia. The importance of the inclusion of Elders in this consortium is not only that it creates jobs in Adelaide. Most importantly, it provides shopfront services right around Australia—a pre-established network of services for this wholesale product that will be used by Elders as well as other ISPs in the delivery of the broadband service.
OPEL will be operational with six megabits per second increasing to 12 megabits per second by 30 June 2009. Contrast that with Labor’s fibre-to-the-node plan which, whilst reaching fewer people, will be fully operational to that smaller number of people no earlier than 2012. Knowing that it will be a publicly funded infrastructure rollout of the type that we have seen state Labor governments—and federal Labor governments of the past—operating, no doubt we can be confident that the cost will blow out and the time will drag out and the technology will be outdated by the time they even get around to finishing it.
So we have the OPEL network as the first important part of the package. It is not the only part of the package. We are also looking to establish a network within the cities, looking to ensure that, in addition to that, we provide, through the Australia Connected program, broadband that goes beyond just OPEL and actually provides a mix of ADSL2+ and fibre technology as well as the WiMAX technology used under that contract that has been signed. This will ensure that we are using the right range of technologies for different areas. Contrary to what we have just heard, Labor’s fibre-to-the-node plan will actually leave many people in regional areas worse off. It will ensure that they do not get the services that can be offered by the flexibility of WiMAX where there are not nodes to which to deliver the fibre. That is why this is an important policy. Instead, we are seeing from Labor old-style policy investing billions of dollars of public funding to deliver something that the private sector, working in tandem with government, can deliver for much less, ensuring that we on this side of the house reach 99 per cent of the people with high-speed broadband, compared with an opposition policy that will not— (Time expired)

"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2007-09-12,"—I rise to take note of answers by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Coonan. We have had 11 long years of the Howard government, and it is without doubt that the state of telecommunications infrastructure and services across Australia has suffered as a result. Senator Birmingham, let me say that I have spoken to people in our home state of South Australia about their ability to get high-speed broadband. I have spoken with small businesses which can no longer compete because they cannot access high-speed broadband, and I have met with students who have thrown in the towel on accessing lessons on the internet because it was just too unreliable, too difficult, too time consuming and too frustrating. As it stands, our nation’s lack of high-speed broadband is hurting and holding back Australian families and small businesses. We lag a long way behind the countries we consider to be our international peers, yet the coalition has sat on its hands for years, only cobbling together a plan in the shadow of a looming federal election. Even now the result is unsatisfactory on many levels.
The federal government has thrown $958 million of taxpayers’ money at the problem in the lead-up to an election. The trouble is that this $958 million, awarded to the Elders consortium OPEL, is going towards building a second-class broadband system. Having had 17 previous attempts at devising a broadband plan for Australia, the Howard government’s 11th hour effort has raised more questions than answers. Perhaps the minister does have the answers to these questions but will not reveal them because she knows the answers are not palatable. It certainly is not due to the lack of opportunity.
Today, the minister responded to specific questions from Senator Conroy by saying that the government has a comprehensive plan. There were no answers, just a sweeping statement. Here we have one of the largest government grants to a private company in our history and yet three months on there remain so many unanswered questions. These questions are as basic as what the real minimum broadband speeds will be, what the technical specifications of the network will be, where the 1,361 new towers will be built, what the maximum retail price will be and just how much money OPEL will in fact be contributing. The fact is that the government made the announcement that it would award OPEL the job in June this year. So, surely, it is not unreasonable to expect that in September, some three months on, Australian taxpayers be provided with at least some of the answers. After all, it relates to $958 million of taxpayers’ money being spent.
When the government announced that it had awarded the tender to OPEL, its purpose was to build a broadband network for underserved areas—those who had long been ignored. However, those people living in such areas, which include but are not limited to rural, regional and remote Australia, are going to be let down under this proposal. The network, which is based on the obsolete technology fixed wireless WiMAX, will not reach the claimed 99 per cent of Australians. Optus has admitted six-kilometre penetration from the base station, not the 20 to 50 kilometres stated by the minister in her release in June. OPEL states that its network will serve 3.7 million phone lines in underserved areas, but there are in fact only two million phone lines. So this statement by OPEL appears to be completely false and misleads the Australian people. OPEL does not own the transmission spectrum. The Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has admitted that actual coverage will not even be known until the network is turned on.
Adding to the coverage conundrum are the fraudulent maps being mailed out by the government without the disclaimer issued by the department. The disclaimer reads:
The Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts makes no guarantee about the suitability of these maps for any purpose by any person whatsoever.
Along with the deficiencies in the coverage by the government proposal come disappointments in the area of speed, a basic requirement of an appropriate broadband network. (Time expired)

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2007-09-12,"—It is with a very strong sense of disappointment and anger that I propose this matter of public importance. I have a strong sense of disappointment because, once again, public trust in our residential aged-care system has been tested and it has tested badly. I have a sense of anger, and it arises from the fact that this situation could and should never have occurred. The report of the assessment undertaken from 6 to 15 August 2007 is the most appalling and distressing description of what is clearly not care for the residents of Belvedere Park Nursing Home in Victoria. It is the most distressing report I have read in my almost three years of being the shadow minister for ageing.
Whilst not wanting to dwell on some of the findings from the assessment committee, I do think it is important that people understand how bad this facility has been to the 25 residents who live there. Residents and relatives stated to the assessors that the stench in the visitors toilet was so overpowering it made them vomit. Staff had attempted to camouflage the oppressive odour with the use of aromatherapy oils. The living room is filthy, the carpet is frayed, reeking of urine, and furniture is ripped and stained. There is built-up grime on the walls and floors, and an offensive odour permeates the home. A resident was consistently urinating in a handbasin in the community areas. There is delay to call bell response. Some residents call out loudly to attract the attention of staff. However, these calls were observed by the assessment team to go unanswered. A resident requiring palliative care was not receiving pain management. Seven of the 25 residents had lost significant amounts of weight over the last few months. The evening meal commenced at 4.30 pm, meaning that if residents did not have supper they had nothing to eat until 8 am the next day—some 15 hours later.
The assessment team found that a hot water tap delivered only cold water after nine o’clock in the morning. Both of the lifting machines that are used for showering were rusty; one was completely rusty. This line completely appals me: activity resources for residents included childish puzzles, such as Thomas the Tank Engine; activity centres for babies; card games for children; and soft toys. Taped music for children was played for the residents. The recording invited the ‘children’ to sing along with the song. This was the most distressing report that I had ever read, and then I got to this finding:
One resident was observed in a semi-recumbent position with the over bed table over his head. The resident was attempting to eat the meal and was observed eating with his/her hands.
The person was in bed with a table sitting across their lap. They had slumped to the point that their head was under the over table and they were so hungry that they were attempting to take the food off the plate so that they could eat. This happened this year in an aged-care facility in Victoria. As I said, this could have been avoided.
The company that owns this particular facility has a track record of poor performance in the provision of aged care in Australia, and this government knows that. This man, Graeme Menere, lost the ability to be a key personnel member at an approved provider back in 2000. The facility that he was a part-owner of, Kenilworth, was closed because the then Minister for Aged Care, Mrs Bronwyn Bishop, called it the worst aged-care facility in Australia. You would think this government would have had a bit of an eye to a facility that had been sanctioned, I think, four times between 1998 and 2000 but continued to provide so-called care at Belvedere, clearly without the appropriate monitoring that our older people deserve.
Mr Graeme Menere operated two nursing homes in Victoria: Belvedere Park and Kenilworth Private. Mr Menere operated the facilities under different corporate structures. As we heard in question time today, Mr Menere received a suspended jail sentence in May 1998 for stalking a nursing home employee. Rightly, the government said that this was not a person who should be running an aged-care facility in Australia. Rightly, he lost his status as an approved provider. Rightly, he could no longer be a key personnel member under the act. But we know, from the reports in the media and from commentary that we have heard, that Mr Graeme Menere continued to provide those services by managing Belvedere.
One journalist said to me that he rang up to speak to Mr Graeme Menere and was told, ‘Ring back at lunchtime; he’ll be back then.’ This is a person who is not meant to be near the aged-care facility, but he is continuing to manage the day-to-day operations of this place. Back in 1998 the federal opposition brought Mr Menere’s conviction to the attention of the minister at the time. It was through our actions that we have kept this government watching and making sure that its own Aged Care Act is being complied with.
In 1998, 1999 and 2000, Belvedere Park Nursing Home was found not to be meeting aged-care standards. In January 1999, residents were found at serious risk in relation to 17 separate aspects of their care. From June 1999, Kenilworth Private Nursing Home was found not to be meeting standards. Five sanctions were applied during 2000 and then funding was cut in 2001. The provider appealed the sanctions to the AAT and won. That has just happened again. Hasn’t the government learnt anything about how to ensure compliance with AAT principles when they are ensuring that their act is being complied with?
As I said, the nursing home was widely reported by Mrs Bishop to be the worst nursing home in Australia. In 2001 Kenilworth went into receivership and was closed.
—By this government.
—By that government—yes, exactly. That is my point, Senator Humphries. You knew back then that this operator needed to be monitored closely. I need to confirm this with Senator Ellison, but from answers given in question time today it seems quite clear to me that from 2003 through to 2007 there has been one unannounced spot check. That is what I learnt at question time today. If that is incorrect, I really do ask you to correct it, but if there has only been one unannounced spot check from 2003 to 2007 the government need to tell us what they have been doing to ensure the wellbeing of the residents of Belvedere Park.
On 15 August 2007, following that very lengthy audit, Belvedere Park was found not to be meeting 42 out of 44 outcome areas. I have never seen a report that was that bad—hence my anger. This government has known that this facility should have been monitored far more closely. As you know, Mr Deputy President, the government is responsible for the standards of care in Australia’s aged-care facilities. I have called on Minister Pyne to explain how the conditions of this facility could be so bad despite the fact that the government has known since at least 2000 that Mr Graeme Menere had an appalling record for aged-care provision. These problems have not occurred just overnight. A showering seat does not become rusty in a short period of time. These things take time and require appropriate monitoring to ensure that the residents’ welfare is paramount.
How many spot checks has Belvedere had since it was sanctioned three times in 2000? What measures did the government take to ensure that Mr Graeme Menere, a disqualified individual, was not involved in the day-to-day running of Belvedere? Has Mr Menere been involved in the day-to-day running of the home? How many complaints has the government received about the home? When were they and what did the government do about them? When did Saitta, the company which owns Belvedere, receive its approved provider status? That is very important. And will Minister Pyne rule out Mr Graeme Menere operating nursing homes in the future? I asked those questions almost a month ago. Minister Pyne has declined to answer them.
Confidence in Australia’s aged-care system has been severely threatened. We have to be absolutely sure that all aged-care facilities are providing the quality of care that Australians expect of our 3,000-odd aged-care facilities. The concern is very much felt by many aged-care facilities which are doing the very best that they can to provide quality care. Quality aged-care providers hate it when something like this is exposed because, in the community’s mind, trust in our aged-care system generally is questioned. Everybody is concerned that the level of care which is being provided in all of the other aged-care facilities is up to scratch. So it is in the interests not only of those older people who live in aged-care facilities; it is also in the interests of the community at large and the aged-care sector that we have an efficient, effective and quality management and monitoring system. It is in all our interests that poor aged-care providers are weeded out. That is what we have to ensure so that confidence in aged care can be restored.
Unfortunately, this is not the only example we have had where an individual who is an approved provider has been operating aged care outside of the act. In 1999 Kerry and Malcolm Bishop, Queensland aged-care providers, were convicted of defrauding the Commonwealth of $139,000 in aged-care subsidies and were jailed. Today they are operating nursing homes in two states of this country and receiving almost $16 million every year in subsidies. When those two individuals were jailed, they simply transferred the ownership of the companies, the approved provider status and the key personnel status to their children. But it is alleged that Mrs Bishop, in particular, is still operating aged-care facilities in Australia. This government has to be drawn to account with respect to these two cases—not just the case in Brisbane, which is of concern, but on behalf of the 25 people who have been living in what can only be described as horror in that aged-care facility in Victoria. This government has a responsibility to ensure that all of the almost 170,000 people who live in aged care—and their families—are confident that they are receiving the sort of care we all expect they should receive.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Belvedere Park Nursing Home</title>,Matters of Public Importance,13,1,speech
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2007-09-12,"—I am pleased to contribute to this debate on a matter of public importance. It needs to be put on the record, unambiguously, that the Australian government does not in any way support or condone or seek to downplay the significance of the kind of neglect and maladministration which Senator McLucas referred to in her speech. Clearly, what has occurred at Belvedere Park Nursing Home is unacceptable and an example of practices which should form no part in the aged-care industry. Although we can agree on that much, Senator McLucas has attempted in this debate to employ, by implication, the argument that, first of all, there is a more widespread problem than there is at places like Belvedere Park and previously at Kenilworth—another facility operated by the same operators; both of them have now been closed down by the federal government—in the broader aged-care industry in Australia. That is a matter which Senator McLucas, with great respect, has not established, and she can only attempt to do so by using an extremely broadbrush approach to tar many other, reputable operators with the actions and omissions of Belvedere Park.
She also suggested that this government has failed by not being aware of the issues going on at Belvedere Park and has failed to act on them. Today in this debate I want to comprehensively indicate that that is simply not the case. Since the connection between Belvedere Park and Kenilworth became evident to the Department of Health and Ageing because of an overlap in persons involved in both organisations, comprehensive steps have been taken by the federal government to ensure that an extremely close eye is being kept on Belvedere Park. I want to outline some of those steps.
It is worth acknowledging, first of all, that the government needs to operate in the context of the administration of the law with respect to aged-care facilities. The laws have been greatly strengthened in the last few years by virtue of reforms undertaken by this government to ensure that higher standards are in place in Australian aged-care facilities—standards which could not have been applied before because there were no such laws underpinning those standards. But, despite that, the government has faced the battle of enforcing standards when there are rights built into laws, appropriately, for persons affected by government decisions to appeal to courts.
I want to come back to the issue that, by implication, Senator McLucas is raising—that the government and its agencies, particularly the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency, must somehow accept responsibility for attempting to enforce standards in respect of these areas and being knocked back by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on a number of occasions.

Senator McLucas interjecting—

—No, on a number of occasions, Senator McLucas, and I will come back to that in a moment. With great respect, you are not well-informed about the background of this matter.
Senator McLucas has asked whether there were any unannounced checks of the Belvedere Park facility between 2003 and 2007. I want to give an answer to that question. There has been a long history of the department monitoring this particular facility. Between 1998 and 2002, there have been five separate occasions when the Department of Health and Ageing has imposed sanctions on Belvedere Park. During that period there were frequent unannounced visits. In fact, on 12 June 2002, there was an unannounced visit; on 7 October 2002, a further unannounced visit; on 15 November 2002, an unannounced visit; and on 12 December 2002, an unannounced visit. Again, in 2003 on 6 June, on 18 June, on 31 July, on 10 September and on 11 November there were unannounced visits. The operators of this facility could not have been under any mistake that they were being very closely watched by this department and its accreditation agency.
In 2004 there were some changes in personnel and an apparent attempt by the home concerned to try to lift its game. However, the agency continued to ensure that there were spot checks on this particular facility. An unannounced visit occurred on 19 January 2005, another on 21 January 2005 and one on 10 February 2005 as well. On 16 and 17 November 2005 there was an accreditation site audit over a two-day period—a comprehensive examination of how well this particular facility was attempting to lift its game. On 28 April 2006 there was a site visit in response to a complaint, where some of the things that Senator McLucas has referred to were raised, and it resulted in a number of actions being taken by the agency to press the particular provider to lift its game. There was a further support contact visit to the home in November 2006, and there was a further visit on 3 July 2007. There is no question and it is simply untrue to suggest that the government has failed to act in respect of this particular home. Comprehensive, repeated actions have been taken to monitor the activities of that home. This indicates great pressure put on these providers to lift their game.
Senator McLucas raises the additional question of the way in which Mr Graeme Menere was involved with this facility, and the suggestion is that Mr Menere’s involvement as an active participant in the administration of this home has been ignored in some way by the department. Again, this is not true. Of course, under the system of health care standards that we inherited, there was no capacity for the department or the accreditation agency to prevent a provider from being accredited if a person with an indictable offence to their name was involved in the administration of that facility. We fixed that in legislation in 2000, effective as of January 2001. The trouble is that, unfortunately, Mr Graeme Menere’s involvement has not been a formal involvement on the record in that home. He has not been a director of that home; he has not been on the board of management of that home.

Senator McLucas interjecting—

—Yes, he was involved, Senator McLucas. But the problem that you face in bringing this case against the government is that mere suspicion of those things is not sufficiently strong evidence to convince bodies like the AAT, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, that we should disqualify this particular provider from operating that home in circumstances where we cannot prove the involvement of Mr Menere in its activities.
—Because you were not monitoring it!
—We were monitoring it. Senator McLucas, please! Nine spot checks in 2002 and 2003; another three in 2005; further site visits in 2006 and 2007. To say that we were not monitoring the facility is the grossest exaggeration, I think, you can possibly come up with.
—There were no spot checks from February 2005 until this year.
—No, there were further checks. You said there were none between 2003 and 2007 before; now you can see that there were some in 2005. There were further checks during that time on the basis of a continuing operation to monitor the activities of this home subsequent to that, and the fact is that it has continued throughout this period. There have been both spot checks and announced visits. It has been comprehensive over several days. The fact is that it has placed enormous pressure on this agency.
However, I want to make one other point. You are obviously claiming that we are too slow to act; that we have not done enough to get this particular provider off the scene. I note that, on 28 August in the North West Advocate, a paper in Melbourne, the state Labor MP, George Seitz, condemned the federal government for the haste with which it closed the home and suggested that it did not follow due process. So, what is it: are we going too fast or going too slow? Are we doing too much or doing too little, Senator McLucas? This government has been proceeding in accordance with the framework of the law; it has acted appropriately and promptly; and the fact that this home has been closed is a testament to the standards that we have put in place to ensure that aged care standards in this country are maintained to a high level.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-09-12,"—It is disappointing that we are again having a debate about a nursing home which has had to be closed down for appalling treatment of the elderly. Listening to the list of visits, checks and monitoring that the government has been engaged in since 1998 makes me wonder just what the government found when it went to this place and whether the situation which finally caused it to act decisively was not apparent at those other visits. If it was apparent at that time, one wonders why the situation was allowed to go on. It seems to me that if the AAT knocked back perfectly reasonable efforts on the part of the government to sanction the operators then there has to be something wrong with the law. It is clearly too indulgent of those nursing homes which are doing the wrong thing. They are a tiny minority, as we know, but every time something like this comes up it shatters confidence in the sector as a whole. It is one thing to come in here and suggest that there has been enormous pressure put on this agency, as Senator Humphries just said, and another to demonstrate that the government has not been simply indulgent with the aged-care provider in this case.
We want better. We expect those standards to be upheld. I acknowledge that this government brought in those standards and they were missing with the previous government. There is no question about that. I had quite a bit to do with Senator Bishop at the time that she brought them in. I congratulated her then, and I do now, but it seems to me that the government have dropped the ball a bit on this issue and they are not as vigilant on aged care as they might have been back when Senator Bishop began this reform process.
I think we need to look more broadly at aged care, however. There are ongoing concerns about the quality of care available to residents in many nursing homes and hostels, and the government needs to be more vigilant, as I said, to make sure that residents receive the quality of care they are entitled to expect. A number of people of my generation are now unfortunately having to place their parents in aged-care facilities and they are deeply troubled by this process. Some find an aged-care facility which is very good and they are pleased and enormously relieved, but others are deeply anxious about the process because they do not have confidence. It is incumbent on the government, having subsidised the industry substantially, and rightly, to provide the best quality care and ensure that we do not have shysters, such as we have heard about today, taking advantage of older people and obviously taking that money and not using it in those facilities.
There is a history of failing assessments over years, and we need to get to the bottom of it, but it is also the case that the complaints monitoring and accreditation system could be much more transparent and much more independent of government than it is. We need more resources to monitor our aged-care facilities so that they are not simply glossing over the problems so that they are not seen to be to blame.
There are major problems looming for future governments when it comes to aged care. With the number of people 80 years and over set to increase from the level of 680,000 in 2002 to 2.6 million by 2045, there is going to be a massive increase in demand for aged-care services and aged-care workers. The number of people with dementia will increase more than threefold over the next 50 years unless there are effective methods of prevention and treatment found. Some 65 per cent of residents in aged-care homes are estimated to have some degree of dementia, and dementia will progressively become the biggest disability driver of demand for aged care. We may have solved the problem of accreditation and standards to some extent, but there are bigger issues looming. It is disappointing that the government has not turned its reformist zeal—if I could put it that way—to some of the problems that are already with us but are looming as greater problems into the future.
We need a system that is transparent, takes into account capital, staffing and operating costs and can respond to those future needs. We also need to ensure the money is there to provide dementia-specific care for people with challenging behaviours, including funding for training for all nurses and care staff, and we need additional supplements to provide care for residents— (Time expired)

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2007-09-12,"—It is sad that we are back here discussing this issue, but in some ways it gives us a chance to work through the particular issues that must come out of yet another aged-care home being publicly exposed as not meeting the standards that have been imposed and that we have also grown to expect. On the Department of Health and Ageing website—and I do look at the department website; sometimes I think they do not think I do—are probably the most damning couple of sentences I have seen on a department assessment. I think it sums up where we are. On the background to the Belvedere Park experience it says:
Belvedere Park has the most significant number of non-compliance outcomes in the history of accreditation, with 42 out of 44 expected outcomes under the Accreditation Standards.
In taking this strong action—
that they were taking at that time, which was the closure recommendation—
the department recognised the significant level of non-compliance and the immediate and severe risk to residents.
The department determined that the non-compliance is widespread, deeply-rooted and intractable, demonstrating a fundamental breakdown in systems and care delivery.
That would have to be a fairly clear assessment of a total failure of what was happening at that home.
It is interesting that, while we are talking about the system of accreditation, the spot check process and exactly how the department are aware of what is going on in the facilities for which they are responsible—which we have been asking for many years—the department have claimed in the assessment that they have exposed these issues by their standard process. I question whether you can claim to have exposed a system which is ‘widespread, deeply-rooted and intractable’ in August 2007 when you look back at the number of visits and discussions that have taken place in the previous two years, which we have heard Senator Humphries expose recently. Senator McLucas has pointed out that these are not new issues with the ownership of this home and Belvedere itself. There have been alarm bells ringing. In fact, the same facility in 2002 had significant failures and suffered as a result of those, under the then system. They were found not to have met the requirements of effective aged care and were punished under the system.
In the period from 2004 until now, there has obviously been some changing and some ongoing discussion. Senator Humphries proudly claimed it to be ongoing monitoring. I ask: how can you be confident in ongoing monitoring which has led to this debacle? I do not like to use emotive language, because that does not help the issue, but I am sure people saw the media coverage of those stressed elderly residents and their families, lost and frightened at the exposure that they were suffering—in the opening of the wounds and having the home where they live, where they were expecting care, exposed as not only not providing care and support but actually being dangerous to their health. When I saw the television coverage of those poor, frightened people being taken away from their home, I asked: is this system working?
We are not claiming that this process is widespread across the country, but if in July 2007 we had asked a question about what was happening in Belvedere we would not have heard the answers about the problems there. It was not until August 2007 that the failure, which was widespread, deeply rooted and intractable, demonstrating a fundamental breakdown in systems and care, was discovered. This is the issue. We have accreditation systems. We have spot-check systems. I cannot begin to remember, Senator Polley, the number of Senate estimates questions we have gone through trying to establish exactly how it works, when it happens, what stimulates the visits. We want to know what happens next.
The fact is that for over seven years this aged-care facility has continued to operate—people have lived there, families have visited—and we have now had an assessment which is the most damning in accreditation history. What has happened after the visits that have occurred up until now? How on earth can the issues, which have been identified in the audit report which is now on the departmental website, continue to exist? They did not happen in a two-, three- or four-month period. These problems are so established and so intractable that they have been going wrong for a long time. How then can you have faith in a system when, as Senator Humphries has pointed out, a facility such as this has had visits over that time? What kind of proof, what kind of evidence, what kind of legal commitment has there been between the people who have been giving information about what has been going on behind the closed doors of Belvedere over last few years?
Senator Humphries pointed out that in 2004, after they were previously punished for not meeting standards, there was some kind of change in personnel and things seemed to get better. That was a small window. I do not know the residents who are living there but one of the things we do know is that residents who seek support in aged-care facilities often live there for a long time. So I wonder whether any of the residents who have had to find a new home now because of the outrageous conditions in which they were living were there when the previous process occurred. How much disruption has been going on for those people and their families?
We also know—and you, Mr Acting Deputy President Barnett, have been at inquiries where this has been discussed—that there is not widespread availability of aged-care facilities in many parts of Australia. In Melbourne itself it is not that easy to find a facility where you are comfortable and where you can visit your family easily. It is a difficult and confronting situation. We do not want to run a scare campaign but we want to understand how we can ensure that the system that is in place—and we can read pages of what happens in the system and how it works and all those things—is working properly. In the case of Belvedere, it has not worked. I wonder how anyone could have any faith that it was going to work in the future.
In terms of statements about the government being responsible, it seems to me that if the government can claim success and claim responsibility for the things that are going well, it should acknowledge reality when things do not go well. As we consistently read in the media, when anything is positive and good the government is very quick to get out there with the media opportunity and claim a marvellous success. When things in the same system do not go as well, I think that it is only appropriate that the same government with the same responsibilities acknowledges that it has not gone well. Everyone can talk for minutes on this issue about all the things that are supposed to happen. For the people who were residents at Belvedere Park those things did not happen—and what is going to happen next?",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Belvedere Park Nursing Home</title>,Matters of Public Importance,13,1,speech
"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2007-09-12,"—This is a very sad motion. The content of the motion is sad, as I think is the attempt by the Labor Party to suggest that the government should have 20/20 hindsight in all conditions. I find it unacceptable that the residents of Belvedere Park had to exist in the conditions that they did. The Labor Party, Senator McLucas and Senator Humphries—all of us—find it unacceptable that that happened. The minister, Christopher Pyne, has said that he finds it unacceptable that those people existed in those conditions. But that does not mean that this government is going to get it 100 per cent right 100 per cent of the time.
If you look at the number of residential aged-care facilities in Australia—and there are more than 4,000 of them—currently 14 of them have sanctions imposed on them. That number of 14 is not acceptable to me, to the minister or to anybody else, but it is a reality in our world. The Labor Party seem to be suggesting not only that the government should be using 20/20 hindsight to ensure that we never, ever have one failure in any way within aged-care residential facilities but also that we should just ignore the rule of law when we do so. It has been pointed out that, yes, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal overturned the sanctions on Belvedere Park imposed by the agency. I do not quite know what anyone living in a democracy, where the rule of law is meant to be of primacy, would suggest we should do to ensure that that cannot happen in the future, that people cannot appeal against decisions made against them. This has to be allowed to happen. I think we should be looking at and concentrating on the fact that this was picked up, that the accreditation and spot-check systems actually picked up Belvedere Park and the problems that it had.
Perhaps we should also look at what has happened in the past. Right now the care and safety of residents in aged-care facilities in Australia is the government’s highest priority. But if you look back to the records in Victoria, in particular, you can start with the 1994 Gregory report which said:
13% of nursing homes did not meet the relevant Fire Authority standards.
11% of nursing homes did not meet the relevant Health Authority standards.
70% of nursing homes did not meet the relevant Outcome Standards.
51% of nursing homes residents were living in rooms with three or more beds.
This was 1994. Let us move on to the Victorian Auditor-General’s report in August 2006, which was extremely critical of the Bracks-Brumby government’s management of the nursing home structure in the public sector. It is worth noting here that Victoria is one of two states that have very strong public sectors of aged care provision—over 6,000 beds in that sector.
Let us now turn to the current situation, where we have expenditure that has gone from $3.1 billion in 1995-96 to more than $10 billion—established, expected—for 2010-11. Senator Allison pointed out that some planning was needed in this area. There has been some planning: there has been a massive increase in the amount of spending in the aged-care area. We no longer have the situation that we had when Mrs Bishop became the minister, where over 200 homes were closed down almost immediately because they were in an appalling condition; there were not any standards for those homes to meet. This has all been established by our government in the last 11 years. Yes, there should not be one failure, ever, in an aged care facility—we are talking about vulnerable people who need every protection we can give them—but that is not going to be reality. The situation has been found, these people are now in better facilities and, as far as the law will allow, the government is currently doing its best to ensure that this cannot happen again.
Mr Menere is certainly not someone that any government in its right mind would want to let back near aged care residents. But the government must operate within the law. Van Diemen’s Land is not there anymore, unfortunately—it would have been a nice option.
—It is; it is just called something else.
—It is still under the same rule of law. Another area that has changed radically in the past 11 years is the number of aged-care community places. If you look back, you will find that there were virtually no community care places 10 years ago. We now have the situation where the government will spend $1.9 billion on aged care community places over this financial year. That is a growth of more than three times what it was 11 years ago. We have got 42,000 places, as of June 2007, that were available so that people could stay in the community. More and more people are telling us that they do not want to be in institutions any more than necessary—this relates back to the sorts of comments that Senator Ellison was making: let’s change that balance from people being in residences to people being in their own homes with our support.
We have also increased the spending through the National Respite for Carers program from $19 million in 1996-97 to $185.4 million over 2007-08—again providing a chance to support people to do exactly what they want, which is stay in their own homes.
The other area that I think we should mention is the spot check area. This has been strengthened and developed and improved radically. It is now a requirement that every home will receive at least one unannounced visit every year—the current average is 1.75 unannounced visits every year. There will be more than 5½ thousand unannounced visits to homes over the next 12 months. This has to begin to give us some security in this area. The other point is that unannounced visits had to be legally provided for. (Time expired)

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2007-09-12,"—I rise to speak today on aged care as a matter of public importance. In particular, I will focus on the horrors of Belvedere Park Nursing Home. Like other speakers here today, I am disappointed to think that we are once again talking about the negative side of an industry that, overall, has a good reputation.
We could not go through debate here today—not even on nursing homes—without government senators getting into the blame game. If all else fails, when they want to take the credit—as Senator Moore said—they will take the credit for all the good things that happen; they are out in the media. But, when it comes to taking responsibility, they run a mile.
Our aged-care system faces a number of long-term challenges. It is estimated that the number of Australians aged 70 or over will double over the next 20 years. A shortage of aged-care workers is also a major problem. Ultimately, the Howard government has done nothing for aged care, except make hollow promises, for the time they have been in government—a long 11½ years.
The sector has suffered for far too long. This is evident in the problems that are emerging within the sector now. Our elderly deserve the right to live in a safe and caring environment. The community needs to be assured that our mums, dads and grandparents are secure and well cared for. Labor believes that healthy and positive ageing must be an achievable goal, because older Australians deserve the best our nation can provide. The Australian Labor Party is concerned about the quality of Australia’s aged care system. Reflecting this, Labor’s election policies will be based on respecting and valuing the enormous contribution to our society by older Australians.
Over the last few months, we have heard of the shocking treatment of the residents at the Belvedere Park Nursing Home. The Herald Sun reported on 23 November that at Belvedere Park investigators found faeces smeared on equipment, undated food in the fridge and pathology specimens stored with medicines. Auditors also revealed that there was a sickening stench in the toilets and a lack of incontinence hygiene. This could have been detected earlier if the government had unannounced spot checks. We have heard from government senators about things back in 2002 to 2005 but, if those unannounced spot checks were actually working, we would not be here having this debate now.
There was serious, widespread, systematic noncompliance at this aged-care facility—and that was reported at the AAT hearings. The Age also reported that Belvedere Park failed 42 of 44 aged-care standards. Inspectors found that, amongst other things, the home had failed to properly manage residents’ medication, nutrition and hydration. Their families had complained that they were not given access to basic toiletries, such as toothpaste, toothbrushes and soap. Other reports claim that staff at the Belvedere Park aged-care home had no effective infection control system in place, medicine cabinets were left unlocked and medicine administration lists were signed off before being given to residents.
Confidence in Australia’s aged-care homes has been seriously eroded due to the Howard government’s inept monitoring of aged-care facilities. What I find most upsetting after reading the horror reports of the Belvedere nursing home is the indignity the residents were faced with. We are talking about people’s homes. The residents were literally treated like small children and given childish puzzles, including Thomas the Tank Engine, activity centres for babies, card games for children and soft toys. Furthermore, tape music for children was also played for the residents. The recording invited the children to sing along with the song. This is completely unacceptable. Our elderly are not a burden and they deserve the very best care that we can provide. In fact, we have a responsibility to ensure that they have the best possible care. Labor’s policies recognise that elderly people are vulnerable to abuse, including neglect, financial exploitation, psychological manipulation and physical and sexual abuse.
Labor is firmly focused on the long-term future of aged-care provision—not just from one election to another. Labor is acutely aware of the workforce shortages constraining Australia’s aged-care sector. Attracting and retaining aged-care workers, including nurses, is a looming crisis which must be addressed. Caring for older family members is also complex. Access to services such as community and respite care that can assist frail older people is essential. In 11½ years the Howard government turned an 800 aged-care bed surplus in 1996 into a 4,613 shortfall by June 2006—what a record! Labor is committed to providing a guaranteed, universal and integrated retirement incomes system that is secure, stable, simple and fair. Labor will develop high-quality care standards for aged-care providers so that they deliver high-quality outcomes.
As has been said by other speakers from this side of the chamber, it is regrettable that we are once again here talking about aged care and the neglect of our elder Australians. Unfortunately, when this is raised in the media, it reflects across the whole industry—though we know that the majority of those who work in the industry use world’s best practices and do the best that they can and with the respect that older Australians deserve. We should be providing the highest quality care—as I said, it is our responsibility. The Howard government, for a variety of reasons, has not accommodated this. I think this once again clearly demonstrates how the Howard government is out of touch with the community, with what is expected and with what our obligations are as elected members.
The blame game is once again the fallback position for government senators here today. If all else fails, they blame a state Labor government or even go back through history—go back to 1994. We are in 2007, and this government has to take responsibility for its failings. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Belvedere Park Nursing Home</title>,Matters of Public Importance,13,1,speech
"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2007-09-12,"—I would say in reply to those on the other side of the chamber that I think it is important for you to note—and this is not about the blame game—that, in 1996, there was no independent oversight of the quality of aged-care homes. Now there is an independent agency, the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency, which accredits every aged-care home—and all homes will receive at least one unannounced visit every year. I too am very disappointed with what has come up from the investigation into the two aged-care homes, which my colleagues, Senator Ellison in answering a question in question time today, and those opposite have described very adequately.
I think it is important for me to be positive about where we are going and what is available at the moment. This government has certainly recognised the failings. It is very upsetting to know that these things happen in some of our aged-care homes. We have put different measures in place to ensure that these things do not happen but, if they do, that they are rectified very, very quickly—as has happened with this last incident. As at the end of June 2006, almost 3,000 residential aged-care homes had been accredited. The Australian government has acted to protect people in aged-care homes from sexual and serious physical assault. The Australian government’s response to abuse allegations totals more than $100 million over four years. With legislation passed this year, 2007, we have also strengthened protection for accommodation bonds paid by aged-care residents, which I think is a very important issue—and it also prevents abuse.
The Australian government has in place a quality framework for residential aged-care homes which includes accreditation, building certification, the Aged Care Complaints Investigation Scheme and user rights programs. Residential aged-care services are required to be accredited to receive subsidies from the Australian government. As at 30 June 2007, only 2.9 per cent—85 homes—were identified as having some noncompliance. Aged-care homes are monitored by the department and the agency.
In 2006-07, a total of 6,329 visits were undertaken by the agency, including 3,627 unannounced visits—otherwise known as spot checks. The agency makes at least one unannounced visit to each home every year. Issues of concern are acted upon promptly and monitored until compliance is achieved. Poor care is never acceptable whatever the circumstances and in these cases sanction action may be taken. We have had a number of examples of that from earlier speakers.
There are currently sanctions imposed in respect of 14 residential aged-care homes out of a total of nearly 3,000 aged-care homes around Australia. The care and safety of residents at all aged-care homes remains the highest priority for this government. Concerning increased protections, recent amendments to the Aged Care Act 1997 put in place a more robust aged-care complaints investigation process and established a new independent Aged Care Commissioner from 1 May 2007. They also require compulsory reporting of incidents of sexual and serious physical assault in residential aged care, with protections for approved providers and staff who report from 1 July 2007. It is important that those opposite understand the new Aged Care Complaints Investigation Scheme, which has the scope to investigate any possible breach of an approved provider’s responsibilities and take action where approved providers fail to meet their responsibilities.
On 1 May 2007, the Minister for Ageing appointed a new Aged Care Commissioner, Rhonda Parker, who will provide an independent review mechanism. I know Rhonda Parker personally. She is from Western Australia. She has a very long history in aged care and in her former employment was as a minister in the Court government covering the portfolio of Families and Children’s Services, Seniors and Women’s Interests. We could not have a better person to act as the commissioner. As the new Aged Care Commissioner, she has the capacity to examine complaints about decisions of the department under the investigation scheme and, as a result of a complaint or on her own initiative, the department’s processes for handling matters under the investigation principles. This is very important. This system is certainly going to improve any problems we have had in the past.
Also, on 21 December 2006, the Australian government amended the Aged Care Principles 1997 to give effect to police check arrangements that require approved providers to ensure that certain staff and volunteers in Australian government subsidised aged-care services who have unsupervised access to care recipients are screened every three years for any criminal history. This is certainly a big improvement too.
We go on to compulsory reporting and whistleblower protection. From 1 July 2007, approved providers must have systems in place to ensure staff report allegations of sexual and serious physical assault to the approved provider. Providers are required to report this information to the police and to the Department of Health and Ageing.
The Australian government is providing an additional $8.6 million over four years to increase the number of spot-check visits by the agency. Since 1 July 2006, every home has received at least one unannounced visit a year and the average number of overall visits was increased to 1.75 visits per home per year. I do believe that this government is doing the right thing for aged care. (Time expired)


(Senator Barnett)—Order! The time for consideration of the matter of public importance has expired.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Belvedere Park Nursing Home</title>,Matters of Public Importance,13,1,speech
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2007-09-12,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present two reports of the committee, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and submissions received by the committee, and move:
That the Senate take note of the reports.
On behalf of the Trade Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I wish to make some brief comments on the committee’s report: Australia’s trade with Mexico and the region.
Since the commencement of diplomatic relations in 1966, Australia and Mexico have developed a modest but important economic relationship. Mexico is Australia’s largest trading partner in Latin America and our 33rd largest trading partner overall. Australia sits as Mexico’s 26th largest trading partner.
In examining the state of economic relationships between Australia and the other nations of the region, the committee noted the growth of trade and investment ties, albeit from relatively small bases. Encouraging expansion potential and progress has been identified in areas such as energy, mining, agribusiness, food commodities and the provision of professional services, but there is not a lot of conclusive data about movement in this area.
Increasing imports and a burgeoning education sector have seen the Australia-Mexico bilateral relationship grow significantly in recent years. In May 2006, the Hon. Alexander Downer MP, Minister for Foreign Affairs, and his Mexican counterpart established a joint experts group to explore possible directions for economic relations, including the possible negotiation of a free trade agreement, and that has reinforced the importance of this relationship to both nations.
Australia’s main exports to Central America are dairy products, in particular milk, cream, butter and cheese. Whilst still modest, two-way merchandise trade with Central America has increased significantly over recent years.
In summary, the committee has concluded that, despite the challenges of distance, poor transport links, language and cultural differences and unfamiliar business environments, there is still significant potential within the Australia-Mexico trade relationship and the trade relationships between Australia and the region. As such it did become clear to the committee that a free trade agreement with Mexico is a highly desirable outcome to the quest of both governments to progress and strengthen this relationship.
There are challenges involved for both countries in pursuing a free trade agreement. Agriculture, for example, continues to be a sensitive area, and the committee has recommended that issues relating to agriculture should be determined at an early stage of any negotiations. The committee also acknowledges that current political and business conditions in Mexico are perhaps not what you would describe as ideal for an FTA and there may be some time needed to develop conducive conditions.
In conclusion on this report, the committee would like to extend its sincere thanks to all of the officials of the Australian Embassy in Mexico City that assisted the delegation with the visit by the trade committee to Mexico. I was not part of that delegation but I understand from my colleagues who were that it was a very productive engagement. It proved very successful in terms of contacts made, opportunities identified and challenges addressed. The committee also wants to acknowledge and thank the officials and business people in Mexico for their hospitality and input.
In closing, the committee is grateful to all those who gave evidence to the inquiry. I also want to place on record that in tabling this report I do so on behalf of Mr Baird, the member for Cook, who is the Chair of the Trade Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I note that he has provided exceptional service in his role as chair of that subcommittee and that he retires from parliament in this round of elections. I think his contribution should be noted.
I commend the report to the Senate.
The second report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is the report of the inquiry into Australian Defence Force regional air superiority. It is a quite different report in nature from the preceding one.
The matter of Australia’s regional air superiority has been the subject of both considerable discussion and commentary since 2000. The strategic guidance which is outlined in Defence 2000: our future Defence Force, which is of course known as the Defence white paper, and the acquisition and phasing out of equipment proposed in the Defence capability plan 2004-2014 have provided the basis for much of the debate amongst those key stakeholders.
The Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade first examined the issue of Australia’s air combat capability in its Review of the Defence annual report 2002-03. Further to that inquiry, in June 2005 the Senate resolved that the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade:
... inquire and report into the ability of the Australian Defence Force to maintain air superiority in our region to 2020, given current planning; as well as any measures required to ensure air superiority in our region to 2020.
Although the committee has not made recommendations in this report, the report examines the various issues and the very diverse views presented during the two public hearings and indeed in the 41 submissions received during the term of this inquiry.
Strategic considerations, both global and regional, underpin Australia’s future regional air superiority. Concepts such as a balanced force structure, asymmetric threats, and an assessment of regional military capabilities are key drivers in developing a balanced ADF. Importantly, the committee does note that Australia must continue to monitor developments in the region when considering new and improved air combat capabilities.
The ADF’s current capability planning is guided by the white paper and subsequent defence policy updates released in 2003 and 2005. In examining the existing guidance and the planning for a future air combat capability, the committee notes the introduction of a new platform is underpinned by strategic policy, cost-effective delivery of capability and the constraints of providing a well-balanced ADF.
A key decision in transitioning to a new air combat capability is the withdrawal from service of the F111 in 2010. A number of commentators have indicated that they believe this retirement date is premature, and the report discusses the aircraft’s technical and maintenance issues in extending its in-service life past 2010. The report does conclude that industry could support the F111 until 2020 but there are risks, including the ability to sustain critical skills amongst the current workforce. Further, the committee notes the increasing severity of the risk profile in extending the F111 beyond 2010.
The ADF’s future capability planning is examined in the report, with particular attention being given to the acquisition of the Joint Strike Fighter, or JSF. The unique nature of the JSF project, and Australia’s decision to join the international program, provides opportunities for Australian industry that would not be available if a more traditional capital acquisition strategy had been undertaken.
However, the committee notes that any delay in the Joint Strike Fighter project would be unacceptable. We also note the government’s decision to purchase the Super Hornet aircraft to address any potential capability gap which may arise during the transition to the JSF.
The committee concludes its report with a comparative analysis of the Joint Strike Fighter and the FA22 Raptor covering issues such as capability, availability and cost. Irrespective of whether the FA22 Raptor is available for export sale to Australia, the committee notes the purchase of the JSF is considered by Defence to provide the most effective and efficient air combat capability whilst maintaining a balanced ADF.
In conclusion, again I want to thank all of those who contributed to this inquiry through submissions and discussion with the committee. I would also like to thank committee members and the secretariat staff for their efforts throughout the inquiry process and, in addition, the Defence representatives at the most senior levels for their assistance with this particular inquiry.
I commend the report to the Senate.

Importantly, the committee does note that Australia must continue to monitor developments in the region when considering new and improved air combat capabilities.
The ADF’s current capability planning is guided by the white paper and subsequent defence policy updates released in 2003 and 2005. In examining the existing guidance and the planning for a future air combat capability, the committee notes the introduction of a new platform is underpinned by strategic policy, cost-effective delivery of capability and the constraints of providing a well-balanced ADF.
A key decision in transitioning to a new air combat capability is the withdrawal from service of the F111 in 2010. A number of commentators have indicated that they believe this retirement date is premature, and the report discusses the aircraft’s technical and maintenance issues in extending its in-service life past 2010. The report does conclude that industry could support the F111 until 2020 but there are risks, including the ability to sustain critical skills amongst the current workforce. Further, the committee notes the increasing severity of the risk profile in extending the F111 beyond 2010.
The ADF’s future capability planning is examined in the report, with particular attention being given to the acquisition of the Joint Strike Fighter, or JSF. The unique nature of the JSF project, and Australia’s decision to join the international program, provides opportunities for Australian industry that would not be available if a more traditional capital acquisition strategy had been undertaken.
However, the committee notes that any delay in the Joint Strike Fighter project would be unacceptable. We also note the government’s decision to purchase the Super Hornet aircraft to address any potential capability gap which may arise during the transition to the JSF.
The committee concludes its report with a comparative analysis of the Joint Strike Fighter and the FA22 Raptor covering issues such as capability, availability and cost. Irrespective of whether the FA22 Raptor is available for export sale to Australia, the committee notes the purchase of the JSF is considered by Defence to provide the most effective and efficient air combat capability whilst maintaining a balanced ADF.
In conclusion, again I want to thank all of those who contributed to this inquiry through submissions and discussion with the committee. I would also like to thank committee members and the secretariat staff for their efforts throughout the inquiry process and, in addition, the Defence representatives at the most senior levels for their assistance with this particular inquiry.
I commend the report to the Senate.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports</title>,Committees,14,2,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2007-09-12,"—When I was making my remarks earlier today on this bill, I drew attention to the continuous questioning by Senator Joyce of witnesses during the inquiry, where he was seeking to lead them to make a statement that they should all go out and support the National Party or the Liberal Party in the next federal election in Queensland. I was endeavouring to find a quote and I have found it during the break. I quote from the Hansard of Friday, 31 August. Senator Joyce asked a question of Councillor Brown:
Can you see any pressure points coming up on the horizon that may be exerted that may encourage people to be a bit more active in trying to support your cause, and where might those political pressure points be?

Councillor Brown—I dare say that there probably would be. What you want me to say is that it is probably the federal election.
Senator Moore interjected and said:
That is what he wants you to say.
Senator Joyce said:
I have never suggested anything.
We had a speech here for 20 minutes today in which Senator Joyce stated quite clearly that this is all about trying to get Queenslanders who are upset with the state Labor government over forced local council amalgamations to vote for the coalition in the federal election. Yet he said during the inquiry, on the record, that he had never suggested anything of the sort! That is the nonsense that went on during this inquiry. The other point I was drawing attention to was the duplicitous position—and I use that word ‘duplicitous’ because it has been thrown around here a lot, as it was during the inquiry—of government senators attacking the Labor Party members in Queensland because, apparently, people in the Labor Party at the federal level have a different view from those at the state level. Shock! Horror! Fancy that ever occurring in the history of politics in this country!
When the committee was considering issues dealing with amending the federal Constitution to include recognition of local government, Senator Joyce stated:
I think the inclusion of local government in the Constitution is a great idea. I am all for that.
We pointed out to Senator Joyce at that time during the inquiry that he had actually voted against a proposition to that very effect last year. He could not remember it. When he finally had a look at the Hansard during the inquiry hearing he came back later and made a statement to the effect of: ‘I would like to clarify something, Mr Chairman. I have changed my mind, and it is a healthy thing to change your mind.’ Then we had the situation where I asked Mr Bruce Scott, when he appeared in Emerald:
What is your position and the National Party’s position on supporting a constitutional change to give recognition to local government in the federal Constitution? That would be a head of power that could be relied upon to put this legislation through and potentially to then enforce the results of plebiscites.
Mr Bruce Scott replied:
What you are talking about is recognising local government as a legitimate third tier of government in this country. Personally, my position is that I would support that.
Then, after a few more comments by Mr Scott, Senator Ian Macdonald interjected and said:
It is a view you have long held, if I remember correctly.
Mr Bruce Scott said:
It is indeed.
I said:
Is that true? You have long held that view?
Mr Scott said:
Yes.
I then said:
Why did you vote against that very proposition in the House of Representatives last year, on 17 October?
Mr Bruce Scott replied:
What did I vote against?
He did not have a clue; he could not remember what his position was. Let us return to the bill before us, which deals with a specific situation that has arisen in Queensland as a result of state government legislation that would have prevented councillors and councils from holding local plebiscites on forced amalgamations. If they had done so, if they had supported those plebiscites, they would have been subject to serious penalties.
I do not support the actions of the Queensland government. The then Premier himself, Mr Beattie, acknowledged that it was an overreaction to the interference by the federal government. Mr Howard is on the record on at least two occasions as saying, ‘This legislation is not about amalgamations.’ He was not seeking to impose a view or make a statement about whether he supported amalgamations in Queensland.

Senator Fifield interjecting—

—He said this was about responding to the Queensland government’s actions. What we need to remember is that the Australian Electoral Commission already has the authority, on the basis of a fee for service, to run local plebiscites. That is understood. During the inquiry some constitutional issues were raised, and the government treated the expert witnesses with contempt— (Time expired)


(Senator Crossin)—Senator Fifield, I want to remind you that it is expected you would interject from your chair, not as you come in the doors or walk in the corridors of the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (DEMOCRATIC PLEBISCITES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2007-09-12,"—I am sure Senator Fifield is usually a well-behaved member of the chamber. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Democratic Plebiscites) Bill 2007. It is a bill of wide scope but it pays particular attention to the circumstances that have arisen in Queensland in recent times. In that context, as a Queensland senator I think it is a matter that deserves my attention and, as indeed has become the case, the attention of the Senate.
The now not-much-lamented, in my case, Beattie government proposal to amalgamate local councils in Queensland is one of the more disgraceful exercises in local government reform in Australia, from my perspective, and is certainly one of the more disgraceful exercises in local government reform in Queensland. It will almost certainly fail to achieve its objectives, in my view, as well as having dire consequences for the rights of Queenslanders, which they have been able to take for granted since the beginning of responsible government in Queensland.
At every turn the Beattie government has acted in a high-handed and dictatorial way to deny the democratic rights of Queenslanders. This dictatorial manner of acting reached its height, surely, when the final bill was rammed through the single chamber of the Queensland legislature early one Thursday morning, at a time when few Queenslanders were able to pay attention. All they could do was wake up to the consequences of the denial of their democratic rights greeting them early in the morning.
I am of the view that there was probably a case for reform of local government in Queensland. The existing system has certainly been in place for a long time. But the tragedy of this particular reform proposal is that it is a completely wasted opportunity. It proposed and achieved a simplistic solution to what are very complex problems of local government reform. The tragedy of it is that, with greater creativity and with more attention to the possibilities, the Beattie government, as it then was, could perhaps have claimed the reform as a matter of some credit. The result is that the Beattie government at the time deserved and received a wide degree of public opprobrium for its actions, and what we have now is a bastardised system of local government in Queensland.
This saga began with the proposal for reform in 2005. The Local Government Association of Queensland began the size, shape and sustainability initiative, and 118 councils across the state participated in this program. I visited various councils throughout the state during this period. They were reassuring about the progress that was being made, and they were pleased to have had the opportunity to participate in the process. Shortly thereafter, there began a concerted campaign of violence against democracy by the Beattie government. The Premier decided to override the SSS initiative to impose his own agenda for reform on local government and to create his own Local Government Reform Commission. Then, something that could be regarded as the most outrageous foray into totalitarianism occurred: the government passed new legislation to bypass the Local Government Act 1993. In that act there was a right of individuals and councils to express an opinion about changes that might occur to council boundaries and a longstanding right to approve any changes to the local government boundaries in Queensland. The loss of that right is addressed very directly by the bill that is currently before the chamber. After the Beattie government had passed the act that took away these rights, it proceeded to the next stage of ‘de-democratisation’ when it rammed these provisions through the Queensland parliament in the face of widespread concern, expressed throughout the state, about these changes.
The question before us, and one that has been before Queenslanders all of this time, is why a government would do this: what is the rationale for trying to reform government in this way, and why would you incur such massive public opprobrium? Further, what public purpose is being served by these local government reforms? The answer—which, in my view, is not a particularly compelling one—that was given to the Queensland councils was that the purpose of the reforms was to provide a more efficient local government system. More particularly, they would provide the opportunity for these councils to meet the challenges of economic growth being experienced by my state. This is a challenge that is certainly true in the south-east corner of Queensland, but it is being reflected right throughout the state. So the argument before us was that local government amalgamations were necessary so that local government authorities could meet the challenges of economic growth that were before them. To that end, there was supposed to be an examination of the economic integrity of some of these councils.
The Queensland Treasury Corporation undertook an examination and produced a report, in which it rated 43 per cent of these councils as being in a weak or very weak financial position. This was a very curious report indeed, because it did not evaluate all 156 local government authorities in Queensland. It did not purport to go through the financial circumstances of every council—in fact, it dealt with only 94 of the 156 councils, so less than three-quarters of them. Thus we had an incomplete process of examination. There was never any attempt to examine each council’s circumstances and then to propose public reforms based on the circumstances of councils right across the state. This was a half-baked effort to try to understand the alleged problems of local governments and councils.
But then the process of reform became even more bizarre. After the proposals were examined and the report was released with the names of the councils that were alleged to be in various states of financial distress, the government proceeded with its program of reform. It set up the Local Government Reform Commission and, in due course, the commission produced a report. Peculiarly, the report failed to carry through the concerns that were reflected in the Treasury Corporation’s assessment and at least four of the so-called financially unstable councils were left alone by the amalgamations. Councils such as Carpentaria, Diamantina and Boulia were said to be very distressed, yet no attempt was made to reform those councils in the context of these changes. Even more peculiar is that some councils which were not thought to be financially distressed have been reformed and have been amalgamated with adjacent councils, such as Caboolture, Pine Rivers and Redcliffe.
So we have had a very peculiar process of the public examination of an argument for change, and it has produced some very peculiar outcomes. In the context of these very peculiar changes, it is hardly surprising that Queenslanders right across the state are offended by the consequences of these changes. They are offended by the speed and the determination with which the then Beattie government rammed through these changes and deprived them of their right to express an opinion about those changes, including the impact those changes would have on their lives, on the economic sustainability of their councils and on the sustainability of their democratic communities, which were well established across the state.
We now have a very peculiar situation where Queensland will have fewer councils than either Victoria or New South Wales. Queensland, a state several dimensions larger than Victoria and larger than New South Wales, will have fewer councils—73. I think the figure is 79 in Victoria and 152 in New South Wales. Here we have a huge state, growing rapidly and economically vibrant, and yet we now have fewer councils representing people across the state than exist in other states of the Commonwealth on the east coast.
What has been particularly disturbing and distressing to Queenslanders throughout this process has been the ripping away of the fabric of community and the way in which these reforms have been rammed through the commission and rammed through the parliament, with contempt—and that is the only word that can be used—for the concerns of the local government community and the consequences that this will have for democratic representation at local government level in Queensland. In places like Noosa, Redcliffe and Port Douglas, the anxiety, distress and annoyance is certainly overt. It will mean that people will now have to travel vast distances to meet their elected local government representatives. There are consequences that will follow from these reckless reforms.
I take you, Madam Acting Deputy President, to one example of the way in which democratic representation will be changed by these reforms. Take what will be the new Toowoomba Regional Council. The new council will have an area in the vicinity of 13,000 square kilometres. It amalgamates eight councils into one and brings together a population of 302,000 people whose representation prior to these reforms, on the collective eight councils, was 82 councillors. As a result of these reforms, there will be 11 councillors for these 302,000 people. In some of those old councils—the Millmerran council, for example—there was one councillor for every 223 people. That is, admittedly, an excellent council representation to population. But it varied across these councils. In some places—Toowoomba, for example—there was one councillor to 7,000 constituents. The consequence of these changes is that these 11 councillors will now each represent something in the vicinity of 19,000 people. So in places like Millmerran, where there has been an intimate relationship between the councillor and his constituents, it will now blow out to one councillor to 19,000 constituents.
What is going to happen with the Toowoomba Regional Council, in all probability, because these are now undivided councils, which means that each place will not be represented by its own individual councillor, is that many people in these small communities—Millmerran, Pittsworth and places like that—will be unlikely, because they do not have the population size, to gain representation in the council. Having gone from a position of great intimacy with their local councillor, they will essentially be deprived of the right to be represented in local council. How that will advance democracy and expand economic sustainability in Queensland I have no idea, and I suspect that the Queensland government has no idea either. It is one of the serious consequences and one of the reasons why this bill is necessary and why the Beattie government stands condemned for the way in which it has behaved on this matter. It is a shameful deprivation of representation, and it defies, from my perspective, any particular logic—certainly in relation to building sustainable communities, which I presume is part of the intent here.
We know that these kinds of reforms do not work. We know that in Victoria, for example, where amalgamation took place and there was an expectation of substantial costs savings, the result was that, instead of 20 per cent in cost savings, savings came down to something in the vicinity of 8.5 per cent. We know that, in South Australia, amalgamation reforms which were supposed to produce cost savings in the vicinity of 17 per cent produced savings in the vicinity of 2.3 per cent. Sensibly, the New South Wales government, having examined the consequences of reforms elsewhere, realised that this was a pretty dumb way to reform councils and that there must be a better way of trying to address the problem of economic weakness at a local government level, so they decided to avoid that course of action. From my perspective, that was a sensible action in public policy.
We should be asking ourselves whether there is anything in this barren landscape that can retrieve these proposals in relation to the proclaimed public objective, which is to provide sustainability. I looked at the various proposals and the documents which were produced at the time and I found there is a thing called a ‘local transition committee’ being set up. In the documents which were provided at the time, there is a statement about the composition of these transition committees. One would have thought that if these committees are about economics—producing economic sustainability and preparing local government for the challenges of economic growth—when you create them you might provide for someone to be on them who might know something about economics. Perhaps that would be a financial adviser, a local businessperson who has some experience in the field or someone with some economic experience. What do we find when we look at the composition of the local transition committees? We find a representative from the affected local governments, an interim CEO and, astonishingly, up to three union representatives. There will be up to three union representatives on these transition committees!
Where is the person who will make a contribution to improving the economic sustainability of these councils? Where is the person who will carry through, in some constructive, intelligent way, the kinds of aims that lie behind these proposals? The only conclusion one is justified in reaching is that this is not a reform that has anything to do with local government. This is not a reform that addresses itself to Queensland’s future economic needs. This is a reform which talks about the future of trade unionism in Queensland. All Australians, whether or not they happen to be Queenslanders, ought to reflect on that particular point when they are addressing their attention to the election later in the year. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (DEMOCRATIC PLEBISCITES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2007-09-12,"—I would like to make a brief contribution to this debate on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Democratic Plebiscites) Bill 2007. Listening to the debate today, I am not surprised one bit that we so often hear people talking about Australians being cynical and switched off from politics. You do not have to think too long before you realise that what has been discussed in the chamber today, under the guise of debate on this bill, has been extraordinary nonsense. More importantly, under this government we have seen every attempt to keep the public out of politics and to stop them from even wanting to be involved.
This bill is one step in the right direction. We support any means to improve the quality of our democracy. That means making it easier for people to find out what is happening in politics so that they can make informed decisions and communicate with their elected representatives. People should have a say in decisions that involve them, their local communities or the broader Australian community.
I will get back to what this bill is all about. The bill amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to authorise the AEC’s use and disclosure of any information held by the AEC, including information contained in an electoral roll, for the purpose of conducting an activity such as a plebiscite. I should note, as several other senators have noted today, that this is a very short piece of legislation which contains no detail about what form such a plebiscite might take, so we need to be careful about not overstating the impact that it might have.
The bill has been introduced in the context of the proposed forced council amalgamations in Queensland. Labor believes that these communities should have the ability to express their views on these proposals and that they should not be fined or sacked for doing so. For this reason we support this bill. We have been suggesting the use of plebiscites for some months now. They are just one example of measures that can be taken to get people involved in democratic processes. They are measures which can support politicians’ decision making.
The bill is about more than just Queensland councils. This legislation could pave the way for citizen initiated plebiscites on other issues, which we welcome in principle. When matters are deeply controversial in a local community, people should be able to have a mechanism to make their views on the matter heard. This is not to replace our system of representative democracy but rather is an important complement to it. Just last week, the Prime Minister of Britain, Gordon Brown, announced that he would be instituting citizens’ juries in the UK. We should be thinking about innovative ways to inform people and involve them in decision making, not engaging in the smoke-and-mirror obfuscation that characterises the way this government treats its citizens and electors.
It has become commonplace to say that Australians are cynical about politics and politicians. In the annual Roy Morgan poll, politics usually comes pretty low down on the list of trustworthy occupations—usually just above journalists and the car salesmen. People want politicians to represent their interests honestly, and they want to know what is going on. And these have not been features of the Howard government.
It would be wonderful if this legislation were an indication of some commitment on the part of the government towards improving democratic process in this country. I doubt that it is—not least because the government does not have much of a track record in this respect. Under the Howard government, the quality of our democracy has been significantly downgraded. The coalition have used their control of the Senate to diminish the role of the Senate committees—one of the most constructive, bilateral processes of our parliament, which is admired worldwide. The committee system allows ordinary people the right to have their say on issues that affect them.
The reality of our parliamentary system as it is working at the moment has been commented on by the Clerk of the Senate at a recent forum. He said:
Legislation framed by the executive alone is rammed through lower houses with the least possible delay and examination, scrutiny of government is severely limited lest it disclose matters embarrassing to government, and inquiries are limited to matters which cannot cause the executive any difficulty or embarrassment.
The role of the Senate in scrutinising legislation and allowing Australians to have some input into the process is important but the government has used its control of the Senate to hamstring the capacity of the Senate to provide scrutiny and transparency wherever possible.
This is a government that has shown little respect for the committee process and the effort that thousands of Australians put into making submissions and appearing before committee inquiries. The Democratic Audit of Australia pointed out that the latest six-monthly report on government responses to committee reports, presented to parliament in June this year, showed:
... the government had failed to respond to a single report within the required three-month period. Indeed, some are still waiting for a response after several years. Whilst in a few cases the government claims a response is pending, subject to developments, in the case of the report on A Certain Maritime Incident (tabled in 2002), the government is still deciding whether it is going to respond at all.
This shows a manifest lack of respect for the democratic processes of our parliament and for the ordinary Australians who put their neck out to be involved in it. The Howard government’s control of the Senate also enabled the government to put in place some radical, disturbing and worrying changes to the Commonwealth Electoral Act last year. That has to be the most brazen example of this government’s lack of commitment to improving Australia’s democratic processes. Under these laws, first time voters or those who are re-enrolling or updating enrolment details are required to comply with new proof of identity requirements. Voters will have to either provide drivers licence details, having prescribed documents witnessed by authorised persons according to the act, or have two enrolled people, whom they have known for at least a month, confirm their identity. With data showing that between 10 and 20 per cent of adults do not have a drivers licence, that will be a real problem for some Australians. We should be encouraging people to enrol to vote, not making it increasingly difficult for them to do so.
But more worrying than this, at this point in the electoral cycle, is the early closure of the electoral rolls instituted by the Howard government in that same piece of legislation. These changes close the rolls for new voters on the day the writs are issued or a minimum of 33 days before polling day. So existing enrollees are only given three days to correct their details. The rationale for this was to prevent electoral fraud, but the ANAO found no evidence that fraud was even taking place.
Australia has long been at the vanguard of democratic process and reform. But these changes actually put it behind developments in countries such as Canada and New Zealand, which have changed their legislation in the opposite way to make it easier to enrol and vote. Of course the early closing of the electoral rolls most seriously affects young people who are not yet on the roll. The Special Minister of State, Mr Nairn, admitted in July that, as of March, more than 400,000 eligible people were not enrolled to vote. These are the real people being defrauded by these measures. I should not need to point out that young people are so important to our country’s future. They should be given every opportunity to have their say and we should be encouraging them, rather than discouraging them, to be involved. But it is no great surprise that the coalition do not want more young people on the rolls. Young people who do not have mortgages are not key targets for the government’s endless and deeply monotonous scare campaigns on interest rates. Young people are those most vulnerable to losing conditions under Work Choices. Young people see the overcrowded lecture theatres in their universities and carry debts from their university days through to their working lives. Of course the coalition wants to prevent as many of these people as possible from getting on the electoral roll.
Last month the High Court struck down the amendment in the Commonwealth Electoral Act preventing prisoners who are serving a sentence of less than three years from voting in elections. That is important because, effectively, it led to the potential disenfranchisement of a great swathe of, in particular, Indigenous Australians. In addition, just to make this antidemocratic cocktail all the more potent, the 2006 legislation made it easier for corporations to make secret donations to political parties. Professor Marian Sawer pointed out:
Australia seems unique in legislating to make it easier for private money to influence the policies of elected governments, by removing many corporate donations from public scrutiny.
That is outrageous, but of course we should not be surprised. This piece of legislation which we are debating today is a welcome but entirely uncharacteristic development on the part of this government. I now leave it to my colleague Senator McLucas to reflect on Labor’s final position on the bill.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (DEMOCRATIC PLEBISCITES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2007-09-12,"—There has been a lot of bluster in both the conduct of the inquiry into the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Democratic Plebiscites) Bill 2007 and in the debate that we have had today. It is a lot of feigned anger and a feigned defence of this thing that we call democracy. It has been interesting for those of us in Queensland to watch the behaviour of some of the coalition senators, first of all, in the conduct of the inquiry—I think Senator Moore very eloquently put that on the record—but also during the debate that we have had today. Can I say, as every other Labor senator in this debate has said, that we support this legislation. We announced that support for this legislation when the legislation was proposed, because it actually reflects Labor’s position on the issue of forced amalgamations.
We need to go back over the history that brings us to this point. Late in 2004 the Local Government Association of Queensland adopted a policy to promote discussion on the need to consider reform to local government in our state to ensure long-term sustainability of Queensland’s local government. That resulted in what is called the Size, Shape and Sustainability process, which was agreed to by the Local Government Association of Queensland, supported by the state government and actually funded by the state government—funding of, I think, $25 million over five years. That was strongly supported by local government itself and also by constituents who live in those various local government areas. The reason for that support was that that process allowed for analysis of the financial situation of each council, it looked at opportunities for boundary realignments and for cooperative arrangements that would cross local government boundaries in order to save much-needed ratepayers’ funds. But, most importantly, there was strong community engagement at each step in the Size, Shape and Sustainability process. That process then progressed.
It is extremely unfortunate in my view that, on 17 April of this year, the government of Queensland abandoned what is called the SSS process. That engendered real concern in the community and real concern from local government that the process they had originally embarked upon was being shelved. Then, as we know, the Queensland government established the Local Government Reform Commission which was made up of a range of individuals from all walks of political life—people who had been in the state government from the National Party, the Liberal Party and the Labor Party—all of whom had some interest in local government. They brought down their report and recommended a considerable number of amalgamations in Queensland. The Queensland government, as we know, then adopted almost all of those recommendations and the process of forced amalgamations began.
On 17 May of this year, Mr Rudd, the leader of the federal Labor Party, made it clear that he did not support the process as adopted by the Queensland Labor government. He went to Townsville and spoke very clearly and very openly about why federal Labor was not supporting forced amalgamations in our state. Mr Rudd said, ‘I said to Mr Beattie it would be good if he reviewed his approach to this amalgamations process and put forward other ways in which economic and financial efficiencies can be achieved. My view broadly is that local voice and local choice is critical when it comes to the future of local government across of Australia as well as here in Queensland. My other view is this,’ he said:
If we are going to come up with any amalgamation proposals, the important way forward is then to test them through the democratic process of a local referendum. I think that is a further second test which should be applied.

I remind the Senate that that statement was made on 17 May of this year. So, federal Labor has been consistent in its position in opposition to forced amalgamations. We then had, I think, a very unfortunate position where the Queensland government actually did bring in legislation to say that if any local government undertook a plebiscite, their tenure as a local government would cease and they would then not be involved in any of the preliminary and pre-amalgamation discussions, clearly to the detriment of their local government constituents.
So that is why we are here. The federal government said that they would bring in legislation that would ensure that plebiscites could be held and that they would be funded by the Commonwealth government so that a local voice would be known. We reiterated our support at that time for that process to go forward. We also supported the establishment of the inquiry that was undertaken, and that was a useful thing to do. But I found it somewhat intriguing that this piece of legislation—a piece of legislation which is very simple, clear and not complex at all—warranted a three-day inquiry, whereas the intervention in the Northern Territory, which was a hugely expensive and life-changing proposal, warranted a one-day inquiry. We understand and support the need for the intervention in the Northern Territory to be quick and to happen quickly, but it is intriguing to note that the intervention in the Northern Territory, for example, warranted one day of inquiry, whereas this legislation of three full pages warranted a full three-day inquiry. But, having said that, I support the fact that we did it. I was pleased that the inquiry was able to travel to my home town of Cairns and we were able to hear evidence, particularly from people in the Douglas Shire, and people from the Northern Peninsula Area and the Torres Strait.
I was somewhat disappointed, though, that we only had a very short time to question the Australian Electoral Commission and the Department of Finance and Administration. Because other witnesses went over time, and that is fine, we did not have very long at all to speak with the AEC and to get an understanding of what their processes were, and would be, once this legislation has been passed. I was concerned in the short time that we did have to question the AEC that they indicated that the previously announced date for the plebiscite of 20 October was, to paraphrase the AEC, not achievable—essentially Mr Dacey said that that was certainly not going to be achieved. He indicated that, subsequent to the passage of this legislation through the parliament and royal assent being given, they would then wait for requests for ballots from various local authorities in the state of Queensland. Mr Dacey said very clearly that his priority was going to be the conduct of the federal election—that the federal election had priority. Whilst we are all very comforted by that, and we would not want to see the federal election processes compromised in any way, I am a bit concerned that people who live in the affected local government areas have an absolute expectation that this plebiscite will be conducted in a reasonable amount of time. There is no clarity—maybe Senator Fifield might be able to provide us with some—about when these ballots will be conducted. Mr Dacey did indicate that he expected, and it was his preference, that the most economical way and the way that he would like to conduct the ballot is through a postal ballot rather than an attendance ballot.
The other concern that I have is that I am unsure of what the process is going to be for the writing of the yes/no cases. Who is going to be asked to undertake that piece of work and how will they be vetted? We had some very good evidence from a past president of the Australian Local Government Association about the work they did for an amalgamation in his area. I hope that the AEC takes that advice on board.
I will now go to the effects of amalgamation and my concerns for my communities about what they might be. I will first turn to the Douglas Shire and quote from Councillor Mike Berwick, who is the Mayor of the Douglas Shire. He said to the committee:
Part of Australia’s heritage is regional and rural communities. Let’s look after them. Let’s keep them empowered. They have their own character; they are all different. Once you start joining us all together into big governments we start to lose our identity—and we are upset about it.
I concur with Councillor Berwick when it comes to the question of the Douglas Shire, but I need to place on the record that I am not opposed per se to amalgamations of local government. In fact, in February and March of 1995 I stood for local government and was elected to the amalgamated Cairns City Council. The reason that I stood for that election was that I live in the former Cairns City Council area but the concerns I had about development and the impacts of development in my community were in fact happening in the old Mulgrave Shire. Once those two councils were amalgamated, there was an opportunity to influence the direction of development in my region. I supported the amalgamation of Cairns City and Mulgrave shire, stood for election and was in fact elected. So I am not opposed per se to amalgamations, but I think we have to be careful about what we do and the areas that we do pull together in amalgamations of councils.
When the Local Government Reform Commission looked at the Douglas Shire I think they made a mistake. In every principle, every respect and every one of the terms of reference that the Local Government Reform Commission was given, the answer should have been that Douglas Shire should not be amalgamated with the Cairns City Council. It is geographically isolated. I think many of us have driven the road from Cairns to the Douglas Shire. It is not connected and never will be—I hope—connected by an urbanised area. It has a completely different catchment area. It has pressures on potential development not experienced by the Cairns City Council.
I was so concerned, once the Local Government Reform Commission brought down its findings, that I wrote on 3 August this year to the Premier of our state—and I am happy to table the document. I gave a number of reasons that supported my position that the Local Government Reform Commission had erred in recommending the amalgamation of Cairns with the Douglas Shire. I reminded the Premier that the Douglas Shire’s planning instrument and the processes used to achieve it won the Planning Institute of Australia’s Queensland planning award. I reminded the Premier that the shire is home to a number of land uses which, if not treated appropriately, could be seen as conflicting. ‘It is a credit’, I said, ‘to the councils and its officers that the planning instrument has received the support of the community and the recognition of the institute.’ I made the point that the Douglas Shire has successfully promoted community engagement with its constituency.
The residents of the Douglas Shire are a very diverse group of people. We have a very important sugarcane industry and we have an extraordinarily important tourism industry. We also have the reality that the Wet Tropics World Heritage area of both the Daintree township region—which is the Daintree National Park—and the area north of the Daintree River, which is listed as a World Heritage area, require consistent and vigilant planning instruments to ensure that we do not lose the goose that laid the golden egg. The Douglas Shire, with all those seemingly conflicted constituencies, has been able to come up with a planning instrument which everyone agrees with—and that is no mean feat.
The final point I made to the Premier was that, if the ratepayers of the Douglas Shire were paying more for their basic services—for their roads, their rubbish collection and their water supply—it would diminish my argument. But the ratepayers of the Douglas Shire pay less than similar land users in the Cairns City Council area. I was concerned and I wrote to the Premier about it and I am still of the view that the Local Government Reform Commission erred when it came to the Douglas Shire.
I was pleased to see Queensland respond to the pressure from both the Noosa Shire and the Douglas Shire and to the concerns in their communities about the loss of their iconic status. The Queensland government has spoken with Mayor Berwick and Mayor Abbot of Noosa Shire requesting them to input into what is going to be, as I understand it, legislation that will protect the iconic nature of both of those areas. But I can also say that I was fairly disappointed to read in the Port Douglas and Mossman Gazette last week that four of the councillors of the Douglas Shire have decided not to support involvement in this so-called iconic legislation. That is very disappointing, but it is interesting to note—given Senator Joyce’s very welcome defence of the environmental values of the Douglas Shire—that most of those four councillors who voted against involvement in the iconic legislation are aligned with the conservative side of politics, particularly the Liberal Party.
In the short time I have left I want to go to issues affecting the outer islands of the Torres Strait and the Northern Peninsula Area. There is strong opposition to amalgamation in that area, and I acknowledge that. I say, though, that there is a piece of work that has to be undertaken and undertaken quite quickly before amalgamations will occur, and that is to deal with the question of the ownership of enterprise. I am concerned with the loss of CDEP in the northern peninsula area that we have got two processes running in tandem that could end up in a disaster. Currently the five local government shires based in the Northern Peninsula Area all own enterprises and those enterprises are essentially staffed by CDEP workers. CDEP, as you know, is going to be taken away from those communities, and there is a real concern that those enterprises, viable only because of CDEP, will fold.
Finally, I commend Senator Kate Lundy for her work on constitutional recognition. In my first speech in this place I called on the government to recognise local government in the Constitution. I might see it happen if we get a Labor government, and I think that would be good for local government in Australia. I also commend Jim Turnour, who took the trouble to write a submission to the inquiry. I compare him to the Liberal Party candidate for Leichardt, who came along and grandstanded at the end without identifying herself as the candidate, rather than doing the right and proper thing and writing a submission to the inquiry.

",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (DEMOCRATIC PLEBISCITES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2007-09-12,"—I rise to speak on the Commonwealth Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Democratic Plebiscites) Bill 2007. The bill amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to allow the Australian Electoral Commission to use and disclose information for the purpose of conducting an activity such as a plebiscite. The bill also addresses any state and territory law that seeks to prevent or punish any person or entity from taking part in such an activity and causes such laws to have no effect. In other words, the bill seeks to restore a right which Queensland legislation had removed.
I am pleased to have the opportunity to address some remarks to this bill, having chaired the Senate’s Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration’s inquiry into this legislation. The legislation was referred to the committee by the Senate on 16 August. Submissions were called for and three days of public hearings were held, on 30 and 31 August and 3 September, in Noosa, Emerald and Cairns respectively, and the committee presented its final report on 7 September.
The catalyst for this bill was the extraordinary actions of the Labor government in Queensland. It is worth running through the chain of events that led to the necessity for this legislation. The local government sector in Queensland until April of this year had been undertaking a voluntary process to examine its structure, operations and boundaries. The Size, Shape and Sustainability, or SSS, initiative was a collaborative approach between Queensland local governments and the Queensland state government and it had bipartisan support in the Queensland state parliament. It was supported by legislation and had a clear and agreed time line for progress. In its submission to the Senate inquiry, the Local Government Association of Queensland noted that 27 review groups and 117 councils were fully engaged in this process.
But then, suddenly, without warning, the Beattie government decided to scrap that process and unilaterally dictate forced amalgamations. The SSS initiative was abandoned. What was the rationale for Peter Beattie in abandoning this process? On the Insiders program on 19 August he said:
We just threw our hands up and said, ‘Look, after two years if you can only get four, you’ve got to be kidding.’
That is, only four councils agreeing to amalgamate. It sounds fair enough at face value: after two years you can only get four councils to amalgamate. One thing he left out was that it was actually a five-year process that the Queensland state government had signed up to, that local governments had signed up to, and that the Queensland state opposition had signed up to. So it is hardly surprising when you are barely 18 months through a five-year process that you do not actually have the end result that the process was designed to achieve. In the same interview, when Peter Beattie was talking about what would happen if that process were allowed to go the full distance, he said:
And the end of that process would have been a referendum by the way.
So initially, he entertained the very prospect of a referendum. He saw referendums as a necessary part of giving voice to the people and the wishes of people in Queensland, but he abandoned that.
On 17 April the Queensland government established a seven-member Queensland Local Government Reform Commission, getting rid of the SSS process. Only one month was allowed for submissions from stakeholders as part of that process. The commission brought down its report on 27 July. Amongst its 25 recommendations was the most controversial one: that the number of Queensland councils be reduced from 156 to 72.
In moving to implement these changes the Beattie government expressly removed any right of appeal against the reform commission’s recommendations. It is worth noting what the Queensland legislation actually said in relation to reviews. It said:
A designated decision
is final and conclusive; and
cannot be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed, set aside, or called into question in another way, under the Judicial Review Act 1991 or otherwise (whether by the Supreme Court, another court, a tribunal or another entity); and
is not subject to any writ or order of the Supreme Court, another court, a tribunal or another entity on any ground.
Without limiting subsection (1), a person may not bring a proceeding for an injunction or any other order to stop or otherwise restrain the performance of a designated act, or for a declaration about the validity of a designated act.
And so on it goes. You get the feeling that they did not want anyone to have any avenue of appeal against their decision.
This leads us to the Commonwealth’s action. Without any avenue at all for appeal or redress, the Commonwealth thought that it was only fair and reasonable to offer some assistance to the people of Queensland to have their say. Already there is, in the Commonwealth Electoral Act, provision for local governments to hold plebiscites. That is something that was already there. The Commonwealth said it would fund local governments to conduct those plebiscites. The act already exists for those plebiscites to happen; all we were offering was to fund them. No legislation was required.
In response, Premier Beattie amended his own legislation so that any council that took advantage of the Commonwealth’s offer would be sacked. Any councillor who was involved in seeking to have a referendum would be fined. One can only presume that if they were fined, and did not pay, they would then go to jail. The ALP was saying, ‘We are going to force these amalgamations on you; we are not going to let you have a say and, if you try, we are going to whack you.’ So, on 10 August 2007, the Beattie government passed the Local Government Reform Implementation Act 2007, which banned local councils from conducting these polls. That was the action which prompted the Prime Minister to announce the legislation we are discussing today. Premier Beattie then announced that Queensland would challenge this legislation in the High Court. But, eventually, the absurdity of Premier Beattie’s position was clear even to him and he announced that the Queensland parliament would repeal the offending provisions.
Although Mr Beattie admitted that he had stuffed up, his appearance on the ABC Insiders program on 19 August had his and the government’s arrogance on full display. Whilst he would no longer stand in the way of plebiscites being conducted, Mr Beattie was forced to admit that he did not care what the people had to say. This is what Mr Beattie had to say:
If people want to have a protest and the Prime Minister wants to pay for that protest vote, then that’s fine by us; we’re not going to fine councils. But one thing everyone needs to understand is that amalgamations will go ahead, there will be no changes.
In other words, ‘you can have your say, but we’re not going to listen. We don’t care what you think.’
Despite Mr Beattie apparently withdrawing his threat to punish those who want to have a say, who want to hold a plebiscite, we still seek to pass this legislation, for two reasons. Firstly, and bizarrely, rather than seeking to amend the primary legislation in the Queensland parliament, the Queensland government has opted to seek to override the primary legislation by regulation. It is a pretty bizarre thing to do, and of dubious legal efficacy. This is despite the fact that the Queensland government has already introduced into their parliament amending legislation, which is sitting there waiting to be debated. They just cannot bring themselves to pass legislation to actually withdraw those punitive provisions.
Secondly, and most importantly, we are going to pass our legislation to protect against any future rush of blood to the head of any Queensland premier. This legislation is insurance against the Queensland government not removing those offending provisions or seeking to reintroduce them in the future.
One of the most poignant moments in our public hearings took place in Emerald, where we had a witness, Mr Robert Hayward, Chief Executive Officer of the Tambo Shire Council. While Mr Hayward was giving his evidence he very casually mentioned that he had paid for the Tambo Shire to have a plebiscite out of his own pocket. This is what the Queensland government’s legislation led to: situations where you had a council chief executive paying the $4,000—it was a fairly small shire—out of his own pocket in order to protect his councillors so that they could not be sacked and so that they could not be fined. That is the absurdity of the situation, where you have council chief executive officers putting their own hands in their pockets to fund plebiscites.
That instance so took the committee that we have recommended in our report that the Queensland state government reimburse Mr Hayward for the expenses he incurred and that, failing that, the Commonwealth government should give consideration to reimbursing Mr Hayward. But I would hope that the Queensland government would have the decency to reimburse him.
The committee also heard how important small local councils are in Queensland communities. I have to say: if you had asked me a year ago, I would have said that if you have local government areas with only 1,200 people in central western Queensland, of course they should be merged. If you had asked me, I would have said that a year ago. But listening to the evidence of these people was inspiring. Some of these local council employees in these shires staff the local SES, the fire brigade and the ambulance services purely in a voluntary capacity. If you merge these councils, you lose these councils’ staff in these towns, you will lose their SES, fire brigade and ambulance services. Although the government does not have a position on council amalgamations, I have to say that personally I would hate to see a council such as Tambo forcibly merged. These services are critical and may well be put at risk if forced council amalgamations take place.
Many witnesses before the committee testified on the various unique aspects of their councils, whether it be differences in maintenance standards, approaches to urban planning or simply the preservation of local identity. It was clear to the committee that local councils across Queensland are each representing their individual communities in their own ways—which is as it should be. Each council reflects the different priorities of their communities, and what is clear is that these amalgamations, conducted as they have been without proper consultation, will damage the ability of individual communities to determine their own priorities.
The forced amalgamations have also had significant implications for Indigenous communities. The Chair of the Torres Strait Regional Authority and Chair of the St Paul’s Island Council, Mr Toshie Kris, highlighted in his evidence, in Cairns, the challenge of having responsibilities arising from being partly bound by an international border. He told the committee:
There was no proper consultation throughout our region. It really distresses me. We are talking about a region that looks after more services than any other shire in the region, because we also deal with an international treaty right throughout our region. I would love to see how the Mayor of Cook Shire or the Mayor of Douglas Shire would deal with 10 canoes sitting on the beach with people with diseases ranging from TB and dengue to HIV. These are real issues that are happening throughout our region. It has been stated that our region is the eyes and ears of Australia. With the amalgamation process, the only thing left is the bare skull. There is a passage through that skull to Australia that no-one has really given any answers to.
Mr Joseph Elu, Chair of the Seisia Island Council, added that the amalgamations threaten their cultural heritage. ‘We feel we will lose our identity,’ he said.
The disgraceful handling of this process by the Queensland Labor government leaves that government condemned. It is what led to Dr Michael Taylor, President of the Noosa Shire Residents and Ratepayers Association, to declare, ‘I’m a lifelong Labor voter and I will never vote Labor again.’ But the incompetence and arrogance of the Queensland state Labor government pales in comparison to the rank hypocrisy of the federal Labor Party. Labor say that they support this bill, and I guess Senator McLucas came the closest to seeming vaguely enthusiastic about this bill—but, given her office is in Cairns, she would be practically lynched if she did not evidence some enthusiasm. Labor senators will soon file in here with the government to vote for and pass this bill. But if Labor support this bill, why didn’t one single Labor MP front the inquiry? The Nationals member for Maranoa, Bruce Scott, fronted up and gave evidence. The Liberal candidate for Leichhardt, Charlie McKillop, fronted up and gave evidence.
If Labor support this bill, why didn’t their MPs appear before the inquiry and give evidence to that effect? Why have Labor senators submitted a dissenting a report which amounts to nothing more than a partisan rant? Why are Labor senators attacking the inquiry process and carping at the conduct of the hearings? And why are Labor senators saying that this bill is a stunt? Most of all, why hasn’t anyone in the Labor Party publicly and forcefully called on the Queensland Labor government to pull their head in? Even during the debate on this bill in the House this week, Labor members were running the line that the bill was really unnecessary. If it is so unnecessary, why are Labor recommending that the bill be passed? If it is so unnecessary, why don’t Labor have the courage to vote against it?
It is also noteworthy that not a single Labor member from Queensland had the mettle to speak in support of the bill in the House. They have left the task to their interstate colleagues to tackle an issue of fundamental importance to their constituents and their state. What weak and spineless representation the Labor Party provide for their constituents in Queensland. The truth is that Labor are again trying to walk both sides of the street. They are trying to be seen to be supportive of local communities in Queensland, for reasons of political self-interest, but at the same time they are scared of confronting their party colleagues in Queensland in a meaningful way—in a way that will get results. It is yet another exhibit in a growing catalogue of evidence that demonstrates how federal Labor would merely be a patsy for the state Labor governments. They are not willing to stand up to them, and you can bet your house that, if Labor had been in government federally, they never would have introduced legislation like this and they never would have stood up for the democratic rights of communities in Queensland.
Senators Forshaw and Moore drew to the attention of witnesses over and over again—as Senator McLucas did a moment ago—that Mr Rudd is on the record criticising the amalgamation process before Mr Howard was on the record. My response to that is: so what? Did Mr Rudd’s comments have any effect on the Queensland government? No. Did Mr Rudd introduce legislation into the parliament to override the Queensland legislation? No. What matters to the people of Queensland is not what people said but what they did and who took action. This government is taking action, initiated by us—not initiated by senators on the other side.
Maybe the Labor candidates and members in Queensland were taking their orders from a union boss. In this case, they may well have been following the directive of Bill Ludwig. The Australian helpfully exposed Mr Ludwig’s intervention on 16 August. That article said:
Mr Ludwig said yesterday he had told his Right faction federal candidates in Queensland to ‘pull their heads in’ and not to support Coalition attacks on Mr Beattie over the amalgamations. ‘I’ve sent the word out to the candidates. What the state Government has done is fair,’ he said.
These unions have a funny sense of fairness. On the one hand they say that our workplace relations policies that have delivered higher wages and hundreds of thousands of new jobs are unfair. Yet abandoning a functioning process, ramming through a flawed amalgamations process without consultation, and then threatening to sack and fine those who dare to ask their communities what they think is ‘fair’ according to people like Bill Ludwig. What a joke. When are we going to hear Labor senators opposite rebuke the likes of Bill Ludwig? I am tipping the answer is ‘never’. We will just hear silence.
No wonder the unions are happy with what is occurring. The Labor government in Queensland has stipulated that local transition committees be formed to guide shires through their amalgamation process. I guess that sounds fair enough, but those committees can contain up to three union officials. The committee heard evidence that, unlike the other members of these committees, these union officials are rarely locals. Unions win; local communities lose. On this side of the chamber, we are proud of this legislation. We are actually enthusiastic about this legislation. We are not dragging our heels in here to vote for it reluctantly. We are keen and eager to do it and cannot wait. We are pleased that, through our Senate inquiry, the people of Queensland were able to have a voice, and we look forward to seeing them expressing their views via plebiscites.
But not everyone was so enthusiastic about the Senate committee process. In a letter dripping with vitriol, addressed to the Special Minister of State, Queensland local government minister Andrew Fraser wrote:
… there is absolutely no public benefit in the course of inquiry being undertaken by the committee. It represents an abuse of the majority the Howard government holds in the Senate ...
This inquiry is exposed for what it, in reality, always was: a sham, taxpayer-funded touring circus for Howard government mouthpieces to peddle unconstitutional false hope.
‘Howard government mouthpieces’ is a little offensive to the Labor senators on the committee, I would think. He goes on:
Port Douglas and Noosa are, granted, nice places to visit; especially when compared to Canberra’s wintry August. But the inquiry, like the bill itself, is just a cruel hoax.
I can assure Mr Fraser that this bill is not a cruel hoax. It is intended to give a voice and a say back to the people of Queensland. We are determined to pass this legislation. We think it is important legislation. Never before have many of us on this side of the chamber seen the democratic right of people to have their say stomped on the way we have seen it in Queensland. Local communities need this bill to ensure that they are never again denied their say.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (DEMOCRATIC PLEBISCITES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2007-09-12,"—The government firmly believes—
—Come on! You don’t believe that at all!
—I certainly do, and you might hang around for some comments in committee, Senator. The government firmly believes that it is important for people to have a democratic say in matters that will affect them. The Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Democratic Plebiscites) Bill 2007 will achieve this for all Australians, not just for the people of Queensland. I welcome the support of my fellow senators for this bill and I welcome the unanimous recommendation by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in its report on its recent inquiry into this bill, namely that the bill should be passed. I note that the committee made three other recommendations. I will return to these at a later stage.
I would like to thank the committee for their comprehensive inquiry into the matters associated with the bill. As senators are aware, this bill gives effect to the Prime Minister’s announcement on 7 August 2007 to allow the Australian Electoral Commission to undertake any plebiscite on the amalgamation of any local governing body in any part of Australia. This was in response to the Queensland parliament passing a law on 10 August 2007 which would have prevented councillors in that state from having any involvement with a plebiscite on local government matters. We welcome the Queensland government’s backdown over its threat to penalise councillors for conducting or taking part in any plebiscites on local government matters. This was in direct response to this government’s sustained pressure to allow Queenslanders to express their views on the amalgamations without penalty.
This government did not intend to stand by idly while the Queensland government prevented councillors in that state from having any involvement with a plebiscite on local government matters. This government was, and is, prepared to have Commonwealth legislation override any draconian laws such as those passed in Queensland. As the Prime Minister has reiterated on a number of occasions, this government is not expressing a view on whether or not an individual amalgamation should occur. Rather, the Commonwealth believes that people should have the right to express a view on the actions of a government without threat of penalty. This bill achieves this outcome.
Since 1992, the Australian Electoral Commission has had the ability to enter into arrangements to supply goods and services to a person or body. The Australian Electoral Commission presently conducts elections for trade unions, for employer and other organisations, and for other foreign countries. This bill does not propose that the Australian Electoral Commission perform different functions. Rather, what it does is clarify that the use and disclosure of information by the Australian Electoral Commission is authorised for the purpose of conducting an activity such as a plebiscite.
Contrary to some media reports and commentary on this bill, the government is not directing the AEC to undertake any particular plebiscite activity. The AEC retains its independence under this bill. The bill does not contain a power for anyone to direct the AEC to undertake a plebiscite or similar activity. Clarifying that the Australian Electoral Commission has the authority to use and disclose information it holds will ensure that people are able to express their views on proposals that may affect their democratic rights. Because this government is committed to ensuring that people are able to express their views on proposals that may affect their democratic rights, the bill also contains provisions that override state or territory laws if those laws seek to prohibit, penalise or discriminate against anyone for entering into, or proposing to enter into, an arrangement with the Australian Electoral Commission. The timing for any activity, such as a plebiscite, as part of an arrangement entered into following the passage of this bill, will be determined by the Australian Electoral Commission.
Turning to the Senate committee’s recommendations in its report, the government notes the recommendation relating to the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr Hayward, the Chief Executive Officer of the Tambo Shire Council, in recognition of the expenses he incurred in funding its plebiscite in an effort to give the community a say and to protect its councillors from punitive fines and dismissal. Failing that, the committee recommended that the Commonwealth government, consistent with its policy of funding local government plebiscites in Queensland, consider reimbursing Mr Hayward. The Australian government considers that Mr Hayward should be reimbursed for the expenses he incurred in funding a plebiscite on the proposed amalgamation of the council. He made his arrangements in the light of the Queensland approach which removed a previous right to hold such plebiscites. The Australian government believes that either the Tambo shire or the Queensland government should be responsible for making the reimbursement.
In relation to the recommendation for continuing dialogue with local government on constitutional recognition, the government supports this in principle. The Australian government has an ongoing dialogue with individual local governments as well as local government representative organisations. The issue of constitutional recognition of local government has been unsuccessful in two previous referenda and the Australian government is not convinced at this stage that another referendum would have a different result. The Australian government is open to further consultation with local government representative organisations regarding the objectives and form of the sector’s proposals for constitutional recognition.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-09-12,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This annual report in respect of section 14 of the Housing Assistance Act 1996 is actually an incredibly important document. It is a pity that documents as significant as this are often treated as offering a chance only for a five-minute speech at the fag end of a sitting day. This document deals with an incredibly important area. It deals with the operation of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, being the funding arrangement between the Commonwealth and the states for public housing and community housing and for areas of Indigenous housing. It has always been absolutely critical but it is more important than ever given the absolute crisis in housing affordability and availability which is wreaking havoc across so many parts of Australia in regional areas as well as in the capital cities.
The report is detailed. As you would expect, it details the performance of the agreement over the period of 2005-06. Of course it is already 12 months out of date. That in itself is a reminder that while we have the data from this report the reality out in the community has already moved on. The situation in terms of waiting lists for and availability of public and community housing given the growing gap and in terms of the growing crisis facing Indigenous Australians in particular over access to housing is far worse than the reality that is being assessed in this report.
Above and beyond that, we have, as I was saying in this chamber just yesterday, massive increases in costs in the private rental market as well as big leaps in the purchase price of housing for those who are seeking to buy their own home. Rising housing prices may be great if you are an investor, and rising rents and a market that allows private rents to skyrocket may also be great if you are an investor, but the majority of Australians are not. I think it is a real problem that rising house prices are still perceived and reported in many ways as being a plus. A lot of the documentation from real estate institutes and the like show double-digit growth in housing prices in particular regions as a good thing. Again, I guess it is potentially a good thing if you are an investor, but if any other basic item, particularly if it were essential, were increasing by double-digit amounts in the space of a year—or, in many areas, in less than the space of a year—there would be huge concerns. Inflation in this area at a double-digit level should be a matter of grave concern.
In the area of private rentals, that is also the case. In many regions we are having double-digit growth in inflation. That is seen as a good thing if you are an investor, so it is reported that way in many cases, but it is a terrible thing if you are simply trying to afford to have a home. You particularly do not want to be faced with upheaval or even, in a growing number of cases, genuine homelessness or having to be put in temporary shelters and accommodation of other sorts. There are a huge and growing number of Australians in that situation.
The inability of the public and community housing sector to help plug some of those gaps and to provide that safety net is detailed in this report as well—once you wade through all the different statistics that are here—and nowhere more so than in the area of Indigenous housing. It is a real tragedy that the federal government has failed to increase the amount available through the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. Whilst there have been some funding boosts in the area of Indigenous housing in the last budget, they have been attached to an ideological agenda of a government that is more focused on symbolism of its ideological obsessions than on ensuring practical outcomes of improving housing availability and affordability for Indigenous Australians. It is a serious problem that is only getting worse.
The Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement runs out on 30 June next year, and we have seen another left-field ideological assertion from the federal Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs that the agreement should be put up for tender. I think that, basically, we will just see what happens—if it progresses anywhere; there is a federal election before that. It is another left-field policy proposal without any clear consultation, engagement or evidence based behind it. That is also of great concern to the Democrats. We will continue to focus on housing affordability at all levels and with all types of housing. It is something all parties need to do in the lead-up to the election. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2007-09-12,"—I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate tonight the gross violation of human rights, as I understand it, in the Middle East. I would like to inform the Senate that over a year has passed since the unprovoked abduction of two Israeli soldiers, Eldad Regev and Ehud Goldwasser, on the Israeli side of the Lebanese border—an action that precipitated widespread confrontation between Israel and the Lebanon based Hezbollah terrorist organisation. In that action, on 12 July 2006, Hezbollah launched rockets into Israel and entered Israeli territory. They captured the two soldiers that I have named and they killed a further eight. In the armed conflict which followed, an estimated 43 civilians in Israel were killed and an estimated 1,191 people in Lebanon were killed. Earlier, on 25 June 2006, Hamas irregulars attacked an Israeli position on the edge of the Gaza Strip. They killed two soldiers and captured a third, Gilad Shalit. He was abducted. Nothing has been heard of the two captive soldiers and only a tape has been heard of soldier Shalit’s voice. Neither their families nor the government of Israel have any knowledge of their whereabouts or their current state of health.
Especially grave is the fact that these unprovoked abductions were carried out on sovereign Israeli territory. The trespassing of Hezbollah into Israel arguably constituted an armed attack for the purposes of article 51 of the UN charter, which says:
Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations ...
The argument that cross-border assaults by non-state actors can constitute armed attacks is supported by UN Security Council resolutions 1368 and 1373. If that Hezbollah incursion was an armed attack, it enlivened Israel’s inherent right of self-defence under article 51.
This is a deplorable state of affairs. Not only were many innocent people killed in the subsequent retaliation by both sides but these unfortunate soldiers have not been able to be looked at by international agencies, and nor have their families heard anything from them. As I said, on the anniversary of the single soldier’s abduction in 2007 Hamas released a recorded message of Gilad Shalit’s voice—the first sign of life since he was abducted. His father indicated that the voice, if not the wording, of the message, was indeed that of his son. That recording is an important development but it cannot be seen as a substitute for what Hamas must do—namely, allow the International Red Cross to immediately visit the soldier and allow him to receive proper medical attention. These captive soldiers are being denied the most basic of human rights.
The Israeli foreign ministry are active in their efforts on all levels to obtain the release of the soldiers. The Israeli foreign minister and her fellow ministers, alongside the Prime Minister, have raised the issue at the highest level in their diplomatic meetings in Israel and abroad, as has our own Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Alexander Downer, who, in answer to a question on notice on 30 November 2006, replied that he was aware of the issue and:
... Australia utterly condemns taking hostages for political purposes and calls for the immediate and unconditional release of the IDF soldiers—
including the one abducted in the first abduction, because the abduction of those soldiers:
... will do nothing to advance the cause of the Palestinian people. We are deeply concerned at the complicity of Hamas’ armed wing in the initial attack and at the subsequent action by Hezbollah on the Israel Lebanon Border.
And he reminded those countries:
All states have a responsibility to abide by their obligations under international humanitarian law in response to any conflict.
So at least Australia has had a comment on that, about which I am very pleased.
The other evening, I think some time last week, there was an interview on The 7.30 Report on the ABC with the wife of one of the soldiers. When you look at the level of individual human misery, it is simply unconscionable to allow those families, let alone the respective governments, to go on wondering what has happened to their soldiers.
The report of the UN Secretary-General on this matter says it has been the focus of further intense efforts made by the UN to handle these issues. It says:
Hizbullah publicly rejected the concept of an immediate and unconditional release of the two Israeli soldiers at an early stage ...
And they have continued to do that, which is a matter for great concern. On 17 April the UN Security Council noted the lack of progress. On 25 June 2007, as I said, an audio message was released from one of the soldiers. On 20 July 2007 Israel released 256 prisoners and negotiations were ongoing for the release of Hamas prisoners in exchange for the return of Shalit. On 25 August 2007, Khaled Mashaal, the exiled Hamas leader, said Shalit is alive and in good health, but the outgoing UN envoy for the Middle East peace process, Michael Williams, told the Security Council that Hezbollah had, after 20 meetings, rejected an Israeli offer for a prisoner exchange for Regev and Goldwasser. There had been no evidence that they were still alive. An Israeli report concluded that they had been ‘seriously wounded during their capture and at least one of them could now be dead’. That information came from a Reuters report of 29 August 2007.
The electorate in Victoria, for which I am patron senator, Melbourne Ports, has many families and Jewish organisations who are seriously interested in this case. Together with me, a senator, and others of goodwill, they are seriously asking our government and any international agencies to progress this case and find out the fate of the prisoners, whether they are still alive and when a release may be expected. As I said, it is bad enough at an international level but at an individual level wives and families of these soldiers are wondering what has happened to them after at least a year of captivity with no medical attention being instanced, no international visits being allowed and no bulletins on their condition. We have every right to be seriously worried and I think it is a case that needs our immediate attention.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Middle East</title>,Adjournment,21,1,speech
