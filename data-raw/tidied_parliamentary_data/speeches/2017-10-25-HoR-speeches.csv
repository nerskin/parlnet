3 MS SHARKIE: To move:


That this House:


(1) notes that:


(a) plastic bags are detrimental to the environment;


(b) Australians use an estimated 5 billion plastic bags a year, which represents over 20 million bags used every day;


(c) research has indicated that as of 2013, approximately 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic have been floating in our world's oceans—these are mostly microplastics of less than 5 millimetres in size and are regularly eaten by marine life, through which they enter the global food chain and are consumed by humans;


(d) thousands of marine mammals and seabirds die every year around the world as a result of plastic litter;


(e) plastic bags are particularly bad for the environment because they take from between 20 and 1,000 years to biodegrade and can travel long distances via air and water;


(f) South Australia led the nation with the phasing out of lightweight non-biodegradable plastic shopping bags, which state legislation defines as a carry bag, the body of which comprises (in whole or in part) polyethylene with a thickness of less than 35 microns and includes handles;


(g) South Australia's ban on plastic shopping bags came into force on 4 May 2009; and


(h) the South Australian Environmental Protection Authority estimates that the state's ban on plastic shopping bags has resulted in almost 400 million fewer plastic bags in that state each year; and


(2) calls on the:


(a) state governments yet to enact a ban on lightweight non-biodegradable plastic shopping bags to do so with speed and urgency; and


(b) Australian Government to work with the state Governments to implement a national ban on lightweight non-biodegradable plastic shopping bags by the end of 2018.

5 MR ALBANESE: To move:


That this House:


(1) declares:


(a) its support for the vital work performed each and every day by the highly trained professionals providing aviation rescue and fire fighting (ARFF) services to ensure the safety of the flying public;


(b) that the ARFF service is particularly important to the safe operation of airports in regional Australia where it also responds to non-aviation emergencies within its local communities; and


(c) that the presence of the ARFF service is key to safeguarding the safety and security at major metropolitan and regional airports around the country, which is critical for international and domestic tourism; and


(2) calls on the Government to reject any proposal to increase the threshold for the provision of ARFF services at airports from the existing 350,000 passenger movements annually, noting that this would preclude the establishment of these services at Proserpine Whitsunday Coast Airport and lead to the removal of these services from the following regional communities: Ballina; Coffs Harbour; Ayres Rock; Gladstone; Hamilton Island; Broome; Karratha; Newman; and Port Hedland.

6 MR VAN MANEN: To move:


That this House:


(1) recognises positive effect of the Government's measures to assist more hard working Australians to:


(a) earn more through the tax system, in particular by:


(i) legislating tax cuts for middle income earners to ensure they are not pushed into the second highest tax bracket;


(ii) introducing to Parliament the Enterprise Tax Plan, which will extend small business tax concessions to businesses up to $10 million from the outdated $2 million threshold; and


(iii) supporting employers to invest more, provide more hours and increase wages through a more competitive international tax rate;


(b) save more for their retirement through increased flexibility in the superannuation system, in particular by:


(i) abolishing the so called '10 per cent rule', which prevents anyone earning more than 10 per cent of their income from salary and wages from claiming a deduction for personal superannuation contributions; and


(ii) introducing catch up concessional contributions to provide assistance to those—particularly women—who have interrupted work patterns, whether to raise children, look after elderly parents, or seek to boost their retirement savings just before retirement; and


(2) notes with deep concern that the Opposition:


(a) refuses to support tax relief for small business, while at the same time advocating tax cuts for foreign workers;


(b) seeks to abolish measures to improve the retirement savings of hard working Australians, particularly those on low incomes and with interrupted work patterns; and


(c) has no plan for jobs and growth, despite having previously advocated for a more competitive tax rate for employers.

7 MS CLAYDON: To move:


That this House:


(1) notes that:


(a) one in three Australian women have experienced physical violence since the age of 15; and


(b) two thirds of women who experience violence are in paid employment;


(2) recognises that:


(a) family violence isolates and excludes its victims and disconnects people from community, work, education, friends and family;


(b) the trauma experienced by an employee facing family violence will be lessened if they have the support of an understanding and accommodating employer that offers domestic and family violence leave; and


(c) access to a leave specifically allocated for situations of domestic and family violence protects employees from discrimination and allows them to maintain stable employment which increases their likelihood of leaving violent relationships;


(3) commends the many private companies that already provide domestic and family violence leave, including Telstra, Virgin, Qantas, the National Australia Bank, to more than one million Australian workers;


(4) condemns the Government for its public service bargaining policy which has resulted in the removal of domestic and family violence leave provisions in some public service enterprise agreements; and


(5) calls on the Government to amend the National Employment Standards to include domestic and family violence leave as a universal workplace right.

8 MR ZIMMERMAN: To move:


That this House:


(1) notes the release on 5 October 2017 of the Consular State of Play 2016-17 (State of Play), which provides an overview of the Government's provision of consular assistance to Australians in the last financial year;


(2) acknowledges the hard work and dedication of Australian consular officials who have provided high-quality assistance to Australians in distress in 12,454 cases during 2016-17;


(3) notes with concern that a significant number of Australian travellers are travelling overseas without insurance;


(4) reiterates the Minister for Foreign Affairs' remarks in launching the State of Play that if travellers cannot afford travel insurance, they cannot afford to travel;


(5) acknowledges that the Australian Government will provide consular assistance where possible, while noting there are limits to what it can do to assist Australians in trouble overseas; and


(6) calls on Australians to:


(a) draw on resources such as Australian Government Smartraveller advice to inform themselves about their destination; and


(b) purchase insurance appropriate to their activities and circumstances.

6 MR VAN MANEN: To move:


That this House:


(1) recognises positive effect of the Government's measures to assist more hard working Australians to:


(a) earn more through the tax system, in particular by:


(i) legislating tax cuts for middle income earners to ensure they are not pushed into the second highest tax bracket;


(ii) introducing to Parliament the Enterprise Tax Plan, which will extend small business tax concessions to businesses up to $10 million from the outdated $2 million threshold; and


(iii) supporting employers to invest more, provide more hours and increase wages through a more competitive international tax rate;


(b) save more for their retirement through increased flexibility in the superannuation system, in particular by:


(i) abolishing the so called '10 per cent rule', which prevents anyone earning more than 10 per cent of their income from salary and wages from claiming a deduction for personal superannuation contributions; and


(ii) introducing catch up concessional contributions to provide assistance to those—particularly women—who have interrupted work patterns, whether to raise children, look after elderly parents, or seek to boost their retirement savings just before retirement; and


(2) notes with deep concern that the Opposition:


(a) refuses to support tax relief for small business, while at the same time advocating tax cuts for foreign workers;


(b) seeks to abolish measures to improve the retirement savings of hard working Australians, particularly those on low incomes and with interrupted work patterns; and


(c) has no plan for jobs and growth, despite having previously advocated for a more competitive tax rate for employers.

(2) recognises that:


(a) family violence isolates and excludes its victims and disconnects people from community, work, education, friends and family;


(b) the trauma experienced by an employee facing family violence will be lessened if they have the support of an understanding and accommodating employer that offers domestic and family violence leave; and


(c) access to a leave specifically allocated for situations of domestic and family violence protects employees from discrimination and allows them to maintain stable employment which increases their likelihood of leaving violent relationships;


(3) commends the many private companies that already provide domestic and family violence leave, including Telstra, Virgin, Qantas, the National Australia Bank, to more than one million Australian workers;


(4) condemns the Government for its public service bargaining policy which has resulted in the removal of domestic and family violence leave provisions in some public service enterprise agreements; and

Mr JOYCE
 (New England—Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources and Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (09:35):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


Agricultural chemicals and veterinary medicines—or agvet chemicals—are essential to our quality of life. We all know that these chemicals protect our crops and animals from pests and diseases, and underpin the productivity and competitiveness of Australia's farmers. However, agvet chemicals also have a range of other uses, including protecting our health, managing domestic pests and fulfilling consumer needs. Agvet chemicals are used to control vermin and pests in food premises, kill flies and mosquitoes around our houses, preserve timber, control fouling of boat hulls and keep our swimming pools safe. These chemicals are also vital for keeping our pets healthy and protecting our environment from invasive weeds and animals. The regulation of safe and effective agvet chemicals is therefore of interest to all Australians.


Through a cooperative scheme with the states and territories, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority—the APVMA—is the national regulator of agvet chemicals. The APVMA ensures that agvet chemicals used in Australia are safe for people, animals, plants and the environment.


Legislation underpinning the APVMA and agvet chemical regulation was developed in the early 1990s. A detailed review of the whole legislative framework is overdue. The government announced in April that it would undertake such a review and the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources is currently developing terms of reference for this important piece of work.


In the meantime, the chemical industry has made it clear that there are simple, non-controversial changes that could be done now that improve the efficiency of the regulator and increase the speed to which farmers can get access to safe effective chemicals. We are heeding these calls.


The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment (Operational Efficiency) Bill 2017 amends agvet chemical legislation to streamline industry reporting and support the operational efficiency of the APVMA. The bill also clarifies some ambiguities in the legislation and removes unnecessary and redundant provisions.


This bill reduces some of the unnecessary regulatory burden on industry by simplifying reporting requirements for chemical products. The amendments in the bill ensure that industry continues to provide necessary information about registered chemicals in the marketplace but reduces the time and effort that industry require to collect this information.


Essentially, the bill removes the need for industry to undertake two unrelated reporting activities—one for levies, based on chemical product sales, and a more complex reporting activity on active constituent quantities. It simplifies and aligns these reporting processes based on the quantity and value of product sales. This significantly reduces reporting costs for industry without compromising the availability of information for our international reporting obligations and policy development needs. The chemical industry has been seeking changes to the burdensome reporting requirements and the bill delivers these changes.


The role of the regulator is to ensure that the safe agvet chemicals we need are available in a timely fashion. The bill therefore includes measures to improve the administrative efficiency of the APVMA and promote quicker access to chemical products. The measures in the bill reduce the handling time for applications by increasing the APVMA's flexibility when dealing with errors in applications and for altering applications.


Other measures in the bill enable the holder of a label approval to vary a label approval while this approval is suspended. This removes an administrative barrier that currently prevents the holder from addressing the reasons for the suspension. This will ensure that the issue with a label approval that led to its suspension can be appropriately rectified at the holder's request.


To perform its role as a regulator the APVMA has to rely on information provided to it by applicants. The bill includes civil penalty provisions for providing false or misleading information. These provisions provide a broader suite of sanctions than currently available to the APVMA for dealing with any false or misleading information that may be provided to it. This is important as it will provide the APVMA with the necessary tools to proportionately respond to any false or misleading information it receives. Industry understands the importance of increasing the range of compliance options available to the APVMA.


Further measures in the bill clarify the meaning of the expiry date for a chemical product and allow applicants to address minor errors identified during preliminary assessment of an application, without having to go through the whole application process again.


Stakeholders have confirmed that the bill will deliver tangible benefits to industry and the regulator.


Collectively, the measures in the bill will reduce regulatory burden on industry and allow the regulator to be more efficient, while ensuring safe and effective agvet chemicals continue to be available to the community.


The government will continue to work with industry to implement further improvements to agvet chemicals regulation through future legislation and administrative reform.


I would also like to convey my deepest sympathies to and keep in my closest thoughts and prayers the family of Linda Burney.


Debate adjourned.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2017-10-25,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (09:46):  On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the committee's report entitled Report 467: Cybersecurity compliance: inquiry based on Auditor-General's report 42 (2016-17).


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Ms BRODTMANN:
  by leave—The release of the report into cybersecurity compliance by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit highlights the continuing negligence of the Turnbull government when it comes to ensuring our departments and agencies are safe from cyberattack. Since the creation of the cybersecurity portfolio in 2016, Labor has been consistently calling on the government to take this issue seriously. So far, the only thing the Turnbull government has done to fix this mess is send a letter to the heads of government agencies—a letter to each head of department asking them to please take cybersecurity 'very seriously'. This is pathetic and it's a serious concern for our national security.


When it was revealed in 2014 that not one of the seven departments investigated by the Australian National Audits Office was compliant with its cybersecurity requirements, action should have been taken then. Instead, here we are at the end of 2017 and all we can say definitively is that only one of those seven departments has met its security requirements—just one in 2017. The rest are all still at risk of serious cyberattacks and data breaches. This is simply unacceptable.


This issue has been ignored for far too long by the Turnbull government and action needs to be taken now. Deadlines need to be set and consequences need to be enforced for those who continue to ignore this threat. As we speak, large government departments such as the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection are still not compliant with their cybersecurity responsibilities—that's as we speak, right here and right now. We are talking about the systems and networks that collect and store personal information on every Australian citizen, that manage this country's most important public services and that protect this country's borders and run our national security operations.


The recommendations in this report are loud and clear: compliance with cybersecurity standards is not optional—it is not optional. As holders of detailed and sensitive information, all government departments must maintain a strong cybersecurity posture. There is simply no excuse for any department or agency to ignore mandated—and these are mandated—security requirements. And there is certainly no excuse for the Turnbull government to continue to ignore this problem. It cannot be tolerated. This blase approach to cybersecurity has got to stop; it has got to change.


This report reveals a long history of prolonged negligence and a lack of concern for the significant threat cyberattack poses. In October 2014, a public hearing was held to examine the disastrous findings earlier that year by the ANAO that not one of the departments that were investigated was cyber-resilient—not one in 2014.


Three of the seven audited entities—the Australian Taxation Office, the Department of Human Services and the then Australian Customs and Border Protection Service—appeared before the hearing to explain their plans and timetables to achieve compliance. They each gave assurances—big-time assurances—to the committee that compliance with the top four mitigation strategies would be achieved during 2016.


The follow-up report published in March this year revealed that, despite those assurances in 2016, only one department, the Department of Human Services, had met its mandated requirements—and I'm underscoring here 'mandated', because these are mandated cybersecurity requirements across government agencies. Only one federal government agency could be deemed cyber-resilient.


Both the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection failed to meet the requirements and achieve their own deadline for compliance. They failed to meet it in 2014, and they failed again in 2016. So far, the only consequences that have come from this repeated failure are a letter by the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Cyber Security asking government agencies to take cybersecurity 'very seriously', and that was almost a year ago.


It is simply unacceptable. The fact that only one out of three of the largest Australian government agencies is meeting its mandated cybersecurity requirements is absolutely shocking. This is a huge risk to our national security and it needs to be treated as such. Why is the government so blase about this? At a time when significant data breaches and cyberattacks are an almost daily occurrence, the revelation that our own government agencies are failing to meet basic, mandated standards should come as a wake-up call. It should be ringing alarm bells for the government.


Through its electronic lodgement systems, the Australian Taxation Office collects over $440 billion in gross tax revenue annually. The Department of Immigration and Border Protection electronically processes around seven million visas annually and inspects and examines around two million air and sea cargo imports and exports every year. The collection and storage of this and other personally identifiable data can be used to identify, contact, locate or impersonate an individual. It includes information such as birth dates, bank account details, driver's licence numbers, tax file numbers and biometric data. By failing to be cyber-resilient, these departments are putting this data at great risk, with potentially significant consequences for Australian citizens.


Each of the 10 recommendations in this report will ensure the cyber-resilience of government departments and agencies is brought up to speed, but only if they are actually adopted. These recommendations offer significant improvements including introducing tangible deadlines for compliance, updating the top four strategies to the newer and comprehensive Essential Eight cybersecurity strategies, annual audits reviewing departmental compliance with these requirements, mandating—and again I'm saying 'mandating' here, because we've had a mandated approach on this before, and I'm imploring the government to actually take this report seriously and make these government agencies comply with mandated requirements—that all agencies complete and return the annual ASD cybersecurity survey, and mandating the internet gateway reduction program to reduce the number of attack vectors into government systems.


On this last point, the internet gateway reduction program was started in 2009. It was meant to reduce the patchwork of over 120 different internet gateway services being used right across government, particularly in smaller agencies, down to a manageable and auditable eight. The program was designed to reduce the attack surface into government systems. Eight years on, this policy is still being sidestepped by many smaller agencies who are just choosing to ignore the problem. And what's the Turnbull government done to address this issue? Absolutely nothing.


Similarly, the Australian Signals Directorate sends out an annual cybersecurity survey to the heads of all major government agencies to assess their cyber risks. These surveys are rarely completed or sent back to the ASD, which has a significant impact on the ASD's ability to accurately assess the risk within these departments. As the report says:


The results of the ASD survey are reported to a secretaries' cyber security board, coordinated by PM&C—


the Prime Minister's own department.


The results of the surveys provide a list of high-risk entities, for which ASD can then focus its resources on assisting.


However—


remember, this is meant to be mandated—


the ASD has no capacity to compel agencies to complete the survey. For this year's survey, as at 23 June, fewer than 40 per cent of agencies had completed the survey. In 2016, fewer than 30 per cent completed the non-mandatory survey.


Absolutely appalling! So, as at 23 June, for this year's survey, less than 40 per cent had completed it; and, in 2016, fewer than 30 per cent. These surveys are a vital way of assessing whether government agencies are keeping up to date with their cybersecurity risks and threats, and the fact that they're just treated in such an arbitrary way is breathtaking. It's breathtaking.


There is a pattern of negligence here, of ignoring cybersecurity. The recommendations in this report seek to directly address these issues. They are proactive steps we must take to fixing this tick-box compliance culture, a culture that ignores responsibility and that gets away with it under this government. The Turnbull government must sit up and take notice of this report. It must adopt—it must, must adopt—the recommendations in it, and it must do so quickly. The recommendations it makes are urgently required to ensure our nation and our nation's data are safe and secure. We cannot afford to continue to turn a blind eye to cybersecurity, especially in our own government agencies and departments. Government agencies must be the standard against which others in the community measure themselves.


Cybersecurity is everyone's responsibility and none more so than the government and heads of government departments. It is not acceptable—it's simply not acceptable—for Australian government departments to just ignore their security requirements: 'All too hard; can't be bothered,' even though these are mandated requirements.


This government needs to start taking cybersecurity seriously, and I implore the Turnbull government to accept all the recommendations in this report, and I implore the Turnbull government to accept all the recommendations in this report today.


I move:


That the House take note of the report.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (09:58):  Given we're about to head into the summing up and then amendments and then votes on this bill, I just wanted to briefly place on the record that the member for Mayo intends to vote with the government on these bills but has requested, and I've agreed, that she and I would seek to be paired, effectively, on the votes; that I would be voting with the opposition on the amendments and the bill; and that she would be taken as voting with the government. This is, of course, an informal arrangement. Pairs are an informal arrangement, and reached as such, but they are usually between the government and the opposition, but, in this case, crossbenchers are having to do it ourselves. So I wanted to place on the record that that is our stance in relation to the amendments and these bills. I'm not sure of the process. I would hope that that could be recorded in some way, in the Hansard or in the Votes and Proceedings, but I just wanted to place that matter on the record. With respect to the substance of the issues, that is something that our portfolio holders will prosecute more fully when the matter comes to the Senate.

Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Treasurer) (10:00):  In summing up the debate I firstly thank all those members who have contributed to this debate. This is a very sensitive issue. Many members of this place have their own personal experience of either directly living with disability or having family members, friends or colleagues who are affected by disability. As I observed in this debate earlier, when introducing these bills, in my own case there is my brother-in-law Gary. It's understandable and it's appropriate that this House reflect on the personal experiences. I think it has been the deep personal commitment of people in this place on both sides of this House that led to the bipartisan introduction of the National Disability Insurance Scheme.


This House is committed to the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and what I've sought to do in this budget—what the government has sought to do in this budget—is to ensure that we can provide certainty for the National Disability Insurance Scheme by providing the funding that is needed to guarantee its future and to lock that funding up, to create a pipeline from the Medicare levy directly into the National Disability Insurance Scheme to ensure that never again, based on the forward program of the NDIS, should it be found wanting for funds.


These bills will secure the essential funding required for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, giving Australians with permanent and significant disability and their families and carers certainty that this vital service will be there for them into the future. A responsible government looks after those most in need, and everyone in this place knows that Australians with a disability deserve support to fully participate in the life of this nation, which is what the NDIS does. That is why we backed the establishment of the NDIS, so that individuals could get essential help based on their needs and not where they live.


It is one thing, however, to set up a scheme like the NDIS, but it is meaningless if it is not funded, if it's not secured, if it's not protected and if its funding is not protected into the future. Governments will lower taxes like the Turnbull government has and will continue to seek to do. Other governments, if they're elected, will raise taxes as Labor have done in the past. That's a matter for them. But, as a result of any of those general decisions taken on tax measures in this country, the National Disability Insurance Scheme should be unaffected by those decisions. The NDIS should have its own secure source of funding to provide for its future and its present, and the mechanism that we have sought to do that with is the Medicare levy and the measures that are proposed in this series of bills.


There's a fundamental difference between the Labor Party and the government when it comes to this issue. The Labor Party do not believe, despite all of the evidence, that there is a $55.7 billion hole in funding for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. They're wrong about that, and that has been demonstrated by the testimony and evidence of Treasury and others. It's clear there's a $55.7 billion hole in the funding for the NDIS. They claim there were savings that they spent four times, some of which never appeared and some of which they even voted against when we sought to take those savings through this House.


We endeavoured, prior to this budget, to secure savings that would have been put into a special-purpose account to ensure that that was a locked box for the funding of the NDIS. We sought to do it through savings. That was rejected by the Labor Party and it was rejected by the Senate. That's the will of the parliament. We accept that. We understand that. But what we can't walk back from is addressing the fundamental problem of the massive hole in funding for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. So we put forward in the budget a way to achieve that. It was a way that absolutely and completely mirrored the initial increase in the Medicare levy that the Labor Party had introduced when they were in government to contribute towards the funding costs of the NDIS. They had received the support of the opposition in the Liberal and National parties and they were able to move forward. We have simply brought through their exact same mechanism to deal with this problem, and we have not secured the support of the Labor Party to achieve that.


I give Julia Gillard credit for her significant role in introducing the National Disability Insurance Scheme—and she deserves it. I believe she should be disappointed by the behaviour of those who followed her, who could be acting to secure the future of the NDIS by supporting this bill. When she was Prime Minister she said:


… the Medicare levy does not pay for all our Medicare or health care expenditure but the fundamental principle of the Medicare levy is we all put in and we all take out …


She also said:


… it would be terrific to see the half a per cent increase in the Medicare levy pass with bipartisan support.


That would give security for the future around the half a per cent increase in the Medicare levy.


The former Treasurer, now the member for Lilley, said:


… we are asking Australians to make a small contribution that will make a big difference to the lives of over 460,000 people with disability …


When Labor were proposing exactly the same thing, the now Leader of the Opposition said:


These bills will change lives.


Change families.


Change the dimension of hope in every community.


No longer do we fill this place with empty rhetoric on this issue. We now put our money on the table. And we ask: what is the price of an ordinary life?


That is what the Leader of the Opposition said when, in government, he was supporting bills to do exactly this. What is the price of an ordinary life to the member for Maribyrnong? Well, he's clearly not prepared to stump up or take his party with him to live up to the ideals and standards that Julia Gillard, as Prime Minister, was able to draw from the Labor Party when she introduced this scheme and introduced as like a measure as you could find. And there's a reason for that, which is that they don't believe there's a funding hole. They want to live in budgetary denial, as they did in government, and just pretend the problem isn't there.


What I find quite puzzling about the Labor Party's position on this is: if they really think there's no funding hole with the NDIS, then why are they supporting the increase in the levy at all? As the shadow Treasurer said, if the Labor Party were in government, not one cent of the increase in the Medicare levy that they're prepared to support would go to funding the National Disability Insurance Scheme—not one cent. So why are they supporting that element of it? For them, it's just another tax. For them, it's just another impost on working Australians. I'm joined now by the member for Hughes, who has a deep personal understanding of this issue. For those on this side of the House it's an insurance levy to pay for an insurance scheme that makes a big difference to families and people living with disabilities in this country. That's the only reason we're doing it. If there were no funding hole, we would not be doing this. But we must do it; we must fill this hole. We must ensure that we live up to the principles of those who actually brought this scheme into this parliament and were able to achieve bipartisan support.


I believe the way the Labor Party have responded to this is a great disappointment. If there were any issue we could agree on, if there were any opportunity to actually reach across the aisle, surely it would be for this. Members of the opposition should be ashamed of the level of conflict-dominated politics they have pursued on this issue. If they didn't believe there was a funding hole, then why would they want to increase the Medicare levy at all? They are seeking to take the cynical opportunity of this bill to go and spend money on any number of other things that mount up day by day. They're not doing this—even one cent of it—to support those with disabilities. They're just doing it to fund their addiction to higher spending on anything that comes across their desk.


During the course of this debate, we heard some tremendous testimonies about the courage of Australians living with disabilities. The member for Ryan, the Assistant Minister for Social Services and Disability Services, spoke of the 11-year-old boy who as a result of his NDIS package has received consistent coordinated support. This means that his relationship with his family has improved, he is learning better and he has a real hope for an independent life. The member for Gilmore spoke of Brad Rossiter, who has prosthetic legs, as well as having kidney and pancreas transplants. He's an advocate for kidney health awareness and organ donation registration. He's an Australian hero!


The member for Brisbane spoke on Monday of the outstanding work of Youngcare, providing accommodation for young people so that they are not forced to live in aged-care facilities. We heard of people like Shevaune Conry, who has MS—like my brother-in-law Gary—and Nick, who is confined to a wheelchair, who now receive the care they need. Their quality of life has improved immeasurably through the work of Youngcare and the support of the NDIS.


I highlight them simply to make the point that it's not too late for the opposition to make the right choice—to back the government's plan to provide secure funding for the NDIS. The way this bill has been structured with the others is to ensure that the increase in the Medicare levy goes directly, and is secured, to support the NDIS. It can't be siphoned off; it can't be sent off to subsidise or pay for other adventures by the Labor Party. It's there for Shevaune, it's there for Brad, it's there for Gary and it's there for the many other Australians that each and every one of us in this House can name, whom we love and care for. We want to see them have a quality of life that is unimpeded by things that we can do something about through the NDIS.


But the NDIS is a hollow promise if it is not funded, and that's what these bills rightly seek to do. So I would encourage the Labor Party to at least put down this sword—at least this one—and join with the government to provide for every person with a disability and every carer, every friend, every colleague and every passing stranger who has walked past and offered some kindness or support to them, demonstrating their commitment to their fellow Australians who suffer with disabilities.

The NDIS was fully funded by Labor. Those who doubt this need only look to the DisabilityCare Australia document in the 2013-14 budget, page 4, which sets out the impact of private health insurance reforms, changes to tobacco excise and changes to import processing fees, among others. The question before the House is whether or not the exercise of budget repair should be done by slugging low- and middle-income earners or by reinstating the budget repair levy. As the Leader of the Opposition noted in the budget reply, Labor won't be supporting an increase in the Medicare levy for those with taxable incomes below $87,000. But, by reinstating the budget repair levy, our position leaves the budget more than $4 billion better off over the medium term.


The Treasurer asks: why is more revenue required? Anyone who did their tax return early will know the answer to that because they would have seen on their tax receipt that gross debt has now crashed through the half-trillion-dollar mark. The question is whether we tackle the challenge of debt in Australia by slugging the middle or by raising taxes on the top. The Treasurer said in July that inequality has 'actually gotten better'. But as the late professor-turned-politician Daniel Patrick Moynihan said, 'You are entitled to your own opinion, but you are not entitled to your own facts.'


Let's just run through a few facts on inequality. Since 1975, real wages have grown 72 per cent for the top 10th and 23 per cent for the bottom 10th, meaning that the top 10th of earners earned twice as much as the bottom 10th in 1975 and nearly three times as much in 2014. The labour income share in the economy has fallen from 75 per cent in 1975 to 60 per cent today. The Treasurer said his preferred measure of inequality is the Gini coefficient. According to the Australian National University's Peter Whiteford, the Gini in 1981-82 was 0.27 and by 2013-14 was either 0.30 or 0.33. My own work on pre-tax male Gini coefficients again suggests a significant rise from 1942 to 2010. The top one per cent share of national income has almost doubled since 1980. The top 10 per cent income share has increased by a quarter. Wealth inequality has risen significantly over the course of the last generation. There has been an unambiguous rise in Australian inequality. As Roger Wilkins of the Melbourne Institute summed it up to me recently, 'Inequality is currently high by modern Australian historical standards.'


We see now from the coalition a plan to increase taxes so that a worker on $55,000 would pay $275 extra a year in tax while somebody on $80,000 would face an extra $400 in tax—effectively, a tax rise that would wipe out the benefit of last year's sandwich-and-milkshake tax cut for a worker earning $85,000 a year. Parliamentary Budget Office analysis shows that the average tax rate for individuals in every quintile will increase from 2017-18 to 2020-21, but the largest increase in average tax rates is for people in the middle income quintile under the changes proposed by this government. The Parliamentary Budget Office specifically states:


… average tax rates are projected to increase due to policy changes, most notably the policy decision to increase the Medicare levy from 2019/20.


This statement clearly disproves the Treasurer's claim that he is reducing taxes.


At a time when we have earnings inequality up, when the labour's share is the lowest in a generation, when income inequality by the Gini coefficient has risen and when wealth inequality is up, we have a government that wants to increase average taxes for those in the middle income quintile by 3.2 percentage points, significantly higher than the two-percentage-point increase for people in the top quintile. That would increase average tax rates on middle-income earners to 20-plus-year highs, according to the Parliamentary Budget Office. Labor's plan raises more for the budget over the medium term—an excess of $4 billion more. Most importantly, it tackles the challenge of rising inequality. It just isn't fair, with inequality as high as it's been in three-quarters of a century, to be slugging the middle and letting the top off scot free.

Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Treasurer) (10:33):  The amendment that is put forward by the opposition is not supported by the government. I'm a little puzzled as to why the shadow Treasurer hasn't come in to speak to his own amendments and has delegated this duty. If he really wants to own these, he should actually come in here and put his reasons for them rather than delegating it to the intern to go and put these issues forward in this place.


To deal with what has been put forward, the shadow assistant minister has just exposed the Labor Party on this issue. He says there's no funding gap on the NDIS—which is wrong, by the way; the budget papers clearly demonstrate a $55.7 billion funding hole. But the Labor Party have just said clearly here that there is no need to raise additional revenue to support the NDIS. So they are using people's disabilities as an excuse to raise levies on the Australian public. They have just admitted to this. I mean, if it weren't obscene enough that they couldn't live up to their own principles, as ordinary as they were, when they were in government, they now come in here and use people's disabilities to whack up levies on the Australian public. They don't believe it is necessary to raise additional revenue to support the NDIS.


So what is the purpose? He says it's to reduce the debt. He says it's to reduce the deficit. Under the Labor Party's election policies at the last election, the deficit was higher. Their position is to have a higher deficit. They're not reducing debt as a result of this; they're just spending even more money on things they don't have the courage to come in here and explain to the Australian people: why they want to increase the levy.


I'm going to be straight with the Australian people: we need to increase the Medicare levy by half a per cent to make sure that the National Disability Insurance Scheme is fully funded. Australians are fair-minded people. They understand that if you're unfortunate enough to have been born with a disability, that in this country you should be given every opportunity to realise your potential—just like any other Australian. I don't think there's an Australian in this country who doesn't think that's a fair thing and who isn't prepared to put their bit in, to put their fair share in, to make sure that all can benefit, particularly when they themselves might be in a position where they have to draw on that. The lack of faith shown by the Labor Party in the Australian people and their sense of fairness on this issue is abysmal, and they should be ashamed of themselves.


We understand that Australians would be prepared to step up for people with disabilities. The Labor Party used to think that; they are just using people's disabilities as an excuse to raise levies.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Rob Mitchell

Ms Catherine King:
  Imputation of members, Mr Deputy Speaker. That was an outrageous thing you just said: withdraw it!




Mr MORRISON:
  I won't withdraw it, Mr Deputy Speaker. I won't withdraw it, because it's a fact—




Ms Catherine King:

The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  You have been asked to withdraw—




Mr MORRISON:
  I won't withdraw it, Mr Deputy Speaker!




Ms Catherine King:
  Then throw him out, Mr Deputy Speaker!




Mr MORRISON:
  I won't withdraw.




Ms Catherine King:
  You've been asked by the Speaker to withdraw—




Mr MORRISON:
  I haven't actually, you've asked me!



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I just said that I'll ask you to withdraw that. I don't think that's appropriate—




Mr MORRISON:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I withdraw. Let me rephrase: the Labor Party has said clearly that this levy does not need to be raised to fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme. That's what the shadow assistant minister at the table has said. What is then the purpose of raising this levy? It has been done under the guise—the truth on the government's part—to pay for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Those opposite do not support that purpose for this levy, but they want to increase the levy anyway. They're doing it in a bill that is designed to help people with disabilities, but they have no intention to use the money to help people with disabilities. So the glass jaw of the opposition on this has just been demonstrated and they have been called out.


But on top of that, it's bad tax policy. The effective marginal rate of tax that applies to how they propose to deliver this in their amendment would mean that in the absence of phasing arrangements a taxpayer might incur an additional tax liability of $435.39 on the first $1 earned above $87,000. That is an effective marginal tax rate of 43,539 per cent. It's a daft idea in the practice of policy, and it's a heartless idea in the absence of morality on the part of the Labor Party.



The SPEAKER:  The question is that the amendments be agreed to.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (09:58):  Given we're about to head into the summing up and then amendments and then votes on this bill, I just wanted to briefly place on the record that the member for Mayo intends to vote with the government on these bills but has requested, and I've agreed, that she and I would seek to be paired, effectively, on the votes; that I would be voting with the opposition on the amendments and the bill; and that she would be taken as voting with the government. This is, of course, an informal arrangement. Pairs are an informal arrangement, and reached as such, but they are usually between the government and the opposition, but, in this case, crossbenchers are having to do it ourselves. So I wanted to place on the record that that is our stance in relation to the amendments and these bills. I'm not sure of the process. I would hope that that could be recorded in some way, in the Hansard or in the Votes and Proceedings, but I just wanted to place that matter on the record. With respect to the substance of the issues, that is something that our portfolio holders will prosecute more fully when the matter comes to the Senate.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,5,2,speech
"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2017-10-25,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Treasurer) (10:00):  In summing up the debate I firstly thank all those members who have contributed to this debate. This is a very sensitive issue. Many members of this place have their own personal experience of either directly living with disability or having family members, friends or colleagues who are affected by disability. As I observed in this debate earlier, when introducing these bills, in my own case there is my brother-in-law Gary. It's understandable and it's appropriate that this House reflect on the personal experiences. I think it has been the deep personal commitment of people in this place on both sides of this House that led to the bipartisan introduction of the National Disability Insurance Scheme.


This House is committed to the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and what I've sought to do in this budget—what the government has sought to do in this budget—is to ensure that we can provide certainty for the National Disability Insurance Scheme by providing the funding that is needed to guarantee its future and to lock that funding up, to create a pipeline from the Medicare levy directly into the National Disability Insurance Scheme to ensure that never again, based on the forward program of the NDIS, should it be found wanting for funds.


These bills will secure the essential funding required for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, giving Australians with permanent and significant disability and their families and carers certainty that this vital service will be there for them into the future. A responsible government looks after those most in need, and everyone in this place knows that Australians with a disability deserve support to fully participate in the life of this nation, which is what the NDIS does. That is why we backed the establishment of the NDIS, so that individuals could get essential help based on their needs and not where they live.


It is one thing, however, to set up a scheme like the NDIS, but it is meaningless if it is not funded, if it's not secured, if it's not protected and if its funding is not protected into the future. Governments will lower taxes like the Turnbull government has and will continue to seek to do. Other governments, if they're elected, will raise taxes as Labor have done in the past. That's a matter for them. But, as a result of any of those general decisions taken on tax measures in this country, the National Disability Insurance Scheme should be unaffected by those decisions. The NDIS should have its own secure source of funding to provide for its future and its present, and the mechanism that we have sought to do that with is the Medicare levy and the measures that are proposed in this series of bills.


There's a fundamental difference between the Labor Party and the government when it comes to this issue. The Labor Party do not believe, despite all of the evidence, that there is a $55.7 billion hole in funding for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. They're wrong about that, and that has been demonstrated by the testimony and evidence of Treasury and others. It's clear there's a $55.7 billion hole in the funding for the NDIS. They claim there were savings that they spent four times, some of which never appeared and some of which they even voted against when we sought to take those savings through this House.


We endeavoured, prior to this budget, to secure savings that would have been put into a special-purpose account to ensure that that was a locked box for the funding of the NDIS. We sought to do it through savings. That was rejected by the Labor Party and it was rejected by the Senate. That's the will of the parliament. We accept that. We understand that. But what we can't walk back from is addressing the fundamental problem of the massive hole in funding for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. So we put forward in the budget a way to achieve that. It was a way that absolutely and completely mirrored the initial increase in the Medicare levy that the Labor Party had introduced when they were in government to contribute towards the funding costs of the NDIS. They had received the support of the opposition in the Liberal and National parties and they were able to move forward. We have simply brought through their exact same mechanism to deal with this problem, and we have not secured the support of the Labor Party to achieve that.


I give Julia Gillard credit for her significant role in introducing the National Disability Insurance Scheme—and she deserves it. I believe she should be disappointed by the behaviour of those who followed her, who could be acting to secure the future of the NDIS by supporting this bill. When she was Prime Minister she said:


… the Medicare levy does not pay for all our Medicare or health care expenditure but the fundamental principle of the Medicare levy is we all put in and we all take out …


She also said:


… it would be terrific to see the half a per cent increase in the Medicare levy pass with bipartisan support.


That would give security for the future around the half a per cent increase in the Medicare levy.


The former Treasurer, now the member for Lilley, said:


… we are asking Australians to make a small contribution that will make a big difference to the lives of over 460,000 people with disability …


When Labor were proposing exactly the same thing, the now Leader of the Opposition said:


These bills will change lives.


Change families.


Change the dimension of hope in every community.


No longer do we fill this place with empty rhetoric on this issue. We now put our money on the table. And we ask: what is the price of an ordinary life?


That is what the Leader of the Opposition said when, in government, he was supporting bills to do exactly this. What is the price of an ordinary life to the member for Maribyrnong? Well, he's clearly not prepared to stump up or take his party with him to live up to the ideals and standards that Julia Gillard, as Prime Minister, was able to draw from the Labor Party when she introduced this scheme and introduced as like a measure as you could find. And there's a reason for that, which is that they don't believe there's a funding hole. They want to live in budgetary denial, as they did in government, and just pretend the problem isn't there.


What I find quite puzzling about the Labor Party's position on this is: if they really think there's no funding hole with the NDIS, then why are they supporting the increase in the levy at all? As the shadow Treasurer said, if the Labor Party were in government, not one cent of the increase in the Medicare levy that they're prepared to support would go to funding the National Disability Insurance Scheme—not one cent. So why are they supporting that element of it? For them, it's just another tax. For them, it's just another impost on working Australians. I'm joined now by the member for Hughes, who has a deep personal understanding of this issue. For those on this side of the House it's an insurance levy to pay for an insurance scheme that makes a big difference to families and people living with disabilities in this country. That's the only reason we're doing it. If there were no funding hole, we would not be doing this. But we must do it; we must fill this hole. We must ensure that we live up to the principles of those who actually brought this scheme into this parliament and were able to achieve bipartisan support.


I believe the way the Labor Party have responded to this is a great disappointment. If there were any issue we could agree on, if there were any opportunity to actually reach across the aisle, surely it would be for this. Members of the opposition should be ashamed of the level of conflict-dominated politics they have pursued on this issue. If they didn't believe there was a funding hole, then why would they want to increase the Medicare levy at all? They are seeking to take the cynical opportunity of this bill to go and spend money on any number of other things that mount up day by day. They're not doing this—even one cent of it—to support those with disabilities. They're just doing it to fund their addiction to higher spending on anything that comes across their desk.


During the course of this debate, we heard some tremendous testimonies about the courage of Australians living with disabilities. The member for Ryan, the Assistant Minister for Social Services and Disability Services, spoke of the 11-year-old boy who as a result of his NDIS package has received consistent coordinated support. This means that his relationship with his family has improved, he is learning better and he has a real hope for an independent life. The member for Gilmore spoke of Brad Rossiter, who has prosthetic legs, as well as having kidney and pancreas transplants. He's an advocate for kidney health awareness and organ donation registration. He's an Australian hero!


The member for Brisbane spoke on Monday of the outstanding work of Youngcare, providing accommodation for young people so that they are not forced to live in aged-care facilities. We heard of people like Shevaune Conry, who has MS—like my brother-in-law Gary—and Nick, who is confined to a wheelchair, who now receive the care they need. Their quality of life has improved immeasurably through the work of Youngcare and the support of the NDIS.


I highlight them simply to make the point that it's not too late for the opposition to make the right choice—to back the government's plan to provide secure funding for the NDIS. The way this bill has been structured with the others is to ensure that the increase in the Medicare levy goes directly, and is secured, to support the NDIS. It can't be siphoned off; it can't be sent off to subsidise or pay for other adventures by the Labor Party. It's there for Shevaune, it's there for Brad, it's there for Gary and it's there for the many other Australians that each and every one of us in this House can name, whom we love and care for. We want to see them have a quality of life that is unimpeded by things that we can do something about through the NDIS.


But the NDIS is a hollow promise if it is not funded, and that's what these bills rightly seek to do. So I would encourage the Labor Party to at least put down this sword—at least this one—and join with the government to provide for every person with a disability and every carer, every friend, every colleague and every passing stranger who has walked past and offered some kindness or support to them, demonstrating their commitment to their fellow Australians who suffer with disabilities. Get on board with this; put an end to the mindless opposition to this for political purposes.

 (Griffith) (13:30):  The 26th of October is Intersex Awareness Day. It's very important that we observe this day, because there is a lack of understanding of people with intersex conditions in the community. And those organisations that represent people with intersex conditions have made it a mission of theirs to improve visibility for people who are born with intersex conditions. This parliament should take an interest in improving that visibility, so I want to extend my congratulations to the LGBTIQ Friendship Group for hosting the first ever parliamentary intersex-specific event last week. In particular, I want to acknowledge the Labor chair, the member for Moreton, Graham Perrett. And there are other parties that have chairs, and they have done an excellent job of bringing this group together.


In fact, a couple of my constituents spoke at the breakfast. One of them, Alex, has been instrumental in getting the Story Bridge and Victoria Bridge lit up in purple and yellow for Intersex Awareness Day. I thank Alex very much. I also acknowledge Cody, Morgan, Bonnie and Tony, who were kind enough to come to the breakfast and talk to us about some of the issues facing people born with intersex conditions and their parents, who are often confronted with something they don't understand—whether it's a physical condition or different forms of chromosomes. This can be quite confronting for a parent and for a young person as well. (Time expired)

As Jenny Macklin and I were speaking to her last night, the grief was terrible. Losing a child is every parent's nightmare. It is, as Shakespeare once said, a grief that fills up the room. We know how much Linda loved her son and we know how much her son loved Linda.


In this time of deep sadness, can I please request that the media respect her family's privacy, and I know that they will. And I should add that the family have asked that, instead of flowers, if people are so inclined, could they please contribute to the Central Coast Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Centre.

 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (14:04):  My question is to the Prime Minister. Yesterday it was revealed that the Federal Police did not have the resources to investigate the importation of 1.6 tonnes of cocaine, but on the very same day the Prime Minister's Registered Organisations Commission sent at least 25 AFP officers to look at a 10-year-old donation to GetUp!

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2017-10-25,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Prime Minister) (14:05):  The Leader of the Opposition talked about a 10-year-old donation. Is he suggesting that breaches of the law and breaches of union rules should not be investigated because they're 10 years old? That would be very convenient for the Leader of the Opposition. That would, indeed, be very convenient for the Leader of the Opposition. What we have seen from the Labor Party since that search warrant was executed is an attack on the integrity of the Australian Federal Police. This is what they know as well as we all do: the Australian Federal Police are absolutely independent in their operations. They decide who to investigate and how to investigate. That is a matter for them and so it should be. But we heard yesterday the member for Gorton say: 'The government is using the power of the state to attack its political opponents. The Prime Minister is willing to use the police like his plaything.' They are accusing the Federal Police of acting on political direction. That's what they're doing. It is very, very familiar rhetoric because this is exactly what John Setka said in that notorious speech in Melbourne when he accused the Federal Police of being a political police force and of being political henchmen of the government.


The reality is this: the Labor Party do not respect the integrity of the Federal Police. They are all too ready—



Ms Catherine King interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Ballarat is warned!




Mr TURNBULL:
  to accuse them of being a political police force. And, absent a few four-letter words, there is nothing in substance that differs from what the member for Gorton said yesterday and what John Setka said on his platform in Melbourne—the same denial of the rule of law; the same contempt for the rule of law; the same contempt for the independence of the police. 


The question for the Leader of the Opposition is not just why the AWU gave $100,000 to an organisation whose principal objective seems to be shutting down industries in which members of the AWU work but also why he has not apologised for and disowned the outrageous attacks on the independence and the integrity of the men and women that keep us safe.

(1) notes:


(a) yesterday, it was revealed the Australian Federal Police (AFP) did not have the resources to investigate the importation of 1.6 tonnes of cocaine;


(b) on the very same day, the Prime Minister’s Registered Organisations Commission sent at least 25 AFP officers to look at a 10-year-old donation to GetUp;


(c) in so doing, this Government diverted police resources needed to fight drug syndicates to protect his own political interests; and


(d) that this is just the latest example of this Prime Minister’s willingness to abuse his power and debase the Office of Prime Minister; and


(2) therefore, condemns this born-to-rule Prime Minister for his grubby attacks and blatant abuses of power designed to protect his own political interests instead of protecting Australians.


We have full respect for the integrity of the AFP, but no respect for the integrity of those opposite.

"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2017-10-25,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (15:20):  As the government continues its obsession with witch-hunts and with taxpayer-funded smear campaigns, there are big issues that the government should be addressing in this House and should be addressing when it comes to policy. Economic growth is very important amongst them. We've had 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth, which is a great achievement for Australia. We on this side of the House know that this economic growth has lifted people out of poverty and turned aspiration into reality, and driving economic growth is part of our mission in public life, because we want to see people move from poverty into better circumstances and we want to see aspiration return to reality. That's why this side of the House, the Labor Party, engaged in those reforms of the 1980s and 1990s to see those 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth. That's why this side of the House kept Australia out of recession in the face of the most difficult economic circumstances that had been faced in 70 years, under the treasurership of the member for Lilley. That's what we believe in: economic growth. That's what drives our economic policy.


We know also that that growth needs to be inclusive, and I was glad to see the Productivity Commission this week agree. The Productivity Commission said in their report on economic growth:


A key issue will be to ensure that future economic, social and environmental policies sustain inclusive growth …



Opposition members:  Hear, hear!




Mr BOWEN:
  'Hear, hear,' this side of the House said. That sits well with this side of the House. It doesn't sit so well with those opposite, because they don't know what it means. When we say they don't know what it means, we mean it, because they say they don't know what it means. Just last week, the member for Jagajaga was talking about inclusive growth and she said:


We need social investment in our people and in health and education, inclusive growth …


Did the other side say, 'Hear, hear'? No. The member for Mitchell said, 'What does that even mean?' He didn't know what inclusive growth meant. For the benefit of the House, we'll explain it. Inclusive growth means ensuring that every Australian, regardless of their background, regardless of their educational experience and regardless of their parents' wealth, is able to contribute to that growth, is invested in to grow to their full potential and is included in the benefits of that growth. To spell it out, that's what inclusive growth means.


We on this side of the House have understood that. We've understood that for a long time. In 2008, the Labor government ensured that investment in our people, human capital, was at the centre of the COAG Reform Agenda. We wrote it in. We got the agreement of the states. The other side of the House came to office and ripped that up in that document which is known as the 2014 budget. They ripped into health, ripped into education and ripped into investments in our people. That's what that side of the House believe in. What we had is five wasted years when it comes to growth which includes all Australians.


We've seen this week the Productivity Commission report. It's a lengthy report, a substantial report. It was best summed up, perhaps, by Phil Coorey on the front page of the Financial Review this week. He said:


The report and speech will more closely mimic Labor's inclusive growth strategy, which is based on a smarter, healthier population.


We're happy to lead the debate. We're happy to set the agenda. We thought, 'Well, maybe this is an opportunity for the government to finally get it, to get the message and to understand what inclusive growth looks like.' I listened to what the Treasurer had to say in response to the Productivity Commission inquiry. He went out and he made a speech, and what was his big message out of the Productivity Commission inquiry? What was the big message that he took away that was going to influence government policy?


 He said, 'This makes us even more determined to pass our corporate tax cuts'—inclusive trickle-down from the Treasurer! I thought: 'Maybe I've missed something. I'll go and double-check the report to find where the report recommends $65 billion be spent on corporate tax cuts.' Well, they go to tax. They talk about land tax. They talk about stamp duty. They talk about alcohol tax. There are 28 recommendations, but not one of them says to cut corporate tax. Not one of them in this Productivity Commission review says we should cut corporate tax.


What we know from the government and their plans is that they intend to have a $65 billion hit to the budget bottom line over the next decade. That is their one trick. That $65 billion is the one bullet they have in their locker. It's not even as if the government actually believe in lower tax. No, they don't believe in lower tax; they believe in different tax. They don't believe in shrinking tax; they believe in changing tax. To give them their credit, they're very happy on the government benches today because they just passed through this House a $44 billion tax rise on working Australians. They are very pleased. Who's paying that tax rise? Every Australian who earns more than the princely sum of $21,000 a year. They're the people who will pay more tax as the government reduce corporate tax. They are shifting the burden onto every Australian.


This comes at a time when many of those same Australians who are earning low and middle incomes are getting a cut to their wages because they work on the weekend. It comes at the same time as they are dealing with record-low wages growth. It comes at the same time as they're dealing with a massive increase in electricity prices as confirmed today in the inflation figures. And the government say, 'You should be grateful because we're going to get you a 50c-a-week saving.' That's what they get at the same time as people will pay more through the increase in tax. A person on $55,000 a year will pay an extra $275 in tax. A person on $80,000 will pay $400 a year. The Treasurer likes to boast about the tax cuts he introduced last year. Somebody on $85,000 would have been better off if he did absolutely nothing. This is their idea of inclusive growth.


And all this means that their big plan, paid for by Australian workers—well, almost paid for, because the tax cut costs $65 billion and the Medicare levy raises $44 billion, so they've still got a gap—is shifting the tax burden all for the sake of growing our economy by one per cent in 20 years time. That's their big plan. The same plan will increase wages by $2 a day in 20 years time. That's what they've got.


There's a better way: investing in schools and investing in vocational education and training, which was the centrepiece of the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply. And we see this in this Productivity Commission report. You look through this report, and you see recommendations which go to health and education. You see the Productivity Commission say:


Health inequalities and educational underperformance present big opportunities for Australia.


We get it. We know that, if you have a better and fairer school-funding model, you're actually investing in Australians regardless of where they live, regardless of how wealthy their parents are, and we want them included. We want them included in contributing to the growth. We want them included in benefiting from the growth. We want their contribution, and we want them to benefit from our economic growth going forward. You don't get that from a $65 billion trickle-down tax cut. You get that from investing in people. You get that from investing in vocational education and training, lifelong learning, helping Australians build their skills and adapt to the changing workforce. That is the first priority when it comes to vocational education and training.


The economy is changing and changing rapidly. We want to give Australians the skills they need to prosper, not to suffer, in that changing economy. In regional economies in Central and North Queensland, in South Australia and Tasmania, we want them benefiting from that economic growth. We want them contributing to it and benefiting from it. Does the government $65 billion tax cut do that? No, and neither does the Medicare levy increase do that. Neither of those plans involves inclusive growth. You can't deliver inclusive growth if you don't know what it is, if you don't understand what it means, if you just don't get it as a concept, as a principle. I feel sorry for some members of the government; they don't understand what inclusive growth is. Well, I'll tell you what inclusive growth looks like: it looks like growth delivered by a reforming Labor government, a government which is actually prepared to make difficult decisions and lead the reform debate from opposition and then from government. We have a government that is out of touch and out of puff, a government that is born to rule, a government that doesn't believe in inclusive growth, a government that will be replaced at the next election.

"Sukkar, Michael, MP",LP,2017-10-25,"



Mr SUKKAR
 (Deakin—Assistant Minister to the Treasurer) (15:30):  I'm not sure who to believe—the shadow Treasurer who was just at the dispatch box or the Chris Bowen who wrote Hearts & Minds: A Blueprint for Modern Labor, in which he spoke eloquently about corporate tax cuts. I don't think I believe either of them. We've got to remember that this shadow Treasurer was the worst immigration minister this country has ever seen—25,000 people arrived on his watch. This is the man whose great idea was Cash for Clunkers, that absolutely outstanding piece—



An opposition member interjecting—




Mr SUKKAR:
  It was his idea! It was a great idea—I don't think it ever happened! What about Fuelwatch? Whatever happened to Fuelwatch? But what happens in the Labor Party when you're the worst immigration minister this country has ever seen and you come up with absolutely crazy schemes like Fuelwatch? You get a promotion.


But to be a bit more serious about the substance of this MPI: the Labor Party take growth for granted; that's the problem. They think there is a God-given right for this country to have growth, that we don't have to work hard for it and that the government doesn't have to put in place policies that encourage growth. This is the position of Labor. I feel for the shadow Treasurer. I suspect he's a patriot, but every time good economic data comes out, he goes hiding. He can't speak about it. It's almost as though he's desperate for some bad economic data—and it's not coming. In the last 12 months, jobs have grown by 371,000. In the last 12 months, 371,000 Australians have found a job. Importantly, when we talk about inclusive growth—so called—315,000 of those 370,000 jobs are full-time jobs. A job is what gives people the best start they can possibly have in life. The Labor Party think you can take growth for granted. They think that we have a God-given right to all of the investment that creates those jobs without doing any of the hard work to make it happen.


The Labor Party think that those in small business just open the shop and the customers just roll in and the profits just roll in. Otherwise, how could you explain why Labor believes that a small business with a turnover of just over $2 million should be treated the same as Apple and Google and be denied a tax cut? In a number of interviews on television today, we saw Labor MPs evading questions about what they will do with these small business tax cuts. I think we know what it means. It means that, if a Labor government were elected, small businesses would pay higher taxes. According to the Labor Party, small businesses are doing it easy. Well, I can tell the shadow Treasurer, I can tell the Labor Party, that small family businesses fight for every single dollar of profit. Small businesses pay the rent first, the employees second, the suppliers third and the tax fourth. They pay themselves last. So, when we can give them a tax cut, hopefully they can invest and grow that business. We know that a lot of the jobs growth I have spoken about here—the 371,000 jobs in the last 12 months—has come from the small to medium enterprise sector. This is the place that is creating opportunity for Australians. These are the sorts of businesses that create the growth, the inclusive growth, that the shadow Treasurer talks about.


Words are cheap. Words are absolutely cheap. You've got to do the hard work to encourage small businesses and encourage Australians to create the economic growth that can deliver these opportunities. We can't take it for granted, and the Labor Party thinks we can. Yes, we've had 26 years of uninterrupted growth, and 17 of those years were stewarded by coalition governments. We've got a shadow Treasurer who often evokes the memories of Keating and Hawke. In fact, he jumped the shark by evoking John Howard a few months ago. John Howard's not as charitable about you as you are about him. The legacy that you are claiming is one that you are completely repudiating. The legacy that you are supposedly proud of, you are completely repudiating. You have now gone back to a pre-Hawke-Keating era of thinking that says, 'You encourage more investment and therefore create more wealth for Australians and therefore create more opportunities for Australians by having a higher corporate tax rate than our competitors.' That is plainly wrong. Page 63 of this fantastic book, Hearts & Minds: A Blueprint for Modern Labor actually says it. There's a very big heading here. It's in bold. It's not a particularly lengthy tome, but there's a bold heading here: 'Promoting growth through cutting company tax'.




Mr Husic:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I'm loath to interrupt, but he's reading from a document. I'm wondering if he could table the book. It's a good book.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Coulton
):  There is no point of order. The member for Chifley will resume his seat. I give the call to the assistant minister.




Mr SUKKAR:
  I say to the honourable member: it's pretty easy to get your hands on one of these. They're only a couple of bucks, just in the bargain bin at the front of bookstores. They're not that hard to find.


'Promoting growth through cutting company tax'. What has happened between then and now? I think I know what's happened between then and now. Bill Shorten's become leader of the party, and the Left is large and in charge of the Labor Party. What is sad is that someone like the shadow Treasurer has not been able to stand up to them—someone like the shadow Treasurer, who evokes the memories of Hawke and Keating, who cut company taxes, is now someone who wants higher company taxes and higher taxes on small family businesses. This is a man who wants small businesses with a turnover between $2 million and $10 million to be denied tax cuts and be denied the ability to access concessions like the instant asset write-off. They are not rich people. They are not Apple and Google. They are small businesses that might have one, two or three employees; small businesses that treat their employees more like family members than employees. But he wants to deny them a tax cut. He hurts not only those small businesses but also their employees, because, if those small businesses are doing it tough, then it's harder to provide the opportunities for inclusive growth that he talks about.


Speaking of growth, in the last quarter we had growth at 0.8 per cent in one quarter. It must be hard, it must be tough, as someone in the role of shadow Treasurer. Every time some good economic data comes out, he is torn. I'm sure that, as a patriot, he thinks this is great for the country—good on the coalition government for delivering 0.8 per cent growth—but he's torn. He can't say it. It must be a very difficult position to be in.


We've also seen the dividends for the government, and we've seen dividends for the country due to the encouragement of growth under this government. We saw the final budget figures come in at $4.4 billion better than expected. This is very important. This is the first time since the last Costello budget, the last coalition government budget before the rabble of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government, where we've exceeded expectations, and this was delivered under Treasurer Morrison's watch. We have exceeded expectations. It's very important because, unlike the Labor Party, we underpromise and overdeliver. That is what that shows.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr SUKKAR:
  The Labor Party might think that $4.4 billion is a trifling amount worth laughing at, but we think that is extraordinarily important and absolutely telling. The economy is seeing growth and strength in a way that we have not seen since the Howard and Costello government. But we've got a lot more to do and we cannot take it for granted. The Labor Party thinks we can take it for granted and thinks that we can tax our way to prosperity. It's false. I say to the shadow Treasurer: we don't want you bringing what you brought to the immigration portfolio in government to this debate. (Time expired)

"Bird, Sharon, MP",ALP,2017-10-25,"



Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (15:40):  I thank the assistant minister for his dissertation on growth. I would suggest there's a lot of content in that that's debatable. He seems to have forgotten the bit that's called inclusive growth, so I'd encourage him to have a bit of a look at some of the other economic outcomes that are currently facing this country that might enlighten him around issues such as stagnant wages growth. In the last two hours or so we've had a really interesting indication of where exactly those opposite are on inclusive growth. Perhaps the shadow Treasurer could follow up his book with 'Inclusive Growth for Dummies'. Since those opposite seem to be keen to buy his books, I think that would be a particularly useful addition.


Just before question time, we had the most astonishing performance by the member for Corangamite, who wanted to lecture us on this side for having some concerns about a senior member of the media, a woman who had an issue with not getting equal pay. The member for Corangamite was outraged about women across a number of industry sectors and why we weren't talking about them. I don't know where she's been for the last 50 years. One of the very first committees I sat on did an inquiry under a Labor government on pay equity which led to significant reforms in the Industrial Relations Commission that saw pay equity cases successfully prosecuted. Why did we do that? Because we understand that inclusive growth means that women across what were undervalued sectors of the economy deserved wage equity and pay equality.


That was followed up by the Prime Minister, during question time, informing us from his lofty heights that not everyone has had a privileged ride to power. Well, he'd know! He'd know, wouldn't he? I tell you what, Mr Speaker: from the top to the bottom, those opposite epitomise a complete inability to understand what we mean by inclusive growth and what the Australian community expects of growth in this country and the way in which it is shared. We are one of the great examples among OECD countries with a structure in our economy and society that has meant a significant increase in the wellbeing and welfare of working-class people. Over time, that is what has driven growth in this country.


The assistant minister wanted to talk about small business. I have done some local events with small businesses in my area who understand that if you go cutting people's wages you are hurting their customers. You are attacking the base of their community—the people who come in and buy from them, who come in and have a meal at their restaurant or who come in and do a bit of that discretionary spending you can do when you have a decent wage in place. Instead of doing that, what those opposite are doing is cutting away at the heart of the customers who feed those small businesses, by refusing to take action on penalty rates, as an example. I can't believe they're making comments about needing better wages growth in this country whilst not only doing absolutely nothing to deliver that but taking actions to cut away the base of that. As the shadow Treasurer said, this week we've had bills through this place to attack the wage level of people earning only $21,000 a year. These are people who go out and shop in the businesses in my electorate. These are the people who spend the additional money they have. The big end of town don't do that; they put it in a bit more of their own investments or into shares and so forth. If you want inclusive growth, you have to understand how the economies in our local communities operate. They operate on the strength of the incomes that come in to the people who live in those communities and the purchasing power that they deliver to the businesses in our local area. Those opposite, from top to bottom, say people in Western Sydney don't even own cars or drive very far. They say: those of you who can't afford a new house, just beg mum and dad for a bit of money—I'll tell you what: as a mum, I'm not keen on that solution—or that getting paid $4 an hour is a gift.

Mr GEE
 (Calare) (15:45):  It does beggar belief that the member for McMahon can come into this House with his pious bleating about inclusion and inclusive growth on the very day those opposite try to sabotage full funding for the NDIS. It beggars belief and just epitomises those opposite. They talk a good game on inclusion and inclusive growth but they just can't deliver. They can't fund the NDIS. The NDIS was never funded and they were never able to fund Gonski either. But over on this side, on the government's side, we have plans to fully fund the NDIS and fully fund Gonski, backed by David Gonski himself. As you walk around these corridors, you'll see all the Gonski posters those opposite had up in their rooms have all come down because they know we deliver on all of these inclusive policies.


At the core of inclusive growth is giving Australians a shot at a job. And as Deloitte Access Economics has recently stated, Australian job growth is a thing of beauty. Why wouldn't Deloitte Access Economics say that? Over the past 12 months, 371,500 Aussies got a job, the strongest jobs growth since before the global financial crisis. I think I'd know what the Treasurer would say about that. He would say the better days are arriving. Twelve months of consecutive jobs growth is the best result in over 23 years—that's better days ahead. Annual jobs growth is now running at over three per cent—that's 15 times greater than it was in 2013 when the coalition government was first elected. And since then, 825,000 jobs have been created and almost two-thirds of those jobs have been secured in the past two years. Better days ahead there, better days indeed. 


Nowhere have the better days economically been felt more so than in country Australia. If you look at the economic growth figures for regional Australia, you see they are quite astounding. Agriculture is now Australia's fastest growing economic sector and was the largest contributor to national GDP growth in 2016 and 2017. Growth in agriculture, as you would know, Deputy Speaker Coulton, is up 23 per cent, proving the sector is the fastest to grow of all of the 19 industries. The nation's economic growth is at 1.9 per cent, and Australian agriculture contributed 0.5 per cent of that. So it just keeps getting better and better in terms of inclusive growth, because our young farmers can finally see a future on the land. That's giving everyone a share and a part in that great Australian vision.


In more good news: in 2016-17, agriculture contributed over $500 billion in exports, compared to $41 billion just five years ago. So you can see how the better days have indeed arrived. In contrast, those opposite have turned their backs on working Australians, working families. They have turned their backs on miners. I know in our neck of the words, in the Central West, in Lithgow, the miners are very disillusioned about the whacky energy policies of those opposite. The miners out at Mudgee, the miners out at Ulan, they know. You go into the pubs and clubs and they'll tell you how disillusioned they are at being cut loose by those opposite.


Of course, the Productivity Commission spoke about better health and better educational outcomes, which of course we all support. The Treasurer has said that universities need to focus on teaching, to get those practical outcomes going. Out west, we're certainly pushing hard for that Murray Darling Medical School to train doctors in the bush for practice in the bush. So out west, where we are, we're already working on those key recommendations of the Productivity Commission, and I know that that project is something that the communities of the west support wholeheartedly.


But, if you go right across the economy, right across the sectors, you'll see better days and inclusive growth. According to the NAB, business conditions have risen to their highest levels in almost a decade. If you go to manufacturing activity, AiG has stated that it's at its highest level in 15 years. There are better days ahead. And we've also seen that new private business investment has increased in each of the past three quarters in the national accounts, following 12 consecutive quarters of decline.

Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (15:50):  Can I just acknowledge those young people up in our gallery here, because this debate really is about them. This is about our futures, and those young people over there are the ones who are going to either benefit or otherwise from what's occurring in this place today.


We've been lectured, time and time again, by the government about budget repair. They talk about deficit disaster and they talk about a budget emergency. And yet what was the first thing they did in the last budget? They found the notion of giving a $65 billion tax cut to big business—corporate Australia—which, by the way, last year made record profits, if you can believe the financial analysts out there. So it wasn't that they needed to stimulate big business, because they're actually doing pretty well at the moment. We might need to fine-tune a number of aspects of trade, which we work on, hopefully, on a bipartisan basis.


But, in terms of actually justifying their $65 billion tax cut to big business, they did it on the basis of a belief, believe it or not, in trickle-down economics. Pretty hard to find that—I went through my books and it wasn't mentioned anywhere. But I did find one reference to it earlier this week. There were members on both sides of the House who turned up to hear about the latest issue of the Catholic Social Justice Series Papers, released by Catholic Social Services Australia, entitled 'An economy that works for all'—not dissimilar to the debate we're having at the moment. I was interested: was there anything about trickle-down economics in this publication? And there was, believe it or not! The Catholic bishops' Social Justice Statement this year was entitled 'Everyone's business: developing an inclusive and sustainable economy'. It focused not just on the distribution of wealth but on how it is created and used. I thought, 'That's appropriate for today's debate.' So I thought I'd read on a little bit to see what it said, because it talked about trickle-down economics. It seems these Australian bishops agree with Pope Francis that 'trickle-down theories which assume that economic growth, encouraged by a free market, will inevitably succeed in bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world' have not been proven. But this is the government's whole policy! The bishops go on to say that even 26 years of continuous economic growth has been insufficient to assure the poorest Australians of a dignified, if frugal, existence. As to those opposite, I'm sure I saw some familiar faces there—I'm sure they turned up to see the publication of that document and hear Father Frank Brennan introduce it.


They want to talk about economic vandalism. Have you noticed that? It sort of rolls off the tongue over there. This is the mob—and, by the way, this might be interesting for the teachers up there—part of whose strategy for social inclusion is cutting $17 billion from education. That's their view of investing in our future. This is the same mob that comes in here and says, 'We're going to take $3.8 billion out of our universities.' That's hardly investing in our future. And, by the way, when it gets to vocational and TAFE courses, they want to take over $600 million out of them! I introduced these young people up here because they're the ones you're supposed to be investing in. They're our collective future, which you're ignoring.


They do this at a time when there's record low wage growth.




Mr Gee:
  The good times have arrived!




Mr HAYES:
  I just heard the last member who spoke saying that the good times have arrived: wage growth of 1.9 per cent. Can I just tell that member that this is the lowest wage growth in living memory. And this is the same government that wants to cut the penalty rates for 700,000 Australian workers on low pay, which will take away about $77 a week. And, by the way, the cut won't just apply for this year; their cuts are going to apply for the next four years. These people in the hospitality and the retail sector are on the lowest wages in our country, and they're not going to get a pay rise for the next four years. And those opposite say that the good times have arrived! Well, I'd hate to see what the bad times are like!


And bear in mind that none of them have ever mentioned the global financial crisis. This is the side that actually protected the Australian people and the Australian economy in the face of the worst financial disaster— (Time expired)

"Wilson, Tim, MP",LP,2017-10-25,"



Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (15:56):  I start my address on this matter of public importance by making a confession, a confession that I'm not proud of, but it's important to put it on the record. I was one of those people who paid full price for a copy of the shadow minister's Hearts & Minds book.



A government member:  Surely not!




Mr TIM WILSON:
  I did! There aren't many Australians who can claim that, because it was such a low print run and it has, as the Assistant Minister to the Treasurer conceded, gone straight to the reject bin. But I have done so, and I have then had the dubious honour of reading said Hearts & Minds. The principle that sits at the heart of it is actually that you create economic opportunity by creating economic growth. A shocking proposition, I know! A shocking proposition! Something that's come from the shadow Treasurer's mouth and in words as well as in deed.


But, in practice, everybody on this side of the House knows that's a statement of the expletive obvious. And that's what's at the heart of this motion: an absurdity—the idea that you can get up and pander and postulate to the parliament about how you think you can create a better society by simply sharing the dividends rather than creating the opportunity that this nation needs. The Assistant Minister to the Treasurer was 100 per cent right: those opposite take economic opportunity and growth as a given, rather than recognising it as a cause we must strive for continuously if we want to create the prosperity and opportunity for the children in the gallery that so many on the other side simply seek to gesture to.


The absurdity of their position is how much hypocrisy sits at the heart of the arguments put by those opposite. They talk about the challenges of wage growth—and there are challenges to wage growth; I'm not going to pretend otherwise. But hypocrisy sits at the heart of it when, for the past 12 months, the member for Fraser has done a job and never got paid for it because of factional union deals over the past 12 months. Only because of a recent reshuffle has he been honoured with the commitment to a boost in his income that he was entitled to in fulfilling his role as a shadow minister. These people like to talk it, but they don't like to deliver it—especially when it's one of their own.


Inclusive growth is about creating economic opportunity for every Australian. It's about creating an opportunity society, and at the heart of it is actually understanding some pretty basic propositions of economics. Firstly, you have primary industries, which create the economic opportunity and the wealth that make this nation rich. Secondly, you use that wealth to create a manufacturing sector to value-add and to create opportunities for the next generation, which is ultimately provided for by a service based economy—the sector in which millions of Australians work. But, if you do not create the right economic environment for those primary industries, the country is cactus. And that is what they are doing every single day when they seek to regulate and legislate them out of competitiveness.


Their policy on energy fundamentally undermines the opportunity for our mining industries, our agriculture and our manufacturing services economy to compete, and it slugs households and businesses at every step of the way. That's the point of the National Energy Guarantee. It provides a framework for making sure we get investment in new technology and new energy to make us competitive, so that we can reduce our costs and improve the opportunity for households to reduce their electricity bills.


On top of that, you have to judge what they want to do to our economy against the outcomes of the Turnbull coalition government. Let's face facts: in the year 2016-17 we have had but a measly, a dolorous, if you take the position of the opposition, 371,000 new jobs. Apparently creating job opportunities is not inclusive growth. We have been delivering job opportunities for 371,000 Australians, completely against the rubbish narrative that is being run in this motion today. And 315,900 of those jobs are full time, creating opportunities for hundreds of thousands of Australians to be able to stand on their own two feet, to understand the dignity and opportunity that comes with being able to work and to provide for their families and pay their mortgages. There are so many things this government has done to deliver inclusion and opportunity for Australians. It's about time the opposition woke up and recognised it.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2017-10-25,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (16:01):  Unlike the member for Goldstein, I'm going to talk about 'inclusive economy' as opposed to 'exclusive economy'. Yesterday we saw the Productivity Commission release their five-year productivity report into Australia's productivity and economic growth. Let's just say this review is more like a report card on the five years that we have had under the Abbott-Turnbull governments. What is clear from this report card is that the Abbott-Turnbull governments have received Fs across the board: wage growth, fail; support for universities, fail; support for education, fail; investment in health, fail.


The Abbott-Turnbull governments have failed Australia because they have failed to understand a vital notion, a notion that was outlined on page 30 of the Productivity Commission's review:


A key issue will be to ensure that future economic, social and environmental policies sustain inclusive growth—


a phrase the Turnbull government probably aren't too familiar with, and we've just heard that, considering it includes the term 'inclusive'. So allow me to educate those opposite in the Turnbull government on what 'inclusive' really means. 'Inclusive' does not just relate to the wealthy and the elite. 'Inclusive' does not relate to billionaires and millionaires. And 'inclusivity' is certainly not about providing a $65 billion tax cut to big business. 'Inclusive' means all, everyone, every citizen, all Australians—workers, pensioners, students, teachers, nurses, tradies, electricians, small business owners.


Labor has always understood that investment in people and our human capital is key to economic growth. You cannot have a strong economy without a thriving and inclusive society. That is why it has only ever been Labor that has invested in education, universities, health care and jobs. That is the backbone of who we are. But the Turnbull government does not care about all Australians, and this is very evident with its Medicare levy. This government wants to reduce the taxes for big business by $44 billion over the next decade, with the Medicare levy rise hitting workers who earn as little as $21,000 a year. Quite simply, the Turnbull government is giving away $65 billion in tax cuts to big business but slugging working Australians with a $44 billion income tax hike. This government's tax increase will mean a worker on $55,000 will pay an extra $275 tax a year. It is clear that the Turnbull government is not at all interested in inclusive growth when it is implementing government policies and tax increases that detrimentally affect this vulnerable group of people. The Turnbull government is completely blinded by trickle-down economics. Well, there is something trickling down on Australian workers, but it certainly isn't wealth!


This government needs to stop treating workers like they are fools. Workers know the facts, but allow me to enlighten the government about these facts. Wage growth hasn't been this low since the retention of records started. Since 1975, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has collected data on earnings inequality. Profits have gone up by 40 per cent, wages by less than two per cent. Real wages have grown by 72 per cent for the top 10 per cent.


In 1975, the top ten per cent of earners earned twice as much as the bottom 10 per cent, yet by 2014 they earned nearly three times as much. If low-wage earners had enjoyed the same percentage gains as the highest paid, they would be $16,000 a year better off. The richest one per cent of Australians collectively own more wealth than 70 per cent of Australian citizens combined. So what will the Turnbull government do regarding this massive issue of wage growth? When will wages go up? When asked during a national radio interview last week, the Prime Minister said, 'When businesses are able to, when the economy is growing fast enough and strongly enough so that businesses are able to afford to pay more for labour.' That rambling answer is simply not good enough. And the government's $65 billion tax cut is not good enough either. This farce of a tax cut will only provide one per cent of growth in 20 years' time. That policy is a joke to all Australians.


The Turnbull government is a government that puts profits before people. It is not a government for low-income workers. It is certainly not a government that cares about inclusivity for all Australian citizens, because, under the Turnbull government, workers not only will be taxed more but will certainly be paid less.

"Coleman, David, MP",LP,2017-10-25,"



Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks) (16:06):  The economy is strong and it is getting stronger and stronger every day, with some tremendously good economic figures in recent months. Over the past 12 months, 371,500 Australians got a job, the greatest incremental number of jobs since before the financial crisis, a fantastic rate of growth. And the overwhelming majority of those jobs were full-time. There have been 825,000 jobs created since we came into government, two-thirds of those in the last two years, so it is a very strong economic performance.


We contrast that with the bleak and depressing economic vision of those opposite. The opposition leader said in a speech recently that the wealth of your parents is becoming the defining feature and source of your future and that there is a sense that your success in life is predetermined by your parents' income. That is not right, because, in Australia, we know that it is our own efforts that determine our level of success. We know that this is a country where people can come from any walk of life, from any background, and, through dedication and application, can make so much of themselves. That is so fundamental as to who we are on this side of the House and, indeed, who we are as Australians. But those opposite believe in a sad and depressing vision that your success or destiny in life is predetermined by your upbringing, and that is absolutely false. I'm sure there are many people in this House who know from personal experience that that could not be further from the truth, but this is an opposition that is anti-business, anti-aspiration and, frankly, anti-success. 


What do those opposite want to do to small- and medium-sized businesses? They want to say you can't have any tax relief, because a business with $2 million of revenue or more is some sort of evil multinational that must be denied tax relief, even though most of these businesses are very small and are massive employers of millions of Australians. This could be instructive for those opposite. If you've got $2.1 million of revenue, it doesn't mean that you have made $2.1 million. It doesn't mean that your profit is $2.1 million. It means that you have revenue of $2.1 million and you might have a profit margin of five per cent. Many small businesses have profit margins of three or four or five per cent. So if your profit margin is five per cent and your revenue is just over $2 million, you're making $100,000. You are making about the same as the average family income, and those opposite say this is some sort of huge corporation that must be denied tax relief. That is an extraordinary and absurd proposition, and it just shows a complete lack of understanding from those opposite of how the economy works.


The other thing those opposite want to do is increase the investment tax on everything by 50 per cent. They want to increase capital gains tax on everything by 50 per cent. This is under their so-called housing affordability policy, but Labor's housing affordability policy says that on any investment in anything at all, if there's a capital gain, that person should pay 50 per cent more tax. So, if you invest in a factory in the electorate of Petrie or in a cafe or whatever, there would be 50 per cent more tax. If you invest in a farm, there would be 50 per cent more tax when you sell that asset. That is, again, a ridiculous policy which will be anti-investment. That policy supposedly was designed to address housing affordability issues in Sydney and Melbourne, so why would you apply it to all of these other industries and to the entire country? One reason is that you want to raise more revenue, because you want to spend more and you have absolutely no understanding of how the economy works. It is an extraordinarily bad idea.


We have very strong business conditions at the moment and very strong business confidence, and that's because this Treasurer and this government are unashamedly pro-investment and pro-growth. We have already legislated, with the support of some sensible crossbenchers in the Senate—not those opposite but some sensible crossbenchers in the Senate—for tax relief for businesses with revenue of up to $50 million. That should be extended further, because it will mean more jobs. The proof of the pudding is the very strong performance on jobs that this government has generated in recent years. We have a very strong economic record here. The economy is getting stronger every day. There is a depressing antibusiness, anti-aspiration agenda opposite which must be rejected.

Mr GOSLING
 (Solomon) (16:11):  I'm pleased to have an opportunity to speak to this MPI today. In the Federation Chamber earlier today, I heard some of the comments from the member for Boothby about the closing down of the Holden plant in Adelaide. She really did not have a sense for what that meant to so many families and workers. Then we heard the member for Goldstein's Freudian slip when he talked about the other side's passion for 'exclusive growth'; he belled the cat there about where the focus of those opposite lies. Then we had the member for Calare talking about how things have never been better. I hope that, when he got back up to his office, his staff removed his cranium from his rear end so that he could appreciate and maybe listen to some other contributions, because it may come as a surprise to those opposite, who generally do better from electorates that do better—well done and good for you, guys, and that's fantastic—but a lot of people in this country are struggling and don't feel included in this growth thing.


Let's have a think about that growth. There are $65 billion worth of corporate tax cuts going to the big end of town. For what sort of growth? By their own admission, for one per cent growth in 20 years. Those in the gallery should know a lot of that money gained through those corporate tax cuts will go offshore—that is, not for Australians but for those incredibly wealthy people and companies offshore. How is that inclusive? I don't think it is. So what people are starting to wake up to—with Mr Point Piper with his mansion, our current Prime Minister and all his wealth, and good luck to him—is that people in this country are struggling, and they don't appreciate that those opposite's idea of inclusivity is to increase taxes on every single Australian earning more than $21,000. That's shocking. It's not a surprise. Those opposite don't understand inclusivity.


I was very happy to hear the member for Fowler on our side point to the findings of Catholic Social Services in their look into the state of inequality and inclusiveness in our country. They also mention the fact that the current Pope, Francis, isn't necessarily an adherent to trickle-down, and that's interesting, because a lot of those opposite like to profess a profound communion with the ideals of Christianity. However, taking from poor people and giving to those with abundance is not really in the nature of the teachings of that religion. Forgive them, Deputy Speaker Coulton, because they do not know what they are talking about. They do not understand what inclusivity is.


In fact, the member for Goldstein belled the cat, talking about an exclusive policy of growth excluding those on the margins. I come from the Northern Territory, where people are living on those margins. I understand what communities of disadvantage look like. I understand what it's like to represent people coming from a jurisdiction that depends on something like horizontal fiscal equalisation, which is about us sharing the GST, the glue that holds the federation together. Yet this Treasurer of Australia seeks to change the model by which some areas of our country that are doing less well get to share in the common wealth of our nation. He is saying the Productivity Commission is going around the country doing consultations about this change to the glue of our federation. Do you think they're coming to the Northern Territory? No. They're not coming to the Northern Territory, the very jurisdiction with the most disadvantage in our country, for Territorians to be heard. Territorians' voices should be heard on this issue. Labor will always be for an inclusive economy.

"Howarth, Luke, MP",LP,2017-10-25,"



Mr HOWARTH
 (Petrie) (16:16):  We've seen over the last 12 months some really positive results in the Australian economy. We've seen job creation soar, with over 370,000 new jobs in the last 12 months, and over 300,000 of those being full-time. We've seen the unemployment rate fall, not just nationally but also in my electorate. In the last four years since the coalition came in, we've seen the youth unemployment rate come down considerably in Petrie on the back of projects like PaTH. We've also seen rent fall in some areas, particularly in Brisbane a little bit, which has helped some people. Housing prices have remained stagnant or gone up a little bit. They have remained very stable. Goals are being achieved by local people and local community groups, so I thank the RDA and others in the community that are working hard.


The shadow Treasurer came in here and talked about inclusive growth, but the problem is that his policies and the policies of those opposite are actually making the gap larger. I look at their policies around higher taxes and their policy around making existing homes only available to be positively geared, because they want to get rid of negatively geared housing. When you only allow positive gearing, for the people who rent and who can only ever afford to rent, it means that their rents will go up. Naturally, if they cannot negatively gear, owners need to make sure that rents are higher than interest repayments. Some people out there may remember when interest rates were 17 per cent under Labor. Right now, they are quite low and there'll be very few investors that are negatively gearing compared to when interest rates were high. When interest rates are very high and when they go up in the future and you cannot negatively gear, it means rents will increase.


Labor also want to push up the cost of the electricity bill. We know the Climate Change Authority says their policy will increase prices by $200 and ours will decrease prices by over $100. That is a $300 difference between Liberal-National policy and Labor policy.


They want to punish family-owned business trusts that employ local people. They basically believe we have to tax them more because they must be ripping people off. But when you tax investment there are fewer jobs. We know, since we went to the last election with jobs and growth, that the coalition has a proven record of delivering.


They also want to tax people half of what they earn. If you've got any incentive to earn $300,000, they want to take half of it. We know that people who are earning $37,000 a year pay $3,572 tax. If you earn $52,000 you pay $8,400. If you earn $79,000—around the average in Australia; I think the average is $81,000—you pay $17,222. If you earn $300,000, if you are really earning more than the average, you pay $108,232 in tax. Lisa Wilkinson, who just left Channel Nine and now works for Channel Ten and has landed a contract for $2.3 million, will pay $1,008,232 in tax. So Labor's solution to growing inequality is that a woman who has just landed a $2.3 million contract, who currently pays over $1 million in tax, must pay more. That is why we are in this situation—according to Labor. What they should be focusing on is not the top earners or the middle-income earners but encouraging everyone to do better. They should not be voting against policies like the Super Saver Scheme. Members opposite voted against the $6,000 tax cut that we introduced into parliament last week to help first home owners save more of their own money for a deposit on their own house.


Labor's policies are all wrong. The inclusive growth that they're talking about is actually exacerbated under Labor—the rich and poor are getting wider apart. If you tax Lisa Wilkinson an extra two per cent, she's still going to be earning a lot of money. Focus on the bottom end. Look at those earning $0 to $18,200, who currently pay no tax—and each year maybe link that to CPI so that their $18,200 goes up. It will help everyone on the tax scale, including those at the lower end. You'll see a bigger gap between the minimum wage—what they take home—and what they currently get in welfare. This party believes in lower taxes and lower spending, and that's the only way to equality for all.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fenner) (16:22):  As the member for Hotham has ably set out in this chamber, Labor will support tougher penalties for firearms trafficking but what we won't support are ineffective measures. The reintroduction of these measures is a desperate attempt by the coalition to distract from the fact that they are hopelessly divided on guns. Labor will seek to remove the mandatory minimum sentences because they don't work. We need to draw a distinction in this House between being tough on crime and being dumb on crime. Labor will listen to the experts because we want to make sure that we have less gun crime in Australia. We're proposing amendments to introduce new offences for aggravated firearms trafficking, but we won't support measures which will simply cause judges to be less likely to convict.


In the case of mandatory minimum sentences, the Attorney-General's Department document 'Guide to framing Commonwealth offences, infringement notices and enforcement powers' states that minimum penalties should be avoided on the basis that they interfere with judicial discretion to impose a penalty appropriate to the circumstance of a particular case; that they may create an incentive for a defendant to fight charges even when there's little merit in doing so; that they may preclude the use of alternative sanctions such as community service orders; and that they may encourage the judiciary to look for technical grounds to avoid a restriction on sentencing discretion, leading to anomalous decisions. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee received a wide range of evidence from stakeholders in inquiries on the two previous bills, which strongly opposed the imposition of mandatory sentences.


The Law Council of Australia has written most extensively on this issue. In their policy discussion paper on mandatory sentencing in May 2004, they went through in considerable detail the risks that mandatory sentencing creates. They noted that mandatory sentencing is inconsistent with Australia's international obligations, including the prohibition against arbitrary detention, in article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The right to a fair trial and the provision of prison sentences must, in effect, be subject to appeal, as per article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They also noted that mandatory minimums may breach Australia's obligations under articles 3, 37 and 40 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.


More important than our international obligations is the simple fact that mandatory minimum sentences make it less likely for convictions to be recorded and can lead to manifest unfairness. The Law Council gave examples of instances in which mandatory sentencing has led to outcomes which I don't think any member of this House would believe are just. They give the example of a 16-year-old with one prior conviction who received a 28-day prison sentence for stealing a bottle of spring water—a month in jail for stealing a bottle of water. A 17-year-old first-time offender received a 14-day prison sentence for stealing orange juice and Minties. I have to say, I went to a decent school, and I'm afraid there were classmates of mine who at some stage would have shoplifted orange juice and Minties, but I don't think anyone would have thought that they should have received a fortnight behind bars. The Law Council gives the example of a 15-year-old Aboriginal boy who received a 20-day mandatory sentence for stealing pencils and stationery and died while in custody. An Aboriginal woman, a first-time offender, received a 14-day prison sentence for stealing a can of beer. These manifestly unjust outcomes occurred as a result of mandatory sentencing.


The Law Council points to research which found that, when the public is fully informed about the particular circumstances of a case and an offender, there is a 90 per cent tendency to view judge's sentences as appropriate. That is from work by Geraldine Mackenzie and co-authors, published in 2012, in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology. The Law Council notes too that the imposition of mandatory minimum sentences can lead to unjust outcomes. The Law Council concludes by quoting the then Australian Human Rights Commissioner, the 'Freedom Commissioner', Mr Tim Wilson, now the member for Goldstein. He said:


… mandatory sentencing 'is an incremental stake stabbed in the heart of the foundations of our liberal democracy because it assumes that a centralised government with less information can make better decisions about individual cases than a decentralised courts with more information'.


The member for Goldstein has always stood for freedom, or so he tells us, so it will be interesting to those on this side of the House to see whether he exercises his freedom of conscience to cross the floor and vote with the Labor Party and uphold the principles that he stood for when he was Human Rights Commissioner—the principles he stood for in 2014 when he described mandatory sentencing as 'an incremental stake stabbed in the heart of the foundations of our liberal democracy'.


The criminologist Mark Kleiman describes the trade-off between severity and certainty in his book, When Brute Force Fails, and points out that, if you want to have less crime and less punishment, you need to recognise that offenders who are driven by the present are much more likely to respond to certainty—to the probability of conviction—than to severity, to the duration of the sentence. If you are thinking about committing a serious weapons offence, you are probably living in the moment and it is relatively unlikely that severity will play a bigger role in your mind than certainty. Yet that is the trade-off that this bill fails to recognise.


The Law Council noted that mandatory minimum sentences could increase Indigenous incarceration rates. We on this side of the House believe that incarceration should be added to the Closing the Gap targets, given that Australia's Indigenous incarceration rate is high and rising. Indeed, our overall incarceration rate is now the highest it's been since 1901. In all the time since Federation, Australia has never locked up as large a share of our population as we do today, with 207 out of every 100,000 adults currently behind bars. It's a higher incarceration rate than in Canada, Japan, France, India, Germany, Indonesia or Britain. We are incarcerating a higher share of our population than we have since Federation, at a time, over the last two decades, in which the murder rate and car theft rates have fallen significantly.


This comes at a significant cost to Australians, given that incarceration costs around $300 a day and $110,000 a year. In the United States, where nearly one per cent of adults are behind bars, there's a bipartisan movement towards being smarter on crime, recognising that we need to make better use of monitoring technology and that there are smarter approaches than mandatory sentences. This is a bipartisan push from Democrats and Republicans in the United States. It's a smart-on-crime measure, exactly the opposite of what we see in this government's call for mandatory sentences. We have a government that says we need mandatory sentences in order to make sure offenders are put behind bars. But the Law Council tells us that they will do just the opposite, because when mandatory sentences are in place judges and juries may be less likely to convict, knowing that there is no sentencing discretion.


Finally, I want to do something which is a little unusual in this place, which is to pay tribute to those on the other side of the House. One of the great legacies of the Howard government was the package of gun reforms put in place after the Port Arthur massacre. It is too easy to forget how quickly Australia acted at that time. The police ministers' meeting took place 12 days after the Port Arthur massacre, before all of the 35 victims had been laid to rest. It is to the credit of John Howard and Tim Fischer that they were willing to act and tighten our firearms laws. We refer to the gun buyback, the 600,000 firearms—about a fifth of all guns in Australia—that were handed back into police stations. But it's important to remember, too, the tightening of licensing and regulation requirements, the restrictions on access to semi-automatic weapons and the limits that were placed on sales.


The United States occasionally misreads the lessons of Australia's tightening of gun laws, which took place in 1997-98. Disappointingly, following the mass shooting in Las Vegas that took place so recently, Leah Libresco wrote in The Washington Post that mass shootings were too rare in Australia prior to the buyback to show any evidence of progress and that the Australian gun law tightening did not provide clear evidence for the United States.


In fact, that is not true. If we define a mass shooting as the killing of five or more victims, Australia was experiencing an average of one mass shooting per year in the decade leading up to Port Arthur. In the decade afterwards, there was not a single mass shooting. The odds of this being due to chance alone are less than one in 100.


But the work that Christine Neill and I did when I was at the Australian National University found this had a significant impact on reducing gun deaths—principally through reducing gun suicides. After all, the person most likely to kill you with a gun is yourself. We found when we looked at the time series that the reforms seemed to cause the death rate to fall a little faster. But, in particular, if we looked at cross-state differences and compared jurisdictions where more weapons were bought back and those where fewer weapons were bought back, the largest fall in gun deaths occurred in the jurisdictions where the most guns were bought back. We didn't see any evidence of displacement effects, and we estimated that the firearm reforms of 1996 save around 200 lives year.


It is in no way in my political interest to praise those on the other side of the House, but it is vital for our friends in the United States to get a clear-eyed reading of the impact of the Australian gun reforms of 20 years ago. They were smart gun reforms. They were supported by this side of the House. We supported them because they were based on clear evidence.


We call on the coalition today to make sure that their firearms measures are, again, based on clear evidence. We call on them to listen to the Law Council and to prosecutors, who say that mandatory sentences may make us less safe, not more safe.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling—Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Counter-Terrorism) (16:35):  I thank all honourable members for their contribution to the debate on the Criminal Code Amendment (Firearms Trafficking) Bill 2017, which will introduce new mandatory minimum sentences and increase maximum penalties for firearms-trafficking offences. There have been a wide range of statements made in this debate. In particular, we heard repeatedly from those opposite that mandatory minimum sentences should be opposed as they remove incentives for offenders to cooperate with law enforcement or to plead guilty. However, if members had read the amendments introduced by the government, they would have known that they do, indeed, provide for discounts on the mandatory minimum sentences if offenders plead guilty or if they cooperate with our law enforcement agencies. These amendments provide clear incentives for offenders to plead guilty and to cooperate with law enforcement.


We also heard from those opposite about the case of former Victorian police chief commissioner Simon Overland, who, of course, would not be captured by this bill. The bill is aimed at traffickers—people with intent—not those who make honest mistakes. This was clearly an honest mistake and, of course, he was not charged with any offence. This, as I indicated previously, reflects the discretion that our law enforcement agencies have and continue to exercise each and every single day when it comes to deciding whether to initiate a prosecution.


We also heard that juries would be less likely to convict gun runners if they knew they would get a mandatory minimum sentence. As my colleague the member for La Trobe, who has a lot of experience in these matters, being a former police officer, said in his contribution, 'Juries are actually tough, and they don't have a problem convicting people who are guilty of crimes, and they wouldn't have a problem convicting gun traffickers.'


We also heard from a number of speakers opposite that they do not support mandatory minimum sentences, as a matter of principle. That's interesting because they actually introduced, when they were in office, mandatory sentencing for the crime of people smuggling, in 2010. At the time, Labor's then Attorney-General said:


The use of mandatory minimum penalties reflects the seriousness of the activity being prosecuted. It allows the court to determine an appropriate penalty within the minimum and maximum set by parliament.


The then Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, said at the time:


This legislation includes mandatory minimum penalties for organisers and created a new offence of providing material support for people smuggling …


It was supported at the time by members on that side of the House who are still in the House. The member for Gorton, who was once the Minister for Home Affairs, supported mandatory sentencing at the time. Others who, funnily enough, even spoke in these debates against mandatory sentencing spoke for mandatory sentencing when the people-smuggling bill was introduced in 2010.


The fact is that a combination of mandatory minimum sentences and increased maximum penalties sends the strongest possible message that the illegal trafficking of guns will not be tolerated. Unless a mandatory sentence is introduced, it will remain possible for low sentences to be issued to offenders. I reiterate the fact that, when this bill was debated in the Senate earlier this year, the government, in good faith, supported amendments related to increased sentences for firearms trafficking. This was obviously in line with our election commitment—but also in line with our election commitment that we took to the Australian people in 2016 was the fact that there would be a mandatory sentence for this heinous crime.


If members are truly serious about ensuring that courts impose adequate sentences on gun traffickers, they will support all of the measures contained within this bill—but, sadly, it appears that members opposite will not be supporting mandatory minimum sentences. I implore them to get on board with this tough legislation. This bill and bipartisan support for it within the parliament will send the strongest possible message that we won't tolerate gun crime, and it will create the strongest possible deterrent. The Australian people shouldn't be subject to the sorts of violence that can result from gun smuggling. It actually complements the very tough gun law regime that we have place in Australia. Again I would urge the Labor Party to rethink. If it was good enough to introduce, support and pass mandatory sentences for people smuggling in 2010, it's good enough to support mandatory sentences for gun smuggling in 2017.


Question agreed to.


Bill read a second time.

"O'Neil, Clare, MP",ALP,2017-10-25,"



Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (16:41):  We were very pleased to support the Criminal Code Amendment (Firearms Trafficking) Bill 2017 on the second reading, and that's because this fundamentally was a Labor bill. The legislation that we had before us today was a bill that had actually been completely rewritten by Labor and the crossbench up in the Senate, and that's a bill that we were really proud to work on. Early in the term here, the minister sitting opposite me decided that he would try a little political exercise and try to wedge the Labor Party. So he created a bill that was not much more than something that contained mandatory minimums.


We don't support mandatory minimums, and we don't for a very good reason: we know that they won't work. We'll have plenty of opportunities during this consideration in detail to go to the evidence that supports that claim. But, because we on the Labor side of the House have such strong concern about gun violence, what we did was take that law—that foolish political exercise—and decide to try to make out of it a good bill that would improve the community safety of Australians. That's why, when it got into the Senate, Labor moved amendments to add aggravated offences to this bill. Those aggravated offences are deliberately targeted at people who are gun running guns into this country, and for the first time it would give courts in Australia the ability to lock these criminals up for life as we believe that some of them deserve.


Those reforms received bipartisan support. That is to say that reforms that Labor moved over in the other place received the support of the government. And we were very pleased with that. The Senate also made the good decision to remove the mandatory minimums from that bill. As I said, mandatory minimums do not work. The minister probably thought he was being terribly clever trying to wedge Labor. It was an utter failure and an embarrassment in the Senate because what the Senate did was take that political exercise and make it into a law that was going to make Australians safer.


If the government was not going to be bloody-minded about this, we could actually have a law that protects Australians better right now. If the government and the minister sitting opposite me had the fortitude to stand up and say that these bills would be separated so we could get a good law that appropriately protects Australians and deal with this political distraction of the mandatory minimums later, we'd be very pleased to support that. All of us could leave this House tonight knowing that we had done a good day's work creating good laws that better protect Australians.


I wrote to the minister last night on this subject because for eight months we have been waiting for this bill to return from the Senate. For eight months we could have had a tougher, stronger law against firearm traffickers, but, because of this minister's bloody-mindedness, we have not had the ability to deal with the reform in the House as we should have. Now, eight months later, when it has come back to us, it has, inserted back into it, mandatory minimums, something the government knows that we are not going to support and something the government knows the Senate will not support, because they've rejected it three times already. And so what we have here is the minister opposite me pretending to care about community safety but instead using this chamber as a political exercise. This is not a student representative council. It's not a local council. This is the federal parliament, where we're supposed to act like adults. It's no wonder so many Australians have lost faith in this chamber's ability to deal with the issues that affect their everyday lives.


I wrote to the minister last night. I laid out the case for splitting these bills so that we could have tougher, stronger laws against firearm trafficking today and we could deal with the separate political debate that he's evidently so keen on without continuing to hamper the safety of Australians. I have not received a response from the minister. So my question to the minister is: will you split the bill so we can have a better law right now?

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (16:45):  It's extraordinary that this minister cares so little for the substance of his own amendment that, on moving the amendment, he could not even bring himself to give a speech in support of it. It shows the hollowness and the grubbiness of this failure of a minister that he's not even prepared to speak in favour of his own amendment. What an extraordinary state of affairs that we have a minister, the justice minister, who, with a bill that is already complete—a bill that has come to us from the Senate, a bill that has bipartisan support, a bill that achieves tougher penalties, a bill that does something about gun trafficking in this country—wants to actually worsen that bill and weaken that bill. He is putting forward an extraordinary and pathetic amendment which he's not even prepared to give a speech in favour of. What kind of minister is this? He is a failure of a minister.


It's extraordinary. He likes to talk about the 2010 mandatory minimum that was introduced by a Labor government for an offence called 'aggravated people smuggling'. Is this failure of a minister seriously suggesting that the introduction of that mandatory sentence stopped people smuggling? I don't think so. If he is, let him say it. But I don't think he is saying that, and he's clearly not listening—



Honourable members interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hastie
):  Order! The member will resume his seat. Now that we have some silence, the honourable member for Isaacs.




Mr DREYFUS:
  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. As I was saying, this failure of a minister is clearly not listening to anything that has been said by Labor in this debate. He was clearly not listening to me now, and I'll repeat it. He likes to call in aid the fact that Labor legislated, for a new offence of aggravated people smuggling in 2010, a mandatory minimum sentence. One has to ask: is this minister seriously suggesting that the introduction of this mandatory sentence stopped people smuggling? If he is, let him say it. But I don't think that this minister is saying that.



Mr Keenan interjecting—




Mr DREYFUS:
  If he'd just shut up for a moment and listen, if this failure of a minister had any rigour, he would accept that that one example that he loves to give, because he's only interested in partisan political game-playing, is in fact evidence that mandatory sentencing does not work and has no effect at all. That's the problem with this government. The minister doesn't want to listen, and the government doesn't want to listen, to the Law Council of Australia.



Mr Keenan interjecting—




Mr DREYFUS:
  He loves the sound of his own voice, which is why he's still not shutting up. He doesn't want to listen to the Law Council of Australia. He doesn't want to listen to the Judicial Conference of Australia. He doesn't want to listen to Chief Justice Barwick of the High Court—a former Liberal Attorney-General—to Chief Justice Gibbs of the High Court or to Chief Justice Kiefel of the High Court, all of whom, along with the rest of the High Court for decades, have condemned mandatory minimum sentencing being imposed by this or any other parliament in Australia, because they understand the proper role of the courts, which is to make punishment fit the crime.


This minister calls himself the Minister for Justice, but he has no idea of justice. He has no idea of the criminal justice system. He has no idea of the damage that he wishes to do with this amendment.



Mr Keenan interjecting—




Mr DREYFUS:
  He's still not listening, Deputy Speaker. He won't shut up. You should try to shut him up because he would be far better off if he listened, not just to me; not just to my colleagues in the Labor Party; and not just to the eloquence of my colleague the shadow minister for justice, the member for Hotham; but to the lawyers of Australia; to the Law Council of Australia, the peak body to every state law society; to every bar council and bar association in this country; to the Australian Bar Association; to the International Commission of Jurists; to the Australian Human Rights Commission; and, as I said before, to the Judicial Conference of Australia; all of whom have condemned mandatory minimum sentences, which do not work and which damage our system of justice.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2017-10-25,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling—Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Counter-Terrorism) (16:50):  I think we need to be very clear about what's happening here. Labor have come into this chamber and want to weaken what we are trying to do to put gun smugglers in prison, using the same rationale they have used about us wanting to put child sex offenders in prison. This is the modern face of the Labor Party: overtaken by left-wing ideology against all common sense.


The Australian people want gun smugglers to go to prison. They want paedophiles to go to prison. What we have had is this fake argument where Labor come forward and say, 'Well, you know what? We don't want mandatory sentencing. We don't want mandatory sentencing for these horrendous crimes. What we're going to do instead is increase the maximum penalties.' We on this side are happy to support that. I'm very happy for the government to commit itself to increasing maximum penalties. In fact, that would have been part of both our bills. But, of course, that does not guarantee that gun runners or paedophiles will spend one day in prison. This is the problem with the approach of those opposite. This is the problem with having left-wing ideology dominate what should actually be an argument dominated by the safety of the Australian community but, instead, we find they have been overtaken by this nonsense ideology.


Now, apparently, the Labor Party are deeply opposed to mandatory sentencing, even though when they were in office they introduced it for people smuggling. We have mandatory sentencing in Australia currently for people-smuggling and terrorism offences—two very significant offences. The Labor Party have been making the argument on this bill and on the other bill we have for locking up paedophiles that they don't support mandatory sentencing. If that's the case, are they going to repeal mandatory sentencing for people smuggling? They've just been saying it doesn't work.




Ms O'Neil:
  What's that got to do with anything? This is your bill.




Mr KEENAN:
  What's that got to do with it? Are they going to repeal mandatory sentencing for terrorism offences? The Labor Party have just been up here in this debate saying that they don't believe in mandatory sentencing, so I think it's fair enough that they explain to the Australian people about whether they will repeal the mandatory sentencing laws that exist at the moment for people-smuggling and terrorism offences. You've got an opportunity to get up and explain what Labor's position is.


This is very simple: you are either want gun runners to go to prison or you don't. Our proposal will make sure that they serve a minimum time in prison. The Labor Party's proposal will make sure that the government's tough measures don't move forward. These amendments are vitally important to secure community safety, and I would urge the Labor Party—




Mr Dreyfus:
  In what way? Tell us one way.




Mr KEENAN:
  What? By putting gun runners to prison! The shadow Attorney-General doesn't think community safety is enhanced by putting gun runners in prison. Is that right? I honestly can't believe the position that's being put by those opposite. Usually the shadow Attorney-General and the shadow minister for justice are brought back to some semblance of common sense.




Mr Burke:
  Deputy Speaker, a point of order: there's a specific reference in Practice to putting words into someone else's mouth. We just saw a very precise example of that from the minister, claiming that the shadow Attorney-General had uttered words which he had not uttered. I ask that it be withdrawn.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I will allow what the minister has said and we'll proceed. I don't see the issue. Explain exactly what you're referring to.




Mr Burke:
  Deputy Speaker, because this will affect future editions of Practice, can I ask then if you are changing the ruling on whether or not people are allowed to put words into someone else's mouth? There's a specific reference to it in Practice. If you're changing that ruling—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  No, I'm not changing that ruling. Minister for Justice?




Mr KEENAN:
  I'm happy to withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will just draw this argument to a conclusion by saying that the choice here is very clear. It's whether you want to make sure that people who engage in gun smuggling—a very serious crime, because you don't move guns around the community unless you've got a very nefarious purpose for doing so—spend one day in prison. If you do, you will support the mandatory sentencing that we're proposing. And, if you don't support that, then clearly you're supporting the arrangements which are the status quo. I think that would be shameful, and I'm very surprised that the Labor Party has yet again stood in the way of us toughening up laws for gun smuggling.




Mr Burke:
  How's voting for the bill in its current form supporting the status quo?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! There are a lot of words being thrown around the chamber at the moment.

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (16:55):  I was asked by a very powerful person in this place, when I intimated to him that he was working under a great handicap because he had the worst group of ministers that I've ever seen in my life in 44 years in parliament, 'Who do you reckon is the worst?' and I mentioned the Minister for Justice immediately. I said that within two months he'd managed to have the government in very serious trouble, and everyone in this place knew that.


It is very interesting to listen to his shadow say that he has defied and treated with contempt every one of the judicial representatives in this country. I can tell you that, from my side, every one of the people involved in firearms in this country is treated similarly. So he has very cleverly managed to antagonise all whom he accuses as being of the right wing and the left wing. He has managed to get both the left wing and the right wing in bed and to have no support whatsoever for his extremist persecution of people associated with these industries, and I would say that these are the valid people.


He doesn't like to listen to what I'm saying, so he will use you as an excuse so he doesn't have to face the music. I'll tell you how genuine this bloke is, because we'll talk about the amendment. In 2012-13, which is the latest year for which we have figures, 67,000 prohibited imports were seized from the 25 per cent of mail inspected. Are you doing anything about that, Minister? I'm giving you an opportunity. Are you doing anything about it?




Mr Keenan:
  I'm not sure what you're talking about.




Mr KATTER:
  He's not going to talk about that. If I were in your shoes, I wouldn't either. I'd try desperately to hide. Border Protection inspects 0.22 per cent. Almost all the firearms come in in containers, and there's a 0.2 per cent inspection rate. When we have a look at the postal services, we find that 67,000 prohibited imports were seized from the 25 per cent of mail inspected. So, if we inspect the containers, how many seizures are we going to see there? But we're not inspecting them at all. In fact, he is going to punish people—and I'll give you an example in a moment of the punishment that he wants to mete out to people—but is he doing anything about stopping the illegal firearms from coming in? Obviously, they're coming in in containers and with metal items such as motor cars, tractors et cetera, and he's doing absolutely nothing about it.


This is what he wants to do—and I have the classic case. A bloke had been away on holidays overseas with his wife for two months. He came home, got the mail and found out that his gun licence was overdue and had been automatically terminated. So he was holding guns illegally. Now, under this minister, he would do five years in jail. He's president of the Rotary club. He's president of the local golf club. He has been very active in supporting the local rugby league. He is, in fact, the town's leading citizen. What he was subjected to by you, Minister, was six police, wearing bullet-proof vests and with automatic weapons, surrounding his house. This is the leading citizen in the town. This is what you want to subject these people to through legislation. I belonged to a government which—using the terms 'right-wing' and 'left-wing'—was the most right wing government the country has ever seen. But, in my 20 years in the state house, not once did the government get through legislation that reversed the onus of proof or imposed mandatory sentencing—not once. So we might have been bushwhackers or rednecks or whatever you want to call us, but we did know elementary justice and fairness when we saw it.


You come into this place. You have once again succeeded in getting every single person in this place offside—every single person. There could be no two people more unalike than me and the Greens representative here, Adam Bandt, and yet you've got us together. Congratulations! (Time expired)

"Hart, Ross, MP",ALP,2017-10-25,"



Mr HART
 (Bass) (17:00):  Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing me to contribute to this debate. In my former career as a legal practitioner, I had the distinction and the honour of being able to serve as the President of the Law Society of Tasmania in 1993, and then I had the privilege of serving as the state representative on the Law Council of Australia. In my time dealing with the legal profession and, in particular, dealing with the political side of the legal profession—that is, in the Law Council of Australia and the Law Society of Tasmania—I have yet to experience an issue like this where a minister of the Crown, the Minister for Justice, has described the courts, the Law Council of Australia, the law societies, the Australian Institute of Criminology, the Sentencing Advisory Council of Victoria and other esteemed bodies as 'infected with leftist ideology'. This is an extraordinary attack on the rule of law and the separation of powers which this minister should be ashamed of. But I'm afraid there is absolutely no shame for this minister. He does not listen to the legal profession, and he ought to listen to the legal profession.


There are perfectly good reasons of principle for the minister to listen to these issues and the arguments with respect to the rejection of mandatory minimum sentencing. These are important questions of principle, but this minister is without principle when he considers this issue. He relies purely upon base politics. Indeed, the government's own Attorney-General's Department's paper 'Guide to framing Commonwealth offences, infringement notices and enforcement powers' states that mandatory minimums should be avoided. We know that there are important considerations which operate to ensure that juries are unlikely to convict when they know that people face mandatory minimum sentences. The Law Council just last week said that mandatory sentences actually make it harder to prosecute criminals by removing the incentive for anyone to plead guilty or to provide information to police. There is every incentive for the defendant to fight on and appeal against convictions. Minister, mandatory minimums let guilty people off the hook. You understand that, or you should understand that, and you should listen to the legal profession.


The Criminal Code Amendment (Firearms Trafficking) Bill 2017 will lead to unintended outcomes because mandatory minimums remove judicial discretion. This is at the heart of the separation of powers. The Law Council of Australia has provided very significant examples as to how this will produce injustice. The first example is:


Former Victoria Police Chief Commissioner, Simon Overland, inadvertently carried a magazine containing live rounds of ammunition on a flight from Melbourne to Canberra in 2010. Prior to travelling, Mr Overland had removed a firearm from his bag, but forgot to take out the magazine. Under the proposed laws he may be facing a mandatory five year jail term. 


That is what happens when you remove judicial discretion.


In the next example, a farmer who has never been overseas goes to the US and attends a gun show. He finds a gun part that he thinks would be helpful to use in controlling pests when he returns to the farm. He buys one for himself and he buys one for his mate down the road that he intends to sell to him. This is a situation very similar to that which was referred to previously. He gets caught returning to Australia when he's going through Customs. He is honest, as we all must be, when dealing with the officer and tells the officer that he intends to sell one of the parts to a friend. Minister, that would satisfy the elements of trafficking, and this defendant would be facing a mandatory five years in prison. A judge, the person who should be determining the sentence, would have no choice but to jail him.


The third example is that a prominent businessman exported gunpowder cartridges, primer and propellant from Australia to Papua New Guinea without a permit when the Lae pistol club was short of ammunition after the defendant's home in Lae, where the club's ammunition was stored— (Time expired)

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (17:06):  I need to make clear to the Minister for Justice, who has been having difficulty listening to anything that Labor has said in this debate, that not supporting mandatory sentencing on this bill does not mean support for gun traffickers; not supporting mandatory sentencing on this bill does not mean supporting the status quo; and not supporting mandatory sentences on this bill does not mean support for lighter sentences. To explain that a bit further, Labor stands in this parliament having moved amendments in the Senate, where this bill commenced its passage, to increase sentences. So it is not possible for this minister or any other representative of this government to suggest that Labor, in not supporting mandatory sentencing, in some way is supporting lighter sentences. I repeat: Labor does not support lighter sentences.


The reason for increasing the maximum sentences in any criminal offence bill is so that this parliament can send the clearest possible message to every court in Australia administering those criminal statutes that what this parliament is indicating is that sentences should be increased. That's what happens in the sentencing process—just for the benefit of the Minister for Justice. When this parliament increases maximum sentences, courts take notice. That's the way the sentencing process works. Every court in Australia, from the High Court down, takes notice when this parliament increases maximum sentences. I'm pleased to see that the minister's taking notes. Not supporting mandatory sentencing on this bill does not mean supporting the status quo. Again, Labor has moved amendments so that the bill now comes before us in a form which has increased maximum sentences, which will lead, over time—because, again, this is the way the sentencing process works in Australian sentencing law—to increased sentences being imposed on people who are convicted of these offences.


As for the laughable and offensive suggestion that the minister seems to like to keep making—that not supporting mandatory sentences on this bill means that in some way those opposing mandatory sentences support gun trafficking in any way—that is such a laughable suggestion I need say no more about it.


We've also heard from this failure of a Minister for Justice that opposing mandatory sentencing is somehow left-wing ideology. The member for Kennedy might well take issue with the suggestion that opposing mandatory sentencing is left-wing ideology. But I'd invite this minister to put that same proposition to the judges of this country, from the High Court down, who have for decades patiently explained, to anybody in the community who cares to listen and anybody in the community who, like the Minister for Justice, should be listening, that proper and just sentencing requires attention to all of the circumstances of the particular case—to the circumstances of the victim, to the circumstances of the offender and to the circumstances of the crime, the nature of the crime and the seriousness of the crime—and, as part of that process, to what tariff has been set by this parliament in passing legislation.


Most importantly, it's about making the punishment fit the crime. As judges have tried to explain, as legal professional bodies have tried to explain, as the Australian Human Rights Commission has tried to explain, as the Judicial Conference of Australia has tried to explain: making the punishment fit the crime is not something that this parliament can do in advance. This parliament does not know the circumstances of the crime for which a future offender is going to be convicted. This parliament does not know the circumstances of the offender, of the victim, of the nature of the crime, of the seriousness of the crime compared to other crimes of a similar nature. And it's because this parliament does not know, and cannot know, those circumstances that this parliament should never seek to impose a mandatory minimum sentence in respect of a crime yet to be committed about which this parliament knows nothing.

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (17:11):  Mr Deputy Speaker—




Mr Burke:
  Left-winger!




Mr KATTER:
  If I'm called left wing outside this chamber, I'll take defamation action I can assure you! There have been very few times in this place I've seen a person who can get such unanimity between the left and right so effectively. I would not like to be a country member of parliament running in the forthcoming federal elections. Everyone regularly goes overseas these days—I'm one of the few who doesn't—and people from the country, by their very nature, have firearms. I mean, it is an absolute necessity. It's not what you like to do; it's what you have to do.


I don't know, the estimates seem to be that there are about 10 million pigs in North Queensland and there are problems on the Barrier Reef—arguably very much coming from this area. The Julia Creek dunnart is the most threatened species in Australia, and Stephen Malone, the expert in this field, has said that unless something's done about pig populations, then it will be extinct. It's only one of many, many items that will be extinct. So these people have guns around all the time.


When you have guns around all the time, you forget when you put some brass in your pocket. You take your trousers off and pack them. You go overseas. You come back into Australia with a shell in your pocket and you go to jail for five years! Now apart from anything else, in Queensland it costs the taxpayers $580,000 a year. A conservative estimate would be about 2,000 people going to jail each year. Minister, we can't afford you. We really, seriously just simply can't afford you—and you won't be able afford anything if you call me a leftie outside of this place!


I do want to seriously say about mandatory sentencing that anyone who has gone to law school, and as I understand it the minister has—I don't talk about it much, but I was president of the law faculty at Queensland university. My brother lectures in law, and I have the privilege of saying I was right on Mabo to the Queensland government. I know the law intimately. In Magna Carta, they died for the principle of being judged by your peers. This is not judgement by your peers. This bloke, this minister, thinks that he can do the judgements forevermore, because we're locked into automatically putting people in jail—whether we like to or whether we don't.


Each of the Labor speakers have quite rightly pointed out that a lot of people will be getting off the hook here who should be on the hook, because people will baulk at putting a human being in jail for five years. But the sorts of people who will be caught in this net are not the people who are the bad guys. The bad guys are not going to be stupid enough to bring a shell casing back in a trouser pocket. Once again I reiterate: you know how—but you don't know, Minister, because you've never spoken to them.


The gun people in Australia have the greatest vested interest in no-one running amok and shooting people, because every time it happens we get punished. We're the ones that desperately don't want this to happen. And of course we are pointing it out to the government and the minister—well, we can't point it out to the minister, because none of the gun groups said they had any listening with him. Either they had a meeting in which he didn't listen and treated them with absolute contempt or they couldn't get a meeting at all.


I find out today from the opposition that he believes in equality, apparently, as he treats the gun people with exactly the same contempt as he treats the judicial people of Australia! And he must be a very clever person, because he knows more than all of them put together!


I repeat that only a quarter of the mail was inspected, and they found 67,000 prohibited imports. This is coming in not through all the mail but the 25 per cent of the mail being inspected. Only 0.2 per cent of the containers coming in are inspected. Should the police and the government spend their money on this stupidity or on stopping the containers? (Time expired)

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling—Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Counter-Terrorism) (17:16):  I do need to respond to a few of the things that the member for Kennedy has just said. I'm sorry to hear of the member for Kennedy's very low opinion of me as a minister; I thought we got on better than that, but apparently not. But I do need to say a few things because what he was alleging there, of course, is not right, and that is not the way this legislation will work. The way it will work, of course, is that there are significant safeguards in the way that the police and the CDPP operate every day when making judgements about whether or not to prosecute crimes. That is exactly the way this will work. The member for Kennedy might not be aware of it, but the police are called upon to make judgements—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hastie
):  Order! The minister will resume his seat. The member for Kennedy.




Mr Katter:
  What he's saying is that police forces have a discretionary power and that they can apply it where they want and don't have to apply it where they don't want to. You understand what you're saying, Minister.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Kennedy will resume his seat or state a point of order. If you have a point of order, state it clearly up front.




Mr KEENAN:
  That is exactly what I'm saying. Police forces all around the country every single day use their discretion about whether or not to prosecute matters, and they are required to take into account the public interest in whether they do so. The same applies for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions as it does for other offices that the states run around that as well. 


I do want to take issue with a couple of other things that the member for Kennedy said which are completely and utterly inaccurate. I've said in this place and outside of this place on many occasions that the threat to community safety in relation to guns is in the illicit and black market. That is where the threat to community safety is. Our focus since we arrived in office in 2013 has been cracking down on that. Legal firearms owners, who are registered firearms owners who actually store their weapon well, are not a threat to community safety. I repeat that over and over again. We have been targeting the black market for guns, and that's what this legislation is about. It's the people who smuggle in guns, the ones who have intent to cause harm, who are going to be captured by this.


And I do talk to the firearms-owning community on a regular basis. In fact, I have a firearms consultative committee that has met on a regular basis since I have become minister. It's got representatives from a very broad cross-section of the shooting community on it—both owners and sporting shooters—and I've been meeting with them on a very regular basis since I have become minister. I will continue to meet with them. We've got very good relationships with them. The advice that they give me is always welcome, and we act on it as appropriate.

"Hart, Ross, MP",ALP,2017-10-25,"



Mr HART
 (Bass) (17:19):  I welcome the opportunity to address this legislation, because it is fundamentally flawed. The minister does need to take into account the views of the legal profession, in particular the concerns that have been expressed by the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions, the Tasmanian Director of Public Prosecutions, the Australian Human Rights Commission and Law Society of New South Wales. We know that the legal profession as a whole, in a single voice, oppose minimum mandatory sentences, and we know why that is the case: because they simply do not work. We know that they are not capable of putting people in jail, because the juries do not convict. We know that, where there is an opportunity for a judge to exercise sentencing discretion, the justice of the case can be met. We know that, where you impose a mandatory minimum sentence, you can't take into account the individual circumstances of the case—the justice, that is, that has been handed out by the judiciary for nearly a thousand years. It's vitally important that we respect the separation of powers and that we reserve to the judiciary the power to adjudge as to the sentence, taking into account the maximum sentence, which of course will be determined by this place.


The Labor proposal is that we absolutely condemn gun running and gun smuggling by increasing the maximum sentence. That sends the appropriate message to the judiciary and the general public that we are very strongly against gun smuggling. But the answer is never—never—to impose mandatory minimum sentencing. The experience wherever mandatory minimum sentencing is imposed is that it is unsuccessful. It is not capable of dealing with the evil that it is designed to combat. We know that the incentive for a defendant facing a mandatory minimum sentence is to fight the charge. We know that—when it comes to a question of fettering the discretion that's available to a judge, whether it's admitting somebody to bail or dealing with an issue of the sentence—the judge needs to have regard to all of the circumstances, particularly the circumstances of the commission of the offence and the personal circumstances of the defendant.


This is not the way to deal with the evil of gun trafficking. We know that the examples that have been given by the Law Council of Australia provide powerful evidence of the injustice that will be visited upon any defendant that is facing a mandatory minimum sentence.


Before I was interrupted, I gave an example of a prominent businessman who exported gunpowder cartridges, primer and propellant from Australia to Papua New Guinea without a permit, when the Lae Pistol Club was short of ammunition after the defendant's home in Lae, where the club's ammunition was stored, was destroyed in a fire. The defendant disguised the export in order to try to get the items into Papua New Guinea quickly. The magistrate who sentenced him accepted that he was a passionate sporting shooter and was only motivated to assist the club. All of the ingredients are there to enable that defendant to be sentenced to a minimum mandatory term of five years under this legislation.


We know that the circumstances of the case need to be taken into account in determining what a just sentence is for the individual circumstances of the case. We know that this justice minister—this justice minister with a tin ear—needs to be listening to the legal profession. He needs to be concerned about the principles that are involved here, rather than base politics.

"Katter, Bob, MP",AUS,2017-10-25,"



Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (17:23):  There is one other fact that should be raised. The minister said earlier on that he'd spoken to all of the gun representatives and they were all very happy. It would be no news to anyone in this place that I would speak to gun representatives almost on a weekly basis, and I take great pride in being their representative in this place. We don't have a sporting shooters party in Queensland, but we most certainly hold our hands up for that purpose. And there is one thing that needs to be brought to the attention of the House.


There are two magnificent machine-guns in all the world's history: the Owen gun and the Bren gun. They never break down; they just work forever. The Owen gun was built by a 19-year-old kid, who went down to the local machinery shop and said, 'Could you machine up these parts?' He gave them a photograph and diagrams, and six hours later he walked out with an Owen gun, which was, for those people who used it, one of the greatest pieces of machinery that the world had ever seen in weaponry. You see, any diesel fitter, boilermaker or fabricator—anyone—can get hold of this. And we have a vested interest in saying, 'Would the government's resources be used in separating the madmen?' As I said earlier today: reverse the ruling in Tarasoff's case. I'll take a bet, I will put $200 on the table, that the minister can't explain what the ruling in the Tarasoff case was. And don't go ringing up to find out before you get up to speak! If you reverse that rule, Hoddle Street wouldn't have taken place, Surry Hills wouldn't have taken place and Port Arthur wouldn't have taken place if the laws had been enforced.


There are 600 police employed in Australia persecuting all the innocent people that have gun licences and their time is not being spent pursuing the bad guys and separating them from their guns, and separating the people who are both bad and mad from their guns. There's no time being spent on that. If you look at the Port Arthur case, there is no justification for the police not having separated that person from those guns. I mean, they knew he had the guns, they knew he was crazy and they knew the evidence of his relatives that had been murdered and girlfriends that had been murdered. They knew all the evidence and yet they left him there. The time is not being spent on that.


The minister is going to punish anyone that's found bringing a shell case in his pocket back from overseas. I live in North Queensland, Minister, and we interface with New Guinea all the time. It is now the biggest rugby league area in the world and North Queensland is the biggest rugby league area in Australia so we are backwards and forwards all the time. In the Torres Strait, they let us go backwards and forwards as they have for 10,000 or 20,000 years. And because of the dangers that exist for us with the crocodiles, snakes, everything else, sharks in the water—we go diving for crayfish; my cousins and brother are up in the Torres Strait—there are guns going backwards and forwards because they are in their canoes. You 'll have half the population of Torres Strait in jail for five years! I don't know where you are going to get the money from to pay for all these people that you're going to have in jail. You have not thought this through at all. I have to advise the House that either all the gun groups in Australia are telling lies or the minister is telling lies, because they have said to me: 'They may well as have had a conversation with a gum tree.'



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Kennedy will resume his seat. I will remind you of standing orders, section 90, reflecting on member's character. It is highly disorderly.

  I could argue that I'm reflecting on behalf of all the gun representatives in Australia.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I remind you to tread carefully there. You've got 40 seconds if you want to keep going. 




Mr KATTER:
  We concentrate all the time on trying to separate the dangerous people from their weapons, and it seems to us that all the authorities want to do is to persecute people that have guns. The minister wasn't here earlier when I said that the bloke who had six police around his house was president of the local Rotary Club, he was president of the golf club, he was very active in rugby league in his town, and he was the town's leading dentist. You are criminalising the most decent people in our society. (Time expired)

Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (17:28):  I want to thank those who have made a contribution to this discussion, especially the member for Kennedy, who is making incredible sense over there, which is great to hear. Thank you so much for the contribution. On behalf of Labor, closing this debate, we abhor crime and violence, especially when it relates to gun violence, and that's why we have approached this debate with only one goal in mind—how we can keep Australians safe.


When we got a bill coming into the Senate that was a petty political wedge to make a political point about Labor, we decided to approach that bill in good faith and make a good law. So what we did was worked hard with the crossbench to make changes to that law so that, for the first time in this country, people who seriously run gun-trafficking operations can be put away in jail for life. The government actually supported those amendments. It is quite rare that we see this happen. Labor wanted to make a law that works, we got bipartisan support and it went through that other place.


I want members of parliament to be absolutely clear about what is going on here because we have agreement on new laws that will help make Australians safer. Instead of taking that agreement and making a good law that we could have in place in this country in a matter of a few minutes, the bloody-mindedness of the justice minister has taken hold. This is petty politics at its absolute lowest form. In the time that I have been involved in politics I have never seen someone so obviously put petty politics in the path of the community safety of Australians. I want to repeat that we could have a better law now or we could do what the justice minister wants us to do, which is to bring this parliament into deadlock over a law that everyone in this chamber agrees is very important. That is pathetic. It is absolutely pathetic.


I want to respond to one of the issues that the minister has raised in his contribution so far. He has said that Labor wants to support the status quo. Has the minister been asleep for this whole debate? That is completely and utterly wrong. What Labor wants is tough new sentencing for gun traffickers, because we don't want gun traffickers walking the streets; we want them in jail and, if necessary, in jail for life. The only thing that is standing in the path of this becoming Australian law in a matter of minutes is this minister here—this minister who is so willing to put petty politics ahead of the safety of the people that he professes to represent. This is disgraceful. It is a disgraceful use of time in this chamber.


We all know what's about to happen here. I just want to lay this out very clearly because I want people on the government side—the good people on that side of the House—to understand what it is they are about to come and vote for. They are about to come in here and vote for a bill that will send this parliament into deadlock. I want every person on the conservative side of politics who's listening to this right now to understand what this minister is making them do in front of their constituents. This minister is putting your votes in the path of tough new laws to stop gun traffickers and to put gun traffickers in jail for life. What's about to happen here is because of the minister's bloody-mindedness. We're going to vote a bill up to the other place and it's going to get rejected by the Senate, where it has been rejected three times already. This is pathetic. It is utterly pathetic. I don't know if there's a minister on the other side of the House who practices a form of politics which is as low as this.


We will not be supporting the amendment, as the minister knew we would not be supporting the amendment. Those amendments are not going to make Australians safer. We actually want to take a practical approach which is going to make good laws in this parliament. I only wish I could say the same of the minister and the government he represents.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling—Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Counter-Terrorism) (17:32):  Again I repeat that these amendments are important because the people on the government side of the House believe it's actually important that if you're involved in gun smuggling you spend a certain amount of time in prison. If the parliament were to come together to agree to these sensible amendments, what would happen is that parliament would send a very strong message that we believe that this is an extraordinary crime. We believe that gun running is a very serious crime; it's as severe as people smuggling, for example. We believe it's a very serious crime and, as a result, the parliament should come together and make sure that people who are engaged in it serve a minimum period in jail. That is what we're proposing here. That is what we have been proposing in relation to our crackdown on child sex offenders as well.


Labor, even though they introduced mandatory sentencing for people smuggling when in office, apparently now think that mandatory sentencing is a terrible thing in principle. Some of the members that spoke in this debate expressing that point of view actually spoke in 2010 expressing the opposite. But the point is that if mandatory sentencing is somehow evil in principle, then is Labor in office going to repeal the existing mandatory sentencing offences that we have for people smuggling and terrorism? Nobody on the Labor side has answered that question, which is a very reasonable question under the circumstances. Apparently they've had some road-to-Damascus conversion and now say how terrible mandatory sentencing is.


The government won't be changing its position, because we believe firmly that gun smuggling deserves a serious and appropriate sentence. That's what we on this side of the House believe. We believe it because smuggling just one gun can have enormous consequences for community safety and because you're not involved in gun smuggling unless you're doing it for the worst possible purpose. We know that guns are used by organised crime. They use them for standover tactics and violence. When guns fall into the wrong hands and they're moved about the community, they can do an enormous amount of damage.


We've been very concerned about the illegal firearms market since we arrived in office. Since 2013, we've taken very significant measures to crack down on the black market for guns. The National Anti-Gangs Squad, for example, is incredibly successful. We have strike teams based in every mainland state. We also have officers based in Tasmania, the ACT and the Northern Territory as liaison officers. They work side by side with their state and territory police colleagues, and they have successfully taken about 5½ thousand firearms or firearm parts off the streets.


These are the sorts of measures that we've been taking since we arrived in office. But this legislation and the amendments that I've moved to it remain a very important piece of the puzzle. I am disappointed that the Labor Party continue in their apparently ideological opposition to mandatory sentencing. I had hoped that they could join us in making sure that people who engage in gun smuggling actually serve an appropriate amount of time in prison, but clearly they're not prepared to change their minds. I think that is unfortunate for the Australian people. It's going to have detrimental effects on community safety, and they deserve to be condemned for it.

Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (17:36):  In international Disarmament Week, we are definitely all united in this parliament in seeking to end gun smuggling and to ensure that gun smugglers receive the prison terms that they deserve. I also want to join with members on the Labor side to say that the best way to ensure that gun smugglers and gun runners get the prison sentences that they deserve is not to implement a law that will act as a disincentive to people coming forward with information about gun-smuggling offences and to juries committing people in respect of the offences connected with gun smuggling.


We are very concerned about those issues, and we're also very concerned about unintended consequences. I am a vice-patron of the Queensland Rifle Association. I'm not the only one, I hasten to say, but I'm one of the vice-patrons of the Queensland Rifle Association, along with my friend the member for Bonner. Unfortunately, he is not in here tonight, but I know that he takes his vice-patron duties very seriously, as do I. I would hate to see a situation where a member of that rifle association or of any other rifle association, or any other person who had a legitimate and lawful interest in firearms in this country, was caught up in the unintended consequences of what this government and this minister are seeking to do.


Take, for example, a farmer who goes overseas. I've got farmers in my family. Some of them enjoy shooting for sporting purposes. Obviously, they've been pretty handy with guns their whole lives. In fact, I was speaking with one of my cousins about this when I saw him in country North Queensland over winter. What of a farmer who has never been overseas before who goes to the United States, attends a gun show and finds a gun part that he thinks will be helpful to use when he's controlling pests back on the farm? He buys one for himself and one for his mate down the road, thinking that his mate might find it useful as well. He intends selling one to his mate down the road when he gets back to Australia, so he buys two. Upon returning to Australia, he gets caught when he goes through Customs. He's honest with the officer and tells him that he intends to sell one of the parts to his friend. That would satisfy the elements of trafficking, and he would be looking at a mandatory five years in prison if this government's legislation were allowed to get up. Judges would have no choice but to imprison him in the event of that occurring.


What of the unintended consequences? We talk about judicial discretion. We're not talking about ill-informed or unprofessional discretion; we're talking about a situation where judges are entrusted with the obligation to impose a sentence that is appropriate. And the job of our parliament should be to arm those judges with the ability and the power to impose heavy sentences where heavy sentences are warranted. That's the job of this parliament. The job of this parliament is not to restrict unreasonably the sentences that a court can impose in the event that they're appropriate.


The job of this parliament is not to issue directions to a judge to impose sentences mandatorily. If we do that we're not only undermining judicial discretion and the separation of powers but putting judges in a position where they will have to convict and imprison people in the circumstances that I just described. In the circumstance I just described there is somebody—innocently and thinking that it's okay—bringing back these gun parts from another country and intending them to sell them to the farmer down the road. That's not someone who should, in my submission and in my view, be sentenced to five years imprisonment mandatorily because of a decision of this parliament—a parliament!


Parliaments are not ideally suited to predicting every possible combination or permutation of events. We can't lay down a code that describes what should happen in every circumstance or in every event. What we can do is to make laws for the peace, good government and order of this nation; we can set down criminal offences; and we can then equip judges with what they need to ensure that sentences are appropriate. Let's not determine the sentences in individual cases; let's have appropriate laws. (Time expired)

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (17:41):  I rise to speak on the Criminal Code Amendment (Firearms Trafficking) Bill 2017. I rise to support the bill that was carried by the Senate in February and which the government has sat on for eight months in an act of petulance, which typifies the attitude of this government towards the democratic processes.


Of course, the fundamental disagreement that we have over our position about maximum sentences versus their position of mandatory sentencing shows that they not only act in a petulant manner in the political sphere; they also don't seem to comprehend the need for the separation of powers to be at the core of the functioning of our nation. That principle is something that can't be bargained away. It's a principle which applies at the local, state and federal levels, and it's a principle which people who profess to support the rule of law should just understand as—dare I use the term—a mandatory principle.


But what we see today is a minister who, unlike most people in this place—we often get told that we grow older by multiples of the calendar while we're here—gets less mature the longer he is here.




Mr Keenan:
  A personal attack, is it?




Mr ALBANESE:
  The minister who is prepared to act in a petulant way and an entirely inappropriate way raises the issue of personal attacks. I wasn't going to raise what was said about the member for Cowan during the last election campaign—the member for Cowan, someone who has brought great dignity to this House of Representatives, someone who, in spite of the fact that it was at great risk to harmony and community cohesiveness in Perth, Western Australia, and in our nation, was attacked in the most outrageous way, including by someone who has the title of the Minister for Justice. And that is what is quite extraordinary.


Here we have a bill that could have become law in February. Instead, it's been sat on for month after month, and there has been a failure to bring it on for debate, a failure to accept that the principles that we were putting forward weren't divisible and a failure to act in a mature way, as a minister of the Crown should. The minister was sat down by the Speaker this week—something that doesn't happen too often, I've got to say. I was a minister for six years and it never happened to me. Most people in this place will go through their entire political career and, if they have the honour of being a minister of the Crown, they will never be sat down. It is quite an extraordinary occurrence. But this minister chose to engage in a debate which suggested that the support of paedophilia was something that was a partisan issue, whereas it is something to which everyone in this parliament is opposed in the strongest possible way, which is why he was shut down.


I won't cop that from a government that launches royal commissions based upon politics, whereas the single most significant royal commission that we brought about when in government was into institutional sexual abuse against children. And we did that at great political risk. We did that and it's made a difference to people's lives. To people who all of us know, it has made a difference, and it's made this country better. It's made this country better because we made this decision. Those opposite are just determined to play politics with everything—everything's about politics, which is why you have no credibility and why you're increasingly clutching at straws.

We could have dealt with this bill in February, and those of us on this side of the House who have community safety as our top priority have been waiting for eight months for this bill to come back into the House so we can make a good law. But, because of the utter petulance of the minister who sits across from me in the chamber, we are sending this parliament into deadlock.

Ms O'NEIL:
  We have been waiting eight months for the minister on the other side of the House to bring this bill back into the chamber so we can pass good laws in this parliament that have bipartisan support. The bipartisan support comes for Labor amendments that were moved in the other place and that for the first time in this country would allow serious gun traffickers to be put away for life. They were amendments moved by Labor senators, and they were voted for by your political parties. But, because of the petulance of the minister who sits opposite me, we have not had the opportunity to pass these laws. What your minister is doing—and you can go back to your electorates and talk to your constituents about this—is inserting into this bill something he knows that Labor will not accept.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fenner) (16:22):  As the member for Hotham has ably set out in this chamber, Labor will support tougher penalties for firearms trafficking but what we won't support are ineffective measures. The reintroduction of these measures is a desperate attempt by the coalition to distract from the fact that they are hopelessly divided on guns. Labor will seek to remove the mandatory minimum sentences because they don't work. We need to draw a distinction in this House between being tough on crime and being dumb on crime. Labor will listen to the experts because we want to make sure that we have less gun crime in Australia. We're proposing amendments to introduce new offences for aggravated firearms trafficking, but we won't support measures which will simply cause judges to be less likely to convict.


In the case of mandatory minimum sentences, the Attorney-General's Department document 'Guide to framing Commonwealth offences, infringement notices and enforcement powers' states that minimum penalties should be avoided on the basis that they interfere with judicial discretion to impose a penalty appropriate to the circumstance of a particular case; that they may create an incentive for a defendant to fight charges even when there's little merit in doing so; that they may preclude the use of alternative sanctions such as community service orders; and that they may encourage the judiciary to look for technical grounds to avoid a restriction on sentencing discretion, leading to anomalous decisions. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee received a wide range of evidence from stakeholders in inquiries on the two previous bills, which strongly opposed the imposition of mandatory sentences.


The Law Council of Australia has written most extensively on this issue. In their policy discussion paper on mandatory sentencing in May 2004, they went through in considerable detail the risks that mandatory sentencing creates. They noted that mandatory sentencing is inconsistent with Australia's international obligations, including the prohibition against arbitrary detention, in article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The right to a fair trial and the provision of prison sentences must, in effect, be subject to appeal, as per article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They also noted that mandatory minimums may breach Australia's obligations under articles 3, 37 and 40 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.


More important than our international obligations is the simple fact that mandatory minimum sentences make it less likely for convictions to be recorded and can lead to manifest unfairness. The Law Council gave examples of instances in which mandatory sentencing has led to outcomes which I don't think any member of this House would believe are just. They give the example of a 16-year-old with one prior conviction who received a 28-day prison sentence for stealing a bottle of spring water—a month in jail for stealing a bottle of water. A 17-year-old first-time offender received a 14-day prison sentence for stealing orange juice and Minties. I have to say, I went to a decent school, and I'm afraid there were classmates of mine who at some stage would have shoplifted orange juice and Minties, but I don't think anyone would have thought that they should have received a fortnight behind bars. The Law Council gives the example of a 15-year-old Aboriginal boy who received a 20-day mandatory sentence for stealing pencils and stationery and died while in custody. An Aboriginal woman, a first-time offender, received a 14-day prison sentence for stealing a can of beer. These manifestly unjust outcomes occurred as a result of mandatory sentencing.


The Law Council points to research which found that, when the public is fully informed about the particular circumstances of a case and an offender, there is a 90 per cent tendency to view judge's sentences as appropriate. That is from work by Geraldine Mackenzie and co-authors, published in 2012, in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology. The Law Council notes too that the imposition of mandatory minimum sentences can lead to unjust outcomes. The Law Council concludes by quoting the then Australian Human Rights Commissioner, the 'Freedom Commissioner', Mr Tim Wilson, now the member for Goldstein. He said:


… mandatory sentencing 'is an incremental stake stabbed in the heart of the foundations of our liberal democracy because it assumes that a centralised government with less information can make better decisions about individual cases than a decentralised courts with more information'.


The member for Goldstein has always stood for freedom, or so he tells us, so it will be interesting to those on this side of the House to see whether he exercises his freedom of conscience to cross the floor and vote with the Labor Party and uphold the principles that he stood for when he was Human Rights Commissioner—the principles he stood for in 2014 when he described mandatory sentencing as 'an incremental stake stabbed in the heart of the foundations of our liberal democracy'.


The criminologist Mark Kleiman describes the trade-off between severity and certainty in his book, When Brute Force Fails, and points out that, if you want to have less crime and less punishment, you need to recognise that offenders who are driven by the present are much more likely to respond to certainty—to the probability of conviction—than to severity, to the duration of the sentence. If you are thinking about committing a serious weapons offence, you are probably living in the moment and it is relatively unlikely that severity will play a bigger role in your mind than certainty. Yet that is the trade-off that this bill fails to recognise.


The Law Council noted that mandatory minimum sentences could increase Indigenous incarceration rates. We on this side of the House believe that incarceration should be added to the Closing the Gap targets, given that Australia's Indigenous incarceration rate is high and rising. Indeed, our overall incarceration rate is now the highest it's been since 1901. In all the time since Federation, Australia has never locked up as large a share of our population as we do today, with 207 out of every 100,000 adults currently behind bars. It's a higher incarceration rate than in Canada, Japan, France, India, Germany, Indonesia or Britain. We are incarcerating a higher share of our population than we have since Federation, at a time, over the last two decades, in which the murder rate and car theft rates have fallen significantly.


This comes at a significant cost to Australians, given that incarceration costs around $300 a day and $110,000 a year. In the United States, where nearly one per cent of adults are behind bars, there's a bipartisan movement towards being smarter on crime, recognising that we need to make better use of monitoring technology and that there are smarter approaches than mandatory sentences. This is a bipartisan push from Democrats and Republicans in the United States. It's a smart-on-crime measure, exactly the opposite of what we see in this government's call for mandatory sentences. We have a government that says we need mandatory sentences in order to make sure offenders are put behind bars. But the Law Council tells us that they will do just the opposite, because when mandatory sentences are in place judges and juries may be less likely to convict, knowing that there is no sentencing discretion.


Finally, I want to do something which is a little unusual in this place, which is to pay tribute to those on the other side of the House. One of the great legacies of the Howard government was the package of gun reforms put in place after the Port Arthur massacre. It is too easy to forget how quickly Australia acted at that time. The police ministers' meeting took place 12 days after the Port Arthur massacre, before all of the 35 victims had been laid to rest. It is to the credit of John Howard and Tim Fischer that they were willing to act and tighten our firearms laws. We refer to the gun buyback, the 600,000 firearms—about a fifth of all guns in Australia—that were handed back into police stations. But it's important to remember, too, the tightening of licensing and regulation requirements, the restrictions on access to semi-automatic weapons and the limits that were placed on sales.


The United States occasionally misreads the lessons of Australia's tightening of gun laws, which took place in 1997-98. Disappointingly, following the mass shooting in Las Vegas that took place so recently, Leah Libresco wrote in The Washington Post that mass shootings were too rare in Australia prior to the buyback to show any evidence of progress and that the Australian gun law tightening did not provide clear evidence for the United States.


In fact, that is not true. If we define a mass shooting as the killing of five or more victims, Australia was experiencing an average of one mass shooting per year in the decade leading up to Port Arthur. In the decade afterwards, there was not a single mass shooting. The odds of this being due to chance alone are less than one in 100.


But the work that Christine Neill and I did when I was at the Australian National University found this had a significant impact on reducing gun deaths—principally through reducing gun suicides. After all, the person most likely to kill you with a gun is yourself. We found when we looked at the time series that the reforms seemed to cause the death rate to fall a little faster. But, in particular, if we looked at cross-state differences and compared jurisdictions where more weapons were bought back and those where fewer weapons were bought back, the largest fall in gun deaths occurred in the jurisdictions where the most guns were bought back. We didn't see any evidence of displacement effects, and we estimated that the firearm reforms of 1996 save around 200 lives year.


It is in no way in my political interest to praise those on the other side of the House, but it is vital for our friends in the United States to get a clear-eyed reading of the impact of the Australian gun reforms of 20 years ago. They were smart gun reforms. They were supported by this side of the House. We supported them because they were based on clear evidence.


We call on the coalition today to make sure that their firearms measures are, again, based on clear evidence. We call on them to listen to the Law Council and to prosecutors, who say that mandatory sentences may make us less safe, not more safe.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2017-10-25,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling—Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Counter-Terrorism) (16:35):  I thank all honourable members for their contribution to the debate on the Criminal Code Amendment (Firearms Trafficking) Bill 2017, which will introduce new mandatory minimum sentences and increase maximum penalties for firearms-trafficking offences. There have been a wide range of statements made in this debate. In particular, we heard repeatedly from those opposite that mandatory minimum sentences should be opposed as they remove incentives for offenders to cooperate with law enforcement or to plead guilty. However, if members had read the amendments introduced by the government, they would have known that they do, indeed, provide for discounts on the mandatory minimum sentences if offenders plead guilty or if they cooperate with our law enforcement agencies. These amendments provide clear incentives for offenders to plead guilty and to cooperate with law enforcement.


We also heard from those opposite about the case of former Victorian police chief commissioner Simon Overland, who, of course, would not be captured by this bill. The bill is aimed at traffickers—people with intent—not those who make honest mistakes. This was clearly an honest mistake and, of course, he was not charged with any offence. This, as I indicated previously, reflects the discretion that our law enforcement agencies have and continue to exercise each and every single day when it comes to deciding whether to initiate a prosecution.


We also heard that juries would be less likely to convict gun runners if they knew they would get a mandatory minimum sentence. As my colleague the member for La Trobe, who has a lot of experience in these matters, being a former police officer, said in his contribution, 'Juries are actually tough, and they don't have a problem convicting people who are guilty of crimes, and they wouldn't have a problem convicting gun traffickers.'


We also heard from a number of speakers opposite that they do not support mandatory minimum sentences, as a matter of principle. That's interesting because they actually introduced, when they were in office, mandatory sentencing for the crime of people smuggling, in 2010. At the time, Labor's then Attorney-General said:


The use of mandatory minimum penalties reflects the seriousness of the activity being prosecuted. It allows the court to determine an appropriate penalty within the minimum and maximum set by parliament.


The then Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, said at the time:


This legislation includes mandatory minimum penalties for organisers and created a new offence of providing material support for people smuggling …


It was supported at the time by members on that side of the House who are still in the House. The member for Gorton, who was once the Minister for Home Affairs, supported mandatory sentencing at the time. Others who, funnily enough, even spoke in these debates against mandatory sentencing spoke for mandatory sentencing when the people-smuggling bill was introduced in 2010.


The fact is that a combination of mandatory minimum sentences and increased maximum penalties sends the strongest possible message that the illegal trafficking of guns will not be tolerated. Unless a mandatory sentence is introduced, it will remain possible for low sentences to be issued to offenders. I reiterate the fact that, when this bill was debated in the Senate earlier this year, the government, in good faith, supported amendments related to increased sentences for firearms trafficking. This was obviously in line with our election commitment—but also in line with our election commitment that we took to the Australian people in 2016 was the fact that there would be a mandatory sentence for this heinous crime.


If members are truly serious about ensuring that courts impose adequate sentences on gun traffickers, they will support all of the measures contained within this bill—but, sadly, it appears that members opposite will not be supporting mandatory minimum sentences. I implore them to get on board with this tough legislation. This bill and bipartisan support for it within the parliament will send the strongest possible message that we won't tolerate gun crime, and it will create the strongest possible deterrent. The Australian people shouldn't be subject to the sorts of violence that can result from gun smuggling. It actually complements the very tough gun law regime that we have place in Australia. Again I would urge the Labor Party to rethink. If it was good enough to introduce, support and pass mandatory sentences for people smuggling in 2010, it's good enough to support mandatory sentences for gun smuggling in 2017.

"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2017-10-25,"



Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (18:15):  I rise today to speak about the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2017. This bill contains eight schedules, which deal with different elements of veterans legislation that seek to clarify, improve and streamline the operation of law and processes within the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Given the detail in the bill, it was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. The committee thoroughly examined the legislation, held public hearings and reported back to the parliament on 13 June 2017. I would like to thank the committee members and all those submitters on their work in reviewing this legislation.


As we understand it, schedule 1 seeks to amend the provisions under which the Veterans' Review Board operates by aligning certain provisions of the board with similar provisions to that of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. As members may be aware, the board is a statutory authority whose role is to provide independent merits review of decisions about disability pensions, war widow and war widower pensions and attendant allowances under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, rehabilitation compensation and other benefits under both the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and the new Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Defence Force) Bill 2017.


The amendment in schedule 1 seeks to modernise and improve the operations of the board in a number of ways. Item 1 deals with the board's objectives. As it stands, the board's objectives are listed as providing a mechanism of review that is fair, just, economical, informal and quick. These amendments do align the VRB with the changes made to the AAT under the Tribunals Amalgamation Act 2015. It provides that, in carrying out its functions, the board must pursue the objective of providing a mechanism of review that is accessible, fair, just, economical, informal and quick, is proportionate to the importance and complexity of the matter and promotes public trust and confidence in the decision-making of the board. This section also imposes an ongoing obligation on both the claimant and the Department of Veterans' Affairs during the period until the board has determined the matter to lodge with the board a copy of any document that is in possession which is relevant to the review that has not been lodged previously. 


In addition, it provides the board with the power to vary or revoke a decision made under the alternative dispute resolutions process with the consent of the parties and where the board is satisfied that it is within its powers and otherwise appropriate to do so. The section also requires the Repatriation Commission and any person representing the commission in a review to use their best endeavours to assist the board in fulfilling its legislative objective in line with the expanded objective, which deals with the proportionality and public trust.


Finally, this section provides the principal member with the power to dismiss an application for a review of a decision if they are satisfied that the application is frivolous, vexatious, misconceived or lacking in substance, has no reasonable prospect of success or is otherwise an abuse of process. The final element which gives the principal member the power to dismiss an application has caused some angst within the veterans community for a number of reasons. The Veterans' Review Broad is a unique board that recognises the exceptional nature of military service. It provides an opportunity for veterans to be heard and, while rulings are legal, it is meant to operate in a less adversarial way. It is for this reason that veterans historically have been unable to be represented by lawyers at this point. As stated by the Returned and Services League of Australia in their submission to the Senate inquiry, the Veterans' Review Board has always been the first level of appeal. The veteran should always have his or her say and this should remain as such. In addition, the RSL argued that individuals should be able to present to the board, as it gives them the opportunity to be heard by three individuals in contrast to one DVA delegate.


There was also concern raised during the Senate committee process about the ability to delegate these powers, which the bill was silent on. Consequently, during the Senate committee process, the principal member of the board, Mr Doug Humphreys, provided written information to the committee to allay these concerns, stating that the power would rest wholly with the principal member. In his correspondence, Mr Humphreys also stated that there were few occasions where he would utilise this provision, claiming that, during the current principal member's tenure of seven years, there have been only three matters where it may have been appropriate to hold a preliminary hearing to consider whether the matter should be dismissed on these grounds. Given the small number of times that this would be utilised, Labor does not believe the benefits outweigh the significant concerns.


Labor believes that the Veterans' Review Board was always meant to be a chance where a veteran could be heard. It is meant to be a less adversarial process which accounts for the unique nature of military service. We do support the intention of the bill to align the principles of the VRB and the AAT and are supportive of the broader changes. While we respect that the principal member has outlined their process and how they will engage with an individual, we do not believe that this clause is fitting with regard to the overriding philosophy of the board. As such, Labor proposed—and communicated with the government on this—an amendment which would remove this section. However, it is my understanding that, in the third reading stage, the government will move this amendment, along with a number of other changes. We welcome this change. Labor made very, very clear that this is something that we believe, as a result of consultation with the community, needs to occur. I am very, very pleased that the government has taken that on board and will relieve us of having to move our amendment. We will support the amendment of the government.


Schedule 2 seeks to simplify the appointment process of individuals to the Specialist Medical Review Council, progress whole-of-government requirements for digital transformation, remove red tape in commencing reviews and provide reimbursement of certain travel expenses. The Specialist Medical Review Council is an independent statutory body that reviews the contents of the statements of principles or a decision of the Repatriation Medical Authority not to issue such a statement. The council consists of medical practitioners and medical scientists appointed as councillors by the minister and selected by the convenor of the council for a particular review on the basis of their expertise on the injury or the disease relevant to the statement of principles subject which is under review. Essentially, if someone believes there is an issue with a statement of principle, they will take it to the council for review. The council then appoints a panel which reviews the statement of principle. If they agree there is an issue, it is then returned to the RMA for review.


Under the current arrangements, the minister must select members for the panel from a list or lists of nominations submitted by colleges or other bodies of medical practitioners or scientists. In practice, colleges forward the names of candidates who have responded to advertisements without assessing or recommending candidates. In addition, when making appointments, the minister must have regard to the branches of science or the expertise as necessary to decide review matters and must appoint not fewer than two councillors with experience in each branch. Given these requirements, the process of appointing members takes around three months or longer. This affects the council's ability to perform its functions. It's our understanding that under the amendments the requirements which fix the number of councillors with experience at each branch of medical science will be repealed.


While the minister is still required to have regard to the branches for the expertise needed to decide matters referred to the council, they will have greater discretion as to the number of councillors needed. While it makes sense to have a standing membership from which to draw councillors, there are not necessarily always at least two members from each area of expertise, particularly when it relates to uncommon specialities. This section also includes a requirement that at least one councillor must have at least five years experience in the field of epidemiology, the branch of medicine which deals with the study of the distribution and determinants of disease in populations, and with investigation into the sources and causes of infectious disease.


The review process, as it stands, also requires the council to advertise the date of its first meeting with respect to a particular review. This is described as unnecessary and prescriptive, given the practicalities of arranging a meeting with specialists with busy schedules. Changes to this section will still require notice published in the Gazette at least 28 days before the first meeting of councillors.


Schedule 2 also seeks to provide financial assistance for individual representatives of organisations for any necessary attendance to accompany individuals or representatives to attend a council to make an oral submission. It will make several amendments which enable the convenor of the council to give written directions about the manner of lodging requests for reviews or applications, enabling the council to adopt electronic lodgement of requests for reviews rather than requiring a hard copy form as required by the Veterans' Entitlements Act.


In the light of the ongoing Digital Transformation Agenda, it is appropriate that the council should have the capacity to develop online forms and lodgements. This will streamline the processes and reduce unnecessary red tape. The government assures us that these amendments will not change the threshold for the specialists who are appointed to the panel; rather, the amendments focus on streamlining the process of appointing specialists to the panel, providing financial assistance and reducing red tape. Given these assurances, Labor is supportive of these amendments.


Schedule 3 relates to the international agreements and gives the minister power to make agreements with foreign governments to cover the provision of benefits and payments for the benefits under the MRCA and DRCA. This amendment is required as under the current arrangements the minister can only enter into the agreement for the provision of benefits and treatment, including rehabilitation, that are comparable to those provided under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Current and former ADF members now have coverage under other veterans' entitlements portfolio acts in addition to the Veterans' Entitlements Act and, as such, there is a need for arrangements which refer to benefits and payments, including rehabilitation, that are provided by the Repatriation Commission or the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission under the VEA, the MRCA, the DRCA or the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act. This is a logical extension of the current arrangements that ensures that all veterans' legislation is covered. I understand there will be an amendment to the title of this and that, rather than calling it 'agreements', it will be 'arrangements', and we will support that amendment by the government.


Schedule 4 legislates the employer incentive scheme payments, which are made to employers in the form of wage subsidies to encourage them to engage an injured veteran who has found it difficult to compete in a tight labour market. The department provides vocational rehabilitation to eligible serving and former Defence Force members, reservists and cadets following service related injury or disease. Vocational rehabilitation delivers assistance to members to help them achieve sustainable employment where possible and return them to the workforce at at least the level of their pre-injury employment. These services include assessment, guidance or counselling, functional capacity assessment, work experience, vocational training and jobseeking assistance. It also may involve incentive payments to employers to facilitate civilian employment of veterans. While the department has been able to facilitate these payments under existing provisions, this amendment will strengthen and clarify the legislation around these payments.


Labor is supportive of measures which assist veterans to move to and retain employment. Vocational rehabilitation plays an important role in assisting eligible veterans with finding or retaining employment. It can assist with transition from military to civilian employment for members of the ADF and peacekeeping forces who may experience difficulty in obtaining or holding civilian employment.


Schedule 5 amends the MRCA and the DRCA to facilitate information sharing between the MRCC and the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation with respect to certain service related compensation claims. These amendments will implement a recommendation by the Review of Military Compensation Arrangements which was intended to improve the information-sharing framework for incapacity and superannuation benefits between the MRCC and the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation. While the MRCC is authorised to request information from the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation to assist with the calculation of incapacity payments, there is no express provision to allow the MRCC to provide information to the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation to assist with their assessment of superannuation benefits. As such, at present all requests to the MRCC for information from the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation are undertaken in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act 1982, which is a cumbersome and time-consuming process accounting for approximately 20 per cent of all FOI requests received by the department on behalf of the MRCC.


These amendments, we are informed, will provide a stronger foundation for the MRCC to provide the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation with the information needed to make an assessment of the superannuation benefit. Requests from the CSC to the MRCC for claims information are increasingly being received for the purpose of conducting superannuation investigations through the useful and relevant medical and rehabilitation information held by the MRCC. Enabling the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation to use information held by the MRCC will also avoid the need to send Defence Force members for further medical assessment where the MRCC already holds the relevant information which could be used by the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation to determine benefits. Apart from saving time and effort, this would also prevent Defence Force members from having to explain their circumstances to different medical professionals. This is particularly important in the cases of members who are suffering from psychological conditions, including those which have arisen from physical or psychological abuse. This will prevent any retraumatisation as a result of having to ongoingly explain their circumstances. 


I must note that this section has caused some concern within the veterans community through the Senate inquiry process. Senators raised a number of privacy concerns with the committee, noting there is some confusion within the Defence community as to what type of information is being shared. Many of the submitters called for a privacy impact assessment to be conducted on schedule 5 of the bill, and I understand the government has completed this process.


Labor is supportive of the measures listed in schedule 5 to help veterans reverse the process and to reduce the unnecessary work. It is important, I think, that we note that the time taken to process claims by DVA has been a longstanding issue with many veterans. Veterans and their loved ones have regularly expressed to me the frustration of having to tell their story again and again. This amendment seeks to address this, and that is why we're supportive of it. However, I do understand these privacy concerns and certainly have supported the calls to conduct a privacy impact assessment. I am pleased that the government has done that.


Schedule 6 seeks to amend the MRCA to provide the minister with the power to delegate his or her powers and functions to the members of the MRCC, employees of the department or persons engaged or appointed under the Public Service Act 1999. This is a provision which exists under the other act, the VEA, but it appears to have been omitted from the development process of the MRCA in 2004. This omission has prevented the implementation of some of the administrative reforms to achieve efficiencies across the department as part of the government's commitment to reduce red tape. Examples that have been provided of the type of determinations which might be delegated include determination of an interest rate payable on a lump sum payment of permanent impairment compensation; minor determinations concerning reimbursement of travel expenses; requirements for medical examinations; and the types of payments that may be deducted from payments of weekly compensation. Delegating authority for minor matters to appropriate employees will enable quicker decision-making in relation to small issues and reduce unnecessary red tape. The department have assured Labor that delegation levels would be set at either band 1 or band 2 or at the chief operating officer level only, to ensure that the employee has the appropriate skill set to be approving these decisions. On that condition, Labor will support this amendment.


Schedule 7 will amend the legislation to exempt certain legislative instruments from section 14(2) of the Legislation Act 2003 and enable these legislative instruments to incorporate material contained in other non-disallowable legislative instruments or other non-legislative writings in force from time to time.


The current requirement to amend the Veterans' Affairs portfolio legislative instruments to incorporate changes in non-disallowable instruments has caused significant administrative issues for the department. These changes will essentially allow materials to be updated with new references to information without lodging each individual instrument into the parliament. Many of the legislative instruments include references to external documents which are incorporated by reference into instruments that are legally regarded as being parts of the instrument. As such, any change to such documents can't be recognised unless the changed versions are incorporated into the legislative instrument by an amendment or a replaced instrument. This can cause significant administrative issues and unnecessary delays.


An example of this can be seen in relation to the availability of new rehabilitation appliances. The availability of the new equipment will be delayed, as the legislative instrument in the case of the Treatment Principles, which incorporates the document under which the appliance may be provided, would need to be amended to refer to the changed date of the policy document. As we can see, that's quite an ordeal, and for that reason Labor will be supporting this amendment.


The final schedule deals with the repeal of redundant and spent provisions administered in the Veterans' Affairs portfolio concerning benefits that are no longer payable, and it makes consequential amendments in relation to the repeal. This was originally proposed as part of the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2015) Bill 2015, which lapsed with the end of parliament in April 2016. The proposed amendments seek to remove the following spent provisions: the clean energy advance during a period before 1 July 2012; parts providing for one-off payments to older Australians in 2006, 2007 and 2008; the Economic Security Strategy payment from 2008; and the educational tax refund payment in 2012.


However, a provision has been inserted that will ensure that, in a circumstance where a person is found to have been eligible for one of the payments due to a retrospective assessment of the pension, they will still be able to access the spent provision. The Veterans' Affairs portfolio is supportive of these changes, and therefore we are also and think that this is an appropriate way to go.


The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2017 seeks to streamline the operation of the law and to improve processes for veterans. Labor is supportive of the changes, which will improve the process for veterans. However, as stated, we do believe that we need to remove one section of schedule 1. As I've said, it's my understanding that the government will move that amendment, and we certainly welcome them paying careful consideration to Labor's views. We certainly welcome the government doing that and look forward to continuing to work in a bipartisan way. I think that this legislation not only has bipartisan support but now accurately reflects the views of the veterans community. Overall, it will be welcomed by the veterans community as a sensible piece of legislation and one that we have worked together to land perfectly.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2017-10-25,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (18:38):  Can I borrow your speech? I just want to say to the member for Kingston that I was only half joking!




Ms Rishworth:
  Yeah, right!




Mr SNOWDON:
  But I do want to say, whilst you're here, congratulations on being elevated into the shadow cabinet. It is great recognition of your good work and of your good work to come as a minister in a future government. So, well done to you.




Mr Tehan:
  Oh—




Mr SNOWDON:
  I'm going to talk about you in a minute, so be careful! There are a couple of things that I think are important in this Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2017, though. The member for Kingston made this point towards the end of her speech, and I know she thinks this to be the case—and I know it to be the case. It's about the way in which there is strong bipartisan support for this legislation and the way in which the minister has been dealing with the opposition and the way in which opposition has been working with the minister to try to secure better outcomes for veterans, by and large, across the country. Now, there will be differences from time to time, but it's important that we accept our obligations as legislators to try to get the best possible outcomes that we can without politicising the process for our veterans. There are a couple of areas within this parliament where that seems to be happening and others where it's not.


If you'll forgive me, I just want to make the point that bipartisanship in trying to represent the interests of veterans in this place and to make changes which suit their needs is very important, and it's being done in a constructive way. I know that, in the context of the recent suicide report, we've heard both from the government and the opposition, through the minister and through the member for Kingston, and they have both made vital contributions to that discussion, but again showing very little difference, in terms of the final outcome and the desired outcome, from this parliament, represented by them as the spokespersons for both the government and the opposition, to get the best possible outcome for veterans. That, to me, is what this is about. I have to say that, in my own experience as a minister in this space, that was also the case when we were in government. And I expect it to be the case into the future, because we don't want the veterans community wondering why it is that we're playing politics around their interests and their concerns.


I have that same relationship in many ways with the member for Hasluck, in dealing with Indigenous health issues. We meet regularly. We discuss issues. We won't always agree, but we have a common interest in making sure that we try, as a parliament, to get the best possible outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and in other areas. We, Senator Dodson from Western Australia and I, are attempting to work collaboratively with Minister Scullion in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs space. That's somewhat more difficult, because it's a bit more of a contested space. But the bottom line is: there's a genuine desire to try to work in a bipartisan way.


I just want to contrast that, if I may, with the way in which we've seen the member for Stirling, as the Minister for Justice, operate in this parliament over the last two days and the very divisive nature of the way in which he has addressed this place. We don't need it. It's an insult to the parliament. It's an insult to the community and to all Australians who listen to this place. They expect us to do better. As to the responses that the minister made in question time yesterday, I think the member for Kennedy described, in a contribution in this parliament today, the member for Stirling as the worst minister he'd seen in 44 years in politics. I've never seen a contribution like that which was made by the member for Stirling in response to a question yesterday. And today we just had a debate which resulted in the opposition, with the support of the Independents and the crossbenchers, opposing the government on important measures relating to the justice portfolio. We've seen the government, through the Prime Minister and the member for Stirling, yesterday and today, try and insult the intelligence of the Australian community by saying that the Australian opposition, through the Leader of the Opposition and other members, were not supportive of the Australian Federal Police. That is just plain wrong. It debases this parliament for the Prime Minister to make those sorts of insulting remarks about the Leader of the Opposition and other Labor people—the opposition generally—by saying that, somehow or other, we do not support the work of the Australian Federal Police. That is not accurate, it's not correct and it shouldn't be done. In fact, we should be using the exemplar of the minister who is sitting at the table and his shadow who is sitting at the table to say: 'We can work cooperatively in this space, and let's sit down and do it. We don't need to be divided over issues of such great national importance as the role of the Federal Police in this country.'


It's very, very important, in my view, that we try and seek to do things in a cooperative way in this place. I know it's a contested space. I know that, in the way in which this parliament operates, oppositions oppose and governments try and kick the guts out of the opposition. That's all well and good. But it's not appropriate in areas of public policy of the greatest concern to the Australian community. We should be trying to resolve our issues in an appropriate way. We don't do that by denigrating one another and we don't do it, in my view, by insulting the intelligence of the Australian community and saying that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, and his shadow ministerial team and the Labor backbench are somehow or other not supportive of the Australian Federal Police. That is just plain wrong. I know that any Australians who might be listening to this debate would say they agree that this should not be the case.


But I want to go back to the legislation. I know that the minister, working with the Department of Veterans' Affairs and with the opposition, through the member for Kingston, has come to a conclusion about eight schedules in this piece of legislation. We have heard from the shadow minister and the minister that they have agreed to amend schedule 1 to recognise the issues which were raised by the veterans community about a particular aspect of that schedule—and that is as it should be. And we know that the veterans community are exercised by the fact that they want to make sure that their interests are properly protected and advanced within this legislation. The proposals to dismiss the prospect of reviews, in schedule 1—an application dismissed as frivolous, vexatious, misconceived or lacking in substance, or which has no reasonable prospect of success or is otherwise an abuse of the process of the board—were of concern to the stakeholders. I'm indebted to the work of the Parliamentary Library and their excellent Bills Digest, which enumerates some of the concerns which were expressed about this particular part of the legislation by representatives of the veterans community.


And I think it's worthwhile pointing out that in accepting that there was no need for that amendment, which was proposed originally by the government, the government has actually responded positively to the concerns that have been expressed by the veterans community and by the member for Kingston—and that's a very good thing. Whilst a number of points of concern were raised, there is no question in my view that the amendments as proposed will have the result that's required and make the legislation better.


I'm not going to go through—as the shadow minister has done already—each of the schedules of this legislation. That will serve no particular purpose other than to bore those who are listening—because they have already heard it. I did ask in a flippant way whether I should just use the opposition spokesperson's speech—because it did, as the government has done, outline the detail of the legislation. But I do want to go more generally to the issue of how we have a responsibility to make sure, in a changing environment, that we do all we possibly can to support our veterans.


It was a salutary lesson the other day when I sat and listened to the minister talk about the suicides. The fact is that, when in uniform, the suicide rate for Australian serving men and women is a lot less than it is in the general population; but, for that group of young Australians under the age of 24 who are veterans, it's a lot higher. I think the average length of service—the minister can correct me—for Australian serving personnel is around 7½ to eight years. We know that there are people who serve until they're 60. Congratulations to them, and we thank them very much for their wonderful service. But the young Australians who join the Defence Force when they're 17, 18 or 19 and leave the Defence Force in their mid-20s are the most at risk. And one of the issues which has been of concern not only to the minister but to the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the defence organisations is that we lose track of people once they leave—and that's for a whole range of reasons. It's really difficult. You can't compel people who leave the uniform to remain in touch.


You can't compel people who separate from the Defence Force to retain contact with their unit. We can't compel them to be members of a representative organisation like the RSL or some other organisation. We just can't. There are some who leave dispirited, and perhaps with a whole range of issues around authority as a result of their service, and they don't want anything to do with the uniform—they just don't want anything to do with it. Yet, potentially, they are the ones most in need. Our aspiration must be, somehow or another, to be able to track those people so that there is someone watching out for them.


That is extremely difficult. It's not something that the minister or the department can manufacture. I think it's something that organisations supporting veterans may have better access to, because it really means people going out and looking. If you've got mates while you're in the Defence Force, let's hope you keep those mates after it. I know in my father's case—he was a serving member in the Second World War—that he kept very close contact with his unit right until his death. That was great, but it doesn't happen often enough for some young people.


When people do cry out for help we've got to do what we can immediately. If there are people who, say, have a claim against the Commonwealth because of their service, we need to expedite the process for their claim to be heard, to make sure their claim is properly represented and to make sure their voice is properly heard so that their claim is met as quickly as possible—as this legislation is designed to do. If we don't, then we may end up in a situation where someone might do something which we would not want them to do. That is really very important.


I know that the department is challenged by this all the time, because it's not something that's easily overcome. But I do know, and I want to commend the minister and ask him to tell his department, how much we do appreciate the work they do. We might have differences about some of the decisions made about staffing, VAN officer and those sort of things but, ultimately, the people I've met in the Department of Veterans' Affairs are very highly motivated towards attending to the veterans' needs and veterans' families' needs.


As I've said continually in this place, we should make sure that anyone who walks through the doors of Kapooka understands from the day they walk in that they they're a potential client of the Department of Veterans' Affairs until the day they die. If they can accept that proposition as early as that, they'll see it as normal, once they leave, to have an association with the department. I would say—and this is a message which I know shouldn't rest with the minister—that we need to make sure there's never ever again another thought about having the Department of Veterans' Affairs absorbed into another agency. That should never happen. I don't think it will happen. It certainly won't happen under a Labor government. I know there have been some who have posited that proposal over the years, but let's make sure it's rejected whenever it's put.

"Hart, Ross, MP",ALP,2017-10-25,"



Mr HART
 (Bass) (18:53):  I echo the sentiments expressed by the member for Lingiari about the spirit of cooperation and bipartisanship that infects the area of Veterans' Affairs. Unlike the unfortunate circumstances this afternoon with respect to equally important legislation dealing with gun trafficking, this minister understands that it's really important to develop and encourage a spirit of bipartisanship—particularly around this vitally important area of veterans' affairs.


I'm always very pleased to speak on legislation affecting our veterans community, like this Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2017. I was very fortunate during my legal career to have represented veterans, commencing with veterans of the Second World War and then succeeding generations, in connection with pension claims. I have been able to gain an insight into that community, particularly those who sought to battle on and delayed making any claim for support from the taxpayer.


I fondly recall many veterans who recounted the fact that they tried to get on with their lives, despite in some cases having severe trauma which should have been the subject of an earlier claim. These veterans often found it difficult to make a late claim for TPI, for example, because of their willingness to put up with many conditions until pain or incapacity proved insurmountable.


It was and is a privilege to represent all of those veterans, each with their own unique stories of service, hardship, mateship and, of course, their postservice lives. If there was a common thread through all of these claims—whether it was a seaman who served in the Second World War in HMAS Shropshire and was exposed to high levels of radiation, someone who served in North Africa and washed his kit in petrol, or someone who damaged his knees, unsurprisingly, in parachute training—it was the volume of service and medical material that had to be trawled through in order to build a case for the veteran's claim. Often my involvement, for very practical reasons, only commenced once the matter had been unsuccessful before the Veterans' Review Board, the VRB. In many cases, delay in the resolution of a meritorious claim would have been avoided if some person with suitable knowledge and training had been in a position to review the material, advise as to the evidence and instruct medical experts as to what reports may have been required.


The object of veterans' affairs legislation is beneficial. In other words, the legislation should be construed in favour of the applicant veteran. The system should work in a manner which facilitates the resolution of claims in a manner which is fair, just, economical, informal and quick. My experience and the feedback I've received from veterans support groups would suggest that more work would need to be done to achieve that object. Labor is supportive of changes which will clarify, improve or streamline the operation of the laws and processes within the department. This is something that I strongly believe in and something which should also be subject to a process of continuous improvement.


The bill contains eight schedules which deal with a variety of different elements within the legislation. The bill was considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Labor supported the referral to enable a thorough examination of the legislation. The overriding consideration is to ensure that the legislation operates as intended and that veterans are no worse off as a result of these changes. Our obligation—that is, the obligation of this place—to those who have served on behalf of our nation is to ensure that we do not, through changes that we make in this place, place them at any additional disadvantage.


Schedule 1 within the legislation seeks to amend the provisions which govern the Veterans' Review Board. This is designed to ensure that these provisions are aligned with similar provisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The VRB is a statutory authority. It's designed to provide independent merits review of decisions in connection with disability pensions, war widows and war widow pensions, a tenant allowance under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and, of course, the rehabilitation, compensation and other benefits under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. The amendments are designed to ensure that the operations of the board are modernised and improved to ensure accessibility, fairness, justice, economy, informality and speedy resolution. The operation of the board should be proportionate to the importance and complexity of an individual matter and, generally speaking, the operation of the board should promote public trust and confidence in the decision-making of the board.


As a legal practitioner, I know that independent merits review is a vitally important aspect of ensuring that, in the administration of complex systems of pensions entitlement, the applicant is able to have a decision reviewed without involving the expense of a legal practitioner in a complex formal process. One of the central aspects of merits review is access to proper material to found a decision. The legislation imposes an ongoing obligation upon both the applicant claimant and the Department of Veterans' Affairs to lodge with the board a copy of any document in their possession which is relevant to the review and has not been lodged previously.


It is notable that the Repatriation Commission and any person representing the commission in a review are required to use their best endeavours to assist the board in fulfilling the board's legislative objectives of accessibility, fairness, justice, economy, informality and speed of resolution. I must note that, whilst my experience in my dealings with representatives of the Repatriation Commission was almost without exception positive, there are and have been concerns expressed by the veterans community that the department and the commission often take a position towards the claimant applicant which is adversarial in nature. The formal introduction of an obligation to use best endeavours to assist the board in fulfilling those objectives is a positive step.


Schedule 1 also introduces provisions which would entitle the principal member to dismiss an application if they are satisfied that the application is frivolous, is vexatious, is misconceived, is lacking in substance, has no reasonable prospect of success or is otherwise an abuse of process. On balance, the provision of this express power is claimed by the minister to be appropriate, although it's unlikely there'll be many occasions in which it would be appropriate to dismiss an application without proceeding to a final hearing. I thank the minister for his ability to remove this particular clause from the legislation. As I said earlier, the spirit of bipartisanship with respect to this area of public policy is most important.


I know that on this side of the House, and certainly as conceded by the minister, we would be concerned if any power were used to deny an applicant an opportunity to put their case, even if their case appeared to have low prospects of success. It is understandable, of course, that our veterans community would be concerned about the introduction into legislation of any such power, but as a legal practitioner I understand and respect that courts have under their inherent jurisdiction a power to dismiss in these circumstances. Obviously, as a statutory tribunal, the Veterans' Review Board cannot exercise any inherent review powers, so these powers, if they were to be appropriate, must be conferred expressly.


This is obviously a balancing exercise. Lawyers are not permitted to appear before the Veterans' Review Board; the procedure is supposed to be informal. A case may not have been assembled with the assistance of a person with knowledge of procedure, as I have indicated earlier. It is important that the documents are reviewed and organised so that the Veterans' Review Board gets to consider the best possible case. As has been conceded, the veteran deserves an opportunity to be heard. It is always my preference for the applicant to have the opportunity to present their case.


Schedule 2 of the bill simplifies the appointment process for those who are to be appointed to the Specialist Medical Review Council. It progresses the whole-of-government requirements for digital transformation, removing red tape and commencing reviews and provides for reimbursement of certain travel expenses. The Specialist Medical Review Council is an independent statutory body that reviews the contents of statements of principle or a decision of the Repatriation Medical Authority not to issue a statement of principle. As a person who has practised in this area, I know that the existence of statements of principle provided some measure of certainty with respect to veterans' claims. Prior to the introduction of the statements of principle, aspects of the law required the establishment of a reasonable hypothesis linking service with a particular claimed condition. The statements of principle effectively codified reasonable hypotheses so as to assist in the resolution of claims.


It is obviously in the interest of justice for the statements of principle to have authority as to the matters that they cover. The people that determine the statements of principle should be appropriately qualified and possess appropriate expertise. Under the current arrangements, the minister must select members for the panel from a list of nominations submitted by colleges or other bodies of medical practitioners or scientists. However, that is not the way the process has worked in practice. In practice, the colleges have forwarded the names of candidates who have responded to advertisements, without assessing or recommending candidates. The minister, in making appointment, must have regard to the branches of science where expertise is necessary to decide review matters and must appoint no less than two councillors with experience in each branch. Obviously, given these requirements, the process of appointing members takes time—around three months or longer. This can affect the ability of the review council to perform its functions. These amendments, as proposed by the minister, are designed to streamline and facilitate the operation of the council.


Schedule 3 of the bill relates to international agreements and gives the minister the power to make agreements with foreign governments to cover the provision of benefits and payment of benefits under the MRCA, the SRCA and the DRCA. The current legislation only provides for existing agreements under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The new provisions will cover allied veterans and Defence Force members with entitlements under whichever regulation gives them their entitlement. Labor supports the extension of agreements to cover all veterans' affairs legislation to ensure that veterans are covered under the relevant legislative framework irrespective of formal entitlement.


Schedule 4 deals with employer incentive scheme payments. These payments provide for wage subsidies which are payable to employers to encourage them to employ injured veterans who may be finding it difficult to compete in the labour market. That is particularly the case where we have a labour market where there is high unemployment. These amendments are commendable and strengthen the legislative foundation for the payments. Labor is supportive of measures which assist veterans to integrate into the community, to move on and to retain employment.


Schedule 5 introduces some important provisions to facilitate information sharing between the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission and the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation, in respect to certain service-related compensation claims. Under the existing legislation, due to information-sharing provisions—indeed, restrictions—when somebody is medically discharged they will undergo a medical, but when they go to the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation to organise those payments they may be required to undertake a second medical and, in turn, when they go to the DVA for assistance, they'll be required to undertake yet a further medical. These amendments are appropriate to enable information sharing between these bodies, reducing some of the intrusive medical examinations required. Access to the department's claims information, particularly relevant medical and rehabilitation information, enables the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation to make speedier superannuation benefits assessments and, in turn, will assist the department to determine a person's entitlement to incapacity payments. A common theme of my former practice as an advocate in this area was the necessity to organise multiple medical examinations. This is extremely frustrating for a veteran, particularly where there is a sense that the deck is stacked against the applicant.


I support this bill—of course, subject to the concerns that were expressed by Labor, with respect to the power, which was initially contained in this bill, to dismiss certain claims. It's very pleasing, therefore, that the minister has agreed to amend the bill to remove those provisions. Our veterans deserve a fair, just, economical, informal and quick system to address their claims. We welcome this change, which recognises the unique nature of the Veterans' Review Board. The measures within this bill are designed to address that object. I commend the legislation to the House.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2017-10-25,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (19:06):  I am sure that it is no news to anyone in this place how passionate I am about veterans, ex-service personnel and current and serving ADF members and their families. When I consider any piece of legislation that comes before this parliament, I always consider not only how it will impact on our community in general but also how it will impact on Townsville's strong defence population. I have, and always will, support necessary legislative changes that will improve the lives of Townsville's veterans, ex-service personnel and their families. This bill, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2017, is a fine example of bipartisanship.


It is very important that all legislation is inclusive of all citizens in the community. For example, health legislation and education legislation needs to reflect an understanding of the uniqueness of the veteran community, to ensure that we do not enact legislation that has a negative impact. Our veterans, ex-service personnel and families have given selflessly of themselves to ensure that we enjoy the freedom that we have in this country today. For that, we owe them access to the services and supports that they require.


One of the most common issues regularly raised with me by the Townsville veteran community is the need to improve the processes of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The changes in this bill will clarify, improve and/or streamline the implementation of the law and processes within the department. Thorough examination of this bill has occurred in the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to ensure that changes are implemented as intended and that veterans are no worse off as a result of enacting these measures.


Schedule 1 seeks to amend the provisions under which the Veterans' Review Board operates by aligning certain provisions with similar provisions to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Veterans' Review Board is a statutory authority whose role it is to provide independent merits review of decisions about disability pensions, war widow and war widower pensions and attendant allowances under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, and rehabilitation, compensation and other benefits under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004.


The amendments in schedule 1 will modernise and improve the operations of the board to ensure the board is carrying out its functions. It will pursue the objective of providing a mechanism of review that is accessible, fair, just, economical, informal and quick and is proportionate to the importance and complexity of the matter and promotes public trust and confidence in the decision-making of the board. It will impose an ongoing obligation on both the claimant and the Department of Veterans' Affairs during the period until the board has determined the matter to lodge with the board a copy of any document that is in their possession, is relevant to the review and has not been lodged previously. It will provide the board with the power to vary or revoke a decision made under the alternative dispute resolution processes with the consent of the parties and where the board is satisfied that it is within its powers and otherwise appropriate to do so. It will require the Repatriation Commission and anyone representing the commission in a review to use their best endeavours to insist that the board fulfil their legislative objectives and will provide the principal member with the power to dismiss an application for review of a decision if they are satisfied that the application is frivolous, vexatious, misconceived, lacking in substance, without reasonable prospect of success or otherwise an abuse of process. The government has advised that these amendments will align with the board's objectives and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal objectives.


This final element of the schedule, which gives the principal member of the Veterans' Review Board the ability to dismiss an application for review, has caused some angst in the ex-service community. The Veterans' Review Board is designed to be a less adversarial process than the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and does allow veterans to be represented by lawyers at this stage. This is the veterans' opportunity to be heard, and Labor holds concerns about the insertion of these provisions. In addition, during the FADT committee process the principal member advised that there have been only three circumstances in the past seven years where he or she would have used this power. We understand that, following the Labor opposition urging the government, they are now moving an amendment which removes this section. We welcome this change, which recognises the unique nature of the Veterans' Review Board.


Schedule 2 simplifies the appointment process for individuals on the Specialist Medical Review Council, progresses whole-of-government requirements for digital transformation, removes red tape in commencing reviews and provides for reimbursement of certain travel expenses. The Specialist Medical Review Council is an independent statutory body that reviews the contents of statements of principles or a decision of the Repatriation Medical Authority not to issue such a statement.


Essentially, the process is as follows: if someone believes there is an issue with an SOP, they take it to the SMRC for review. The SMRC then appoints a panel to review the SOP. If the SMRC agrees there is an issue, it is then turned over to the RMA for review. The SMRC consists of medical practitioners and medical scientists appointed as councillors by the minister and selected by the convenor of the SMRC for a particular review, involving three to five members on the basis of their expertise in the injury or disease relevant to the SOP subject of review. Under current arrangements, the minister must select members for the panel from a list or lists of nominations submitted by colleges or other bodies of medical practitioners or scientists. In practice, colleges forward the names of candidates who have responded to advertisements but do not assess or recommend candidates. In making appointments, the minister must have regard to the branches of science where expertise is necessary to decide review matters and must appoint not less than two councillors with experience in each branch.


Given these requirements, the process of appointing members takes around three months or longer. This affects the SMRC's ability to perform its functions. We have been advised that these amendments will not change the threshold for the specialists who are appointed to the panel. The amendments focus on streamlining the process of appointing specialists to the SMRC, which in its current form is described as labour intensive. In addition, these amendments provide financial incentives for individuals, representatives of organisations and any necessary attendants accompanying those individuals or representatives attending the SMRC hearing to make an oral submission.


Schedule 2 will also make several amendments which enable the convenor of the SMRC to give written directions about the manner for lodging requests for review for applications, enabling the SMRC to adopt electronic lodgements of requests for reviews rather than requiring a hard copy form as required by the VEA.


Schedule 3 relates to international agreements and gives the Minister for Veterans' Affairs the power to make agreements with foreign governments to cover the provision of benefits and payments under the MRCA, SRCA and DRCA. As it stands, existing agreements concern only those payments which are payable under the VEA. The new section will now cover allied veterans and Defence Force members with service of the type for which benefits and payments, including rehabilitation, can be provided by the Repatriation Commission or the MRCC under the VEA, MRCA, SRCA, DRCA or the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act 2006. It is so important that all veterans are covered, and I support extending agreements to cover all veterans' affairs legislation to ensure that veterans are covered under the relevant legislative framework, whether that is the VEA, the SRCA, the DRCA or the MRCA.


Schedule 4 legislates the Employer Incentive Scheme payments. These payments are made to employers in the form of wage subsidies to encourage them to engage injured veterans who have found it difficult to compete in a tight labour market. While the department has been able to facilitate these payments, this will strengthen the legislative foundation of the payments. One of the concerns I hear, especially from young veterans, is about the issue of employment. Work is so very important for people to feel they are contributing. Having a job is a reason to get out of bed. That is why I am completely committed to supporting measures that will assist veterans to move into and retain employment.


Schedule 5 amends the MRCA and the SRCA/DRCA to facilitate information sharing between the Military Rehabilitation Compensation Commission and the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation with regard to certain service-related compensation claims. As it stands, due to information-sharing provisions, if someone is medically discharged, they undergo a medical. When they go to the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation to organise payments, they undergo a second medical. And when they go to the DVA for assistance, they undergo a third medical. These amendments seek to enable information sharing between the CSC and the DVA, reducing some of the rework.


These amendments are designed to enable the CSC to access relevant claims information held by DVA, where that access would assist the CSC in the performance of its functions and powers. Access to the department's claims information, particularly to relevant medical and rehabilitation information, would assist CSC to make speedier superannuation benefit assessments, which, in turn, would assist the department to determine a person's entitlement to incapacity payments. A common complaint from veterans and advocates relates to the complicated and lengthy claims process for people seeking assistance from the department. I want to make this point very clear: there must be adequate safeguards in place to ensure that veterans' privacy is protected regarding any changes in this legislation.


Schedule 6 seeks to amend the MRCA to provide the Minister for Veterans' Affairs with the power to delegate his or her powers and functions to members of the MRCC, employees of the department, or persons engaged or appointed under the Public Service Act 1999. This function already exists under the VEA but was overlooked during the development of the MRCA. It makes sense that they be the same.


Schedule 7 will amend the legislation to exempt certain legislative instruments from subsection 14(2) of the Legislation Act 2003, and enable these legislative instruments to incorporate material contained in other non-disallowable legislative instruments or other non-legislative writings as are in force from time to time. The current requirement to amend Veterans' Affairs portfolio legislative instruments to incorporate changes in non-disallowable instruments causes significant administrative issues for the department. These changes will essentially allow material to be updated with new reference information without lodging each individual instrument into the parliament. The current process can cause administrative issues and unnecessary delays. An example of this can be seen in relation to the availability of a new rehabilitation appliance. The availability of new equipment will be delayed as the legislative instrument—in this case, the treatment principles that incorporate the document that the applicant may be provided—would need to be amended to refer to the changed date of the policy document. The amendments in schedule 7 will improve the administration of the acts, but not have any impact on the provision of benefits under the acts.


Schedule 8 will repeal redundant and spent provisions administered in the Veterans' Affairs portfolio concerning benefits that are no longer payable under portfolio acts. This schedule will remove references to payments which are no longer able to be accessed by individuals, in order to simplify veterans legislation and make it more accessible for individuals wishing to interpret the current provisions. The proposed amendment seeks to remove the following: the clean energy advance during a period before July 2012; parts providing for a one-off payment to older Australians in 2006, 2007 and 2008; the economic security strategy payment from 2008; and the educational tax refund payment in 2012.


In some circumstances, a person may be found to have been eligible for one of the payments because of a retrospective assessment of pension. Following the repeal, such a person will retain eligibility to receive the payment on the basis that they were eligible for the underlying payment during the relevant period that the repealed legislation was still in force. I am with Labor that we hold concerns about enabling the principal member of the VRB to dismiss claims and have yet to be convinced of the necessity of these provisions. Overall, though, I am supportive of any changes that streamline processes in the department that will assist our veterans and make processes a lot easier for them and less stressful for their families.

Ms LAMB
 (Longman) (19:20):  It really is a privilege to follow the member for Herbert in speaking to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2017. She is a fantastic advocate for her community up in Townsville and, like me, she really appreciates the work that our veterans have done in serving our country. I'm incredibly proud to rise today in solidarity with our veterans, who have already given so much to our nation. It is only fair that we, as their representatives, do whatever we can to support them. Whether it is supporting them to return to the workforce, helping them to live with a disability that they may now suffer from or even just helping them with the transition back to civilian life, it is important that we do what we can to support them. They deserve our support.


That is why I will continue to do what I can, and make sure the government does what it can, to provide Australia's veterans with the support they need in that transition to finding work or helping them in their community. I have been doing what I can already in my own electorate. I have been standing up for our veterans. Whether they live on Bribie Island, at Beachmere, in Caboolture, Morayfield, Narangba, Burpengary or Kallangur—we have wonderful communities of veterans throughout the electorate of Longman—I will always fight for our veterans and always support them. And, of course, I will always support legislation that helps them. I think it is fair to say that neither I nor Labor will ever stand in the way of good and sensible legislation.


I am standing here today agreeing to support the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill. By no means is this is a huge overhaul; the majority of the bill streamlines processes and makes things easier for veterans, which is what is fair, reasonable and should be expected. Most of all, for most of it, it is sensible and it is practical. I would like to speak on a number of the schedules to the bill. Schedule 1 will modernise and improve the operations of the Veterans' Review Board. This is a change that I welcome.


The Veterans' Review Board is a statutory authority whose role is to provide independent merits review of decisions about pensions and allowances under the Veterans' Entitlements Act as well as rehabilitation, compensation and other benefits under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004. The Veterans' Review Board is a body that serves a highly important function, so any changes that can be made to ensure it operates as effectively and efficiently as possible will always be welcomed by me on behalf of the veterans in my community. If these amendments ensure that the board pursues an objective of providing a mechanism of review that is fair, a mechanism that is accessible and just, a mechanism that is economical, informal and quick, a mechanism that helps to promote public trust and confidence in the decision-making of the board, then of course I will support these measures, as will my Labor colleagues.


These are sensible amendments, which is why I'm happy to support them, although I must point out it's no surprise to find that there was a proposal made by the government that apparently was suggested by the principal member of the Veterans' Review Board. I must commend the government for actually listening to suggestions. We all know that the only way for a government to formulate good policy is to listen and take heed of suggestions and to listen to those people who are affected, whether they be stakeholders or other organisations, or veterans or other people who live in the community. It is not possible to truly govern without listening to those who you represent, hearing what their needs and concerns are and listening to possible solutions or suggestions. It is just like hearing, I suppose, how many members of the ex-service community have expressed concerns with section 6 of schedule 1 of this bill.


I will go to section 6. It is understandable that this element has caused some angst in the community, as it gives the principal member of the Veterans' Review Board the ability to dismiss an application for review. Section 6 of schedule 1 of this bill effectively suppresses the voice of veterans who wish to stand up and represent themselves. The Veterans' Review Board is designed to be a less adversarial process than the AAT, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It is supposed to be less stressful, less painful and more accommodating to the needs of ex-service men and women. Lawyers won't be involved at this stage, which is welcome. This will be an opportunity for veterans to be heard, but I believe that making it so easy for the principal member of the board to dismiss an application for review puts this schedule at odds with the very principle of the process. It is not just me who thinks this—so do the Returned and Services League and my colleagues on this side of the House, in the Labor Party. Labor had prepared to seek amendments to this bill to remove that section in its entirety. We have been pressuring the government to do just the same.


Again, going against character today, I'm pleased to hear that the government has finally listened. I commend the government—twice in one speech!



Mr Byrne interjecting—




Ms LAMB:
  No, we won't. But when it is sensible, when it helps veterans in our community and right across Australia, of course we will commend and support the government on finally doing their job properly. We have been calling on them to listen to the RSL and other ex-service men and women for some time now, so it is fantastic that they have finally listened.


Schedule 4 stands out to me to be a very good move, one that I am happy to support and one that I think really will support and help the veterans in my community. Schedule 4 legislates Employer Incentive Scheme payments. These payments are effectively wage subsidies made to employers to encourage them to engage an injured veteran. I think this is important, and I really do welcome this. I have quite a lot of young veterans living in communities around Narangba and this is welcome for both the veterans and their families. We all know what the job market is like at the moment. It is a scant job market, a job market that is growing worse at an alarming rate. We as policymakers have a responsibility to do whatever we can to assist those who have served our country to find work post-service.


Some months ago, I hosted a visit by the shadow minister for defence, the honourable member for Corio, Mr Richard Marles, in my electorate of Longman. Along with the honourable member, we visited Remembrance House in Burpengary and spent quite a few hours sitting around the table talking to and listening to a group of returned service men and women.


Debate interrupted.

"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2017-10-25,"



Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (18:15):  I rise today to speak about the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2017. This bill contains eight schedules, which deal with different elements of veterans legislation that seek to clarify, improve and streamline the operation of law and processes within the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Given the detail in the bill, it was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. The committee thoroughly examined the legislation, held public hearings and reported back to the parliament on 13 June 2017. I would like to thank the committee members and all those submitters on their work in reviewing this legislation.


As we understand it, schedule 1 seeks to amend the provisions under which the Veterans' Review Board operates by aligning certain provisions of the board with similar provisions to that of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. As members may be aware, the board is a statutory authority whose role is to provide independent merits review of decisions about disability pensions, war widow and war widower pensions and attendant allowances under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, rehabilitation compensation and other benefits under both the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and the new Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Defence Force) Bill 2017.


The amendment in schedule 1 seeks to modernise and improve the operations of the board in a number of ways. Item 1 deals with the board's objectives. As it stands, the board's objectives are listed as providing a mechanism of review that is fair, just, economical, informal and quick. These amendments do align the VRB with the changes made to the AAT under the Tribunals Amalgamation Act 2015. It provides that, in carrying out its functions, the board must pursue the objective of providing a mechanism of review that is accessible, fair, just, economical, informal and quick, is proportionate to the importance and complexity of the matter and promotes public trust and confidence in the decision-making of the board. This section also imposes an ongoing obligation on both the claimant and the Department of Veterans' Affairs during the period until the board has determined the matter to lodge with the board a copy of any document that is in possession which is relevant to the review that has not been lodged previously. 


In addition, it provides the board with the power to vary or revoke a decision made under the alternative dispute resolutions process with the consent of the parties and where the board is satisfied that it is within its powers and otherwise appropriate to do so. The section also requires the Repatriation Commission and any person representing the commission in a review to use their best endeavours to assist the board in fulfilling its legislative objective in line with the expanded objective, which deals with the proportionality and public trust.


Finally, this section provides the principal member with the power to dismiss an application for a review of a decision if they are satisfied that the application is frivolous, vexatious, misconceived or lacking in substance, has no reasonable prospect of success or is otherwise an abuse of process. The final element which gives the principal member the power to dismiss an application has caused some angst within the veterans community for a number of reasons. The Veterans' Review Broad is a unique board that recognises the exceptional nature of military service. It provides an opportunity for veterans to be heard and, while rulings are legal, it is meant to operate in a less adversarial way. It is for this reason that veterans historically have been unable to be represented by lawyers at this point. As stated by the Returned and Services League of Australia in their submission to the Senate inquiry, the Veterans' Review Board has always been the first level of appeal. The veteran should always have his or her say and this should remain as such. In addition, the RSL argued that individuals should be able to present to the board, as it gives them the opportunity to be heard by three individuals in contrast to one DVA delegate.


There was also concern raised during the Senate committee process about the ability to delegate these powers, which the bill was silent on. Consequently, during the Senate committee process, the principal member of the board, Mr Doug Humphreys, provided written information to the committee to allay these concerns, stating that the power would rest wholly with the principal member. In his correspondence, Mr Humphreys also stated that there were few occasions where he would utilise this provision, claiming that, during the current principal member's tenure of seven years, there have been only three matters where it may have been appropriate to hold a preliminary hearing to consider whether the matter should be dismissed on these grounds. Given the small number of times that this would be utilised, Labor does not believe the benefits outweigh the significant concerns.


Labor believes that the Veterans' Review Board was always meant to be a chance where a veteran could be heard. It is meant to be a less adversarial process which accounts for the unique nature of military service. We do support the intention of the bill to align the principles of the VRB and the AAT and are supportive of the broader changes. While we respect that the principal member has outlined their process and how they will engage with an individual, we do not believe that this clause is fitting with regard to the overriding philosophy of the board. As such, Labor proposed—and communicated with the government on this—an amendment which would remove this section. However, it is my understanding that, in the third reading stage, the government will move this amendment, along with a number of other changes. We welcome this change. Labor made very, very clear that this is something that we believe, as a result of consultation with the community, needs to occur. I am very, very pleased that the government has taken that on board and will relieve us of having to move our amendment. We will support the amendment of the government.


Schedule 2 seeks to simplify the appointment process of individuals to the Specialist Medical Review Council, progress whole-of-government requirements for digital transformation, remove red tape in commencing reviews and provide reimbursement of certain travel expenses. The Specialist Medical Review Council is an independent statutory body that reviews the contents of the statements of principles or a decision of the Repatriation Medical Authority not to issue such a statement. The council consists of medical practitioners and medical scientists appointed as councillors by the minister and selected by the convenor of the council for a particular review on the basis of their expertise on the injury or the disease relevant to the statement of principles subject which is under review. Essentially, if someone believes there is an issue with a statement of principle, they will take it to the council for review. The council then appoints a panel which reviews the statement of principle. If they agree there is an issue, it is then returned to the RMA for review.


Under the current arrangements, the minister must select members for the panel from a list or lists of nominations submitted by colleges or other bodies of medical practitioners or scientists. In practice, colleges forward the names of candidates who have responded to advertisements without assessing or recommending candidates. In addition, when making appointments, the minister must have regard to the branches of science or the expertise as necessary to decide review matters and must appoint not fewer than two councillors with experience in each branch. Given these requirements, the process of appointing members takes around three months or longer. This affects the council's ability to perform its functions. It's our understanding that under the amendments the requirements which fix the number of councillors with experience at each branch of medical science will be repealed.


While the minister is still required to have regard to the branches for the expertise needed to decide matters referred to the council, they will have greater discretion as to the number of councillors needed. While it makes sense to have a standing membership from which to draw councillors, there are not necessarily always at least two members from each area of expertise, particularly when it relates to uncommon specialities. This section also includes a requirement that at least one councillor must have at least five years experience in the field of epidemiology, the branch of medicine which deals with the study of the distribution and determinants of disease in populations, and with investigation into the sources and causes of infectious disease.


The review process, as it stands, also requires the council to advertise the date of its first meeting with respect to a particular review. This is described as unnecessary and prescriptive, given the practicalities of arranging a meeting with specialists with busy schedules. Changes to this section will still require notice published in the Gazette at least 28 days before the first meeting of councillors.


Schedule 2 also seeks to provide financial assistance for individual representatives of organisations for any necessary attendance to accompany individuals or representatives to attend a council to make an oral submission. It will make several amendments which enable the convenor of the council to give written directions about the manner of lodging requests for reviews or applications, enabling the council to adopt electronic lodgement of requests for reviews rather than requiring a hard copy form as required by the Veterans' Entitlements Act.


In the light of the ongoing Digital Transformation Agenda, it is appropriate that the council should have the capacity to develop online forms and lodgements. This will streamline the processes and reduce unnecessary red tape. The government assures us that these amendments will not change the threshold for the specialists who are appointed to the panel; rather, the amendments focus on streamlining the process of appointing specialists to the panel, providing financial assistance and reducing red tape. Given these assurances, Labor is supportive of these amendments.


Schedule 3 relates to the international agreements and gives the minister power to make agreements with foreign governments to cover the provision of benefits and payments for the benefits under the MRCA and DRCA. This amendment is required as under the current arrangements the minister can only enter into the agreement for the provision of benefits and treatment, including rehabilitation, that are comparable to those provided under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Current and former ADF members now have coverage under other veterans' entitlements portfolio acts in addition to the Veterans' Entitlements Act and, as such, there is a need for arrangements which refer to benefits and payments, including rehabilitation, that are provided by the Repatriation Commission or the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission under the VEA, the MRCA, the DRCA or the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act. This is a logical extension of the current arrangements that ensures that all veterans' legislation is covered. I understand there will be an amendment to the title of this and that, rather than calling it 'agreements', it will be 'arrangements', and we will support that amendment by the government.


Schedule 4 legislates the employer incentive scheme payments, which are made to employers in the form of wage subsidies to encourage them to engage an injured veteran who has found it difficult to compete in a tight labour market. The department provides vocational rehabilitation to eligible serving and former Defence Force members, reservists and cadets following service related injury or disease. Vocational rehabilitation delivers assistance to members to help them achieve sustainable employment where possible and return them to the workforce at at least the level of their pre-injury employment. These services include assessment, guidance or counselling, functional capacity assessment, work experience, vocational training and jobseeking assistance. It also may involve incentive payments to employers to facilitate civilian employment of veterans. While the department has been able to facilitate these payments under existing provisions, this amendment will strengthen and clarify the legislation around these payments.


Labor is supportive of measures which assist veterans to move to and retain employment. Vocational rehabilitation plays an important role in assisting eligible veterans with finding or retaining employment. It can assist with transition from military to civilian employment for members of the ADF and peacekeeping forces who may experience difficulty in obtaining or holding civilian employment.


Schedule 5 amends the MRCA and the DRCA to facilitate information sharing between the MRCC and the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation with respect to certain service related compensation claims. These amendments will implement a recommendation by the Review of Military Compensation Arrangements which was intended to improve the information-sharing framework for incapacity and superannuation benefits between the MRCC and the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation. While the MRCC is authorised to request information from the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation to assist with the calculation of incapacity payments, there is no express provision to allow the MRCC to provide information to the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation to assist with their assessment of superannuation benefits. As such, at present all requests to the MRCC for information from the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation are undertaken in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act 1982, which is a cumbersome and time-consuming process accounting for approximately 20 per cent of all FOI requests received by the department on behalf of the MRCC.


These amendments, we are informed, will provide a stronger foundation for the MRCC to provide the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation with the information needed to make an assessment of the superannuation benefit. Requests from the CSC to the MRCC for claims information are increasingly being received for the purpose of conducting superannuation investigations through the useful and relevant medical and rehabilitation information held by the MRCC. Enabling the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation to use information held by the MRCC will also avoid the need to send Defence Force members for further medical assessment where the MRCC already holds the relevant information which could be used by the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation to determine benefits. Apart from saving time and effort, this would also prevent Defence Force members from having to explain their circumstances to different medical professionals. This is particularly important in the cases of members who are suffering from psychological conditions, including those which have arisen from physical or psychological abuse. This will prevent any retraumatisation as a result of having to ongoingly explain their circumstances. 


I must note that this section has caused some concern within the veterans community through the Senate inquiry process. Senators raised a number of privacy concerns with the committee, noting there is some confusion within the Defence community as to what type of information is being shared. Many of the submitters called for a privacy impact assessment to be conducted on schedule 5 of the bill, and I understand the government has completed this process.


Labor is supportive of the measures listed in schedule 5 to help veterans reverse the process and to reduce the unnecessary work. It is important, I think, that we note that the time taken to process claims by DVA has been a longstanding issue with many veterans. Veterans and their loved ones have regularly expressed to me the frustration of having to tell their story again and again. This amendment seeks to address this, and that is why we're supportive of it. However, I do understand these privacy concerns and certainly have supported the calls to conduct a privacy impact assessment. I am pleased that the government has done that.


Schedule 6 seeks to amend the MRCA to provide the minister with the power to delegate his or her powers and functions to the members of the MRCC, employees of the department or persons engaged or appointed under the Public Service Act 1999. This is a provision which exists under the other act, the VEA, but it appears to have been omitted from the development process of the MRCA in 2004. This omission has prevented the implementation of some of the administrative reforms to achieve efficiencies across the department as part of the government's commitment to reduce red tape. Examples that have been provided of the type of determinations which might be delegated include determination of an interest rate payable on a lump sum payment of permanent impairment compensation; minor determinations concerning reimbursement of travel expenses; requirements for medical examinations; and the types of payments that may be deducted from payments of weekly compensation. Delegating authority for minor matters to appropriate employees will enable quicker decision-making in relation to small issues and reduce unnecessary red tape. The department have assured Labor that delegation levels would be set at either band 1 or band 2 or at the chief operating officer level only, to ensure that the employee has the appropriate skill set to be approving these decisions. On that condition, Labor will support this amendment.


Schedule 7 will amend the legislation to exempt certain legislative instruments from section 14(2) of the Legislation Act 2003 and enable these legislative instruments to incorporate material contained in other non-disallowable legislative instruments or other non-legislative writings in force from time to time.


The current requirement to amend the Veterans' Affairs portfolio legislative instruments to incorporate changes in non-disallowable instruments has caused significant administrative issues for the department. These changes will essentially allow materials to be updated with new references to information without lodging each individual instrument into the parliament. Many of the legislative instruments include references to external documents which are incorporated by reference into instruments that are legally regarded as being parts of the instrument. As such, any change to such documents can't be recognised unless the changed versions are incorporated into the legislative instrument by an amendment or a replaced instrument. This can cause significant administrative issues and unnecessary delays.


An example of this can be seen in relation to the availability of new rehabilitation appliances. The availability of the new equipment will be delayed, as the legislative instrument in the case of the Treatment Principles, which incorporates the document under which the appliance may be provided, would need to be amended to refer to the changed date of the policy document. As we can see, that's quite an ordeal, and for that reason Labor will be supporting this amendment.


The final schedule deals with the repeal of redundant and spent provisions administered in the Veterans' Affairs portfolio concerning benefits that are no longer payable, and it makes consequential amendments in relation to the repeal. This was originally proposed as part of the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2015) Bill 2015, which lapsed with the end of parliament in April 2016. The proposed amendments seek to remove the following spent provisions: the clean energy advance during a period before 1 July 2012; parts providing for one-off payments to older Australians in 2006, 2007 and 2008; the Economic Security Strategy payment from 2008; and the educational tax refund payment in 2012.


However, a provision has been inserted that will ensure that, in a circumstance where a person is found to have been eligible for one of the payments due to a retrospective assessment of the pension, they will still be able to access the spent provision. The Veterans' Affairs portfolio is supportive of these changes, and therefore we are also and think that this is an appropriate way to go.


The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2017 seeks to streamline the operation of the law and to improve processes for veterans. Labor is supportive of the changes, which will improve the process for veterans. However, as stated, we do believe that we need to remove one section of schedule 1. As I've said, it's my understanding that the government will move that amendment, and we certainly welcome them paying careful consideration to Labor's views. We certainly welcome the government doing that and look forward to continuing to work in a bipartisan way. I think that this legislation not only has bipartisan support but now accurately reflects the views of the veterans community. Overall, it will be welcomed by the veterans community as a sensible piece of legislation and one that we have worked together to land perfectly.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2017-10-25,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (18:38):  Can I borrow your speech? I just want to say to the member for Kingston that I was only half joking!




Ms Rishworth:
  Yeah, right!




Mr SNOWDON:
  But I do want to say, whilst you're here, congratulations on being elevated into the shadow cabinet. It is great recognition of your good work and of your good work to come as a minister in a future government. So, well done to you.




Mr Tehan:
  Oh—




Mr SNOWDON:
  I'm going to talk about you in a minute, so be careful! There are a couple of things that I think are important in this Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2017, though. The member for Kingston made this point towards the end of her speech, and I know she thinks this to be the case—and I know it to be the case. It's about the way in which there is strong bipartisan support for this legislation and the way in which the minister has been dealing with the opposition and the way in which opposition has been working with the minister to try to secure better outcomes for veterans, by and large, across the country. Now, there will be differences from time to time, but it's important that we accept our obligations as legislators to try to get the best possible outcomes that we can without politicising the process for our veterans. There are a couple of areas within this parliament where that seems to be happening and others where it's not.


If you'll forgive me, I just want to make the point that bipartisanship in trying to represent the interests of veterans in this place and to make changes which suit their needs is very important, and it's being done in a constructive way. I know that, in the context of the recent suicide report, we've heard both from the government and the opposition, through the minister and through the member for Kingston, and they have both made vital contributions to that discussion, but again showing very little difference, in terms of the final outcome and the desired outcome, from this parliament, represented by them as the spokespersons for both the government and the opposition, to get the best possible outcome for veterans. That, to me, is what this is about. I have to say that, in my own experience as a minister in this space, that was also the case when we were in government. And I expect it to be the case into the future, because we don't want the veterans community wondering why it is that we're playing politics around their interests and their concerns.


I have that same relationship in many ways with the member for Hasluck, in dealing with Indigenous health issues. We meet regularly. We discuss issues. We won't always agree, but we have a common interest in making sure that we try, as a parliament, to get the best possible outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and in other areas. We, Senator Dodson from Western Australia and I, are attempting to work collaboratively with Minister Scullion in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs space. That's somewhat more difficult, because it's a bit more of a contested space. But the bottom line is: there's a genuine desire to try to work in a bipartisan way.


I just want to contrast that, if I may, with the way in which we've seen the member for Stirling, as the Minister for Justice, operate in this parliament over the last two days and the very divisive nature of the way in which he has addressed this place. We don't need it. It's an insult to the parliament. It's an insult to the community and to all Australians who listen to this place. They expect us to do better. As to the responses that the minister made in question time yesterday, I think the member for Kennedy described, in a contribution in this parliament today, the member for Stirling as the worst minister he'd seen in 44 years in politics. I've never seen a contribution like that which was made by the member for Stirling in response to a question yesterday. And today we just had a debate which resulted in the opposition, with the support of the Independents and the crossbenchers, opposing the government on important measures relating to the justice portfolio. We've seen the government, through the Prime Minister and the member for Stirling, yesterday and today, try and insult the intelligence of the Australian community by saying that the Australian opposition, through the Leader of the Opposition and other members, were not supportive of the Australian Federal Police. That is just plain wrong. It debases this parliament for the Prime Minister to make those sorts of insulting remarks about the Leader of the Opposition and other Labor people—the opposition generally—by saying that, somehow or other, we do not support the work of the Australian Federal Police. That is not accurate, it's not correct and it shouldn't be done. In fact, we should be using the exemplar of the minister who is sitting at the table and his shadow who is sitting at the table to say: 'We can work cooperatively in this space, and let's sit down and do it. We don't need to be divided over issues of such great national importance as the role of the Federal Police in this country.'


It's very, very important, in my view, that we try and seek to do things in a cooperative way in this place. I know it's a contested space. I know that, in the way in which this parliament operates, oppositions oppose and governments try and kick the guts out of the opposition. That's all well and good. But it's not appropriate in areas of public policy of the greatest concern to the Australian community. We should be trying to resolve our issues in an appropriate way. We don't do that by denigrating one another and we don't do it, in my view, by insulting the intelligence of the Australian community and saying that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, and his shadow ministerial team and the Labor backbench are somehow or other not supportive of the Australian Federal Police. That is just plain wrong. I know that any Australians who might be listening to this debate would say they agree that this should not be the case.


But I want to go back to the legislation. I know that the minister, working with the Department of Veterans' Affairs and with the opposition, through the member for Kingston, has come to a conclusion about eight schedules in this piece of legislation. We have heard from the shadow minister and the minister that they have agreed to amend schedule 1 to recognise the issues which were raised by the veterans community about a particular aspect of that schedule—and that is as it should be. And we know that the veterans community are exercised by the fact that they want to make sure that their interests are properly protected and advanced within this legislation. The proposals to dismiss the prospect of reviews, in schedule 1—an application dismissed as frivolous, vexatious, misconceived or lacking in substance, or which has no reasonable prospect of success or is otherwise an abuse of the process of the board—were of concern to the stakeholders. I'm indebted to the work of the Parliamentary Library and their excellent Bills Digest, which enumerates some of the concerns which were expressed about this particular part of the legislation by representatives of the veterans community.


And I think it's worthwhile pointing out that in accepting that there was no need for that amendment, which was proposed originally by the government, the government has actually responded positively to the concerns that have been expressed by the veterans community and by the member for Kingston—and that's a very good thing. Whilst a number of points of concern were raised, there is no question in my view that the amendments as proposed will have the result that's required and make the legislation better.


I'm not going to go through—as the shadow minister has done already—each of the schedules of this legislation. That will serve no particular purpose other than to bore those who are listening—because they have already heard it. I did ask in a flippant way whether I should just use the opposition spokesperson's speech—because it did, as the government has done, outline the detail of the legislation. But I do want to go more generally to the issue of how we have a responsibility to make sure, in a changing environment, that we do all we possibly can to support our veterans.


It was a salutary lesson the other day when I sat and listened to the minister talk about the suicides. The fact is that, when in uniform, the suicide rate for Australian serving men and women is a lot less than it is in the general population; but, for that group of young Australians under the age of 24 who are veterans, it's a lot higher. I think the average length of service—the minister can correct me—for Australian serving personnel is around 7½ to eight years. We know that there are people who serve until they're 60. Congratulations to them, and we thank them very much for their wonderful service. But the young Australians who join the Defence Force when they're 17, 18 or 19 and leave the Defence Force in their mid-20s are the most at risk. And one of the issues which has been of concern not only to the minister but to the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the defence organisations is that we lose track of people once they leave—and that's for a whole range of reasons. It's really difficult. You can't compel people who leave the uniform to remain in touch.


You can't compel people who separate from the Defence Force to retain contact with their unit. We can't compel them to be members of a representative organisation like the RSL or some other organisation. We just can't. There are some who leave dispirited, and perhaps with a whole range of issues around authority as a result of their service, and they don't want anything to do with the uniform—they just don't want anything to do with it. Yet, potentially, they are the ones most in need. Our aspiration must be, somehow or another, to be able to track those people so that there is someone watching out for them.


That is extremely difficult. It's not something that the minister or the department can manufacture. I think it's something that organisations supporting veterans may have better access to, because it really means people going out and looking. If you've got mates while you're in the Defence Force, let's hope you keep those mates after it. I know in my father's case—he was a serving member in the Second World War—that he kept very close contact with his unit right until his death. That was great, but it doesn't happen often enough for some young people.


When people do cry out for help we've got to do what we can immediately. If there are people who, say, have a claim against the Commonwealth because of their service, we need to expedite the process for their claim to be heard, to make sure their claim is properly represented and to make sure their voice is properly heard so that their claim is met as quickly as possible—as this legislation is designed to do. If we don't, then we may end up in a situation where someone might do something which we would not want them to do. That is really very important.


I know that the department is challenged by this all the time, because it's not something that's easily overcome. But I do know, and I want to commend the minister and ask him to tell his department, how much we do appreciate the work they do. We might have differences about some of the decisions made about staffing, VAN officer and those sort of things but, ultimately, the people I've met in the Department of Veterans' Affairs are very highly motivated towards attending to the veterans' needs and veterans' families' needs.


As I've said continually in this place, we should make sure that anyone who walks through the doors of Kapooka understands from the day they walk in that they they're a potential client of the Department of Veterans' Affairs until the day they die. If they can accept that proposition as early as that, they'll see it as normal, once they leave, to have an association with the department. I would say—and this is a message which I know shouldn't rest with the minister—that we need to make sure there's never ever again another thought about having the Department of Veterans' Affairs absorbed into another agency. That should never happen. I don't think it will happen. It certainly won't happen under a Labor government. I know there have been some who have posited that proposal over the years, but let's make sure it's rejected whenever it's put.

"Hart, Ross, MP",ALP,2017-10-25,"



Mr HART
 (Bass) (18:53):  I echo the sentiments expressed by the member for Lingiari about the spirit of cooperation and bipartisanship that infects the area of Veterans' Affairs. Unlike the unfortunate circumstances this afternoon with respect to equally important legislation dealing with gun trafficking, this minister understands that it's really important to develop and encourage a spirit of bipartisanship—particularly around this vitally important area of veterans' affairs.


I'm always very pleased to speak on legislation affecting our veterans community, like this Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2017. I was very fortunate during my legal career to have represented veterans, commencing with veterans of the Second World War and then succeeding generations, in connection with pension claims. I have been able to gain an insight into that community, particularly those who sought to battle on and delayed making any claim for support from the taxpayer.


I fondly recall many veterans who recounted the fact that they tried to get on with their lives, despite in some cases having severe trauma which should have been the subject of an earlier claim. These veterans often found it difficult to make a late claim for TPI, for example, because of their willingness to put up with many conditions until pain or incapacity proved insurmountable.


It was and is a privilege to represent all of those veterans, each with their own unique stories of service, hardship, mateship and, of course, their postservice lives. If there was a common thread through all of these claims—whether it was a seaman who served in the Second World War in HMAS Shropshire and was exposed to high levels of radiation, someone who served in North Africa and washed his kit in petrol, or someone who damaged his knees, unsurprisingly, in parachute training—it was the volume of service and medical material that had to be trawled through in order to build a case for the veteran's claim. Often my involvement, for very practical reasons, only commenced once the matter had been unsuccessful before the Veterans' Review Board, the VRB. In many cases, delay in the resolution of a meritorious claim would have been avoided if some person with suitable knowledge and training had been in a position to review the material, advise as to the evidence and instruct medical experts as to what reports may have been required.


The object of veterans' affairs legislation is beneficial. In other words, the legislation should be construed in favour of the applicant veteran. The system should work in a manner which facilitates the resolution of claims in a manner which is fair, just, economical, informal and quick. My experience and the feedback I've received from veterans support groups would suggest that more work would need to be done to achieve that object. Labor is supportive of changes which will clarify, improve or streamline the operation of the laws and processes within the department. This is something that I strongly believe in and something which should also be subject to a process of continuous improvement.


The bill contains eight schedules which deal with a variety of different elements within the legislation. The bill was considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Labor supported the referral to enable a thorough examination of the legislation. The overriding consideration is to ensure that the legislation operates as intended and that veterans are no worse off as a result of these changes. Our obligation—that is, the obligation of this place—to those who have served on behalf of our nation is to ensure that we do not, through changes that we make in this place, place them at any additional disadvantage.


Schedule 1 within the legislation seeks to amend the provisions which govern the Veterans' Review Board. This is designed to ensure that these provisions are aligned with similar provisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The VRB is a statutory authority. It's designed to provide independent merits review of decisions in connection with disability pensions, war widows and war widow pensions, a tenant allowance under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and, of course, the rehabilitation, compensation and other benefits under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. The amendments are designed to ensure that the operations of the board are modernised and improved to ensure accessibility, fairness, justice, economy, informality and speedy resolution. The operation of the board should be proportionate to the importance and complexity of an individual matter and, generally speaking, the operation of the board should promote public trust and confidence in the decision-making of the board.


As a legal practitioner, I know that independent merits review is a vitally important aspect of ensuring that, in the administration of complex systems of pensions entitlement, the applicant is able to have a decision reviewed without involving the expense of a legal practitioner in a complex formal process. One of the central aspects of merits review is access to proper material to found a decision. The legislation imposes an ongoing obligation upon both the applicant claimant and the Department of Veterans' Affairs to lodge with the board a copy of any document in their possession which is relevant to the review and has not been lodged previously.


It is notable that the Repatriation Commission and any person representing the commission in a review are required to use their best endeavours to assist the board in fulfilling the board's legislative objectives of accessibility, fairness, justice, economy, informality and speed of resolution. I must note that, whilst my experience in my dealings with representatives of the Repatriation Commission was almost without exception positive, there are and have been concerns expressed by the veterans community that the department and the commission often take a position towards the claimant applicant which is adversarial in nature. The formal introduction of an obligation to use best endeavours to assist the board in fulfilling those objectives is a positive step.


Schedule 1 also introduces provisions which would entitle the principal member to dismiss an application if they are satisfied that the application is frivolous, is vexatious, is misconceived, is lacking in substance, has no reasonable prospect of success or is otherwise an abuse of process. On balance, the provision of this express power is claimed by the minister to be appropriate, although it's unlikely there'll be many occasions in which it would be appropriate to dismiss an application without proceeding to a final hearing. I thank the minister for his ability to remove this particular clause from the legislation. As I said earlier, the spirit of bipartisanship with respect to this area of public policy is most important.


I know that on this side of the House, and certainly as conceded by the minister, we would be concerned if any power were used to deny an applicant an opportunity to put their case, even if their case appeared to have low prospects of success. It is understandable, of course, that our veterans community would be concerned about the introduction into legislation of any such power, but as a legal practitioner I understand and respect that courts have under their inherent jurisdiction a power to dismiss in these circumstances. Obviously, as a statutory tribunal, the Veterans' Review Board cannot exercise any inherent review powers, so these powers, if they were to be appropriate, must be conferred expressly.


This is obviously a balancing exercise. Lawyers are not permitted to appear before the Veterans' Review Board; the procedure is supposed to be informal. A case may not have been assembled with the assistance of a person with knowledge of procedure, as I have indicated earlier. It is important that the documents are reviewed and organised so that the Veterans' Review Board gets to consider the best possible case. As has been conceded, the veteran deserves an opportunity to be heard. It is always my preference for the applicant to have the opportunity to present their case.


Schedule 2 of the bill simplifies the appointment process for those who are to be appointed to the Specialist Medical Review Council. It progresses the whole-of-government requirements for digital transformation, removing red tape and commencing reviews and provides for reimbursement of certain travel expenses. The Specialist Medical Review Council is an independent statutory body that reviews the contents of statements of principle or a decision of the Repatriation Medical Authority not to issue a statement of principle. As a person who has practised in this area, I know that the existence of statements of principle provided some measure of certainty with respect to veterans' claims. Prior to the introduction of the statements of principle, aspects of the law required the establishment of a reasonable hypothesis linking service with a particular claimed condition. The statements of principle effectively codified reasonable hypotheses so as to assist in the resolution of claims.


It is obviously in the interest of justice for the statements of principle to have authority as to the matters that they cover. The people that determine the statements of principle should be appropriately qualified and possess appropriate expertise. Under the current arrangements, the minister must select members for the panel from a list of nominations submitted by colleges or other bodies of medical practitioners or scientists. However, that is not the way the process has worked in practice. In practice, the colleges have forwarded the names of candidates who have responded to advertisements, without assessing or recommending candidates. The minister, in making appointment, must have regard to the branches of science where expertise is necessary to decide review matters and must appoint no less than two councillors with experience in each branch. Obviously, given these requirements, the process of appointing members takes time—around three months or longer. This can affect the ability of the review council to perform its functions. These amendments, as proposed by the minister, are designed to streamline and facilitate the operation of the council.


Schedule 3 of the bill relates to international agreements and gives the minister the power to make agreements with foreign governments to cover the provision of benefits and payment of benefits under the MRCA, the SRCA and the DRCA. The current legislation only provides for existing agreements under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The new provisions will cover allied veterans and Defence Force members with entitlements under whichever regulation gives them their entitlement. Labor supports the extension of agreements to cover all veterans' affairs legislation to ensure that veterans are covered under the relevant legislative framework irrespective of formal entitlement.


Schedule 4 deals with employer incentive scheme payments. These payments provide for wage subsidies which are payable to employers to encourage them to employ injured veterans who may be finding it difficult to compete in the labour market. That is particularly the case where we have a labour market where there is high unemployment. These amendments are commendable and strengthen the legislative foundation for the payments. Labor is supportive of measures which assist veterans to integrate into the community, to move on and to retain employment.


Schedule 5 introduces some important provisions to facilitate information sharing between the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission and the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation, in respect to certain service-related compensation claims. Under the existing legislation, due to information-sharing provisions—indeed, restrictions—when somebody is medically discharged they will undergo a medical, but when they go to the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation to organise those payments they may be required to undertake a second medical and, in turn, when they go to the DVA for assistance, they'll be required to undertake yet a further medical. These amendments are appropriate to enable information sharing between these bodies, reducing some of the intrusive medical examinations required. Access to the department's claims information, particularly relevant medical and rehabilitation information, enables the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation to make speedier superannuation benefits assessments and, in turn, will assist the department to determine a person's entitlement to incapacity payments. A common theme of my former practice as an advocate in this area was the necessity to organise multiple medical examinations. This is extremely frustrating for a veteran, particularly where there is a sense that the deck is stacked against the applicant.


I support this bill—of course, subject to the concerns that were expressed by Labor, with respect to the power, which was initially contained in this bill, to dismiss certain claims. It's very pleasing, therefore, that the minister has agreed to amend the bill to remove those provisions. Our veterans deserve a fair, just, economical, informal and quick system to address their claims. We welcome this change, which recognises the unique nature of the Veterans' Review Board. The measures within this bill are designed to address that object. I commend the legislation to the House.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2017-10-25,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (19:06):  I am sure that it is no news to anyone in this place how passionate I am about veterans, ex-service personnel and current and serving ADF members and their families. When I consider any piece of legislation that comes before this parliament, I always consider not only how it will impact on our community in general but also how it will impact on Townsville's strong defence population. I have, and always will, support necessary legislative changes that will improve the lives of Townsville's veterans, ex-service personnel and their families. This bill, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2017, is a fine example of bipartisanship.


It is very important that all legislation is inclusive of all citizens in the community. For example, health legislation and education legislation needs to reflect an understanding of the uniqueness of the veteran community, to ensure that we do not enact legislation that has a negative impact. Our veterans, ex-service personnel and families have given selflessly of themselves to ensure that we enjoy the freedom that we have in this country today. For that, we owe them access to the services and supports that they require.


One of the most common issues regularly raised with me by the Townsville veteran community is the need to improve the processes of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The changes in this bill will clarify, improve and/or streamline the implementation of the law and processes within the department. Thorough examination of this bill has occurred in the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to ensure that changes are implemented as intended and that veterans are no worse off as a result of enacting these measures.


Schedule 1 seeks to amend the provisions under which the Veterans' Review Board operates by aligning certain provisions with similar provisions to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Veterans' Review Board is a statutory authority whose role it is to provide independent merits review of decisions about disability pensions, war widow and war widower pensions and attendant allowances under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, and rehabilitation, compensation and other benefits under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004.


The amendments in schedule 1 will modernise and improve the operations of the board to ensure the board is carrying out its functions. It will pursue the objective of providing a mechanism of review that is accessible, fair, just, economical, informal and quick and is proportionate to the importance and complexity of the matter and promotes public trust and confidence in the decision-making of the board. It will impose an ongoing obligation on both the claimant and the Department of Veterans' Affairs during the period until the board has determined the matter to lodge with the board a copy of any document that is in their possession, is relevant to the review and has not been lodged previously. It will provide the board with the power to vary or revoke a decision made under the alternative dispute resolution processes with the consent of the parties and where the board is satisfied that it is within its powers and otherwise appropriate to do so. It will require the Repatriation Commission and anyone representing the commission in a review to use their best endeavours to insist that the board fulfil their legislative objectives and will provide the principal member with the power to dismiss an application for review of a decision if they are satisfied that the application is frivolous, vexatious, misconceived, lacking in substance, without reasonable prospect of success or otherwise an abuse of process. The government has advised that these amendments will align with the board's objectives and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal objectives.


This final element of the schedule, which gives the principal member of the Veterans' Review Board the ability to dismiss an application for review, has caused some angst in the ex-service community. The Veterans' Review Board is designed to be a less adversarial process than the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and does allow veterans to be represented by lawyers at this stage. This is the veterans' opportunity to be heard, and Labor holds concerns about the insertion of these provisions. In addition, during the FADT committee process the principal member advised that there have been only three circumstances in the past seven years where he or she would have used this power. We understand that, following the Labor opposition urging the government, they are now moving an amendment which removes this section. We welcome this change, which recognises the unique nature of the Veterans' Review Board.


Schedule 2 simplifies the appointment process for individuals on the Specialist Medical Review Council, progresses whole-of-government requirements for digital transformation, removes red tape in commencing reviews and provides for reimbursement of certain travel expenses. The Specialist Medical Review Council is an independent statutory body that reviews the contents of statements of principles or a decision of the Repatriation Medical Authority not to issue such a statement.


Essentially, the process is as follows: if someone believes there is an issue with an SOP, they take it to the SMRC for review. The SMRC then appoints a panel to review the SOP. If the SMRC agrees there is an issue, it is then turned over to the RMA for review. The SMRC consists of medical practitioners and medical scientists appointed as councillors by the minister and selected by the convenor of the SMRC for a particular review, involving three to five members on the basis of their expertise in the injury or disease relevant to the SOP subject of review. Under current arrangements, the minister must select members for the panel from a list or lists of nominations submitted by colleges or other bodies of medical practitioners or scientists. In practice, colleges forward the names of candidates who have responded to advertisements but do not assess or recommend candidates. In making appointments, the minister must have regard to the branches of science where expertise is necessary to decide review matters and must appoint not less than two councillors with experience in each branch.


Given these requirements, the process of appointing members takes around three months or longer. This affects the SMRC's ability to perform its functions. We have been advised that these amendments will not change the threshold for the specialists who are appointed to the panel. The amendments focus on streamlining the process of appointing specialists to the SMRC, which in its current form is described as labour intensive. In addition, these amendments provide financial incentives for individuals, representatives of organisations and any necessary attendants accompanying those individuals or representatives attending the SMRC hearing to make an oral submission.


Schedule 2 will also make several amendments which enable the convenor of the SMRC to give written directions about the manner for lodging requests for review for applications, enabling the SMRC to adopt electronic lodgements of requests for reviews rather than requiring a hard copy form as required by the VEA.


Schedule 3 relates to international agreements and gives the Minister for Veterans' Affairs the power to make agreements with foreign governments to cover the provision of benefits and payments under the MRCA, SRCA and DRCA. As it stands, existing agreements concern only those payments which are payable under the VEA. The new section will now cover allied veterans and Defence Force members with service of the type for which benefits and payments, including rehabilitation, can be provided by the Repatriation Commission or the MRCC under the VEA, MRCA, SRCA, DRCA or the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act 2006. It is so important that all veterans are covered, and I support extending agreements to cover all veterans' affairs legislation to ensure that veterans are covered under the relevant legislative framework, whether that is the VEA, the SRCA, the DRCA or the MRCA.


Schedule 4 legislates the Employer Incentive Scheme payments. These payments are made to employers in the form of wage subsidies to encourage them to engage injured veterans who have found it difficult to compete in a tight labour market. While the department has been able to facilitate these payments, this will strengthen the legislative foundation of the payments. One of the concerns I hear, especially from young veterans, is about the issue of employment. Work is so very important for people to feel they are contributing. Having a job is a reason to get out of bed. That is why I am completely committed to supporting measures that will assist veterans to move into and retain employment.


Schedule 5 amends the MRCA and the SRCA/DRCA to facilitate information sharing between the Military Rehabilitation Compensation Commission and the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation with regard to certain service-related compensation claims. As it stands, due to information-sharing provisions, if someone is medically discharged, they undergo a medical. When they go to the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation to organise payments, they undergo a second medical. And when they go to the DVA for assistance, they undergo a third medical. These amendments seek to enable information sharing between the CSC and the DVA, reducing some of the rework.


These amendments are designed to enable the CSC to access relevant claims information held by DVA, where that access would assist the CSC in the performance of its functions and powers. Access to the department's claims information, particularly to relevant medical and rehabilitation information, would assist CSC to make speedier superannuation benefit assessments, which, in turn, would assist the department to determine a person's entitlement to incapacity payments. A common complaint from veterans and advocates relates to the complicated and lengthy claims process for people seeking assistance from the department. I want to make this point very clear: there must be adequate safeguards in place to ensure that veterans' privacy is protected regarding any changes in this legislation.


Schedule 6 seeks to amend the MRCA to provide the Minister for Veterans' Affairs with the power to delegate his or her powers and functions to members of the MRCC, employees of the department, or persons engaged or appointed under the Public Service Act 1999. This function already exists under the VEA but was overlooked during the development of the MRCA. It makes sense that they be the same.


Schedule 7 will amend the legislation to exempt certain legislative instruments from subsection 14(2) of the Legislation Act 2003, and enable these legislative instruments to incorporate material contained in other non-disallowable legislative instruments or other non-legislative writings as are in force from time to time. The current requirement to amend Veterans' Affairs portfolio legislative instruments to incorporate changes in non-disallowable instruments causes significant administrative issues for the department. These changes will essentially allow material to be updated with new reference information without lodging each individual instrument into the parliament. The current process can cause administrative issues and unnecessary delays. An example of this can be seen in relation to the availability of a new rehabilitation appliance. The availability of new equipment will be delayed as the legislative instrument—in this case, the treatment principles that incorporate the document that the applicant may be provided—would need to be amended to refer to the changed date of the policy document. The amendments in schedule 7 will improve the administration of the acts, but not have any impact on the provision of benefits under the acts.


Schedule 8 will repeal redundant and spent provisions administered in the Veterans' Affairs portfolio concerning benefits that are no longer payable under portfolio acts. This schedule will remove references to payments which are no longer able to be accessed by individuals, in order to simplify veterans legislation and make it more accessible for individuals wishing to interpret the current provisions. The proposed amendment seeks to remove the following: the clean energy advance during a period before July 2012; parts providing for a one-off payment to older Australians in 2006, 2007 and 2008; the economic security strategy payment from 2008; and the educational tax refund payment in 2012.


In some circumstances, a person may be found to have been eligible for one of the payments because of a retrospective assessment of pension. Following the repeal, such a person will retain eligibility to receive the payment on the basis that they were eligible for the underlying payment during the relevant period that the repealed legislation was still in force. I am with Labor that we hold concerns about enabling the principal member of the VRB to dismiss claims and have yet to be convinced of the necessity of these provisions. Overall, though, I am supportive of any changes that streamline processes in the department that will assist our veterans and make processes a lot easier for them and less stressful for their families.

Ms LAMB
 (Longman) (19:20):  It really is a privilege to follow the member for Herbert in speaking to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2017. She is a fantastic advocate for her community up in Townsville and, like me, she really appreciates the work that our veterans have done in serving our country. I'm incredibly proud to rise today in solidarity with our veterans, who have already given so much to our nation. It is only fair that we, as their representatives, do whatever we can to support them. Whether it is supporting them to return to the workforce, helping them to live with a disability that they may now suffer from or even just helping them with the transition back to civilian life, it is important that we do what we can to support them. They deserve our support.


That is why I will continue to do what I can, and make sure the government does what it can, to provide Australia's veterans with the support they need in that transition to finding work or helping them in their community. I have been doing what I can already in my own electorate. I have been standing up for our veterans. Whether they live on Bribie Island, at Beachmere, in Caboolture, Morayfield, Narangba, Burpengary or Kallangur—we have wonderful communities of veterans throughout the electorate of Longman—I will always fight for our veterans and always support them. And, of course, I will always support legislation that helps them. I think it is fair to say that neither I nor Labor will ever stand in the way of good and sensible legislation.


I am standing here today agreeing to support the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill. By no means is this is a huge overhaul; the majority of the bill streamlines processes and makes things easier for veterans, which is what is fair, reasonable and should be expected. Most of all, for most of it, it is sensible and it is practical. I would like to speak on a number of the schedules to the bill. Schedule 1 will modernise and improve the operations of the Veterans' Review Board. This is a change that I welcome.


The Veterans' Review Board is a statutory authority whose role is to provide independent merits review of decisions about pensions and allowances under the Veterans' Entitlements Act as well as rehabilitation, compensation and other benefits under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004. The Veterans' Review Board is a body that serves a highly important function, so any changes that can be made to ensure it operates as effectively and efficiently as possible will always be welcomed by me on behalf of the veterans in my community. If these amendments ensure that the board pursues an objective of providing a mechanism of review that is fair, a mechanism that is accessible and just, a mechanism that is economical, informal and quick, a mechanism that helps to promote public trust and confidence in the decision-making of the board, then of course I will support these measures, as will my Labor colleagues.


These are sensible amendments, which is why I'm happy to support them, although I must point out it's no surprise to find that there was a proposal made by the government that apparently was suggested by the principal member of the Veterans' Review Board. I must commend the government for actually listening to suggestions. We all know that the only way for a government to formulate good policy is to listen and take heed of suggestions and to listen to those people who are affected, whether they be stakeholders or other organisations, or veterans or other people who live in the community. It is not possible to truly govern without listening to those who you represent, hearing what their needs and concerns are and listening to possible solutions or suggestions. It is just like hearing, I suppose, how many members of the ex-service community have expressed concerns with section 6 of schedule 1 of this bill.


I will go to section 6. It is understandable that this element has caused some angst in the community, as it gives the principal member of the Veterans' Review Board the ability to dismiss an application for review. Section 6 of schedule 1 of this bill effectively suppresses the voice of veterans who wish to stand up and represent themselves. The Veterans' Review Board is designed to be a less adversarial process than the AAT, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It is supposed to be less stressful, less painful and more accommodating to the needs of ex-service men and women. Lawyers won't be involved at this stage, which is welcome. This will be an opportunity for veterans to be heard, but I believe that making it so easy for the principal member of the board to dismiss an application for review puts this schedule at odds with the very principle of the process. It is not just me who thinks this—so do the Returned and Services League and my colleagues on this side of the House, in the Labor Party. Labor had prepared to seek amendments to this bill to remove that section in its entirety. We have been pressuring the government to do just the same.


Again, going against character today, I'm pleased to hear that the government has finally listened. I commend the government—twice in one speech!



Mr Byrne interjecting—




Ms LAMB:
  No, we won't. But when it is sensible, when it helps veterans in our community and right across Australia, of course we will commend and support the government on finally doing their job properly. We have been calling on them to listen to the RSL and other ex-service men and women for some time now, so it is fantastic that they have finally listened.


Schedule 4 stands out to me to be a very good move, one that I am happy to support and one that I think really will support and help the veterans in my community. Schedule 4 legislates Employer Incentive Scheme payments. These payments are effectively wage subsidies made to employers to encourage them to engage an injured veteran. I think this is important, and I really do welcome this. I have quite a lot of young veterans living in communities around Narangba and this is welcome for both the veterans and their families. We all know what the job market is like at the moment. It is a scant job market, a job market that is growing worse at an alarming rate. We as policymakers have a responsibility to do whatever we can to assist those who have served our country to find work post-service.


Some months ago, I hosted a visit by the shadow minister for defence, the honourable member for Corio, Mr Richard Marles, in my electorate of Longman. Along with the honourable member, we visited Remembrance House in Burpengary and spent quite a few hours sitting around the table talking to and listening to a group of returned service men and women.

Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (19:30):  Unfortunately, it's been a shameful week in this parliament. It was a truly depressing moment in Australian politics yesterday when the Minister for Justice made the contemptible smear that members of the Labor Party were somehow opposed to locking up paedophiles. The extraordinary AFP raids on the Australian Workers' Union's offices in Sydney and Melbourne later that afternoon took us to a new low. Our democratic institutions are precious, but they are in perilous shape. We don't spend enough time looking after them and doing the things that strengthen the system rather than advance the interests of any individual actor, and that goes for all MPs in this building, not just me. As a result, trust in our democratic institutions has collapsed, and the public think that political actors are in it for themselves and will cynically use our institutions for their own benefit rather than the public good. That comes at a great cost to all of us, corroding the utility of our institutions to drive change in our society and implement reform.


One of the most insidious trends in this regard over the past four years has been the criminalisation of the political contest—the use of institutions with coercive powers created by the government of the day and designed to persecute political opponents of the government in the parliament and civil society more broadly. We've seen this in the Prime Minister's disturbing habit of calling the police on his political opponents when he doesn't get his way: in the past on the NBN during the last federal election campaign and with respect to the Medicare text messages sent during the campaign. But it's important to understand that this behaviour happens in the context of the establishment of an $80 million royal commission into the trade union movement designed to pursue the coalition's political industrial opponents, and the establishment of the Registered Organisations Commission to institutionalise those political attacks on a forward basis.


The Prime Minister likes to claim that these institutions are not, in fact, political exercises but are instead institutions designed to restore the rule of law to our workplaces. However, it is hard to take this claim seriously when you compare the government's attack-dog approach to the trade union movement with its response to the greatest moral scandal in our nation today: the systemic exploitation of many thousands of temporary migrant workers across our nation. This is lawlessness in Australian workplaces today. It's not from unions; it's from employers who have engaged in endemic wage theft, the payment of below-minimum-wage rates of pay and denial of basic workplace conditions, and the abuse of workers, including horrific sexual abuse, in thousands of documented instances.


From June 2015 to July 2016, the Fair Work Ombudsman recovered more than $27 million owed to more than 11,000 workers who were underpaid by their employers, and it's clear this is just the tip of the iceberg. A 2016 survey of 4,000 overseas workers who completed the eight-day regional work requirements found that 66 per cent felt employers took advantage of them by underpaying them. In 2015-16, the AFP received 75 referrals related to workplace exploitation that were suspected to amount to human trafficking or related offences under Commonwealth law and, of those, 39 related to sexual exploitation; the rest were other forms of exploitation. Indeed, this lawlessness is so widespread that it's impossible to imagine that it is not having an impact on wages growth across the retail and hospitality sectors, but where are the show trials for 7-Eleven, Domino's and Caltex? Where are the calls for the coalition to stop accepting campaign donations from the companies and directors related to this lawlessness? Where are the calls for coalition MPs to disassociate themselves from directors of companies who have employed business models designed to facilitate wage theft from the most vulnerable members of our society? Where are the criminal charges for the routine falsification of documents, time sheets and pay slips that we see in these cases?


Instead, we see an AFP raid of a union over a 10-year-old donation to a civil society group—a donation disclosed at the time to the AEC and, indeed, publicised by the AWU, and it was documented in material provided to the royal commission. It was a raid implemented by 32 AFP officers without first seeking the voluntary production of the documents; a raid that occurred in the context of 117 officers at the AFP having been cut and leaving the AFP's ability to investigate crimes like drug trafficking diminished; a raid that occurred when the media were informed in advance, with television cameras waiting outside to document it and the Prime Minister's media unit tweeting along as it went; and a raid at the request of a body established by government, with members appointed by the government, pursuing a referral from the employment minister.


The Prime Minister insists these raids were not political, but does anyone believe they would have occurred if the member for Maribyrnong were not the Leader of the Opposition? These attacks on political opponents and civil society using the coercive powers of state, begun by the Abbott government and continued by the Turnbull government, are reminiscent of the Bjelke-Petersen era. It's Joh for Canberra 2.0, and it's a demonstration of the desperation of those opposite, the paucity of their agenda, the hollowness of the government and the depths they have sunk to so early in this term of the parliament.

 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (10:00):  I rise this morning to say congratulations and well done to all of the year 12 students completing their education across the community that I represent today. There are 15 educational institutions offering year 12 studies to students across the electorate, and I know across this week and next week there will be celebrations for us all to attend. Facebook is filled with photographs of young people heading off to school for their last day. What was once called 'muck-up day' has changed its name to 'celebration day' to ensure the behaviour fits the traditions without going overboard. I want to congratulate all of those students on this wonderful effort as well as the school communities that have supported them from preschool through to year 12 and the families that have supported them. I give a special congratulations to those young people on their commitment that saw them see it through. There will be graduation ceremonies. There will be last-day celebrations. There will be valedictory dinners. But, for those people completing the VCE, there will also be an examination period. I know they have been working hard to prepare for it over the year and they particularly will be for the next little while. To their families I say: well done. To their parents I say: keep them well watered and fed over these next few weeks to see them through to the end.


But mostly I want to thank the committed teachers in the electorate of Lalor for the work they have done, from kindergarten all the way through to year 12. I want to thank them for their work and commitment and for the hours they do beyond what is required of them and for the times they sit with students through difficult times, hold them up and push them out the door. For all of the things that they've done for our students, I want to say a very, very big thankyou. I know lots of mums are sharing photographs and waking up this week and going, 'Where have the years gone?' when they look at their young people as they march out the door in their uniform for the last time.


I also want to give a special shout-out today to somebody else who woke up in my community this morning and said to herself, 'Where have the years gone?' And that's my mum, who turned 90 today. I have spoken to her this morning and she said to me, 'I just can't believe I could possibly be 90.' To my mum, I say: lots of love. I wish I was home in Werribee with you. I'll see you on Friday. I'm looking forward to the celebrations with the family on Sunday. I'm so proud to have had you as my mum for my lifetime and I know all of the lives you've impacted on, including many young people in our community. Thank you.

"Mitchell, Brian, MP",ALP,2017-10-25,"



Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (11:00):  This is a government that has declared war on the working men and women of Australia. Under this Liberal government, Australian wage earners suffer pay cuts and tax rises, while corporations enjoy record profits and tax cuts—tax rises for wage earners, tax cuts for corporations and millionaires. But that's not enough for this government. This government also wants to squash the ability of Australians to act in their own interests in the workplace. It does not want to negotiate fairly with Australian wage earners over pay and conditions. Instead, it wants to give itself and its corporate friends the whip hand, using the power of legislation, the blunt instrument of legislation, to permanently handicap wage earners' negotiating position. 


This is a government enacting laws to entrench control in the hands of a corporate elite that believes it is born to rule. The Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017 before the House today is a case in point: 80 pages of legislation, introduced to the parliament six days ago, rushed through this place in under a month in order to evade the usual scrutiny. There's been no consultation with the people and organisations most affected by this bill. What we know about this bill is bad enough. But who knows what forensic probing might uncover if the parliament was given the opportunity to examine it properly. It is disappointing that Senator Xenophon, in one of his last acts as a senator in this place, for one reason or another has used his crossbench influence to diminish rather than enhance the ability of the parliament and particularly the Senate to scrutiny the legislation. He has allowed this bill to be fast-tracked through the Senate and he should be condemned for it. 


What we know about this bill is that it seeks to hobble the ability of unions to cooperate with employers. It establishes a raft of unnecessary new regulations around workers' entitlement funds, including prohibitions. Unions and employers have for many years jointly created funds that enable things like training, safety courses, bereavement payments, mental health counselling and so on. These are things that help create safer, better, more caring and more harmonious workplaces. So, of course, these things do not fit this government's agenda. The last thing this government wants is unions and employers working together. Industrial peace does not fit the Liberal script. For this government's political agenda to work, unions must be cast as bad, corrupt, evil things to be hated and demonised. It is only by fomenting hate that this government can galvanise its forces. Harmony and cooperation do not work for this government. It needs fear and division, and that is clear in nearly everything this government does and everything this government says on nearly all policy agendas before this parliament. 


So, rather than congratulating unions and employers on working together for the common good, and in doing so contributing to historically long levels of industrial peace in Australia, the minister defames these arrangements as 'cosy deals'. No mind that they are transparent and that they are subject to rigorous scrutiny and regulation. No. Just throw out a lazy smear and hope it will be picked up by the tame poodles and minions in the Murdoch press. Never mind that this minister, always so ready to smear unions, had at her right side for a year a man who actually broke the law, and she did nothing. She didn't call in the police. There was no raid on her office, to send him away, shackled and handcuffed. No: she knew for a year he had broken the law, and she left him there—Nigel Hadgkiss, the so-called tough cop on the beat, who broke the law that he was meant to uphold. This minister will go off her rocker in the Senate if a union member so much as jaywalks, but she stayed silent for a year about the head of the ABCC breaking the law when it's his job to uphold it. It is absolute, abject hypocrisy.


This employment minister has done nothing to protect the workers of 7-Eleven and the raft of other rip-off merchants. This employment minister has done nothing to call in the authorities to deal with phoenix companies that go bankrupt rather than pay workers their entitlements. This employment minister has done nothing but smear unions and union members while 28 construction workers died at work this year alone; 28 men and women have died at worksites in Australia this year so far, and what are this employment minister's words? What are this employment minister's actions? Zero—nothing, nada. That is because this minister does not really see herself as an employment minister. She is the anti-unions minister. She doesn't see it as her job to ensure that employers pay their workers fairly or that employers keep their superannuation payments up to date or that employers ensure that worksites are safe. No: she sees it as her job to destroy unions, because they are just so damned inconvenient when it comes to this government's agenda of abolishing secure, permanent work and higher wages.


On that note, I note that the member for Gorton has moved an amendment to this bill on penalty rates. I just can't believe—I still shake my head—that this year we have seen this government back in a decision to actually cut penalty rates—

Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  On the issue of penalty rates, we've had the extraordinary situation this year of this government backing a cut in workers' pay. I never thought I'd see the day when a government would rejoice in Australian wage earners having less money to take home to pay the bills. Jannette Armstrong, who heads up the United Voice union in Tasmania, a union that represents hospitality workers, who are very affected by these penalty rate cuts, says this is just the beginning—and we know that's true. She says:


Yes, this is many students, but this is also many, many families who rely on these penalty rates to pay the rent, put food on the table, put petrol in the car and it’s just going to make life so much harder.


We’ve had members and delegates in tears, we’ve had people calling us asking us when it starts, how are they going to go home and tell their families this afternoon that Mum just got a massive pay cut?


It won't be long before other industries and more workers are affected by cuts to penalty rates if we let these cuts stand, and that is why Labor is committed to rolling them back. Families are doing it tough already under this government, and things don't need to be made any tougher. Penalty rates need to be restored.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2017-10-25,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (11:20):  From the outset, I should say that I oppose this Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017 but that I support the member for Gorton's amendment. In doing so, I want to talk a little about penalty rates. I know they have taken up a fair bit of airtime in this parliament this year, with the decision of the Fair Work Commission to move to cut penalty rates, effectively for some 700,000 low-paid workers in the hospitality and retail industry.


Unlike in the United States—fortunately, we haven't gone down that path of having to rely on tips—these are people who work for a wage and who work on Sundays. For most of us who can afford to go out and enjoy ourselves on a Sunday or go to a restaurant, we don't even mind paying the Sunday surcharge. By the way—the restaurants I've been to lately still have the Sunday surcharge on even though they have cut penalty rates for their employees under the award. This government had the opportunity to join with the opposition in the private member's bill from the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Maribyrnong, to prevent that from occurring.


It's not just what these workers have had their wages cut by this year; it's going to be what they have their wages cut by again in 2019 and then in 2020. Effectively, these workers will not get a pay rise for some four years. Now, they're not the sorts of workers enjoying the same benefits as we do in this parliament. They don't have a parliamentary allowance and they don't have many other things. They are working on minimum wages; this decision only applies to those workers on minimum wage agreements, therefore, the cut in penalty rates for them is very real. It's what makes the difference for many in being able to put food on the table and it's those little benefits for those who are supporting families and catering for kids in school activities. These are the things that make a difference. People don't just work on Sunday because they feel like they want to work on Sunday or because they've got nothing else to do! They work on Sunday because they know it's the industry and they know they have to do it.


And we know it doesn't stop there. This was the start in enterprise negotiations around the country. Employers are starting to lock on to this; they see this as a negotiable area to try to have workers trade off penalty rates. This was the green light given to them by this government that it's fair game now to try to negotiate with your workers to give away penalty rates.


It's a slippery slope. Working conditions were struck to ensure that workers had a fair and equitable outcome—that they were able to maintain a reasonable standard of living, clearly not to get rich under, for the labour they put in. And yet this government salivated at the notion that we could see a cut in penalty rates and, effectively, a real cut in wages as a consequence. This comes at a time when we have record low growth in wages. It's probably the lowest growth in living memory in wage growth. It has flatlined, it has plateaued: it's not moving—that is, for those at the lower end of the scale.


For those at the top end, we see what is written in the Fairfax media about what happens in the Murdoch press, and we see in the Murdoch press what's happening in the Fairfax media. We know that at the top end of the scale they're getting big contracts. The top five per cent of our workers are doing pretty healthily. They are commanding huge salaries. They're not being held back by restraint. Also, this government is going to give them more through tax breaks. I would have thought it was important for those of us on both sides to look after those who have a pretty constrained voice—people who work for only award rates of pay, people who actually do it tough out there. I think that what goes with the privilege of being in this parliament is the responsibility of looking after people at the lower end of the spectrum. 


I know the big attack by this government is on the construction industry. It doesn't take much to get the Prime Minister to rattle off the acronym CFMEU. I accept there can be excesses, and we don't rail against having proper regulation covering both registered unions and registered employer organisations. There is no question about that, as long as it's appropriate. But the construction industry is one of the most dangerous industries in the country. I've got three kids. My eldest, my daughter, is a high-school teacher. My two sons, Nicholas and Jonathan, both work in the construction industry. I know—and it's not what gets spoken about in crib sheds or toolbox meetings—what happens on various job sites. 


A couple of years ago my son Nicholas was working in a fly-in fly-out operation in Western Australia. I got a call from him late at night to say, 'Dad, I'm coming home.' The bloke he was working with had been crushed to death. I'm not asserting that anything was associated with that other than a workplace accident, but I thought at the time that if there had been another set of eyes looking at safety—if I had been that man's family, I would have been pretty keen to see that everyone was focused on safety, including those in the union movement that are paid for by employer and employee funds to have occupational health and safety inspectors on site. I know what sort of impact that had on my son, who is an electrician. This man was working with my son and having morning tea with him, but he wasn't around at lunch time. There is a touch of irony to it in that two weeks ago I was talking to Nicholas, who was working on another job, this time in New South Wales, and one of the formworkers fell through the formwork. He was working with his father, who found him unconscious. A couple of weeks later, the kid's still in a coma. 


These things happen; they're not just things that you trot out in parliament when you need something to augment an argument. We know these things are real. Those on the other side know they're real. It's not just us in Labor representing blue-collar workers—God knows those opposite have a lot of blue-collar workers in their electorates—who depend on us to make decisions for their welfare. I can't understand how those opposite have locked themselves into a position based on trickle-down economics. 


Like many in this place, the other day I attended the launch of a publication by NETWORK, a Catholic social justice organisation, entitled An Economy that Works for All. Its introduction is by Frank Brennan and it is authored by Joe Zabar. I thought I should read it if I have time. Its introduction refers to the social justice statement of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference entitled Everyone's Business: Developing an Inclusive and Sustainable Economy. The Catholic Bishops Conference focused on the distribution of wealth and not only its creation but its use in our economy. I thought it was interesting, because trickle-down economics got a mention. The Catholic Bishops Conference agreed with Pope Francis that trickle-down theories which assume that economic growth, encouraged by a free market, will inevitably succeed in bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world have not been proven. That seems to be echoed by many credible economists. They go on to say that, in the 26 years since the last statement they made on this issue, economic growth has been insufficient to assume that the poorest Australians can enjoy a dignified and at least frugal existence. They're talking about the people we should be representing—people at the lower end of the scale; people who do not have bargaining positions; people who are price takers, not price makers. The price makers are the CEOs up the top on multi-million-dollar salaries. These are the people on the bottom earning very low rates of pay, minimum wages, who rely on things called penalty rates.


It's not surprising, I suppose, that this bill is being advanced by the same people who brought us Work Choices. I know, when I look around the room, that not everyone here was in the parliament when Work Choices was introduced under the Howard government. Work Choices was very significant and will go down in Australian history as the first time in Australia that it was legal to pay people below the award rates of pay. Those of us who were around know there were many debates about this. But it wasn't until after the 2007 election, which John Howard lost to the Rudd government, that members opposite who were around at that stage said: 'Chris, we always thought that you guys were just playing a union line. We just didn't think it was true or that it was possible.' It wasn't until they started getting knocked-up and harangued in their own electorates, not simply by blue-collar trade unionists or CFMEU officials but by mums and dads and grandparents who were concerned about what was happening to their kids, that they started taking it seriously. It was no longer just playing with ideology; it was playing with the future of families. People railed against it and they threw a government out because of it.


There is a track record here. This is the same government that abolished the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. Significantly, the tribunal was about setting rates of pay so truck drivers weren't doctoring their log books and cutting corners but taking their rests, with the genuine view of cutting accidents on our roads and protecting our communities. The government railed against the tribunal and abolished it, and the only reason was that they got a decision they didn't like. They've shown that, even if it's an independent tribunal that does something they don't like, they've got the answer: 'We'll abolish it.' That's precisely what they did.


The government's notion of mounting attacks on the trade union movement doesn't do them any good. They've got to understand that unions are not businesses. Unions are creatures of culture. They're in existence to do one thing—look after workers and workers' conditions. If we didn't have to look after workers' conditions, there probably wouldn't be unions here. But that's why they're here—to prosecute issues on behalf of workers. We're here in this Commonwealth parliament effectively as a union, a union in this parliament. We're here to look after the welfare of mums and dads out there. We're here to look after the interests of all in this country, not simply the corporates, who the government have rushed to give a $65 billion tax cut to in the vague belief that trickle-down economics will have people enjoying unrestrained wealth in this country. There is a concept that pigs might fly. I wouldn't suggest you believe in it, Madam Deputy Speaker Wicks, but obviously your Prime Minister does.


Why is the attack always on the lowest paid; the people at the most vulnerable end of the scale; the people who do not have a great bargaining position; the people who look to us in this parliament to defend them, defend their families and defend their way of life? What the government are putting through with their raft of anti-union legislation doesn't behove even a Liberal government; as a matter of fact, it makes a sham of the name 'Liberal', quite frankly. And this is at a time when in the United States, according to TheAustralian Financial Review, Donald Trump—and he's a person I don't often quote in this place—is talking about tax hikes for the rich, saying they might have to pay more and, if they do, they will. That's not the notion of trickle-down economics. He's going in a slightly different direction, whereas your position is to tax the low-paid and give tax cuts to the rich. It might be different if we were all relying on shares or corporate handouts. If we're going to do our jobs—and we intend to—we will always look after workers and workers' rights, and we will support those organisations that make that their core activity as well.

Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (11:35):  Today I'm very proud to rise in support of the amendment moved to the Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017 by Brendan O'Connor, the shadow minister for employment and workplace relations. We cannot tackle inequality or build a better future unless Australia has a workplace relations system that is productive and fair. I emphasise 'fair'. 


I am proud of my union membership. I belong to the oldest union in this country. A nefarious ideology, writ large when it comes to reducing union power, is to be shouted down at every opportunity. There has been an abuse of power, the use of regulatory bodies for political gain and a bid to stifle legitimate organisations and their right to act and protect their members. As the member for Fowler just indicated, their interests have been trampled on and stifled, and they have been bullied. This lot on the other side hate unions because they stand up for normal, everyday, hardworking Australians who weren't born with silver spoons in their mouths and who don't pay for private education or private health insurance—everyday working Australian people going about their daily business and trying to earn a living. It is absolutely deplorable that those on the other side seek to reduce the union membership in this country, which protects workers. 


Such are the actions of this government, and they include the introduction of this bill last Thursday in an attempt to rush its passage through the parliament. This sets almost impossible time lines for stakeholders to prepare submissions and present evidence. It begs the question: what have the government got to hide and why are they in such a hurry? Where is the proper scrutiny and due process for consideration and consultation on this bill? This is yet another attack by the government on unions. These attacks are relentless. Once again, they are attacking Australian workers and their entitlements. The outcome of this proposed change will limit legitimate activities of unions. Those on the other side of the House attempt to gain, again and again. 


Further, the outcome of the proposed changes will limit legitimate sources of income for unions. The Liberals have always been anti worker. The member for Fowler just spoke about the 'Your Rights at Work' campaign. I wasn't around for that—I think I was still in high school—but I am often reminded, out on the streets, when I talk to our union members and our Labor Party members, of how hard won that campaign was. We thought we saw that off, but all we've seen since is Liberal government after Liberal government attacking workers. They are happy to put their hands up for the big end of town, be a massive cheer squad for them and give them a handout, rather than give everyday Australian workers a fair go. 


Living standards are what makes this country great—make no mistake. Now they are under significant attack. The government wants to attack workers and their entitlements by making cuts to penalty rates, cuts to holiday pay and cuts to working rights. For the life of me, I cannot understand why low-paid workers are always in the firing line when it comes to this cruel Liberal government. This is how out of touch they are with the lives of middle- and working-class people, the people I represent: the Prime Minister gives millionaires a $16,400 tax cut and gives a $65 billion tax break to big business, yet inequality is at a 75-year high. We wonder why. Actually, we on this side don't wonder why; we know exactly why. We look at it every single day that we are here. 


For the benefit of people on the other side, inequality is not peeking over the back fence, looking at jet skis and realising you don't have one. There is stagnant wages growth, and 'wages growth' is an oxymoron when we haven't had any. I'd like to see 'wages non-growth' adopted as your three-word slogan at the next election, perhaps. They want to further undermine workers and their unions, and they have already cut the take-home pay of people across this country. Madam Deputy Speaker Wicks, these workers are people who I represent and, I dare say, people who those on the other side, including you, probably have the opportunity to represent in this place. Considering wages in this country have been stagnant ever since this government was elected, its decision is a kick in the guts to working people who are already struggling to get by. Pay and conditions are not supposed to stagnate or go backwards. We see productivity going up and up and up, and wages just flatlining. 


The Prime Minister's press release claims that, through cosy deals with big business, unions have become a big business in their own right and are more focused on making profits than representing people. I don't know about him, but he obviously hasn't attended any union functions lately or he'd know that we are not big business and that the unions do not represent or look anything like a big business. They represent hardworking people and are out defending working rights every single day, not turning it up at silver-spoon lunches and ritzy dinners. After the Federal Court's decision on cutting penalty rates, the minister said: 


… Federal Court decision once again highlights the hypocrisy of the Labor Party and the unions.


It is beyond comprehension! We keep hearing about workers being ripped off—7-Eleven and Domino's Pizza. Over the 12 months from June 2015 to July 2016, the Fair Work Ombudsman recovered more than $27 million owed to 11,000 workers for almost 30,000 allegations of Fair Work Act breaches. Who do you think stood up for those people? It wasn't the big end of town that this government seeks to give tax cuts to. It wasn't those people who got a handout and tax relief of $16,400. The union movement was standing up for those people. The astronomical numbers represent only those instances of underpayment and exploitation of workers that were reported to the ombudsman. We hear anecdotally on the street every day about such instances, and my office has certainly been regularly contacted by people who make such claims. We need to stand up for working people and their communities. We need to listen to business concerns, of course, and we need to stand up for a fairer, more equitable, inclusive and prosperous Australia. 


Just how out of touch can this government get? The retail trade industry is the second-largest employment category in Australia. It employs 1.2 million people, or one in nine Australians, and 52 per cent of those workers have no post-school qualification. When it comes to my electorate of Lindsay, that equates to over 12,000 people. It is the second-highest employer in my community. The penalty rate cuts are just another milestone in this government's cruel attempts to hurt workers. Labor will never support undermining workers' rights and avoiding workers' entitlements. In fact, we will do the opposite. We will always stand up and fight for them. People need penalty rates to make ends meet. For many people every cent counts, but, if you've never been affected by it, that might be hard to understand. The government has effectively delivered a $77-a-week pay cut to all of those people. For the government, this has been a business decision, but, for the people in my electorate, this is personal. Worker entitlement funds provide for employee long service leave, sick leave and redundancy payments. They provide important services for workers, such as counselling, which we as members of this House also have access to; training; and safe workplaces. All people want is what is fair. 


What is even more worrying is that women will bear the brunt of these devastating cuts. We often hear Malcolm Turnbull, the Prime Minister, refer to his lovely wife, Lucy, in terms of 'women hold up half the sky'. I would just like that 'half' to include equal pay for women in this country, not the absolutely shocking wage gap that exists now and the even greater gap that this decision makes. Women are most likely to be working on weekends and covering public holiday shifts. This is not through choice. It is not like they put their hand up and say, 'I'm happy to go to work on a Sunday, miss my kid's birthday, miss the family lunch, miss the family picnic, miss the opportunity to catch up with my kids who are at school during the week.' They do those shifts on the weekend because their families and their lives dictate that it is the only time when they can have the help and support that they need for their children, because, as we all know, child care is out of the reach of many people in this country. Cutting the pay of workers in industries such as retail and hospitality is the worst thing this government can do to worsen the gender pay gap. We know that, when local workers have less money in their pockets to spend, it actually hurts the local economies as well. 


When I was at university I had four part-time jobs, two of which paid me penalty rates. I was the first of my generation in my family to go to university. I relied on every single cent from those four part-time jobs—which were all insecure, casual work—to run my car, pay my bills, pay my rent and buy my textbooks. Many people do more than four jobs; many people do more than one job. Without those penalty rates and those extra payments for those unsociable hours that I had to work just to get by, I wouldn't have been able to achieve what I did. From my story, I think it is absolutely important and vital to protect and stand up for people who are relying on those penalty rates every single day. 


This government cannot deliver. The proof of the pudding is in the eating—their track record on the NBN; the issues with the Yarra III that we had; the citizenship debacle that we're now waiting on the results of; the robo-debt with Centrelink; the Bureau of Statistics bungle last year in trying to get our census together, which I had almost forgotten to mention; the energy crisis that we've had no movement on for five years; and their failing to do anything at all about alleviating the cost of housing and the unaffordability for so many Australians. Now they're cutting penalty rates. They've just wasted $122 million on a postal poll on equality and people's rights. If this were a report card, this government would be getting a F for fat failure.


Yet now, again, they are coming after the lowest-paid workers. The Turnbull government has no idea about how hard things are for people. From Point Piper over to Penrith is a big distance. I know the Prime Minister knows how to get there during an election campaign by train, but I haven't seen him since. I haven't seen him turn up on the doorsteps of those workers who he seeks to cut money from to say how much he supports and loves Western Sydney, which is a shame. Point Piper is not actually that far in distance, although some people do think they need their passport to come out to visit us, but it is a world away from the different standards of living that those people he represents enjoy compared with the people that I represent. 


All this government is focused on is looking after the rich end of town and trusting that it will trickle down. Well, it doesn't. It absolutely doesn't. Trickle-down economics has been myth-busted and fact-checked, and all the experts and economists around the world have said, 'This does not work.' So why are we in here with a government so obsessed with trickle-down economics? We know that more must be done to reduce the gender pay gap, to make industrial relations more user friendly for small businesses, to make the Fair Work Commission easier to access, to create jobs pathways for people with disabilities or people who are marginalised, to tackle discrimination against older workers so they stay in the work force, and to help younger people.

Ms HUSAR:
  Cutting the pay of workers in any industry is the worst thing this government could do to the gender pay gap. The government cannot deliver, and so much proof is already in the pudding—their track record on the NBN, the citizenship debacle, robo-debt, and the energy crisis they are failing to do anything about after five years in power. They are also failing to do anything about housing affordability. And there was the recent $122 million waste of taxpayers' money on a survey. If the government had a report card, they would fail. Now we are seeing them come after the lowest paid workers.


We need to be doing more to help younger people enter work in the first place. We need to be doing more to reduce the gender pay gap. We need to be doing more to make industrial relations more user-friendly for small business and make the Fair Work Commission much easier to access. We need to create jobs pathways for people with a disability and those people who might be marginalised, and we need to tackle discrimination of older workers so they stay in the workforce for much longer and continue their contributions. We need to create a future for work, not continue to cut away at workers' rights.


This government isn't focused on helping workers at all. They are too busy saving their own jobs. We saw that at the last election, with the Prime Minister pouring in millions of his own money to protect his own job. The government are desperately trying to distract the public from the fact they have no agenda to address wage stagnation, underemployment, rising inequality or anything else, for that matter. They are failing the average Australian every single day they come into this place. The government are not meeting the challenges of low wages growth, rising inequality and job insecurity.


It is completely unsurprising, then, that, under this government, wages are falling in real terms while cost-of-living pressures are rising and workers are struggling to make ends meet. In my own electorate of Lindsay, we have a three per cent higher cost of living than those people Malcolm Turnbull, the Prime Minister of this country, represents in his electorate of Wentworth. According to the latest data, wages growth in enterprise agreements approved in the quarter fell to 2.6 per cent from 2.7 per cent, a 26-year low. This government has refused to stand up for working people time and time again, despite the many opportunities it's been given. It could not be bothered to lift a finger to assist our lowest paid workers.


Over the last 10 years, real labour productivity grew by 20 per cent and real wages growth grew only six per cent. Wages share of GDP is well below the average of the last 50 years. This country deserves better than a government which puts corporate profits above people's wellbeing. They are arrogant and out of touch. They would rather hand tax cuts to big business than stand up for working people and their hard-won and well-earned pay and conditions. We are very, very concerned that the Turnbull government are incapable, unable and unwilling to address consistently flat wages growth. In fact, they are making things worse by cutting the penalty rates of Australia's lowest paid workers. My constituents are concerned because penalty rates make a real difference to how they live. They ensure that those families who earn them can afford the extra things they pay for out of those penalty rates. They now face pay cuts as a result of this government. They were worried about how they were going to afford fuel to get to work. This means cutting back on their already tight spending habits. I know how tough some working people in my community in my electorate of Lindsay have had it. They've had a gutful of this government's bad decisions.

"Conroy, Pat, MP",ALP,2017-10-25,"



Mr CONROY
 (Shortland) (12:03):  I rise to oppose the Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017 because this is fundamentally an attack on working people in this country. It is an attack on working people's ability to bargain for improved conditions. This represents the latest round of this government's misguided ideological crusade against the union movement. This is a government that has been relentless in its campaign against the union movement and working-class people from day one, while giving out huge tax cuts to the top end of town and refusing to go after the big banks.


The tragedy of this unfair and misguided approach is that the real cost of it is inflicted on working people. This proposal to axe entitlement funds typifies this by aiming to cut essential services such as suicide prevention, OH&S and training schemes simply because they are provided for and protected by unions. These entitlement funds are bargained for by companies and workers in good faith, and they both make sacrifices to fund them. Whether they be suicide prevention programs, training schemes or safety officers, these are crucial aspects of providing safe workplaces and they are under attack in this misguided bill. These funds not only protect those who need it most but boost productivity by improving workplace conditions and worker satisfaction. To cut these programs based on an ideological vendetta with no evidence is callous and ill thought through.


It is no wonder this government do not understand how these changes will affect average Australian workers, because they have consistently ignored opportunities for inquiry and consultation. As has become an all too familiar trademark of legislation under this government, we have seen an unwillingness to consult widely and openly in an attempt to rush this bill through parliament before anyone can pull them up on it. Labor is meeting with these Australians, Labor is listening and the sentiment is crystal clear. This is a shoddy deal for workers and everyone knows it.


These entitlements are helping Australians across a number of industries, with programs that save lives and support families. For example, some of the most successful and well-known products of these entitlements funds are the MATES in Construction and MATES in Mining initiatives, funded by a trust set up by the CFMEU. These initiatives have seen thousands of people in these industries trained to assist in suicide prevention. This organisation, which is a product of good-faith bargaining between employers, trade unions and the workforce, raises awareness and runs programs that target the huge problems of suicide amongst workers in the construction and mining industries. These industries are very male dominated. They are industries that have high workplace fatalities—and I will return to that in a minute. As I said, these industries are male dominated, and blokes typically don't talk about their mental health. That is just a characteristic of most men. So these programs, which train their fellow workers to raise these issues with them, are very, very effective. I recently met with key participants in the MATES in Mining program and they are gravely concerned about the future of this lifesaving program under this legislation. Research into MATES in Construction has found it to be one of the most successful programs of its kind and found that it recoups investment many times over in community benefit.


Other funds also protect workers from redundancy, both financially and through training and professional development, and secure entitlements such as long service leave for ordinary Australians. Why the government would want to attack the providers of such vital services is beyond me. Coupled with the concessions to big banks, multinational corporations and the highest-income earners in Australia, it just reflects how out of touch this government is with the majority of Australians. 


Safety is of paramount importance on our work sites. Every Australian and every worker in the world has a fundamental human right to go to work and return safely each day. In the construction industry, almost one worker a week dies on the job. In the mining industry, in the northern coalfields of New South Wales—the Hunter region, which I proudly represent—1,803 miners have lost their lives since coalmining began in 1803. Over the last nine years we have averaged one death a year. This is a disgraceful statistic, and this bill weakens efforts to stop these statistics. This bill weakens the ability to bargain for safety officers on workplaces. This bill undermines the safety of those work sites. This bill hurts safety and impinges on the human rights of Australians to go to work and come back safely. 


I know this will be seen as potentially going over the top, but this bill represents an attack on safety in our work sites. Ultimately, the government have to be held responsible for this. The government have blood on their hands. The government have blood on their hands because they are undermining safety in workplaces right now. Members opposite can roll their eyes and can interject all they want, but look at the facts: every bill that impinges on the ability to employ safety officers, every bill that undermines the ability of workers to preserve safety in their workplaces and every bill that impinges on the right of unions to enter workplaces on safety complaints endangers safety in these industries. I proudly state, and I state accurately, that this government has blood on its hands when it undertakes such actions. So I am proudly opposed to this bill, because it hurts safety, like so many other bills this government puts forward. 


A second part of their blind persecution of the union movement is their attack on wages in this country. We have international organisations such as the IMF and OECD citing declining union density and collective bargaining as major factors in the stagnation of wages and the growth of inequality around the world. In Australia, this is being experienced right now. The latest data on EBA pay rises found that in the last quarter EBA pay rises rose by 2.6 per cent, the lowest on record since the EBA system was put in place. We have flat or declining real wages, we have workers who are struggling to meet the costs of living because their wages are going backwards, and we have insidious actions by companies, such as the widespread attack on enterprise agreements, assisted by terminating agreements willy-nilly. It is no wonder workers are finding it difficult to bargain for wage rises, if there is a very real danger their EBA will be terminated and they will suffer a 40 per cent pay cut. We are seeing a systematic attack on wages and conditions in this country through a concerted push to de-unionise, and this bill is the latest example of that.


Another example of this is penalty rates. We have seen this government's cheer squad cheering on and refusing to do anything to stop the cuts to penalty rates that have now been put in place. Cuts to penalty rates have hit hundreds of thousands of the lowest paid workers in this country. It is the worst example of trickle-down economics—an example that was totally discredited in the Great Depression—where if you cut wages you suddenly boost economic activity and, somehow, businesses will employ thousands more Australians. This theory, based on Say's law, was discredited in the 1930s, where we saw a 25 per cent across-the-board cut in workers' wages and it didn't improve employment and put Australians back in work. It actually led to more unemployment because it reduced aggregate demand dramatically. When penalty rates for workers are cut, it means they have less money to spend in shops in Australia. The lowest paid Australians have the greatest propensity to consume and the least ability to save, and are living from pay cheque to pay cheque, so they spend basically every dollar they earn. If you attack them by cutting their wages, you are attacking consumption directly, and this is what the cut to penalty rates has done. So, not only is it hurting those workers individually but it is actually hurting our economy by suppressing aggregate demand in the economy and, thereby, employment.


We have also heard the government say that it only affects hospitality and retail workers and doesn't affect anyone else. Well, that's the thin end of the wedge. It will lead, no doubt, to attacking workers in other sectors of the economy.


My electorate is home to a significant hospital, Belmont Hospital. We are right on the border with the John Hunter Hospital, which is the largest hospital between Sydney and Brisbane. It is the third-largest in the state and is the only tertiary-level hospital between Sydney and Brisbane. If you get seriously sick north of the Hawkesbury River, that's where you are sent. Without penalty rates, John Hunter Hospital, and Belmont Hospital in fact, will close at five o'clock on a Friday night and won't open until 9 am on a Monday. Penalty rates are the only reason those hospitals stay open, because it is the only compensation for the nurses and support staff who keep the hospitals running. An attack on penalty rates for hospitality workers will no doubt lead to a subsequent attack on penalty rates for nurses and for support staff such as orderlies, thereby imperilling our health system.


This bill is another attack on the wages and conditions of Australians. It's all about weakening the union movement. This government's raison d'etre is to destroy the labour movement. They figure that if they can destroy the labour movement they can destroy the Labor Party as an effective opposition in this country. This playbook is classic John Howard. He tried it in 1998. He thought that if he could destroy the MUA, one of the most militant, democratic and progressive unions in this country, the rest of the union movement would follow. We saw the lockout by Patrick and a government conspiring to sack a workforce. They conspired to unfairly dismiss an entire workforce to break the MUA—and they failed. They failed not just because of the union movement but because the broad swathe of the Australian community said, 'No, we support progressive causes, we support trade unions in this country and we will take part in community pickets to protect the MUA and its members.' We've seen them attack the MUA and we are seeing the current attacks on the CFMEU that are contained in this bill. You just have to listen to question time every day to hear these attacks. I dare those people who are leading these attacks to go to the memorial day for miners in Cessnock each year—which commemorates the 1,803 miners who have lost their lives in the northern minefields—and look those families in the eye and say, 'I'm improving the safety of your workplaces by attacking the CFMEU.' I can assure you, without the mine workers federation, safety in those coalmines would be a lot weaker. 


I can say without fear of contradiction that, if you deunionise the construction sector, you won't see improved safety; you will see fatalities rise. Almost one worker each week in the construction sector dies. So this is not just an attack on the labour movement; it is an attack on the wages and conditions of Australian workers and an attack on the safety of Australian workers. It represents an ideological crusade that takes no prisoners. It is an ideological crusade to deunionise this country, to weaken the labour movement and thereby weaken the Labor Party, and to maximise profits for some of their corporate mates. 


Quite frankly, most employers don't want this. Most employers are genuine, decent people who just want to employ Australians, make a profit and support their family. Most of the employers I talk to want a level playing field. They want fair industrial relations, which means they're not competing with the workplace down the road on wages; they're competing on innovation and productivity. Anything like this that invites more shonks into the business, anything that makes it easier for shonks to set up and rip off their workers by not paying long service leave into portable funds, and anything that allows more repeats of the 7-Eleven fiasco hurts legitimate, caring, responsible employers who aren't it in for the quick buck for six months but are in it for decades. 


So, like all my Labor colleagues, I am proud to reject this legislation, because we've also charted the middle course. We've always condemned inappropriate behaviour on worksites, whether it's by employers or unions, and that's why the question time behaviour by various ministers is farcical, because we're not out there defending criminal behaviour; we're saying everyone should respect the rule of law in workplaces, but the rule of law has to be fair. It has to not tilt the playing field towards one particular group. It has to allow Australians to bargain collectively to have their rights at work respected, to bargain collectively for decent pay rises to support their families and to bargain collectively to improve the safety of their workplaces so that they preserve the ultimate human right, which is to return home safely from work each day. I proudly condemn this legislation as another egregious attack on working people in this country and, like all my Labor colleagues, I stand opposed to it.

"Giles, Andrew, MP",ALP,2017-10-25,"



Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (12:17):  The Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017 once again demonstrates a bitter irony when it comes to this government's approach to changes in the world of work. We know, as Australian workers know and as their representative organisations—unions and the ACTU—know, that it's time to change the rules which govern power at work. But the government is determined to change the rules to reinforce inequality and inequity, not to address it. At the core of Labor's agenda is confidence in Australians, confidence in Australians' capacity to do more, particularly at work. This government is bereft of that confidence and is further determined to constrain the capacity of Australians in the workplace and around the workplace when it comes to skills, when it comes to schools and when it comes to university. 


What this bill demonstrates is that, once again, this government is prepared to put forward its ideological obsession with constraining the rights of individual workers, and in particular the rights of unions to represent workers in workplaces, in defiance of the evidence. On this side, we understand—as international bodies like the IMF and the OECD have made very, very clear—that increasing inequality is a constraint on economic growth. It hurts all of us as well as individual workers, and this bill is just another demonstration of this preference, this determination on the part of the government, to continue to tilt the playing field in workplaces in favour of employers and against working people and their representatives. 


So I am very pleased to join my Labor colleagues, and, in particular, the shadow minister, in opposing this legislation and supporting the amendment which deals with a small but very significant aspect of this debate. At the moment, we understand that wages growth continues to be at a record low and the wage share of the economy continues to be in consistent decline. I think this is the problem, and I think we should all take stock of a couple of facts that characterise the Australian economy today. We all congratulate ourselves on 26 years of consecutive economic growth, and that is a significant achievement, but focusing simply on this ignores some deep realities that shape the lives of too many Australians. At the moment, we have record company profits at a time of record low wage growth. This is a gap that we, as lawmakers, should be trying to close, but the government is determined to exacerbate that gap. We see it most obviously in the insane giveaway of an increased push for more corporate tax cuts, and we see it in the continued insistence on further seeking to diminish the rights of workers in their workplaces to bargain.


Today we find that growth is at a 26-year low, the same time span as that period of continuous economic growth for the economy as a whole. That demonstrates, again, why we need to change the rules in the opposite direction from that which is contended by this government and exemplified by this legislation. Wages, real wages, for too many Australians are simply going backwards. Of course, this is wage growth in the formal economy. It doesn't account for those Australians pushed into informal and even more insecure forms of work. Living standards for these people aren't simply under pressure; they are being squeezed. And that's why it's more than a little bit rich to hear the government talk about cost-of-living savings when they talk about their National Energy Guarantee—or national energy aspiration, as it probably should be called—because the big issue with the living costs of Australian working people and working families is this anaemic wages growth. The cost of living isn't just what you have to pay for things; it's the money you have at bank to be able to pay for things, and it is extraordinary that the government continues to ignore this pretty fundamental fact. We need to change the rules to give workers and their representatives more power in workplaces, not less. 


I mentioned briefly the amendment on penalty rates. The government's consistent attack on penalty rates is simply abhorrent, and it doesn't reflect the choices that are being forced on too many working Australians: to work antisocial hours and to discount their life to maintain their income. A pretty fundamental proposition that Australian governments of all sides of politics have accepted is that penalty rates are fair compensation for a drag away from time with family and time with friends—the ability to engage in social life and cultural amenity. This government talks blithely, through the Prime Minister, about a 24-hour economy, but has no regard for those forced to pay the price, because there isn't a 24-hour society, is there? People's capacity to engage with family and friends is constrained by working patterns that don't reflect the Prime Minister's confident view of how the economy should work. 


In supporting the amendment of the shadow minister, the member for Gorton, I want to make very clear that I'm standing in solidarity with 700,000 Australians who are having their penalty rates cut, having their standard of living cut and having their sense of dignity and sense of agency cut. But I also stand in solidarity with those many, many more Australians who aren't directly affected by the current decision, but whose penalty rates are affected. I know that many nurses, in particular, and other shift workers in my electorate are deeply concerned by the signal that has been sent by an unfortunate decision of the commission and an abhorrent refusal of the government to remedy it. I guess the crux of the problem is this: we have a government that talks about the cost-of-living issues in energy and flicks the problem off to the states, whilst claiming to have fixed the issue, but, in an area of direct legislative competence of the Commonwealth parliament, it does nothing—or, in this case, it does less than nothing. 


I think it is worth touching on some particular features of the bill that is before us now. This bill is a product of the Heydon royal commission—although, as is always the case with this government's law-making, it is important to be careful and test the claims. The claim here about it being a response to the royal commission is one that I think will be found wanting and, I suspect, is one of the reasons for the appalling failure of process which governs the introduction of this piece of legislation. The bill before us deals with matters that are quite technical—matters that actually do require this government, if it were serious, to attend to a problem. Perhaps we can come back and ask what problem this legislation is intended to solve. Unfortunately, we don't seem to be assisted by government member contributions to this debate, which is of itself rather telling. This bill would make very significant technical changes to entitlement funds, which play a very significant role in many industries. These are issues which, if there were matters to be addressed, should be properly ventilated through a Senate inquiry process. Instead, here we are in the Federation Chamber debating a bill—or perhaps not debating a bill but putting on the record—



Ms Bird interjecting—




Mr GILES:
  Yes, as the member for Cunningham says, there isn't a debate here. It is disappointing that, once again, government members aren't here to show the courage of their convictions, are they? So we are putting on the record our concerns about this bill, and we do so at two levels. When we look at the government's broad attitude, there is its failure to respond to fundamental changes in the world of work which are disadvantaging workers, at a time when corporate profits are at a record high and at a time when the Treasurer adds insult to injury by mouthing words like 'inclusive growth'. If you want inclusive growth, how about looking to workers? How about looking at recasting the distribution of the national pie? How about paying some attention to those levers available to the federal government which can redress the imbalance of power and which are not only constraining the ability of individuals to earn an income but also constraining our wider prospects of economic growth and, with it, doing untold damage to communities and to our society?


This bill imposes a range of additional restrictions on the governance of entitlement funds and imposes further restrictions on bargaining, which is precisely the opposite of the approach that we should be undertaking. I hope that members opposite, if they're not going to participate in this debate, would have regard to the contribution of the member for Gorton at the National Press Club a couple of weeks ago, where he looked squarely at the questions that confront Australian workplaces and the Australian economy and set out some proposals that would address the problems. The member for Gorton was very frank in doing so, because he conceded that in our last period in government, in responding to the aggressive, antiworker, anti-union, anti-democratic Right agenda of the Howard government, we didn't pay sufficient regard to the changing nature of work in Australia—in particular, how a model of bargaining which initially served all Australians pretty well in the 1990s was losing pace with the demands of the modern economy, particularly the changes in the structure of work. The member for Gorton accepted that. He pointed to some examples, and some of those were around termination of agreements—in particular, at Murdoch University. There we have an attack on working people that not only is the government simply ignoring but the Minister for Education is encouraging other employers in the sector to follow. It's pretty clear that that is no way to deal with slow wage growth—quite the reverse. It's going to further depress wage growth, to no-one's benefit. 


So here we have a bill that is all about imposing further prescriptions, a series of red-tape obligations, on important bodies. Again I recall at the start of the last parliament the great excitement that government members put on about their red-tape reduction exercise. Well, it's interesting: when it comes to their other ideological hobbyhorses, too much red tape is barely enough. Every week we get an amendment to the Migration Act and every week we get an amendment to the Fair Work Act. Those amendments are really all about doing one thing, which is constraining workers' ability to collectively exercise their rights and secure themselves decent outcomes.


I was really pleased to be in the chamber for the contribution of my friend the member for Shortland. He dealt with a critical aspect of this debate that is too often ignored in the wider commentary, and that is the impact of these imbalances of power that are being codified in legislation on workers' safety. I would have thought it a pretty unexceptional statement, for anyone who's concerned for their fellow Australians, to set out the proposition that anyone who goes to work is entitled to return home safely. It is simply appalling that this government is determined to strip away the capacity of workers to attend to that on their own behalf and on behalf of their colleagues and comrades in workplaces.


But no, this legislation is simply a reheat of tired ideological obsessions. They've found another device whereby unions have been able to offer some protection to workers in difficult times and have done the right thing to redress particular imbalances of power. But, again, the response isn't to recognise this or to look at how it might have broader application to deal with this fundamental problem that's characterising the Australian workforce and the Australian economy at the moment. It's simply to carry on down this blinkered ideological path of further constraining workers' rights and doing everything they can to deny unions their legitimate, democratic capacity to carry on their roles on behalf of their members.


Coming to the end of my contribution, I want to again raise this fundamental point: what is the problem that this bill is responding to? I thought members opposite were interested in leaving things alone from government, but instead they seem to simply want to interfere. We on this side of the House know that the time has more than passed to address some of these imbalances of power in the labour market. We do need to change the rules, but we need to change the rules to do the right thing by workers, to strengthen the capacity of unions democratically to work for them—not the reverse.

Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (12:32):  Time after time I find myself frustrated, bemused and quite often angry about the range of legislation that comes before this chamber when those opposite are in government. I spent my first term at the end of the Howard era among the infamous industrial relations changes around Work Choices. Quite rightly, there was not only a union driven campaign but also a community supported campaign rejecting that dog-eat-dog view of how industrial relations should be managed and regulated in this country. But we now see, under both the Abbott and Turnbull prime ministerships, continuing, ongoing—time and time again—pieces of legislation that, at their heart, are about one thing, and that is destroying the capacity of workers to unite through a formalised union in order to raise issues in a workplace where they don't have the balance of power.


At the heart of it is what sits at the heart of the Liberal and Nationals parties: a belief that only those who can break through that dog-eat-dog world and make good for themselves are deserving of decent pay conditions and a decent lifestyle and that if somehow you can't do it on your own then that's a reflection of you individually, rather than having an understanding of the way our society is structured. It often means that power is enormously twisted to one side of the equation. We have known for generations that those who own the workplaces, those who are putting the money into those workplaces, have an enormously stronger capacity for power than the workers who work in those workplaces.


It's a very simple function of a decent society that those workers are able to organise, to elect union representatives to represent them and to work in a concerted, united manner not only to improve their pay and conditions but on issues such as health and safety. We supposedly don't have a conservative party in the Liberal Party. They're supposed to be a 'liberal' party. They're not supposed to be out there on the far-right-wing fringes of the political spectrum. But on some of these issues—to be honest, on so many issues in general in recent times—they're taking themselves off to that far-right wing.


Like many of my colleagues, I meet regularly with my local unions. I meet regularly with the South Coast Labor Council. I also meet with my business chamber. I meet with other peak bodies around the electorate that represent a variety of views. I would be very surprised if any of those opposite had regular meetings with trade unions in their local area. I would never consider ignoring the views and issues of my local business chambers. I wouldn't even consider it. I wouldn't consider spending all my time in this place attacking their right to be peak groups representing the views of their memberships. Yet so often those opposite do exactly that with the trade union movement. Of course we'll have policy differences. We are born out of the trade union movement; we were born out of the fact that trade unions realised they had to have a political voice as well as an industrial voice. Those opposite, according to how often they say, 'Put your hand up if you've been in business,' have obviously been born out of the view that the business and investment sectors need a voice in parliament too. That's fine. But if those opposite want to be effective they should make sure they're engaging with and respecting the role of all those institutions in our society.


We are seeing growing inequality. We are seeing stagnant wages. We are seeing greater exploitation in the workplace. We are seeing an increasing number of deaths in workplaces. There are real challenges for us in what's going on in our economy and in the workplaces of Australia. If we were serious about creating a society that shared wealth fairly, that understood that the people not getting their fair share weren't just workers but also consumers—and that's what our great social experiment in Australia for over 100 years has been about; we've built up a middle class who have gained the capacity to be effective consumers because they've had good pay and conditions and safe workplaces, and these things complement each other—we would be addressing these issues. We would be looking at why these things are going astray in our current environment. But, no, we're back here with another bill that's about micromanaging the unions, about trying to put handcuffs not only on their capacity to represent, advocate and negotiate and be political but even, in this case, on their capacity to work cooperatively with employers on the sorts of things one would think they both had a common interest in. Employers obviously think they've got a common interest in these areas, because they've often jointly funded, with the unions, things like counselling, preventing suicide in workplaces, and the health and wellbeing of workers. I'm absolutely bemused by the ideology of those opposite—that they could go to this level of attack on unions simply to handcuff their capacity to work effectively on behalf of working people, and, in this case, as I said, in a type of activity that unions undertake in partnership with employers because both see the value in these sorts of programs.


In the Minister for Employment's press release on this bill, what did she say? She said:


Through cosy deals with big businesses, unions have become a big business in their own right, more focussed on making profits than representing people.


If I ever believed she was the least bit interested in unions' capacity to represent people, I might have some sympathy for what she was trying to say. She doesn't. She never does. She has no respect for the trade union movement's capacity to represent people. It is a constant ongoing attack. I can't even imagine what those opposite would be doing. They certainly wouldn't be completely absent from the debating list, as is the case with this debate. Other than the minister's speech, I think there have been hardly any contributions from those opposite.


But I can imagine what would be happening in this place if we were in government and introducing bill after bill like this but trying to hobble the capacity of peak employer organisations to prosecute a case, run campaigns, implement programs and raise funding in order to progress the wellbeing of their members. Forget calling us socialists—they'd be calling us communists and dictators. That's the sort of reality we'd be facing if we tried this sort of stunt on people who form organisations and peak bodies in order to advocate and represent employers, whether they're big business, like the Business Council of Australia; particular industry sectors, like the Australian Industry Group; or small businesses, like COSBOA. If we were trying this sort of stunt and treating those organisations with the arrogance and disrespect that this government shows to the trade union movement, there would be a riot on the other side of this place. I personally am sick and tired of the double standards that this government has about the capacity of people in our civil society to form membership based organisations and advocate on their own behalf. They would not tolerate it if we did that sort of thing, nor will we tolerate it when they decide they're going to do it to trade unions. 


The other problem I have with this bill before us, as is too often the case, is that it appeared last Thursday on the list. It's an extensive piece of legislation—five schedules going to 80 pages. It will amend five different pieces of legislation. One would think that something this significant should be given the respect of a proper and considered debate in this place. It has very significant implications, as I've outlined, not only for unions but, as I indicated, also for employer groups. You would think they would want to be able to have some say and some input into this process.


I actually think that the sort of work that this bill attacks is some of the best stuff that I've seen in workplaces. I've spent time with things like MATES in Construction—a fantastic organisation that works with unions and employers around suicide prevention. Some of the best things that happen in our workplaces are the things that employers and unions do together, because often they're going to the heart of very challenging social issues, things we're facing as a society, that are coming into workplaces and really seriously need addressing. That's often when employers and unions come together and say, 'We have a common interest in this so let's jointly fund, organise and run these sorts of programs.'


It is true, sadly, that mental health challenges are a serious matter for workplaces now. I remember talking to a peak body of hairdressers when we were in government and I had responsibility for skills. The one big issue hairdressers wanted to talk to me about was mental health—young apprentices coming in with complex anxiety and depression issues. This is not a one-off. It's a really common challenge for this generation. As employers they were not just worried about that as a productivity issue, about how it was impacting on the work in their workplace and about that young person's capacity to finish their apprenticeship but also, like the vast majority of employers, deeply concerned about these young people and wanted to know what they could do as an employer to help in those circumstances. 


This is the reality of workplaces in the modern world. These sorts of programs should be supported. Employers who engage in them should be lauded for doing that; unions that engage in them should be lauded for doing that. It is astonishing to me that the government is so hidebound in its hatred of unions that it can adopt the sorts of measures that we see before us in this bill, and do so in a rushed and hurried manner without proper consideration. I'm very disappointed that the Nick Xenophon Team didn't support our proposal to have a Senate committee inquiry, because I think these really important issues should be teased out and considered. 


In the couple minutes I've got left to speak, I want to touch on some of the matters that are playing out in my local area that, if the government were really interested in workplaces, they could be spending a lot more time on. I want to touch firstly on the issue of penalty rates. It has been a big issue in my electorate. I recently surveyed my electorate on issues of importance to them and had a very strong response back on the issue of penalty rates. While the vast majority of people who responded to my survey didn't actually work in an environment where they received penalty rates, 80 per cent of them supported people getting Sunday penalty rates. Even people who weren't getting these rates themselves saw fairness and justice in people who lose their Sundays being recompensed, getting that additional support, yet the government flat out refused to take any action to ensure that people continued to get decent pay—even though, apparently, they've now discovered there is a problem with pays and incomes and perhaps we should have higher pay rates. 


Finally, I want to give an example of why unions are so important at the local level. In my area, the South Coast Labour Council for quite a while has been running a campaign around the exploitation of young workers. A young woman from the University of Wollongong had put up a post on her Facebook about a very exploitative experience she'd had in the workplace and was just blown away by the massive number of young people who went on her Facebook and commented, having had very similar experiences—not being paid, being underpaid, being exploited in terms of their work conditions. It was quite shocking. The South Coast Labour Council became aware of this and then worked with these young people—Ashleigh Mounser was the young woman from the university—to start a campaign to raise awareness. It is true that some of the employers didn't intentionally get things wrong, but it was so unregulated and so unchecked that terrible exploitation went on. If the government wants to spend its time on something useful, I suggest it could spend it in this space.

Ms LAMB
 (Longman) (12:48):  This is getting quite ridiculous. It seems every second day I'm up on my feet in parliament speaking against a government attack on workers and on the trade union movement. It is bordering on ridiculous. But pathetic attacks like these are all that a pretty desperate government seems to have up its sleeves. They have no vision; they have no plan. It seems that this is what we're stuck with—attack after attack on workers or the trade union movement. There certainly is no action or policy that will help move Australia forward. If we don't hear, 'Blame Labor, it's Labor's fault', we hear, 'Let's blame the trade union movement, let's blame workers.' This blame game has to stop. It's a game the Liberals keep playing; it's getting quite tiring and it has to stop. I know I've had enough of it, and I think Australia's has had enough too. I think you'd be hard pressed to find an Australian who wouldn't rather have their government just stand up and govern. People are sick and tired of this. I think they want their government to stand up, take a little bit of responsibility and show a little bit of integrity. That would go a long way. But, with this government, even that appears to be too much to ask. 


Despite having led the country for some years—five years is not a short amount of time—the mess they've created seems to be somebody else's fault. Apparently even the failed NBN, their failed NBN, is Labor's fault. Can you believe that? The second-rate copper NBN, which the coalition fought tooth and nail to implement over our superior policy, is somehow Labor's fault! It's outrageous. They are fooling nobody, but this is what they continue to parrot about.


How about this week in the Federation Chamber? I'm glad the member for Boothby is here. She attempted to lay the blame for the collapse of the Australian automotive industry on the trade union movement. Here was a government member again blaming the trade union movement for something. It was truly, truly ridiculous. What a blatant attempt by the member for Boothby to distance herself from the failings of her government. It's pretty common knowledge right across Australia that the collapse of the Australian automotive industry can be directly linked to the actions of the Liberal government. In true Liberal fashion, rather than showing some integrity, she sought to blame—guess who?—the unions. She sought to blame the unions, the very people who fought against the Abbott government's foolish mismanagement of the manufacturing industry, the very people who fought to keep this industry alive and who fight to keep many industries alive. They are the very people who fought for and won annual leave, sick leave, long service leave, pensions, Medicare, superannuation—where shall I stop? I say to the member for Boothby and to the government: I'm sure the trade union movement would welcome and accept a letter of thanks for all of those things that I'm sure the member for Boothby and other government members have enjoyed themselves and which their constituents as workers of this country enjoy every single day. I'm sure they'll look forward to that letter.


But, instead, we've got a government in crisis mode, a government that are going down and that will stop at nothing to drag everyone down with them. The government's actions are so desperate. The government are demonstrating an inappropriate use of taxpayers' money. But it's clear to see why they're doing it, of course. They're doing it in an absolutely pathetic attempt to shift the blame from their misdoings and at the same time malign the unions who stand up to them when they attack workers. With a government so determined to undermine the rights that Australians—their constituents and my constituents—have worked so hard for, it seems that unions have to stand up to them pretty regularly.


It really comes as no surprise that we're here again today—as I said, this is bordering on ridiculous—debating yet another bill that this government has introduced in yet another desperate attempt to undermine workers in the trade union movement. This bill, the Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017, is not just an attack on unions; it is an attack on every worker in this country. This bill has very significant implications for anyone who benefits from their entitlements being protected through a worker entitlement fund and anyone who benefits from the counselling, training, OH&S and other support services that those funds invest in. A worker entitlement fund is a fund which is for the purpose of paying out worker entitlements and death benefits, like leave payments, payments in lieu of leave, payments in relation to termination of employment—any payments that contracts, awards or agreements provide for an employer to make to an employee. This bill puts additional requirements on those funds.


From a party that once claimed it wanted to cut red tape and government intervention, this looks a lot like a government intervening and actually adding red tape. That's what it looks like to me. The coalition really doesn't care about any of the outcomes of this bill except that it wants to be an inconvenience to unions. That's why it's so foolhardily rushing this bill through. Why else would it so carelessly deny proper scrutiny, proper discussion and transparency with stakeholders before introducing this into parliament?


When you think about this rushing the bill through, it's pretty clear that—with the support of their ever-faithful crossbench comrades, Senator Xenophon and his team—the Liberals have denied calls to conduct a thorough Senate employment committee inquiry into this legislation. Instead of carefully considering the implications of this bill and what effects it would have on workers, what effects it would have on business and what effects it would have on the Commonwealth; instead of looking at this through a really clear lens and actually scrutinising it, they have imposed a reporting date of 10 November 2017. That's just over two weeks away. There are 80 pages to scrutinise and we've been given two weeks.


In typical Liberal fashion, they are blinded by union-hating rage. It's typical. 'Cover your ears and put your blinkers on.' That's what we have come to expect from this government. How can stakeholders and any affected business or employer groups properly prepare a submission and evidence with a deadline of just two weeks? Eighty pages in two weeks? How can you properly do that? The simple answer is you just can't. You can't possibly do that. But that's exactly what this government wants, isn't it? They don't want the opportunity for this to happen properly. They don't want any interjections and they don't want anyone disparaging their plans, whether that's justified or not. It appears that this government just don't like being told what is wrong and they just don't like being held to account. 


Accountability and transparency are the hallmarks of good governance. They are the foundations of a respectable parliament. But it appears to me, again, that the Turnbull government wants none of that. It appears—it is very evident, actually—that the government's intention with this bill is to undermine and erode the rights of all of Australia's workforce. This is a government for the top end of town, not for ordinary Australians like those who live in my electorate of Longman and who will be affected by this bill. This government is not for the ordinary people of Longman, who have been attacked time after time after time by reckless legislation that only benefits those who actually don't need it. I'd love to hear any member of this government try to explain to the vulnerable people of low-income Australia just what they're doing to help them in any way, shape or form. I'd love to hear it, but I suspect it would be a pretty short list. 



An honourable member interjecting—




Ms LAMB:
  Yes, a 50-cent list—if that. In comparison, Labor's list is pretty long. Labor's list is comprehensive. It's fleshed out and has been fleshed out for a long time. This government has been in power for four years and is now in its fifth year, and it still hasn't formulated any strong policies that will benefit all of Australia. You will remember that Labor went to the last election with 100 positive policies. We showed Australia that we weren't just here to fight in parliament. We showed Australia we were listening to ordinary people all around Australia, to Australians from all walks of life, because everyone deserves a say. We heard from people—and we continue to—and we formulated strong policies that we took to the election. Since then, we've continued to build upon them. We know what Australian people want, and it's not what this government is offering. It's not huge cuts to the taxation rates of millionaires and it's not throwing billions of dollars at corporations or banks. It's policies that protect ordinary, everyday Australians. That is what Australian people want. It's policies that protect workers in Australia, the people who are the backbone of this nation. 


Australians are sick of the wars that the coalition keep waging on workers. They are sick of them. They know that they serve no benefit to the Commonwealth and they serve no benefit to the Australian people. Australians know that cuts to the take-home pay of ordinary Australians is a terrible idea. These are cuts to the take-home pay of people who work weekends and nights, people who work unfavourable hours, and give up time with their families. Australians know that you don't cut the take-home pay of those workers. You'll remember the member for Gilmore saying this was a gift to young people. A gift—to cut their take-home pay? She can keep that gift, that's for sure. She might have called it a gift; I reckon it's a lump of coal. We know that those opposite have a real affinity for black coal! But the people of Australia would rather have the money they so badly need and that they work really hard for. It is money that puts food on the table.


On the same note, and to pick up on another area, the Australian people also know that PaTH internship placements make absolutely zero sense. They see straight through that as well. They know that if a business wants to employ someone—you know what?—it goes ahead and employs them. If you've got a job vacant and you want to employ someone, go ahead and employ them. This government doesn't need to throw thousands of dollars at businesses just so they can get free labour. 


People know that tax cuts for big businesses are an absolutely terrible idea. The national debt is sitting in such a terrible position, thanks to this government's economic mismanagement. How could anyone in their right minds justify $65 billion worth of cuts to big business? What an absolutely ridiculous idea. The more I talk about it, the more I realise just how strongly this government have taken a side. They have turned their backs on workers and they're staring up at big business, and that just isn't right. It's not right. From this government, in bill after bill and motion after motion, there is never any reprieve. It's attack after attack on Australian workers and handout after handout to big business. I oppose this bill. It is, plain and simple, an attack on the services that unions provide to workers. Workers don't deserve this. They deserve more, and I will be standing up every single day opposing this bill. 


Debate adjourned.

"Mitchell, Brian, MP",ALP,2017-10-25,"



Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (11:00):  This is a government that has declared war on the working men and women of Australia. Under this Liberal government, Australian wage earners suffer pay cuts and tax rises, while corporations enjoy record profits and tax cuts—tax rises for wage earners, tax cuts for corporations and millionaires. But that's not enough for this government. This government also wants to squash the ability of Australians to act in their own interests in the workplace. It does not want to negotiate fairly with Australian wage earners over pay and conditions. Instead, it wants to give itself and its corporate friends the whip hand, using the power of legislation, the blunt instrument of legislation, to permanently handicap wage earners' negotiating position. 


This is a government enacting laws to entrench control in the hands of a corporate elite that believes it is born to rule. The Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017 before the House today is a case in point: 80 pages of legislation, introduced to the parliament six days ago, rushed through this place in under a month in order to evade the usual scrutiny. There's been no consultation with the people and organisations most affected by this bill. What we know about this bill is bad enough. But who knows what forensic probing might uncover if the parliament was given the opportunity to examine it properly. It is disappointing that Senator Xenophon, in one of his last acts as a senator in this place, for one reason or another has used his crossbench influence to diminish rather than enhance the ability of the parliament and particularly the Senate to scrutiny the legislation. He has allowed this bill to be fast-tracked through the Senate and he should be condemned for it. 


What we know about this bill is that it seeks to hobble the ability of unions to cooperate with employers. It establishes a raft of unnecessary new regulations around workers' entitlement funds, including prohibitions. Unions and employers have for many years jointly created funds that enable things like training, safety courses, bereavement payments, mental health counselling and so on. These are things that help create safer, better, more caring and more harmonious workplaces. So, of course, these things do not fit this government's agenda. The last thing this government wants is unions and employers working together. Industrial peace does not fit the Liberal script. For this government's political agenda to work, unions must be cast as bad, corrupt, evil things to be hated and demonised. It is only by fomenting hate that this government can galvanise its forces. Harmony and cooperation do not work for this government. It needs fear and division, and that is clear in nearly everything this government does and everything this government says on nearly all policy agendas before this parliament. 


So, rather than congratulating unions and employers on working together for the common good, and in doing so contributing to historically long levels of industrial peace in Australia, the minister defames these arrangements as 'cosy deals'. No mind that they are transparent and that they are subject to rigorous scrutiny and regulation. No. Just throw out a lazy smear and hope it will be picked up by the tame poodles and minions in the Murdoch press. Never mind that this minister, always so ready to smear unions, had at her right side for a year a man who actually broke the law, and she did nothing. She didn't call in the police. There was no raid on her office, to send him away, shackled and handcuffed. No: she knew for a year he had broken the law, and she left him there—Nigel Hadgkiss, the so-called tough cop on the beat, who broke the law that he was meant to uphold. This minister will go off her rocker in the Senate if a union member so much as jaywalks, but she stayed silent for a year about the head of the ABCC breaking the law when it's his job to uphold it. It is absolute, abject hypocrisy.


This employment minister has done nothing to protect the workers of 7-Eleven and the raft of other rip-off merchants. This employment minister has done nothing to call in the authorities to deal with phoenix companies that go bankrupt rather than pay workers their entitlements. This employment minister has done nothing but smear unions and union members while 28 construction workers died at work this year alone; 28 men and women have died at worksites in Australia this year so far, and what are this employment minister's words? What are this employment minister's actions? Zero—nothing, nada. That is because this minister does not really see herself as an employment minister. She is the anti-unions minister. She doesn't see it as her job to ensure that employers pay their workers fairly or that employers keep their superannuation payments up to date or that employers ensure that worksites are safe. No: she sees it as her job to destroy unions, because they are just so damned inconvenient when it comes to this government's agenda of abolishing secure, permanent work and higher wages.


On that note, I note that the member for Gorton has moved an amendment to this bill on penalty rates. I just can't believe—I still shake my head—that this year we have seen this government back in a decision to actually cut penalty rates—

Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  On the issue of penalty rates, we've had the extraordinary situation this year of this government backing a cut in workers' pay. I never thought I'd see the day when a government would rejoice in Australian wage earners having less money to take home to pay the bills. Jannette Armstrong, who heads up the United Voice union in Tasmania, a union that represents hospitality workers, who are very affected by these penalty rate cuts, says this is just the beginning—and we know that's true. She says:


Yes, this is many students, but this is also many, many families who rely on these penalty rates to pay the rent, put food on the table, put petrol in the car and it’s just going to make life so much harder.


We’ve had members and delegates in tears, we’ve had people calling us asking us when it starts, how are they going to go home and tell their families this afternoon that Mum just got a massive pay cut?


It won't be long before other industries and more workers are affected by cuts to penalty rates if we let these cuts stand, and that is why Labor is committed to rolling them back. Families are doing it tough already under this government, and things don't need to be made any tougher. Penalty rates need to be restored.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2017-10-25,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (11:20):  From the outset, I should say that I oppose this Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017 but that I support the member for Gorton's amendment. In doing so, I want to talk a little about penalty rates. I know they have taken up a fair bit of airtime in this parliament this year, with the decision of the Fair Work Commission to move to cut penalty rates, effectively for some 700,000 low-paid workers in the hospitality and retail industry.


Unlike in the United States—fortunately, we haven't gone down that path of having to rely on tips—these are people who work for a wage and who work on Sundays. For most of us who can afford to go out and enjoy ourselves on a Sunday or go to a restaurant, we don't even mind paying the Sunday surcharge. By the way—the restaurants I've been to lately still have the Sunday surcharge on even though they have cut penalty rates for their employees under the award. This government had the opportunity to join with the opposition in the private member's bill from the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Maribyrnong, to prevent that from occurring.


It's not just what these workers have had their wages cut by this year; it's going to be what they have their wages cut by again in 2019 and then in 2020. Effectively, these workers will not get a pay rise for some four years. Now, they're not the sorts of workers enjoying the same benefits as we do in this parliament. They don't have a parliamentary allowance and they don't have many other things. They are working on minimum wages; this decision only applies to those workers on minimum wage agreements, therefore, the cut in penalty rates for them is very real. It's what makes the difference for many in being able to put food on the table and it's those little benefits for those who are supporting families and catering for kids in school activities. These are the things that make a difference. People don't just work on Sunday because they feel like they want to work on Sunday or because they've got nothing else to do! They work on Sunday because they know it's the industry and they know they have to do it.


And we know it doesn't stop there. This was the start in enterprise negotiations around the country. Employers are starting to lock on to this; they see this as a negotiable area to try to have workers trade off penalty rates. This was the green light given to them by this government that it's fair game now to try to negotiate with your workers to give away penalty rates.


It's a slippery slope. Working conditions were struck to ensure that workers had a fair and equitable outcome—that they were able to maintain a reasonable standard of living, clearly not to get rich under, for the labour they put in. And yet this government salivated at the notion that we could see a cut in penalty rates and, effectively, a real cut in wages as a consequence. This comes at a time when we have record low growth in wages. It's probably the lowest growth in living memory in wage growth. It has flatlined, it has plateaued: it's not moving—that is, for those at the lower end of the scale.


For those at the top end, we see what is written in the Fairfax media about what happens in the Murdoch press, and we see in the Murdoch press what's happening in the Fairfax media. We know that at the top end of the scale they're getting big contracts. The top five per cent of our workers are doing pretty healthily. They are commanding huge salaries. They're not being held back by restraint. Also, this government is going to give them more through tax breaks. I would have thought it was important for those of us on both sides to look after those who have a pretty constrained voice—people who work for only award rates of pay, people who actually do it tough out there. I think that what goes with the privilege of being in this parliament is the responsibility of looking after people at the lower end of the spectrum. 


I know the big attack by this government is on the construction industry. It doesn't take much to get the Prime Minister to rattle off the acronym CFMEU. I accept there can be excesses, and we don't rail against having proper regulation covering both registered unions and registered employer organisations. There is no question about that, as long as it's appropriate. But the construction industry is one of the most dangerous industries in the country. I've got three kids. My eldest, my daughter, is a high-school teacher. My two sons, Nicholas and Jonathan, both work in the construction industry. I know—and it's not what gets spoken about in crib sheds or toolbox meetings—what happens on various job sites. 


A couple of years ago my son Nicholas was working in a fly-in fly-out operation in Western Australia. I got a call from him late at night to say, 'Dad, I'm coming home.' The bloke he was working with had been crushed to death. I'm not asserting that anything was associated with that other than a workplace accident, but I thought at the time that if there had been another set of eyes looking at safety—if I had been that man's family, I would have been pretty keen to see that everyone was focused on safety, including those in the union movement that are paid for by employer and employee funds to have occupational health and safety inspectors on site. I know what sort of impact that had on my son, who is an electrician. This man was working with my son and having morning tea with him, but he wasn't around at lunch time. There is a touch of irony to it in that two weeks ago I was talking to Nicholas, who was working on another job, this time in New South Wales, and one of the formworkers fell through the formwork. He was working with his father, who found him unconscious. A couple of weeks later, the kid's still in a coma. 


These things happen; they're not just things that you trot out in parliament when you need something to augment an argument. We know these things are real. Those on the other side know they're real. It's not just us in Labor representing blue-collar workers—God knows those opposite have a lot of blue-collar workers in their electorates—who depend on us to make decisions for their welfare. I can't understand how those opposite have locked themselves into a position based on trickle-down economics. 


Like many in this place, the other day I attended the launch of a publication by NETWORK, a Catholic social justice organisation, entitled An Economy that Works for All. Its introduction is by Frank Brennan and it is authored by Joe Zabar. I thought I should read it if I have time. Its introduction refers to the social justice statement of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference entitled Everyone's Business: Developing an Inclusive and Sustainable Economy. The Catholic Bishops Conference focused on the distribution of wealth and not only its creation but its use in our economy. I thought it was interesting, because trickle-down economics got a mention. The Catholic Bishops Conference agreed with Pope Francis that trickle-down theories which assume that economic growth, encouraged by a free market, will inevitably succeed in bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world have not been proven. That seems to be echoed by many credible economists. They go on to say that, in the 26 years since the last statement they made on this issue, economic growth has been insufficient to assume that the poorest Australians can enjoy a dignified and at least frugal existence. They're talking about the people we should be representing—people at the lower end of the scale; people who do not have bargaining positions; people who are price takers, not price makers. The price makers are the CEOs up the top on multi-million-dollar salaries. These are the people on the bottom earning very low rates of pay, minimum wages, who rely on things called penalty rates.


It's not surprising, I suppose, that this bill is being advanced by the same people who brought us Work Choices. I know, when I look around the room, that not everyone here was in the parliament when Work Choices was introduced under the Howard government. Work Choices was very significant and will go down in Australian history as the first time in Australia that it was legal to pay people below the award rates of pay. Those of us who were around know there were many debates about this. But it wasn't until after the 2007 election, which John Howard lost to the Rudd government, that members opposite who were around at that stage said: 'Chris, we always thought that you guys were just playing a union line. We just didn't think it was true or that it was possible.' It wasn't until they started getting knocked-up and harangued in their own electorates, not simply by blue-collar trade unionists or CFMEU officials but by mums and dads and grandparents who were concerned about what was happening to their kids, that they started taking it seriously. It was no longer just playing with ideology; it was playing with the future of families. People railed against it and they threw a government out because of it.


There is a track record here. This is the same government that abolished the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. Significantly, the tribunal was about setting rates of pay so truck drivers weren't doctoring their log books and cutting corners but taking their rests, with the genuine view of cutting accidents on our roads and protecting our communities. The government railed against the tribunal and abolished it, and the only reason was that they got a decision they didn't like. They've shown that, even if it's an independent tribunal that does something they don't like, they've got the answer: 'We'll abolish it.' That's precisely what they did.


The government's notion of mounting attacks on the trade union movement doesn't do them any good. They've got to understand that unions are not businesses. Unions are creatures of culture. They're in existence to do one thing—look after workers and workers' conditions. If we didn't have to look after workers' conditions, there probably wouldn't be unions here. But that's why they're here—to prosecute issues on behalf of workers. We're here in this Commonwealth parliament effectively as a union, a union in this parliament. We're here to look after the welfare of mums and dads out there. We're here to look after the interests of all in this country, not simply the corporates, who the government have rushed to give a $65 billion tax cut to in the vague belief that trickle-down economics will have people enjoying unrestrained wealth in this country. There is a concept that pigs might fly. I wouldn't suggest you believe in it, Madam Deputy Speaker Wicks, but obviously your Prime Minister does.


Why is the attack always on the lowest paid; the people at the most vulnerable end of the scale; the people who do not have a great bargaining position; the people who look to us in this parliament to defend them, defend their families and defend their way of life? What the government are putting through with their raft of anti-union legislation doesn't behove even a Liberal government; as a matter of fact, it makes a sham of the name 'Liberal', quite frankly. And this is at a time when in the United States, according to TheAustralian Financial Review, Donald Trump—and he's a person I don't often quote in this place—is talking about tax hikes for the rich, saying they might have to pay more and, if they do, they will. That's not the notion of trickle-down economics. He's going in a slightly different direction, whereas your position is to tax the low-paid and give tax cuts to the rich. It might be different if we were all relying on shares or corporate handouts. If we're going to do our jobs—and we intend to—we will always look after workers and workers' rights, and we will support those organisations that make that their core activity as well.

Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (11:35):  Today I'm very proud to rise in support of the amendment moved to the Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017 by Brendan O'Connor, the shadow minister for employment and workplace relations. We cannot tackle inequality or build a better future unless Australia has a workplace relations system that is productive and fair. I emphasise 'fair'. 


I am proud of my union membership. I belong to the oldest union in this country. A nefarious ideology, writ large when it comes to reducing union power, is to be shouted down at every opportunity. There has been an abuse of power, the use of regulatory bodies for political gain and a bid to stifle legitimate organisations and their right to act and protect their members. As the member for Fowler just indicated, their interests have been trampled on and stifled, and they have been bullied. This lot on the other side hate unions because they stand up for normal, everyday, hardworking Australians who weren't born with silver spoons in their mouths and who don't pay for private education or private health insurance—everyday working Australian people going about their daily business and trying to earn a living. It is absolutely deplorable that those on the other side seek to reduce the union membership in this country, which protects workers. 


Such are the actions of this government, and they include the introduction of this bill last Thursday in an attempt to rush its passage through the parliament. This sets almost impossible time lines for stakeholders to prepare submissions and present evidence. It begs the question: what have the government got to hide and why are they in such a hurry? Where is the proper scrutiny and due process for consideration and consultation on this bill? This is yet another attack by the government on unions. These attacks are relentless. Once again, they are attacking Australian workers and their entitlements. The outcome of this proposed change will limit legitimate activities of unions. Those on the other side of the House attempt to gain, again and again. 


Further, the outcome of the proposed changes will limit legitimate sources of income for unions. The Liberals have always been anti worker. The member for Fowler just spoke about the 'Your Rights at Work' campaign. I wasn't around for that—I think I was still in high school—but I am often reminded, out on the streets, when I talk to our union members and our Labor Party members, of how hard won that campaign was. We thought we saw that off, but all we've seen since is Liberal government after Liberal government attacking workers. They are happy to put their hands up for the big end of town, be a massive cheer squad for them and give them a handout, rather than give everyday Australian workers a fair go. 


Living standards are what makes this country great—make no mistake. Now they are under significant attack. The government wants to attack workers and their entitlements by making cuts to penalty rates, cuts to holiday pay and cuts to working rights. For the life of me, I cannot understand why low-paid workers are always in the firing line when it comes to this cruel Liberal government. This is how out of touch they are with the lives of middle- and working-class people, the people I represent: the Prime Minister gives millionaires a $16,400 tax cut and gives a $65 billion tax break to big business, yet inequality is at a 75-year high. We wonder why. Actually, we on this side don't wonder why; we know exactly why. We look at it every single day that we are here. 


For the benefit of people on the other side, inequality is not peeking over the back fence, looking at jet skis and realising you don't have one. There is stagnant wages growth, and 'wages growth' is an oxymoron when we haven't had any. I'd like to see 'wages non-growth' adopted as your three-word slogan at the next election, perhaps. They want to further undermine workers and their unions, and they have already cut the take-home pay of people across this country. Madam Deputy Speaker Wicks, these workers are people who I represent and, I dare say, people who those on the other side, including you, probably have the opportunity to represent in this place. Considering wages in this country have been stagnant ever since this government was elected, its decision is a kick in the guts to working people who are already struggling to get by. Pay and conditions are not supposed to stagnate or go backwards. We see productivity going up and up and up, and wages just flatlining. 


The Prime Minister's press release claims that, through cosy deals with big business, unions have become a big business in their own right and are more focused on making profits than representing people. I don't know about him, but he obviously hasn't attended any union functions lately or he'd know that we are not big business and that the unions do not represent or look anything like a big business. They represent hardworking people and are out defending working rights every single day, not turning it up at silver-spoon lunches and ritzy dinners. After the Federal Court's decision on cutting penalty rates, the minister said: 


… Federal Court decision once again highlights the hypocrisy of the Labor Party and the unions.


It is beyond comprehension! We keep hearing about workers being ripped off—7-Eleven and Domino's Pizza. Over the 12 months from June 2015 to July 2016, the Fair Work Ombudsman recovered more than $27 million owed to 11,000 workers for almost 30,000 allegations of Fair Work Act breaches. Who do you think stood up for those people? It wasn't the big end of town that this government seeks to give tax cuts to. It wasn't those people who got a handout and tax relief of $16,400. The union movement was standing up for those people. The astronomical numbers represent only those instances of underpayment and exploitation of workers that were reported to the ombudsman. We hear anecdotally on the street every day about such instances, and my office has certainly been regularly contacted by people who make such claims. We need to stand up for working people and their communities. We need to listen to business concerns, of course, and we need to stand up for a fairer, more equitable, inclusive and prosperous Australia. 


Just how out of touch can this government get? The retail trade industry is the second-largest employment category in Australia. It employs 1.2 million people, or one in nine Australians, and 52 per cent of those workers have no post-school qualification. When it comes to my electorate of Lindsay, that equates to over 12,000 people. It is the second-highest employer in my community. The penalty rate cuts are just another milestone in this government's cruel attempts to hurt workers. Labor will never support undermining workers' rights and avoiding workers' entitlements. In fact, we will do the opposite. We will always stand up and fight for them. People need penalty rates to make ends meet. For many people every cent counts, but, if you've never been affected by it, that might be hard to understand. The government has effectively delivered a $77-a-week pay cut to all of those people. For the government, this has been a business decision, but, for the people in my electorate, this is personal. Worker entitlement funds provide for employee long service leave, sick leave and redundancy payments. They provide important services for workers, such as counselling, which we as members of this House also have access to; training; and safe workplaces. All people want is what is fair. 


What is even more worrying is that women will bear the brunt of these devastating cuts. We often hear Malcolm Turnbull, the Prime Minister, refer to his lovely wife, Lucy, in terms of 'women hold up half the sky'. I would just like that 'half' to include equal pay for women in this country, not the absolutely shocking wage gap that exists now and the even greater gap that this decision makes. Women are most likely to be working on weekends and covering public holiday shifts. This is not through choice. It is not like they put their hand up and say, 'I'm happy to go to work on a Sunday, miss my kid's birthday, miss the family lunch, miss the family picnic, miss the opportunity to catch up with my kids who are at school during the week.' They do those shifts on the weekend because their families and their lives dictate that it is the only time when they can have the help and support that they need for their children, because, as we all know, child care is out of the reach of many people in this country. Cutting the pay of workers in industries such as retail and hospitality is the worst thing this government can do to worsen the gender pay gap. We know that, when local workers have less money in their pockets to spend, it actually hurts the local economies as well. 


When I was at university I had four part-time jobs, two of which paid me penalty rates. I was the first of my generation in my family to go to university. I relied on every single cent from those four part-time jobs—which were all insecure, casual work—to run my car, pay my bills, pay my rent and buy my textbooks. Many people do more than four jobs; many people do more than one job. Without those penalty rates and those extra payments for those unsociable hours that I had to work just to get by, I wouldn't have been able to achieve what I did. From my story, I think it is absolutely important and vital to protect and stand up for people who are relying on those penalty rates every single day. 


This government cannot deliver. The proof of the pudding is in the eating—their track record on the NBN; the issues with the Yarra III that we had; the citizenship debacle that we're now waiting on the results of; the robo-debt with Centrelink; the Bureau of Statistics bungle last year in trying to get our census together, which I had almost forgotten to mention; the energy crisis that we've had no movement on for five years; and their failing to do anything at all about alleviating the cost of housing and the unaffordability for so many Australians. Now they're cutting penalty rates. They've just wasted $122 million on a postal poll on equality and people's rights. If this were a report card, this government would be getting a F for fat failure.


Yet now, again, they are coming after the lowest-paid workers. The Turnbull government has no idea about how hard things are for people. From Point Piper over to Penrith is a big distance. I know the Prime Minister knows how to get there during an election campaign by train, but I haven't seen him since. I haven't seen him turn up on the doorsteps of those workers who he seeks to cut money from to say how much he supports and loves Western Sydney, which is a shame. Point Piper is not actually that far in distance, although some people do think they need their passport to come out to visit us, but it is a world away from the different standards of living that those people he represents enjoy compared with the people that I represent. 


All this government is focused on is looking after the rich end of town and trusting that it will trickle down. Well, it doesn't. It absolutely doesn't. Trickle-down economics has been myth-busted and fact-checked, and all the experts and economists around the world have said, 'This does not work.' So why are we in here with a government so obsessed with trickle-down economics? We know that more must be done to reduce the gender pay gap, to make industrial relations more user friendly for small businesses, to make the Fair Work Commission easier to access, to create jobs pathways for people with disabilities or people who are marginalised, to tackle discrimination against older workers so they stay in the work force, and to help younger people.

Ms HUSAR:
  Cutting the pay of workers in any industry is the worst thing this government could do to the gender pay gap. The government cannot deliver, and so much proof is already in the pudding—their track record on the NBN, the citizenship debacle, robo-debt, and the energy crisis they are failing to do anything about after five years in power. They are also failing to do anything about housing affordability. And there was the recent $122 million waste of taxpayers' money on a survey. If the government had a report card, they would fail. Now we are seeing them come after the lowest paid workers.


We need to be doing more to help younger people enter work in the first place. We need to be doing more to reduce the gender pay gap. We need to be doing more to make industrial relations more user-friendly for small business and make the Fair Work Commission much easier to access. We need to create jobs pathways for people with a disability and those people who might be marginalised, and we need to tackle discrimination of older workers so they stay in the workforce for much longer and continue their contributions. We need to create a future for work, not continue to cut away at workers' rights.


This government isn't focused on helping workers at all. They are too busy saving their own jobs. We saw that at the last election, with the Prime Minister pouring in millions of his own money to protect his own job. The government are desperately trying to distract the public from the fact they have no agenda to address wage stagnation, underemployment, rising inequality or anything else, for that matter. They are failing the average Australian every single day they come into this place. The government are not meeting the challenges of low wages growth, rising inequality and job insecurity.


It is completely unsurprising, then, that, under this government, wages are falling in real terms while cost-of-living pressures are rising and workers are struggling to make ends meet. In my own electorate of Lindsay, we have a three per cent higher cost of living than those people Malcolm Turnbull, the Prime Minister of this country, represents in his electorate of Wentworth. According to the latest data, wages growth in enterprise agreements approved in the quarter fell to 2.6 per cent from 2.7 per cent, a 26-year low. This government has refused to stand up for working people time and time again, despite the many opportunities it's been given. It could not be bothered to lift a finger to assist our lowest paid workers.


Over the last 10 years, real labour productivity grew by 20 per cent and real wages growth grew only six per cent. Wages share of GDP is well below the average of the last 50 years. This country deserves better than a government which puts corporate profits above people's wellbeing. They are arrogant and out of touch. They would rather hand tax cuts to big business than stand up for working people and their hard-won and well-earned pay and conditions. We are very, very concerned that the Turnbull government are incapable, unable and unwilling to address consistently flat wages growth. In fact, they are making things worse by cutting the penalty rates of Australia's lowest paid workers. My constituents are concerned because penalty rates make a real difference to how they live. They ensure that those families who earn them can afford the extra things they pay for out of those penalty rates. They now face pay cuts as a result of this government. They were worried about how they were going to afford fuel to get to work. This means cutting back on their already tight spending habits. I know how tough some working people in my community in my electorate of Lindsay have had it. They've had a gutful of this government's bad decisions.

"Conroy, Pat, MP",ALP,2017-10-25,"



Mr CONROY
 (Shortland) (12:03):  I rise to oppose the Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017 because this is fundamentally an attack on working people in this country. It is an attack on working people's ability to bargain for improved conditions. This represents the latest round of this government's misguided ideological crusade against the union movement. This is a government that has been relentless in its campaign against the union movement and working-class people from day one, while giving out huge tax cuts to the top end of town and refusing to go after the big banks.


The tragedy of this unfair and misguided approach is that the real cost of it is inflicted on working people. This proposal to axe entitlement funds typifies this by aiming to cut essential services such as suicide prevention, OH&S and training schemes simply because they are provided for and protected by unions. These entitlement funds are bargained for by companies and workers in good faith, and they both make sacrifices to fund them. Whether they be suicide prevention programs, training schemes or safety officers, these are crucial aspects of providing safe workplaces and they are under attack in this misguided bill. These funds not only protect those who need it most but boost productivity by improving workplace conditions and worker satisfaction. To cut these programs based on an ideological vendetta with no evidence is callous and ill thought through.


It is no wonder this government do not understand how these changes will affect average Australian workers, because they have consistently ignored opportunities for inquiry and consultation. As has become an all too familiar trademark of legislation under this government, we have seen an unwillingness to consult widely and openly in an attempt to rush this bill through parliament before anyone can pull them up on it. Labor is meeting with these Australians, Labor is listening and the sentiment is crystal clear. This is a shoddy deal for workers and everyone knows it.


These entitlements are helping Australians across a number of industries, with programs that save lives and support families. For example, some of the most successful and well-known products of these entitlements funds are the MATES in Construction and MATES in Mining initiatives, funded by a trust set up by the CFMEU. These initiatives have seen thousands of people in these industries trained to assist in suicide prevention. This organisation, which is a product of good-faith bargaining between employers, trade unions and the workforce, raises awareness and runs programs that target the huge problems of suicide amongst workers in the construction and mining industries. These industries are very male dominated. They are industries that have high workplace fatalities—and I will return to that in a minute. As I said, these industries are male dominated, and blokes typically don't talk about their mental health. That is just a characteristic of most men. So these programs, which train their fellow workers to raise these issues with them, are very, very effective. I recently met with key participants in the MATES in Mining program and they are gravely concerned about the future of this lifesaving program under this legislation. Research into MATES in Construction has found it to be one of the most successful programs of its kind and found that it recoups investment many times over in community benefit.


Other funds also protect workers from redundancy, both financially and through training and professional development, and secure entitlements such as long service leave for ordinary Australians. Why the government would want to attack the providers of such vital services is beyond me. Coupled with the concessions to big banks, multinational corporations and the highest-income earners in Australia, it just reflects how out of touch this government is with the majority of Australians. 


Safety is of paramount importance on our work sites. Every Australian and every worker in the world has a fundamental human right to go to work and return safely each day. In the construction industry, almost one worker a week dies on the job. In the mining industry, in the northern coalfields of New South Wales—the Hunter region, which I proudly represent—1,803 miners have lost their lives since coalmining began in 1803. Over the last nine years we have averaged one death a year. This is a disgraceful statistic, and this bill weakens efforts to stop these statistics. This bill weakens the ability to bargain for safety officers on workplaces. This bill undermines the safety of those work sites. This bill hurts safety and impinges on the human rights of Australians to go to work and come back safely. 


I know this will be seen as potentially going over the top, but this bill represents an attack on safety in our work sites. Ultimately, the government have to be held responsible for this. The government have blood on their hands. The government have blood on their hands because they are undermining safety in workplaces right now. Members opposite can roll their eyes and can interject all they want, but look at the facts: every bill that impinges on the ability to employ safety officers, every bill that undermines the ability of workers to preserve safety in their workplaces and every bill that impinges on the right of unions to enter workplaces on safety complaints endangers safety in these industries. I proudly state, and I state accurately, that this government has blood on its hands when it undertakes such actions. So I am proudly opposed to this bill, because it hurts safety, like so many other bills this government puts forward. 


A second part of their blind persecution of the union movement is their attack on wages in this country. We have international organisations such as the IMF and OECD citing declining union density and collective bargaining as major factors in the stagnation of wages and the growth of inequality around the world. In Australia, this is being experienced right now. The latest data on EBA pay rises found that in the last quarter EBA pay rises rose by 2.6 per cent, the lowest on record since the EBA system was put in place. We have flat or declining real wages, we have workers who are struggling to meet the costs of living because their wages are going backwards, and we have insidious actions by companies, such as the widespread attack on enterprise agreements, assisted by terminating agreements willy-nilly. It is no wonder workers are finding it difficult to bargain for wage rises, if there is a very real danger their EBA will be terminated and they will suffer a 40 per cent pay cut. We are seeing a systematic attack on wages and conditions in this country through a concerted push to de-unionise, and this bill is the latest example of that.


Another example of this is penalty rates. We have seen this government's cheer squad cheering on and refusing to do anything to stop the cuts to penalty rates that have now been put in place. Cuts to penalty rates have hit hundreds of thousands of the lowest paid workers in this country. It is the worst example of trickle-down economics—an example that was totally discredited in the Great Depression—where if you cut wages you suddenly boost economic activity and, somehow, businesses will employ thousands more Australians. This theory, based on Say's law, was discredited in the 1930s, where we saw a 25 per cent across-the-board cut in workers' wages and it didn't improve employment and put Australians back in work. It actually led to more unemployment because it reduced aggregate demand dramatically. When penalty rates for workers are cut, it means they have less money to spend in shops in Australia. The lowest paid Australians have the greatest propensity to consume and the least ability to save, and are living from pay cheque to pay cheque, so they spend basically every dollar they earn. If you attack them by cutting their wages, you are attacking consumption directly, and this is what the cut to penalty rates has done. So, not only is it hurting those workers individually but it is actually hurting our economy by suppressing aggregate demand in the economy and, thereby, employment.


We have also heard the government say that it only affects hospitality and retail workers and doesn't affect anyone else. Well, that's the thin end of the wedge. It will lead, no doubt, to attacking workers in other sectors of the economy.


My electorate is home to a significant hospital, Belmont Hospital. We are right on the border with the John Hunter Hospital, which is the largest hospital between Sydney and Brisbane. It is the third-largest in the state and is the only tertiary-level hospital between Sydney and Brisbane. If you get seriously sick north of the Hawkesbury River, that's where you are sent. Without penalty rates, John Hunter Hospital, and Belmont Hospital in fact, will close at five o'clock on a Friday night and won't open until 9 am on a Monday. Penalty rates are the only reason those hospitals stay open, because it is the only compensation for the nurses and support staff who keep the hospitals running. An attack on penalty rates for hospitality workers will no doubt lead to a subsequent attack on penalty rates for nurses and for support staff such as orderlies, thereby imperilling our health system.


This bill is another attack on the wages and conditions of Australians. It's all about weakening the union movement. This government's raison d'etre is to destroy the labour movement. They figure that if they can destroy the labour movement they can destroy the Labor Party as an effective opposition in this country. This playbook is classic John Howard. He tried it in 1998. He thought that if he could destroy the MUA, one of the most militant, democratic and progressive unions in this country, the rest of the union movement would follow. We saw the lockout by Patrick and a government conspiring to sack a workforce. They conspired to unfairly dismiss an entire workforce to break the MUA—and they failed. They failed not just because of the union movement but because the broad swathe of the Australian community said, 'No, we support progressive causes, we support trade unions in this country and we will take part in community pickets to protect the MUA and its members.' We've seen them attack the MUA and we are seeing the current attacks on the CFMEU that are contained in this bill. You just have to listen to question time every day to hear these attacks. I dare those people who are leading these attacks to go to the memorial day for miners in Cessnock each year—which commemorates the 1,803 miners who have lost their lives in the northern minefields—and look those families in the eye and say, 'I'm improving the safety of your workplaces by attacking the CFMEU.' I can assure you, without the mine workers federation, safety in those coalmines would be a lot weaker. 


I can say without fear of contradiction that, if you deunionise the construction sector, you won't see improved safety; you will see fatalities rise. Almost one worker each week in the construction sector dies. So this is not just an attack on the labour movement; it is an attack on the wages and conditions of Australian workers and an attack on the safety of Australian workers. It represents an ideological crusade that takes no prisoners. It is an ideological crusade to deunionise this country, to weaken the labour movement and thereby weaken the Labor Party, and to maximise profits for some of their corporate mates. 


Quite frankly, most employers don't want this. Most employers are genuine, decent people who just want to employ Australians, make a profit and support their family. Most of the employers I talk to want a level playing field. They want fair industrial relations, which means they're not competing with the workplace down the road on wages; they're competing on innovation and productivity. Anything like this that invites more shonks into the business, anything that makes it easier for shonks to set up and rip off their workers by not paying long service leave into portable funds, and anything that allows more repeats of the 7-Eleven fiasco hurts legitimate, caring, responsible employers who aren't it in for the quick buck for six months but are in it for decades. 


So, like all my Labor colleagues, I am proud to reject this legislation, because we've also charted the middle course. We've always condemned inappropriate behaviour on worksites, whether it's by employers or unions, and that's why the question time behaviour by various ministers is farcical, because we're not out there defending criminal behaviour; we're saying everyone should respect the rule of law in workplaces, but the rule of law has to be fair. It has to not tilt the playing field towards one particular group. It has to allow Australians to bargain collectively to have their rights at work respected, to bargain collectively for decent pay rises to support their families and to bargain collectively to improve the safety of their workplaces so that they preserve the ultimate human right, which is to return home safely from work each day. I proudly condemn this legislation as another egregious attack on working people in this country and, like all my Labor colleagues, I stand opposed to it.

Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (12:17):  The Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017 once again demonstrates a bitter irony when it comes to this government's approach to changes in the world of work. We know, as Australian workers know and as their representative organisations—unions and the ACTU—know, that it's time to change the rules which govern power at work. But the government is determined to change the rules to reinforce inequality and inequity, not to address it. At the core of Labor's agenda is confidence in Australians, confidence in Australians' capacity to do more, particularly at work. This government is bereft of that confidence and is further determined to constrain the capacity of Australians in the workplace and around the workplace when it comes to skills, when it comes to schools and when it comes to university. 


What this bill demonstrates is that, once again, this government is prepared to put forward its ideological obsession with constraining the rights of individual workers, and in particular the rights of unions to represent workers in workplaces, in defiance of the evidence. On this side, we understand—as international bodies like the IMF and the OECD have made very, very clear—that increasing inequality is a constraint on economic growth. It hurts all of us as well as individual workers, and this bill is just another demonstration of this preference, this determination on the part of the government, to continue to tilt the playing field in workplaces in favour of employers and against working people and their representatives. 


So I am very pleased to join my Labor colleagues, and, in particular, the shadow minister, in opposing this legislation and supporting the amendment which deals with a small but very significant aspect of this debate. At the moment, we understand that wages growth continues to be at a record low and the wage share of the economy continues to be in consistent decline. I think this is the problem, and I think we should all take stock of a couple of facts that characterise the Australian economy today. We all congratulate ourselves on 26 years of consecutive economic growth, and that is a significant achievement, but focusing simply on this ignores some deep realities that shape the lives of too many Australians. At the moment, we have record company profits at a time of record low wage growth. This is a gap that we, as lawmakers, should be trying to close, but the government is determined to exacerbate that gap. We see it most obviously in the insane giveaway of an increased push for more corporate tax cuts, and we see it in the continued insistence on further seeking to diminish the rights of workers in their workplaces to bargain.


Today we find that growth is at a 26-year low, the same time span as that period of continuous economic growth for the economy as a whole. That demonstrates, again, why we need to change the rules in the opposite direction from that which is contended by this government and exemplified by this legislation. Wages, real wages, for too many Australians are simply going backwards. Of course, this is wage growth in the formal economy. It doesn't account for those Australians pushed into informal and even more insecure forms of work. Living standards for these people aren't simply under pressure; they are being squeezed. And that's why it's more than a little bit rich to hear the government talk about cost-of-living savings when they talk about their National Energy Guarantee—or national energy aspiration, as it probably should be called—because the big issue with the living costs of Australian working people and working families is this anaemic wages growth. The cost of living isn't just what you have to pay for things; it's the money you have at bank to be able to pay for things, and it is extraordinary that the government continues to ignore this pretty fundamental fact. We need to change the rules to give workers and their representatives more power in workplaces, not less. 


I mentioned briefly the amendment on penalty rates. The government's consistent attack on penalty rates is simply abhorrent, and it doesn't reflect the choices that are being forced on too many working Australians: to work antisocial hours and to discount their life to maintain their income. A pretty fundamental proposition that Australian governments of all sides of politics have accepted is that penalty rates are fair compensation for a drag away from time with family and time with friends—the ability to engage in social life and cultural amenity. This government talks blithely, through the Prime Minister, about a 24-hour economy, but has no regard for those forced to pay the price, because there isn't a 24-hour society, is there? People's capacity to engage with family and friends is constrained by working patterns that don't reflect the Prime Minister's confident view of how the economy should work. 


In supporting the amendment of the shadow minister, the member for Gorton, I want to make very clear that I'm standing in solidarity with 700,000 Australians who are having their penalty rates cut, having their standard of living cut and having their sense of dignity and sense of agency cut. But I also stand in solidarity with those many, many more Australians who aren't directly affected by the current decision, but whose penalty rates are affected. I know that many nurses, in particular, and other shift workers in my electorate are deeply concerned by the signal that has been sent by an unfortunate decision of the commission and an abhorrent refusal of the government to remedy it. I guess the crux of the problem is this: we have a government that talks about the cost-of-living issues in energy and flicks the problem off to the states, whilst claiming to have fixed the issue, but, in an area of direct legislative competence of the Commonwealth parliament, it does nothing—or, in this case, it does less than nothing. 


I think it is worth touching on some particular features of the bill that is before us now. This bill is a product of the Heydon royal commission—although, as is always the case with this government's law-making, it is important to be careful and test the claims. The claim here about it being a response to the royal commission is one that I think will be found wanting and, I suspect, is one of the reasons for the appalling failure of process which governs the introduction of this piece of legislation. The bill before us deals with matters that are quite technical—matters that actually do require this government, if it were serious, to attend to a problem. Perhaps we can come back and ask what problem this legislation is intended to solve. Unfortunately, we don't seem to be assisted by government member contributions to this debate, which is of itself rather telling. This bill would make very significant technical changes to entitlement funds, which play a very significant role in many industries. These are issues which, if there were matters to be addressed, should be properly ventilated through a Senate inquiry process. Instead, here we are in the Federation Chamber debating a bill—or perhaps not debating a bill but putting on the record—



Ms Bird interjecting—




Mr GILES:
  Yes, as the member for Cunningham says, there isn't a debate here. It is disappointing that, once again, government members aren't here to show the courage of their convictions, are they? So we are putting on the record our concerns about this bill, and we do so at two levels. When we look at the government's broad attitude, there is its failure to respond to fundamental changes in the world of work which are disadvantaging workers, at a time when corporate profits are at a record high and at a time when the Treasurer adds insult to injury by mouthing words like 'inclusive growth'. If you want inclusive growth, how about looking to workers? How about looking at recasting the distribution of the national pie? How about paying some attention to those levers available to the federal government which can redress the imbalance of power and which are not only constraining the ability of individuals to earn an income but also constraining our wider prospects of economic growth and, with it, doing untold damage to communities and to our society?


This bill imposes a range of additional restrictions on the governance of entitlement funds and imposes further restrictions on bargaining, which is precisely the opposite of the approach that we should be undertaking. I hope that members opposite, if they're not going to participate in this debate, would have regard to the contribution of the member for Gorton at the National Press Club a couple of weeks ago, where he looked squarely at the questions that confront Australian workplaces and the Australian economy and set out some proposals that would address the problems. The member for Gorton was very frank in doing so, because he conceded that in our last period in government, in responding to the aggressive, antiworker, anti-union, anti-democratic Right agenda of the Howard government, we didn't pay sufficient regard to the changing nature of work in Australia—in particular, how a model of bargaining which initially served all Australians pretty well in the 1990s was losing pace with the demands of the modern economy, particularly the changes in the structure of work. The member for Gorton accepted that. He pointed to some examples, and some of those were around termination of agreements—in particular, at Murdoch University. There we have an attack on working people that not only is the government simply ignoring but the Minister for Education is encouraging other employers in the sector to follow. It's pretty clear that that is no way to deal with slow wage growth—quite the reverse. It's going to further depress wage growth, to no-one's benefit. 


So here we have a bill that is all about imposing further prescriptions, a series of red-tape obligations, on important bodies. Again I recall at the start of the last parliament the great excitement that government members put on about their red-tape reduction exercise. Well, it's interesting: when it comes to their other ideological hobbyhorses, too much red tape is barely enough. Every week we get an amendment to the Migration Act and every week we get an amendment to the Fair Work Act. Those amendments are really all about doing one thing, which is constraining workers' ability to collectively exercise their rights and secure themselves decent outcomes.


I was really pleased to be in the chamber for the contribution of my friend the member for Shortland. He dealt with a critical aspect of this debate that is too often ignored in the wider commentary, and that is the impact of these imbalances of power that are being codified in legislation on workers' safety. I would have thought it a pretty unexceptional statement, for anyone who's concerned for their fellow Australians, to set out the proposition that anyone who goes to work is entitled to return home safely. It is simply appalling that this government is determined to strip away the capacity of workers to attend to that on their own behalf and on behalf of their colleagues and comrades in workplaces.


But no, this legislation is simply a reheat of tired ideological obsessions. They've found another device whereby unions have been able to offer some protection to workers in difficult times and have done the right thing to redress particular imbalances of power. But, again, the response isn't to recognise this or to look at how it might have broader application to deal with this fundamental problem that's characterising the Australian workforce and the Australian economy at the moment. It's simply to carry on down this blinkered ideological path of further constraining workers' rights and doing everything they can to deny unions their legitimate, democratic capacity to carry on their roles on behalf of their members.


Coming to the end of my contribution, I want to again raise this fundamental point: what is the problem that this bill is responding to? I thought members opposite were interested in leaving things alone from government, but instead they seem to simply want to interfere. We on this side of the House know that the time has more than passed to address some of these imbalances of power in the labour market. We do need to change the rules, but we need to change the rules to do the right thing by workers, to strengthen the capacity of unions democratically to work for them—not the reverse.

Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (12:32):  Time after time I find myself frustrated, bemused and quite often angry about the range of legislation that comes before this chamber when those opposite are in government. I spent my first term at the end of the Howard era among the infamous industrial relations changes around Work Choices. Quite rightly, there was not only a union driven campaign but also a community supported campaign rejecting that dog-eat-dog view of how industrial relations should be managed and regulated in this country. But we now see, under both the Abbott and Turnbull prime ministerships, continuing, ongoing—time and time again—pieces of legislation that, at their heart, are about one thing, and that is destroying the capacity of workers to unite through a formalised union in order to raise issues in a workplace where they don't have the balance of power.


At the heart of it is what sits at the heart of the Liberal and Nationals parties: a belief that only those who can break through that dog-eat-dog world and make good for themselves are deserving of decent pay conditions and a decent lifestyle and that if somehow you can't do it on your own then that's a reflection of you individually, rather than having an understanding of the way our society is structured. It often means that power is enormously twisted to one side of the equation. We have known for generations that those who own the workplaces, those who are putting the money into those workplaces, have an enormously stronger capacity for power than the workers who work in those workplaces.


It's a very simple function of a decent society that those workers are able to organise, to elect union representatives to represent them and to work in a concerted, united manner not only to improve their pay and conditions but on issues such as health and safety. We supposedly don't have a conservative party in the Liberal Party. They're supposed to be a 'liberal' party. They're not supposed to be out there on the far-right-wing fringes of the political spectrum. But on some of these issues—to be honest, on so many issues in general in recent times—they're taking themselves off to that far-right wing.


Like many of my colleagues, I meet regularly with my local unions. I meet regularly with the South Coast Labor Council. I also meet with my business chamber. I meet with other peak bodies around the electorate that represent a variety of views. I would be very surprised if any of those opposite had regular meetings with trade unions in their local area. I would never consider ignoring the views and issues of my local business chambers. I wouldn't even consider it. I wouldn't consider spending all my time in this place attacking their right to be peak groups representing the views of their memberships. Yet so often those opposite do exactly that with the trade union movement. Of course we'll have policy differences. We are born out of the trade union movement; we were born out of the fact that trade unions realised they had to have a political voice as well as an industrial voice. Those opposite, according to how often they say, 'Put your hand up if you've been in business,' have obviously been born out of the view that the business and investment sectors need a voice in parliament too. That's fine. But if those opposite want to be effective they should make sure they're engaging with and respecting the role of all those institutions in our society.


We are seeing growing inequality. We are seeing stagnant wages. We are seeing greater exploitation in the workplace. We are seeing an increasing number of deaths in workplaces. There are real challenges for us in what's going on in our economy and in the workplaces of Australia. If we were serious about creating a society that shared wealth fairly, that understood that the people not getting their fair share weren't just workers but also consumers—and that's what our great social experiment in Australia for over 100 years has been about; we've built up a middle class who have gained the capacity to be effective consumers because they've had good pay and conditions and safe workplaces, and these things complement each other—we would be addressing these issues. We would be looking at why these things are going astray in our current environment. But, no, we're back here with another bill that's about micromanaging the unions, about trying to put handcuffs not only on their capacity to represent, advocate and negotiate and be political but even, in this case, on their capacity to work cooperatively with employers on the sorts of things one would think they both had a common interest in. Employers obviously think they've got a common interest in these areas, because they've often jointly funded, with the unions, things like counselling, preventing suicide in workplaces, and the health and wellbeing of workers. I'm absolutely bemused by the ideology of those opposite—that they could go to this level of attack on unions simply to handcuff their capacity to work effectively on behalf of working people, and, in this case, as I said, in a type of activity that unions undertake in partnership with employers because both see the value in these sorts of programs.


In the Minister for Employment's press release on this bill, what did she say? She said:


Through cosy deals with big businesses, unions have become a big business in their own right, more focussed on making profits than representing people.


If I ever believed she was the least bit interested in unions' capacity to represent people, I might have some sympathy for what she was trying to say. She doesn't. She never does. She has no respect for the trade union movement's capacity to represent people. It is a constant ongoing attack. I can't even imagine what those opposite would be doing. They certainly wouldn't be completely absent from the debating list, as is the case with this debate. Other than the minister's speech, I think there have been hardly any contributions from those opposite.


But I can imagine what would be happening in this place if we were in government and introducing bill after bill like this but trying to hobble the capacity of peak employer organisations to prosecute a case, run campaigns, implement programs and raise funding in order to progress the wellbeing of their members. Forget calling us socialists—they'd be calling us communists and dictators. That's the sort of reality we'd be facing if we tried this sort of stunt on people who form organisations and peak bodies in order to advocate and represent employers, whether they're big business, like the Business Council of Australia; particular industry sectors, like the Australian Industry Group; or small businesses, like COSBOA. If we were trying this sort of stunt and treating those organisations with the arrogance and disrespect that this government shows to the trade union movement, there would be a riot on the other side of this place. I personally am sick and tired of the double standards that this government has about the capacity of people in our civil society to form membership based organisations and advocate on their own behalf. They would not tolerate it if we did that sort of thing, nor will we tolerate it when they decide they're going to do it to trade unions. 


The other problem I have with this bill before us, as is too often the case, is that it appeared last Thursday on the list. It's an extensive piece of legislation—five schedules going to 80 pages. It will amend five different pieces of legislation. One would think that something this significant should be given the respect of a proper and considered debate in this place. It has very significant implications, as I've outlined, not only for unions but, as I indicated, also for employer groups. You would think they would want to be able to have some say and some input into this process.


I actually think that the sort of work that this bill attacks is some of the best stuff that I've seen in workplaces. I've spent time with things like MATES in Construction—a fantastic organisation that works with unions and employers around suicide prevention. Some of the best things that happen in our workplaces are the things that employers and unions do together, because often they're going to the heart of very challenging social issues, things we're facing as a society, that are coming into workplaces and really seriously need addressing. That's often when employers and unions come together and say, 'We have a common interest in this so let's jointly fund, organise and run these sorts of programs.'


It is true, sadly, that mental health challenges are a serious matter for workplaces now. I remember talking to a peak body of hairdressers when we were in government and I had responsibility for skills. The one big issue hairdressers wanted to talk to me about was mental health—young apprentices coming in with complex anxiety and depression issues. This is not a one-off. It's a really common challenge for this generation. As employers they were not just worried about that as a productivity issue, about how it was impacting on the work in their workplace and about that young person's capacity to finish their apprenticeship but also, like the vast majority of employers, deeply concerned about these young people and wanted to know what they could do as an employer to help in those circumstances. 


This is the reality of workplaces in the modern world. These sorts of programs should be supported. Employers who engage in them should be lauded for doing that; unions that engage in them should be lauded for doing that. It is astonishing to me that the government is so hidebound in its hatred of unions that it can adopt the sorts of measures that we see before us in this bill, and do so in a rushed and hurried manner without proper consideration. I'm very disappointed that the Nick Xenophon Team didn't support our proposal to have a Senate committee inquiry, because I think these really important issues should be teased out and considered. 


In the couple minutes I've got left to speak, I want to touch on some of the matters that are playing out in my local area that, if the government were really interested in workplaces, they could be spending a lot more time on. I want to touch firstly on the issue of penalty rates. It has been a big issue in my electorate. I recently surveyed my electorate on issues of importance to them and had a very strong response back on the issue of penalty rates. While the vast majority of people who responded to my survey didn't actually work in an environment where they received penalty rates, 80 per cent of them supported people getting Sunday penalty rates. Even people who weren't getting these rates themselves saw fairness and justice in people who lose their Sundays being recompensed, getting that additional support, yet the government flat out refused to take any action to ensure that people continued to get decent pay—even though, apparently, they've now discovered there is a problem with pays and incomes and perhaps we should have higher pay rates. 


Finally, I want to give an example of why unions are so important at the local level. In my area, the South Coast Labour Council for quite a while has been running a campaign around the exploitation of young workers. A young woman from the University of Wollongong had put up a post on her Facebook about a very exploitative experience she'd had in the workplace and was just blown away by the massive number of young people who went on her Facebook and commented, having had very similar experiences—not being paid, being underpaid, being exploited in terms of their work conditions. It was quite shocking. The South Coast Labour Council became aware of this and then worked with these young people—Ashleigh Mounser was the young woman from the university—to start a campaign to raise awareness. It is true that some of the employers didn't intentionally get things wrong, but it was so unregulated and so unchecked that terrible exploitation went on. If the government wants to spend its time on something useful, I suggest it could spend it in this space.

Ms LAMB
 (Longman) (12:48):  This is getting quite ridiculous. It seems every second day I'm up on my feet in parliament speaking against a government attack on workers and on the trade union movement. It is bordering on ridiculous. But pathetic attacks like these are all that a pretty desperate government seems to have up its sleeves. They have no vision; they have no plan. It seems that this is what we're stuck with—attack after attack on workers or the trade union movement. There certainly is no action or policy that will help move Australia forward. If we don't hear, 'Blame Labor, it's Labor's fault', we hear, 'Let's blame the trade union movement, let's blame workers.' This blame game has to stop. It's a game the Liberals keep playing; it's getting quite tiring and it has to stop. I know I've had enough of it, and I think Australia's has had enough too. I think you'd be hard pressed to find an Australian who wouldn't rather have their government just stand up and govern. People are sick and tired of this. I think they want their government to stand up, take a little bit of responsibility and show a little bit of integrity. That would go a long way. But, with this government, even that appears to be too much to ask. 


Despite having led the country for some years—five years is not a short amount of time—the mess they've created seems to be somebody else's fault. Apparently even the failed NBN, their failed NBN, is Labor's fault. Can you believe that? The second-rate copper NBN, which the coalition fought tooth and nail to implement over our superior policy, is somehow Labor's fault! It's outrageous. They are fooling nobody, but this is what they continue to parrot about.


How about this week in the Federation Chamber? I'm glad the member for Boothby is here. She attempted to lay the blame for the collapse of the Australian automotive industry on the trade union movement. Here was a government member again blaming the trade union movement for something. It was truly, truly ridiculous. What a blatant attempt by the member for Boothby to distance herself from the failings of her government. It's pretty common knowledge right across Australia that the collapse of the Australian automotive industry can be directly linked to the actions of the Liberal government. In true Liberal fashion, rather than showing some integrity, she sought to blame—guess who?—the unions. She sought to blame the unions, the very people who fought against the Abbott government's foolish mismanagement of the manufacturing industry, the very people who fought to keep this industry alive and who fight to keep many industries alive. They are the very people who fought for and won annual leave, sick leave, long service leave, pensions, Medicare, superannuation—where shall I stop? I say to the member for Boothby and to the government: I'm sure the trade union movement would welcome and accept a letter of thanks for all of those things that I'm sure the member for Boothby and other government members have enjoyed themselves and which their constituents as workers of this country enjoy every single day. I'm sure they'll look forward to that letter.


But, instead, we've got a government in crisis mode, a government that are going down and that will stop at nothing to drag everyone down with them. The government's actions are so desperate. The government are demonstrating an inappropriate use of taxpayers' money. But it's clear to see why they're doing it, of course. They're doing it in an absolutely pathetic attempt to shift the blame from their misdoings and at the same time malign the unions who stand up to them when they attack workers. With a government so determined to undermine the rights that Australians—their constituents and my constituents—have worked so hard for, it seems that unions have to stand up to them pretty regularly.


It really comes as no surprise that we're here again today—as I said, this is bordering on ridiculous—debating yet another bill that this government has introduced in yet another desperate attempt to undermine workers in the trade union movement. This bill, the Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017, is not just an attack on unions; it is an attack on every worker in this country. This bill has very significant implications for anyone who benefits from their entitlements being protected through a worker entitlement fund and anyone who benefits from the counselling, training, OH&S and other support services that those funds invest in. A worker entitlement fund is a fund which is for the purpose of paying out worker entitlements and death benefits, like leave payments, payments in lieu of leave, payments in relation to termination of employment—any payments that contracts, awards or agreements provide for an employer to make to an employee. This bill puts additional requirements on those funds.


From a party that once claimed it wanted to cut red tape and government intervention, this looks a lot like a government intervening and actually adding red tape. That's what it looks like to me. The coalition really doesn't care about any of the outcomes of this bill except that it wants to be an inconvenience to unions. That's why it's so foolhardily rushing this bill through. Why else would it so carelessly deny proper scrutiny, proper discussion and transparency with stakeholders before introducing this into parliament?


When you think about this rushing the bill through, it's pretty clear that—with the support of their ever-faithful crossbench comrades, Senator Xenophon and his team—the Liberals have denied calls to conduct a thorough Senate employment committee inquiry into this legislation. Instead of carefully considering the implications of this bill and what effects it would have on workers, what effects it would have on business and what effects it would have on the Commonwealth; instead of looking at this through a really clear lens and actually scrutinising it, they have imposed a reporting date of 10 November 2017. That's just over two weeks away. There are 80 pages to scrutinise and we've been given two weeks.


In typical Liberal fashion, they are blinded by union-hating rage. It's typical. 'Cover your ears and put your blinkers on.' That's what we have come to expect from this government. How can stakeholders and any affected business or employer groups properly prepare a submission and evidence with a deadline of just two weeks? Eighty pages in two weeks? How can you properly do that? The simple answer is you just can't. You can't possibly do that. But that's exactly what this government wants, isn't it? They don't want the opportunity for this to happen properly. They don't want any interjections and they don't want anyone disparaging their plans, whether that's justified or not. It appears that this government just don't like being told what is wrong and they just don't like being held to account. 


Accountability and transparency are the hallmarks of good governance. They are the foundations of a respectable parliament. But it appears to me, again, that the Turnbull government wants none of that. It appears—it is very evident, actually—that the government's intention with this bill is to undermine and erode the rights of all of Australia's workforce. This is a government for the top end of town, not for ordinary Australians like those who live in my electorate of Longman and who will be affected by this bill. This government is not for the ordinary people of Longman, who have been attacked time after time after time by reckless legislation that only benefits those who actually don't need it. I'd love to hear any member of this government try to explain to the vulnerable people of low-income Australia just what they're doing to help them in any way, shape or form. I'd love to hear it, but I suspect it would be a pretty short list. 



An honourable member interjecting—




Ms LAMB:
  Yes, a 50-cent list—if that. In comparison, Labor's list is pretty long. Labor's list is comprehensive. It's fleshed out and has been fleshed out for a long time. This government has been in power for four years and is now in its fifth year, and it still hasn't formulated any strong policies that will benefit all of Australia. You will remember that Labor went to the last election with 100 positive policies. We showed Australia that we weren't just here to fight in parliament. We showed Australia we were listening to ordinary people all around Australia, to Australians from all walks of life, because everyone deserves a say. We heard from people—and we continue to—and we formulated strong policies that we took to the election. Since then, we've continued to build upon them. We know what Australian people want, and it's not what this government is offering. It's not huge cuts to the taxation rates of millionaires and it's not throwing billions of dollars at corporations or banks. It's policies that protect ordinary, everyday Australians. That is what Australian people want. It's policies that protect workers in Australia, the people who are the backbone of this nation. 


Australians are sick of the wars that the coalition keep waging on workers. They are sick of them. They know that they serve no benefit to the Commonwealth and they serve no benefit to the Australian people. Australians know that cuts to the take-home pay of ordinary Australians is a terrible idea. These are cuts to the take-home pay of people who work weekends and nights, people who work unfavourable hours, and give up time with their families. Australians know that you don't cut the take-home pay of those workers. You'll remember the member for Gilmore saying this was a gift to young people. A gift—to cut their take-home pay? She can keep that gift, that's for sure. She might have called it a gift; I reckon it's a lump of coal. We know that those opposite have a real affinity for black coal! But the people of Australia would rather have the money they so badly need and that they work really hard for. It is money that puts food on the table.


On the same note, and to pick up on another area, the Australian people also know that PaTH internship placements make absolutely zero sense. They see straight through that as well. They know that if a business wants to employ someone—you know what?—it goes ahead and employs them. If you've got a job vacant and you want to employ someone, go ahead and employ them. This government doesn't need to throw thousands of dollars at businesses just so they can get free labour. 


People know that tax cuts for big businesses are an absolutely terrible idea. The national debt is sitting in such a terrible position, thanks to this government's economic mismanagement. How could anyone in their right minds justify $65 billion worth of cuts to big business? What an absolutely ridiculous idea. The more I talk about it, the more I realise just how strongly this government have taken a side. They have turned their backs on workers and they're staring up at big business, and that just isn't right. It's not right. From this government, in bill after bill and motion after motion, there is never any reprieve. It's attack after attack on Australian workers and handout after handout to big business. I oppose this bill. It is, plain and simple, an attack on the services that unions provide to workers. Workers don't deserve this. They deserve more, and I will be standing up every single day opposing this bill.

Ms Sharkie
  asked the Minister for Health, in writing, on 14 September 2017:


In respect of the Modified Monash Model (MMM), a geographical classification system used to address the maldistribution of medical services across Australia: 


(1) Will the Minister advise if any locations have been identified for review of their classification under the model and, if so, whether any of these reviews resulted in a change to a classification?


(2) Are there are any plans for a review of practice classifications under the MMM and if so,


(a) when is such a review expected to occur, and 


(b) when would the results be released?


(3) Will he detail the process for a medical practice to appeal their classification under the MMM?


(4) Will he advise if the Rural Classification Technical Working Group (RCTWG) still assesses classifications under the MMM and if so, what is the most appropriate way for medical practices to contact the RCTWG?

Mr Hunt:
  The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:


(1) The Modified Monash Model (MMM) is based on research developed by Professor John Humphreys et al. in a paper entitled Who should receive recruitment and retention incentives? Improved targeting of rural doctors using medical workforce data1and was modified through stakeholder consultations including the Independent Review of Australian Government Health Workforce Programs – (Mason Review) 2 and the RCTWG.


Following the introduction of the MMM in 2015, the RCTWG was reconvened in February 2016 to consider whether the parameters and usage of the MMM were meeting the needs of rural communities. This included whether the current buffer zones around large cities accurately reflected the functional service areas of those cities. Consideration was also given to a number of towns where the MMM classification was disputed, including Tamborine Mountain, outside the Gold Coast Qld; Roebourne, north-east WA; Cloncurry, north Qld; Robertson, near Wollongong NSW; Two Wells, near Adelaide SA; Montville and Mapleton, near the Sunshine Coast Qld; Gumeracha, near Adelaide SA; Murwillumbah, near Gold Coast-Tweed Heads Qld.


As a result of discussions, the RCTWG supported the existing structure of the MMM. The discussion did lead to two towns in the Modified Monash category 6 (MM6), Cloncurry Qld and Roebourne WA, having incentive payments increased under the General Practice Rural Incentives Program to levels equivalent to Modified Monash category 7 in recognition of their individual difficulties in attracting doctors to the area. Note that both towns maintain their classification of MM6.


(2) (a-b) The MMM will be updated in 2018, after the Australian Bureau of Statistics update town boundaries and remoteness classifications to reflect changes in demographics as demonstrated through the 2016 Census. The updated MMM will be presented to the Distribution Working Group (DWG) for approval, at which time consideration will also be given to areas in which there is dispute about the current classification.


(3) It is not possible for a medical practice to appeal the location classification under the MMM. The MMM will continue to be based on objective data sources and well-defined parameters in order to determine appropriate classifications.


Programs making use of the MMM are able to establish their own processes to allow for discretion in consideration of factors other than an area's MMM classification as part of their eligibility requirements.


(4) The RCTWG held its last meeting in February 2016. The Australian Government has now established the DWG to address the maldistribution of the health workforce in Australia. One of the core responsibilities will be to consider mechanisms to encourage an equitable distribution of the health workforce. This includes the review and update of the MMM. The DWG has yet to specify the mechanism by which it will seek advice from the community.
