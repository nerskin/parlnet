Speaker of the House of Representatives


12 September 2018

",HoR,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,0,2
"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (09:48):  I seek leave to move the following motion:


That the House:


(1) notes:


(a) today’s media reports that the now Prime Minister abused the Tasmanian Treasurer in an expletive-laden tirade after being accused of short-changing Tasmania on the GST;


(b) this reported conduct is an insult to Tasmania and falls below the high standards expected of Ministers under the Prime Minister’s own Ministerial Standards;


(c) this is just the latest leak in an almost daily series of leaks from within this divided, unstable and illegitimate Government; and


(d) despite the Government being consumed by claims and counter-claims of bullying within its own ranks, the Prime Minister continued to deny that bullying has occurred; and


(2) condemns the Government for:


(a) fighting itself instead of focusing on the needs of Australians; and


(b) reducing the Government to what the Prime Minister has himself described as a Muppet Show.




Leave not granted.




Mr BOWEN:
  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for McMahon from moving the following motion immediately:


That the House:


(1) notes:


(a)   today's media reports that the now Prime Minister abused the Tasmanian Treasurer in an expletive-laden tirade after being accused of short-changing Tasmania on the GST;


(b)   this reported conduct is an insult to Tasmania and falls below the high standards expected of ministers under the Prime Minister's own ministerial standards;


(c)   this is just the latest leak in an almost daily series of leaks from within this divided, unstable and illegitimate government; and


(d)   despite the government being consumed by claims and counterclaims of bullying within its own ranks, the Prime Minister continues to deny that bullying has occurred; and


(2) condemns the government for:


(a)   fighting itself instead of focusing on the needs of Australians; and


(b)   reducing the government to what the Prime Minister has himself described as a muppet show.


Mr Speaker, we now know what the new Prime Minister really thinks of Tasmanians. We know what he thinks of the Treasurer of Tasmania, but we also know what he thinks of every single Tasmanian. He didn't tell the people of Braddon what he thought of them on his single solitary trip to Tasmania during the by-election campaign. He said nice things about Tasmanians there. But, when he was on the telephone to the Treasurer, in the privacy of his own office, he had a different form of words. 


I have a great deal of respect for the institution and the dignity of the parliament so I am not going to quote the Prime Minister directly—I'm sure you would agree with that decision—I will just say that the language was inappropriate and would be unfit to be mentioned in this House. But the Prime Minister thought it was fit to use that language to the Treasurer of Tasmania. 


We know why, perhaps, this new Prime Minister has been to Germany more times in his term than he has been to Tasmania. He really thinks that Tasmanians are mendicants, beggars. He thinks that the Tasmanians waiting at Hobart Hospital are beggars. He thinks that Tasmanians who dare to dream of going to the University of Tasmania are beggars. He thinks that those Tasmanians who want a good quality education for their children are beggars. That's what the now Prime Minister thinks of the people of Tasmania. That's what he thinks of the people of the state of Tasmania.


It also tells us about the state of the Morrison government. I hazard a guess: I don't think this leak came from the Apple Isle. I think this leak came from the Big Apple. I think the former Prime Minister has worked out that his loyal Treasurer was undermining him the whole time.  He has told us at the dispatch box—we've asked him, 'Why is Malcolm Turnbull no longer the Prime Minister of Australia?' His answer in effect is: 'Well, I don't know, because it wasn't me. I had nothing to do with it. I turned up at the Liberal Party room and the next thing I knew I was Prime Minister of Australia. It was all a big surprise.' His defence is: 'I walked in as the Treasurer; I walked out as Prime Minister and I'm still not quite sure how it happened.' He's got form, of course, because he did it before to Tony Abbott. We know how this bloke operates. But, more importantly, the Liberal Party knows how he operates. What it also means is that this will continue. He says the curtain has come down on the muppet show. Well, it is actually only opening night when it comes to the dysfunction of this government. They are riven with disunity. We are going to see these leaks continue—another day, another leak.


We should be focused as a parliament. But, while this government should be focused on the needs of Tasmanians, Western Australians, South Australians—goodness knows what he thinks of South Australia if that's what he thinks of Tasmanians—this government are focused on themselves. They are focused on one job and one job alone: trying to save the prime ministership of Australia.


Australians deserve better than this. Tasmanians deserve better than this. They deserve a government focused on low wages growth. They deserve a government focused on economic growth. They deserve a government focused on better funding for schools and hospitals. They deserve a government that is focused on more fairness in our taxation system. They deserve a government focused on the future, not on the past battles within the Liberal Party. They deserve a government which knows who should be the Prime Minister of Australia and that should be the member for Maribyrnong. They deserve a government that knows who should be in the cabinet of Australia and that should be the people chosen by the Labor Party caucus, because we have the vision for Australia and for Australians' needs. We're not interested in the factional fights of the Liberal Party. We're interested in the long-term, best interests of the Australian people. That's the sort of government Australia needs.


Nobody is suggesting that the challenges facing Australia are easy. I'm not suggesting that the matter of GST distribution is easy. I hazard to say that I understand better than most just what a complicated issue it is. There are legitimate concerns of the people of Tasmania and of the people of Western Australia. These concerns are legitimate. We in the Labor Party have taken the issue seriously. We've spent the time, talking in good faith to our Western Australian colleagues and to our Tasmanian colleagues, working on the issue and coming up with a concrete solution. We've been working with state governments, with the Treasurer of Western Australia, with the shadow Treasurer of Tasmania, and, indeed, with people across the political aisle to find the right solution, because it is a problem, because it is a challenge and because it should be fixed.


The people of Tasmania shouldn't pay the price, and nor should the people of Western Australia. The people of Western Australia have a legitimate concern, and the Labor Party has moved to fix it. My point is that we've done so because it's an important issue. We haven't been dragged there because of the political pressure. We haven't tried to come up with a retrofitted solution and, along the way, insulted the Treasurer of one of Australia's states. A Liberal Party Treasurer was insulted by the then Liberal Party federal Treasurer. Goodness know how he talks to Labor Treasurers, Mr Speaker. Goodness knows what he says to Labor Treasurers. There is how he treats his own state Liberal Party Treasurer.




Mr Josh Wilson:
  He was trying to be authentic!




Mr BOWEN:
  It was a very authentic phone call. I pay respects to the member for Fremantle. It was a very authentic phone call, as we now know. We now know what he really thinks. We now know his true temperament. We now know what really makes him tick when it comes to big issues facing the Australian people. It's all about the politics for this bloke. It is all about the internal Liberal Party politics. You can take him out of the state directorship of the Liberal Party, but you can't take the state directorship of the Liberal Party out of him. He's still, at heart, a state director of the Liberal Party, not a Prime Minister for all Australians. He's certainly not a Prime Minister for all Tasmanians—not for the Treasurer of Tasmania, nor for all Tasmanians.


This is a Prime Minister who is simply not up to the job. He wasn't up to the job of being Treasurer, with all due respect, Mr Speaker, and he's certainly not up to the job of being Prime Minister of Australia. This is a man who thinks it's appropriate to slam down the phone on the Treasurer of Tasmania and use language which was insulting and which I will not repeat in the House. I have too much respect to repeat it in the House. It was clearly insulting to the Treasurer and to all Tasmanians, because that is what he really thinks. He didn't fly into Braddon and say: 'I'm here to tell you you're all mendicants. I'm here to tell you don't deserve the GST money. I'm here to tell you don't deserving fair hospital funding or school funding. I'm here to tell you if you vote for me and for the Liberal Party you'll get a Treasurer and then a Prime Minister who thinks Tasmanians are beggars.' He didn't tell the people of Tasmania that.


He's not being honest with the people of Australia either. This is a man who is prepared to be dishonest with the people of Tasmania. He's therefore willing to be dishonest with the people of Australia. He's not very authentic. He knows that if he can fake authenticity, he's got it made. He knows that. That's his big plan. He says he has a mountain to climb to show the Australian people he's authentic. He's right there; we've found a point of agreement. He has a mountain to climb to show the Australian people he is authentic, because he is not authentic. He is authentic about one thing only: his ambitions. Remember when he gave Malcolm the cuddle and said, 'This is my leader and I'm ambitious for him.' Well, he was ambitious for somebody; that's true. He's not ambitious for the people of Tasmania, that's for certain. He thinks the people of Tasmania deserve less. He thought Malcolm Turnbull should deserve less as well, and he dealt with that.


Let's not let him deal with the people of Tasmania. Let's not let him deal with the matter of GST distribution. Let's not let him deal with low wages growth in Australia, where his plan is to cut penalty rates. Let's not let him deal with underfunding of schools, where his plan is to cut school funding more. Let's not let him deal with underfunding of hospitals and hospital cuts. Let's not let him deal with the challenges facing Australians doing it tough, trying to make ends meet, who commit no crime other than working on weekends, only to get a wages cut; or Australians who want their schools and hospitals properly funded. He has no plan for them. He probably thinks they're beggars and mendicants as well. He thinks they're an irritant as he tries to climb the mountain to build his authenticity, as he tries to show the Australian people he is really just an ordinary bloke. Well, he is an ordinary bloke with bad plans for Australia. He is a very ordinary Prime Minister—I'll give him that. He is a very, very ordinary Prime Minister. This bloke is the most ordinary Prime Minister since Billy McMahon. I suspect the Australian people will work that out, and they will work out his lack of authenticity as well. (Time expired)



The SPEAKER:  Is the motion seconded?

",HoR,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Morrison Government</title>,MOTIONS,2,1
"Collins, Julie, MP",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Ms COLLINS
 (Franklin) (09:59):  The motion is seconded. Tasmanians are rightly outraged as they pick up their newspaper today and see reports about the conversation between the Treasurer of Tasmania and the now Prime Minister. Tasmanians have allegedly been called beggars by the Prime Minister. Tasmanians who are queuing up in our hospitals and are currently ramped in an ambulance at the Royal Hobart Hospital, Tasmanians who are seeking mental health services at the Launceston General Hospital, and Tasmanians who are trying to access specialists on our north-west and west coasts are beggars, according to the Prime Minister. They're not Australians trying to seek the same health services as every other Australian, according to our Prime Minister.


It is an outrageous slur on Tasmanians and it goes to the character of this Prime Minister. It goes to the character of this Prime Minister that he will, behind closed doors, say things like this about Tasmania and Tasmanians and show such complete disregard for Tasmania in a private conversation that clearly happened, because the Treasurer of Tasmania, one of his friends, hasn't denied this conversation happened. All he's denied are the actual words. Clearly there was a very heated conversation and clearly a conversation took place where the current Prime Minister allegedly called Tasmanians beggars.


This Prime Minister really needs to come to Tasmania. He's been down once, as we heard from the shadow Treasurer. He's been down just once in the last three years in his term, and it's only because of the Braddon by-election that he come down. In fact, his trip was so quick, I actually missed it. He just flew in and flew out and nobody really noticed he was there. That's because he doesn't actually care about Tasmania, and that is apparent.


It's also very clear, unfortunately, that the Tasmanian Liberals have no influence here in Canberra and that the federal Liberal Party is not taking the Tasmanian Liberals seriously, whether it be the Senate team or whether it be the Liberal state government. This does not bode well for Tasmania. It does not bode well for Tasmania in GST discussions, it does not bode well for Tasmania when it comes to funding our education system, it does not bode well for Tasmania when it comes to health funding and it does not bode well at all for Tasmanians who expect the Prime Minister to treat us like every other Australian—to treat us the same as he treats his friends at Cronulla.


This is an outrageous slur against Tasmanians, and Tasmanians actually deserve an apology from this Prime Minister for speaking like that to the Treasurer of Tasmania, who is supposed to be his friend. You can imagine the muppet show over there—who's friends with whom? They go over here, they do a little dance and a little show and they try and pretend they're authentic. They try and pretend that they like Tasmanians when they come down. It is outrageous what is going on over on that side—the disunity and the dysfunction from this government continues with this leak. It is outrageous that they would say such things about Tasmanians. But, as I said, it really does go to the character of our Prime Minister.


Our Prime Minister should be prepared, in a phone call with the state Treasurer, to discuss a serious issue like GST funding, which Tasmanians rely on more than most states to fund essential services. This is a very serious issue. We talk about the muppet show and dysfunction and chaos, but Tasmanians actually need these funds. Tasmanians actually rely on them to fund our essential services. It is not good enough for the Prime Minister to have this conversation in private and to say things that clearly happened in this conversation that implied Tasmanians are beggars. We should not have to put up with this. It is not okay that this has happened, and the Prime Minister really does need to say to Tasmanians: 'I'm sorry for what I've said. I'm sorry I've been caught out. I'm sorry that this has occurred.' He needs to say 'I'm sorry' to Tasmanians for this conversation.


The fact that the Treasurer of Tasmania, as I said, has not denied that a conversation occurred is actually damning on the Prime Minister. The fact that he has not said that there was not a heated conversation is damning of this Prime Minister. But, as we heard from the shadow Treasurer, we expect these leaks to continue because we know that they are still not united on that side. We know that they still don't trust each other. That is clearly apparent. We know that the disunity, the dysfunction and the chaos on that side of politics is going to continue, and it will continue to the detriment of Tasmanians and it will continue to the detriment, I'm sure, of other Australians. But this Prime Minister should actually come in here, say sorry and start treating Tasmanians the same as every other Australian. This has been an outrageous slur and he should fix it.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon—Minister for Education) (10:05):  The fact is that what the Prime Minister has done is deliver for Tasmania and deliver for this nation. He has fixed the GST for Western Australia. He's fixed it for Tasmania—



Opposition members interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Rob Mitchell
):  The minister will resume his seat. I know this is passionate, but enough. I'd like to hear the minister's words, and I think, in fairness, you should too.




Mr TEHAN:
  I think this demonstrates what this motion is all about: it's a cheap stunt. The opposition are not focused on the Australian people. The shadow Treasurer was talking about the need to focus on the Australian people. Look at you all. Are you doing that? No. What is the Prime Minister doing? He is focusing on the Australian people because he knows that's what his job is. From day one, from the day he was given the great honour of being Prime Minister of this country, he has had nothing but focus on delivering for the Australian people. I know that this might be concerning and alarming for those opposite because they don't do that. They do not focus on the Australian people like we do. What are we focused on doing? We're focused on delivering a strong economy, we're focused on delivering a safe Australia and we're focused on making sure that that strong economy delivers the essential services that the Australian people need. That is what we are all about on this side. What are you on about over there? You're on about coming in here with your cheap stunts—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I remind the minister to make his remarks through the chair.




Mr TEHAN:
  What those opposite are focused on are cheap political stunts. They're not focused on the Australian people, like the Prime Minister is. They're not focused on delivering outcomes. Let's remember the outcome that the Prime Minister did deliver when it came to the GST. There was a problem which Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania said needed to be fixed in a way that dealt with them fairly. What the then Treasurer did was come up with a solution. What we haven't heard from those opposite is what they will do. What will they do to fix it? What's their solution? Nothing. That's why they come in here with these cheap political stunts. To those opposite: you're not focused on delivering outcomes for the Australian people. You're not focused on making sure that they have improved lives into the future. All you're worried about is coming in here and using some allegation from some report to try and say, 'Okay, there is something here that the Australian people need to be focused on.' We're not going to play your games. We are going to make sure that we are delivering for the Australian people, and that is what we will continue to do.


Look at what we are doing. One thousand jobs a day are being created. Just think for a minute about what that does for people's lives: the fact that we can create 1,000 jobs a day. That is transformational for those people who are getting those jobs. You should be applauding that. You should be applauding the fact that, right now, we have record jobs growth in this country. You should be backing the policies that are delivering that record jobs growth. You should be backing the policies that have delivered income tax cuts. You should be backing the policies which have seen small business tax reduced. That is what we're about. Why don't we hear more from you about that? Those are the sorts of policies which change people's lives. 




Mr Stephen Jones:
  What about education, Dan?




Mr TEHAN:
  Look at education. I'm asked about education. What are we delivering when it comes to education, one of the essential services that we need to deliver on? Record school funding. Record childcare funding. Record tertiary education funding. I can tell you what: we will have results when it comes to education and we will deliver results when it comes to education.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr TEHAN:
  I'm asked what this means when it comes to Tasmanian schools. I'm happy to say it: more funding for Tasmanian schools. That is what this government is focused on. We are focused on making sure that we are going to change the lives of the Australian people, and we're doing that through what we're doing with the economy.


We're also doing it through delivering the essential services. I've mentioned education. We're doing it when it comes to health, which is very important. Look at those medicines that we've been able to provide cheaply to the Australian people. We in this place all know that that delivers real outcomes for those people who need those medications. We're able to do that while we're still keeping the budget heading back to surplus. When was the last time those opposite delivered a surplus? I can't remember. We've lost Wyatt Roy in this place, and I can't remember now the last time that they delivered a surplus. We are delivering these essential services in a way which is economically affordable.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr TEHAN:
  I'm asked what we are we doing for Tasmania. I will say what we're doing when it comes to Tasmania. We're delivering funding for schools, we're delivering better health outcomes and we're delivering jobs outcomes. That is incredibly important for those Tasmanians, and we will continue to deliver that. That is incredibly important. While I'm here, just so we can really put paid to what this motion is all about, I'd like to read out a statement from the Tasmanian Treasurer. I think, given that this goes to the heart of the motion, it would be good if we listened. This is a statement from the Tasmanian Treasurer.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr TEHAN:
  What this goes to show is you're not actually interested in your own motion. You're not interested in Tasmanians. You're just here doing your cheap political stunts. That's all this is about. Let's hear what he has to say. 


While it is not my usual practice to comment on private conversations, I can confirm that during our discussions relating to the GST the phrase attributed in today's media to Mr Morrison was not used.


What does this say? It says this has just been a complete waste of time on your behalf.


Mr Morrison and I continue to have a very good working relationship and most importantly, the GST proposal that Mr Morrison and I reached is, on face value, a good deal for Tasmania.


So you can all go back to doing your day jobs. You can all go back to actually doing what you were elected here to do, and that wasn't to play these cheap political stunts. Go back to representing your constituencies in the way that they want you to. This statement clearly shows that this whole thing has been a complete and utter waste of time.


I repeat:


While it is not my usual practice to comment on private conversations, I can confirm that during our discussions relating to the GST the phrase attributed in today's media to Mr Morrison was not used.


Which part of 'was not used' don't you understand? What you've done this morning is waste this parliament's time. You've completely and utterly wasted this parliament's time, and the Australian people will be saying, 'This is why you should remain in opposition.' (Time expired)

Mr O'DOWD
 (Flynn) (10:24):  I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the Republic of Indonesia, 29 July to 4 August 2018, and seek leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with this report.


Leave granted.




Mr O'DOWD:
  I now wish to table the parliamentary delegation report on the Indonesian visit of 29 July to 4 August. The members of the delegation were Ms Sharon Claydon MP, member for Newcastle; Senator Patrick Dodson, senator for Western Australia; Senator Dean Smith, senator for Western Australia; Ms Paula Waring, delegation secretary; and myself, Ken O'Dowd, member for Flynn and leader of the delegation.


Indonesia has a current population of 262 million and it's growing at five million a year. It's a nation made up of 17,000 islands. Unfortunately, there are still many people living below the poverty line and surviving on less than $5 a day.


It was very interesting to learn that people from the South Sulawesi islands had been sailing in their boats—seven sails—on the monsoon winds to northern Australia and Arnhem Land. This practice continued over many centuries, and their relationship with the Australian Aboriginals was great, as they exchanged culture and traded their wares.


I would like to thank all members of the delegation for their time, contributions and participation in the very busy week—first in the west in Jakarta and then in the east at Makassar in South Sulawesi. I would also like to thank the ambassador, His Excellency Gary Quinlan; the deputy ambassador, Allaster Cox; Consul-General Richard Matthews; and their staff. They gave us a very warm welcome and extended their hospitality to the people of Indonesia, cultivating of goodwill, ensuring the visit was very well organised and making the delegation to Indonesia informative and a learning and sharing experience for us all.

Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (10:27):  by leave—Thank you to the leader of our delegation, the member for Flynn, for those comments just now. I too would like to acknowledge a number of people who really made our delegation trip across to Jakarta and to South Sulawesi the very best it could be.


I would like to, in these few moments, focus on a couple of matters that the member for Flynn wasn't able to cover. My focus is really on the efforts that Indonesians are making to reduce poverty within its peoples, indeed with a very strong focus on the elderly, women and children. There were some terrific programs that we got to visit. We got to see firsthand and talk to people about the significant impact being made. I don't think anyone should underestimate the task of trying to reduce poverty in Indonesia, although there have been, really, a lot of very substantial gains made. There are still 26 million people living below the national poverty line and another 62 million Indonesians considered to be economically vulnerable, so there is an enormous task ahead, but the government and communities within Indonesia are making every effort to address this.


We got to see terrific efforts being made around urban sanitation programs. That was a very important partnership with Australia. There was some $200,000 of development money from the Australian government to provide 400 households living in a very densely populated urban slum area outside Jakarta with septic and sewerage systems. Of course, that's important to not only the health and wellbeing of all the people living in that urban area but also the health and wellbeing of the river system, which is where all of that raw sewerage had been going.


I also want to flag some terrific conversations that we had around Indonesian efforts to look after older people in poverty in their communities and some very early discussions we had around whether Indonesia might be able to examine something on par with an age pension system. These are very early discussions—people are very interested; it's obviously a very big financial cost for the Indonesian government—but it was terrific being able to have those discussions with the Australian delegation, because we've had an age pension system in Australia pretty much since Federation. We were almost one of the earliest governments to do so. I hope that those discussions continue. There was terrific presence from all of the Australian embassy's DFAT staff there in helping to coordinate those discussions with many of the not-for-profit and community organisations in Jakarta that are interested in reducing poverty amongst the elderly.


I'd also like to make a very quick reference to the issue of asbestos related health issues in Indonesia. We had an opportunity to meet with a local group called LION, which is an acronym that stands for Local Initiative for OHS—occupational safety and health—Network. They are pushing up against it at the moment. There is such a lack of information within Indonesia with regard to the dangers of asbestos. There is often a misdiagnosis of asbestos related lung conditions within the medical profession there. There has only ever been one asbestos disease inquiry compensation case that has been successful in Indonesia. This is a product that we have rightly banned in this country, but there is continued importation of raw asbestos from both Russia and China into Indonesia. It is prolific in the manufacturing of all roofing materials in Indonesia, so people are working on these asbestos-riddled projects. These roofs are being used in schools, hospitals and all sorts of residential housing. It is potentially an enormous issue going into the future for Indonesia. I thank LION, who are a very small group of profoundly dedicated people trying to organise within the workforces there and their communities to get information out about the dangers of asbestos.


I'd like to thank APHEDA, the Australian People for Health, Education and Development Abroad, who put me in touch with LION, and the delegation for accompanying me. We had some terrific news that Australian government funded projects in Indonesia have asked for the prohibition of asbestos in any projects that we are funding, which is a good leadership role for the Australian government to be taking. The delegation strongly endorses Australia continuing to stipulate that we will not allow asbestos to be used on Australian government funded projects within Indonesia.


I would like to end with terrific thanks to the women of Indonesia, who showed me such determination for themselves to get better representation in parliaments throughout Indonesia. The representation of women in parliaments is a topical issue even here in Australia. We had some very good, robust discussions about how they might best do that. I thank those women, who are trailblazers in Indonesia, for achieving gender equality and women's empowerment in Indonesia. There were some terrific and indeed formidable women parliamentarians who we did get to meet. I extend my best wishes to them, and hopefully we'll be seeing many, many more of them elected in the not-too-distant future.


Finally, we went to Makassar, and I thank the member for Flynn for reminding the House of the incredibly important historical links between Makassan traders and the First Nation peoples of Australia in North Australia. It was a real honour to be there with Senator Pat Dodson, who was able to trace Makassan links through to the Kimberley region and, indeed, to some parts of his family. It was a real privilege to see those ancient people-to-people links continuing into our contemporary worlds.


As a former anthropologist, I was really delighted to be able to attend a very important rock art site just out of Makassar, at the time under the leadership of Associate Professor Adam Brumm, from Griffith University. There is a team of pretty amazing Australian archaeologists and a very strong team of young Indonesian students working on this site. There is rock art in this cave area that they've dated back to 35,400 years ago, and that is amongst the oldest rock art in the world. There are some very interesting links between Australia and those sites. I wish Professor Brumm's team all the very best in the excavation that they have underway. It was, for me, a real delight to be able to see that work firsthand. I wish the team every success, and I look forward to reading that research very soon.


I will end on the note of thanking Paula Waring for her terrific company and for her organisational capacity of keeping us on time and getting us to the right places. Also a big shout out to the DFAT staff in Indonesia. It's very significant, as our largest post in the world. There is a very significant body of DFAT staff in Indonesia. I look forward to seeing Mr Gary Quinlan, our ambassador, in Newcastle. He is an alumnus of the University of Newcastle, and I believe he will be in my hometown next week. I look forward to catching up with him again there. We were really well looked after also by Richard Matthews in Makassar. Thank you to the DFAT teams both here and in Indonesia. Thank you to my colleagues for being such great company on a terrific delegation.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (10:37):  It's my privilege to finish my contribution to the debate on the Tobacco Plain Packaging Amendment Bill 2018 this morning, having been interrupted by events of last evening. Last night I was talking about the appalling cuts to Aboriginal smoking programs by the Abbott government in 2014. I note the amendment which has been moved by the shadow minister says:


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House:


(1) notes that progress on lowering smoking rates has stalled following the Government's cuts to tobacco control measures; and


(2) calls on the Government to re-invest in lowering smoking rates.""


I should say that of course I support that amendment wholeheartedly. What they could do is look at best practice examples of programs which have been very effective in impacting smoking rates amongst some communities.


I want to point particularly to one program which has been developed by the Institute for Urban Indigenous Health in Brisbane, called Deadly Choices, which explores the historical journey of tobacco use, its acceptance and its impact on Aboriginal communities. It's a tobacco education program which is available in schools. It's a health education capacity development program that gives participants an understanding of the long association with tobacco that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have had, which helps them gain insights into the current use and acceptance of tobacco in the community. But Deadly Choices is bigger than that. It's really a health promotion program which spins around the need to address tobacco. The one-term, six-session program for schools is delivered in a flexible manner to suit school and community environments. It talks about the history and impacts of smoking; chemicals and addiction; quit support; health resources; passive smoking; and Deadly Places, Smoke-Free Spaces. It involves a 715 health check and developing links with Aboriginal medical services or health centres. That's a very important thing. We need to understand the relationship between primary health services and prevention and the way in which you can spin off programs like Deadly Choices as a result of attracting people to get a 715 check and give them an opportunity to take action to safeguard their own health.


There was a systematic review in 2016 of these programs, and I want to quote some of the conclusions:


… many of the interventions analysed in this review report high levels of community engagement and ownership. Interventions that led to positive changes were 1) led by Indigenous community members; 2) implemented in partnership with non-Indigenous health workers; 3) offered as mainstream health services. However, the importance of Indigenous led commercial tobacco control interventions is three-fold. First, it demonstrates a growing recognition of the need to address the high rates of smoking in Indigenous communities—


which I explored in my earlier contribution. They continued:


Second, it recognizes that interventions will have greater community relevance if programs are supported and rooted in local community context. Third, it reflects the growing demand, made by Aboriginal communities, for control over health services through the full participation of Aboriginal individuals in decision making and implementation.


Further, consistent with approaches to Indigenous health knowledge translation, this review found a preference for 'within the community' messages. … This was made evident through the frequent use of culturally relevant health promotion materials that were adapted to reflect the communities' unique history and culture as well as the use of Aboriginal project staff and research officers in many of the interventions.


That's what Deadly Choices does. It's built around the expertise and drive of an organisation which is very ably led by its CEO, Mr Adrian Carson. It's got a wonderful board, a skilled board, which not only has Aboriginal people but is a skill based board. I think Bill Glasson, who's a noted eye specialist in Brisbane, is on the board, plus others. This organisation has been able to work around the funding arrangements for the Commonwealth to make sure it has a program which is effective, makes an impact and will reduce and has reduced smoking rates in its community. That's what this is about.


I say to the government: you have an opportunity here to redeem yourself, and the way you redeem yourself is by putting additional resources into programs like Deadly Choices, not only in Queensland but elsewhere across Australia, and other programs which are community owned and community driven.

Ms McBRIDE
 (Dobell) (10:42):  I am pleased to speak on this amendment to the second reading motion for the Tobacco Plain Packaging Amendment Bill 2018 following the member for Lingiari, and I fully support his comments on properly funding community controlled public health initiatives. They work. They're very effective.


Smoking kills. Smoking kills over 19,000 Australians each year. Smoking causes many diseases—heart disease, stroke, emphysema and a range of cancers. Smoking-related diseases—lung cancer, heart disease and vascular dementia—killed my grandparents. Smoking is a leading cause of preventable death and disease in Australia.


Worse, these effects of smoking fall most heavily on vulnerable groups in our communities. Australians in the lowest socioeconomic areas are three times as likely to be daily smokers as those in the highest socioeconomic areas. Unemployed Australians are 1.7 times more likely to be smokers than those with jobs. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians are 2.6 times more likely to be smokers than non-Indigenous Australians. People in rural and remote areas of Australia are twice as likely to be smokers as those who live in cities. And the impact of higher rates of smoking on these groups is exacerbated by lack of proper access to health services.


Big tobacco and their apologists might like to portray smoking as a lifestyle choice. As a pharmacist who has worked in mental health and drugs and alcohol for many years, I know nicotine is an incredibly addictive drug. Almost one in two patients in mental health inpatient units are smokers. The big tobacco companies know this, and they exploit it. They also know that plain packaging has been one of the most effective steps in reducing the incidence of smoking in recent years. Why else would they have gone to the lengths they did to try to overturn the original legislation?


As a result of the far-sighted and courageous policies from the Gillard Labor government, Australia became the first country in the world to introduce plain packaging, in 2012. The Tobacco Plain Packaging Act was fought by the big tobacco companies. They challenged it in the High Court and lost. They funded a challenge to the World Trade Organization, a challenge which was rejected in June this year.


In the first two years after Labor's legislation was enacted, there was a 12.8 per cent fall in tobacco consumption across Australia. Adolescent smoking rates dropped to a record low in 2014. In that year, 18.6 per cent of males and 80.2 per cent of females aged 12 to17 reported they had never smoked compared with 75.9 per cent of males and 77.4 per cent of females in 2011. As teenage years are particularly dangerous in establishing smoking habits, this fall is particularly good news. The post-implementation review of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act conducted by the Department of Health and Ageing was published in February 2016. The PIR concluded that the plain packaging measure has begun to achieve its public health objectives of reducing smoking and exposure to tobacco smoke in Australia and was expected to continue to do so into the future. The body of studies considered for the PIR showed the tobacco plain packaging measure was having an impact by reducing the appeal of tobacco products, increasing the effectiveness of health warnings and reducing the ability of the pack to mislead. The studies also provide early evidence of positive changes to actual smoking and quitting behaviours.


In simple terms, plain packaging is saving lives. Following the success of the Australian legislation, a number of other countries have adopted similar legislation or are in the process of doing so. We welcome and will support this legislation to make minor technical amendments to Labor's world-leading plain packaging legislation. But we also want to take this opportunity to tell this government that it needs to do more. Unfortunately, the steady progress on reducing smoking rates experienced over decades seems to have stalled under the current government. In 2017, the Australian health policy collaboration at Victoria University said on World No Tobacco Day:


… Australia’s Health Tracker by Area reports that about 2.8 million Australian adults are current smokers. Research shows that two thirds of people who continue to smoke are likely to die because of their smoking.


Health experts agree that Australia needs ongoing media campaigns to reduce smoking, action to counter tobacco industry strategies and increased support for proven tobacco control programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people with mental health problems, and disadvantaged groups.


To quote from Professor Mike Daube of Curtin University:


This is our most preventable epidemic. We know exactly what needs to be done, but the tobacco industry has developed new strategies to keep people smoking, and governments are getting complacent. It is especially disappointing that there has been no national tobacco media campaign for several years, although this year the government expects to get more than $11 billion in tobacco tax revenue. Prevention should be a priority, not an afterthought.


Dr Sarah White, Director of Quit Victoria, said:


Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in Australia. Investing in helping people to quit and deterring kids from starting to smoke is a no-brainer. Prevention is a better approach than spending billions trying to treat diseases that are often, sadly, not treatable.


We need to acknowledge it is getting more challenging to help the remaining smokers. Most of those who have been able to quit, have. These are the ones for whom initiatives, to date, have not been effective. They're recalcitrant smokers. Now that the government has extensively abandoned its tax cuts to big business and big banks, perhaps that money could be directed to better understanding the problem of nicotine addiction and the ways to address it. We need to do whatever we can to support those seven-in-10 smokers who plan to quit but need help to get them started.


Smokers need to know the immediate and long-term benefits of quitting. A year after quitting, your risk of coronary heart disease is about half of that of someone who continues to smoke. If you quit smoking at 30, your life expectancy is similar to that of someone who has never smoked. We need to find ways to address the problems faced by those groups who have higher incidence of smoking—those in poorer areas, those in the regions like my community on the Central Coast of New South Wales, those with multiple and complex health needs, and Indigenous Australians.


There are quality, cost-effective, evidence based smoking cessation projects often led by public health units in public hospitals that are saving lives. I'd like to give you an example from my electorate. The pharmacist led smoking cessation project at the Central Coast local health district started at Wyong Hospital. In 2015, two of my then staff, Amy and Katie, came to me and said, 'We ask all patients on admission whether they are smokers. Then what do we about it?' This was a big problem. They'd identified a big problem. According to the New South Wales Population Health Survey conducted by the Centre for Epidemiology in 2016, 20 per cent of adults on the Central Coast were smokers compared to the state average of 15 per cent. Something needed to be done. Our LHD, the Central Coast LHD, was the second worst for smoking prevalence in New South Wales at the time. But in order to do something about it, health practitioners really needed to be better trained. I am pleased to say that Amy and Katie are now tobacco treatment and smoking cessation specialists. For less than $2,000 a health practitioner can be trained in nicotine addiction and smoking cessation. This may be an area where some of this money could be redirected. A grant then allowed Associate Professor Renee Bittoun, of the Woolcock Institute, to train our team. It was excellent training and an excellent investment by a department in a local health district.


Since then, the pharmacy team have conducted inpatient smoking point prevalence audits to better identify smokers and offer smoking cessation, like very brief intervention, and have updated the hospital's nicotine replacement therapy formularies to include a wider range of nicotine replacement modalities and to have them on hand so they are readily available as soon as somebody is identified as a smoker. They have also committed to better train all pharmacists in smoking cessation and nicotine addiction within the health service. I'm pleased to say that this initiative has led to smoking cessation champions in the wider hospital. The cardiology division now has trained specialists and last year held a training day for cardiac, neurology and respiratory nurses.


I won't forget the training that I was at early in my career when we were talking about smoking cessation and the time when people are most receptive. One of the junior doctors said that when someone came round from having a stroke or a heart attack, he'd lean in and say, 'I think it's time for you to stop smoking.' That type of intervention can work, at a time when people are most receptive.


Most people, like the dedicated pharmacists at Central Coast Health, understand that addiction is a complex health problem—it is not a lifestyle choice. But it is evident from other legislation introduced by this government, such as the proposals for mandatory drug testing of income support recipients, that some on the other side just don't seem to get it. Despite the clear evidence that our plain packaging legislation has worked and has clearly saved lives, many on the other side still think this is a 'nanny state' policy.


Labor have a long and proud record on tobacco control. We have shown consistent leadership, standing up to the big tobacco companies despite their formidable resources. It's now been 14 years since Labor announced that we would no longer take political donations from big tobacco. It took nearly 10 years for the Liberals to match us on that commitment. But, shamefully, the Nationals still haven't done the right thing. As recently as 2016-17 they took $15,700 from big tobacco companies. That is a disgrace, particularly when you consider that what they regard as their core constituency, rural and regional Australians, are at twice the risk from smoking as their city cousins—twice as likely to contract smoking caused diseases; twice as likely to die prematurely as result of smoking.


This is a really serious issue. This is about influence. The Southgate Institute were here this morning talking about the social determinants of health and wellbeing, and one of the social determinants they were talking about was the corporate or commercial influence in public health policy in Australia. As a former mental health worker and someone who has worked in inpatient mental health and drug and alcohol units, I believe it is something that needs to be called out and something that needs to be changed. We can't have more vulnerable people exploited by big tobacco and we can't have big tobacco continue to influence decision-making in public health policy in Australia—particularly when we know that rural and regional Australians are twice as likely to die prematurely as a result of smoking and twice as likely to contract smoking related diseases as people who live in the city.


I spent almost 10 years working in the mental health inpatient units of my local health service. During that time smoke-free policies were introduced across NSW Health. There is so much that we can do to support people so that they are able to quit, but we need to first acknowledge that nicotine is a highly addictive drug and it needs to be treated as a complex health problem, not a lifestyle choice.


The Prime Minister must explain why he thinks it is okay for his coalition partner to accept donations from companies who profit from the 19,000 premature deaths in Australia each year from smoking related disease. But that's what we see the Liberals and Nationals doing time and again: putting the interest of big business and big banks before the wellbeing of the Australian people.


As I said at the outset, I lost my grandparents to smoking related disease: heart disease, lung cancer and vascular dementia. In too many rural communities, lives are being cut short by smoking related diseases that are preventable. We know that this is the No. 1 preventable disease and we know what to do. What has to be done is that it needs to be properly funded. I call on the government to properly fund these community controlled, community led public health initiatives that are saving lives.

Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in Australia. Investing in helping people to quit and deterring kids from starting to smoke is a no-brainer. Prevention is a better approach than spending billions trying to treat diseases that are often, sadly, not treatable.


We need to acknowledge it is getting more challenging to help the remaining smokers. Most of those who have been able to quit, have. These are the ones for whom initiatives, to date, have not been effective. They're recalcitrant smokers. Now that the government has extensively abandoned its tax cuts to big business and big banks, perhaps that money could be directed to better understanding the problem of nicotine addiction and the ways to address it. We need to do whatever we can to support those seven-in-10 smokers who plan to quit but need help to get them started.


Smokers need to know the immediate and long-term benefits of quitting. A year after quitting, your risk of coronary heart disease is about half of that of someone who continues to smoke. If you quit smoking at 30, your life expectancy is similar to that of someone who has never smoked. We need to find ways to address the problems faced by those groups who have higher incidence of smoking—those in poorer areas, those in the regions like my community on the Central Coast of New South Wales, those with multiple and complex health needs, and Indigenous Australians.


There are quality, cost-effective, evidence based smoking cessation projects often led by public health units in public hospitals that are saving lives. I'd like to give you an example from my electorate. The pharmacist led smoking cessation project at the Central Coast local health district started at Wyong Hospital. In 2015, two of my then staff, Amy and Katie, came to me and said, 'We ask all patients on admission whether they are smokers. Then what do we about it?' This was a big problem. They'd identified a big problem. According to the New South Wales Population Health Survey conducted by the Centre for Epidemiology in 2016, 20 per cent of adults on the Central Coast were smokers compared to the state average of 15 per cent. Something needed to be done. Our LHD, the Central Coast LHD, was the second worst for smoking prevalence in New South Wales at the time. But in order to do something about it, health practitioners really needed to be better trained. I am pleased to say that Amy and Katie are now tobacco treatment and smoking cessation specialists. For less than $2,000 a health practitioner can be trained in nicotine addiction and smoking cessation. This may be an area where some of this money could be redirected. A grant then allowed Associate Professor Renee Bittoun, of the Woolcock Institute, to train our team. It was excellent training and an excellent investment by a department in a local health district.


Since then, the pharmacy team have conducted inpatient smoking point prevalence audits to better identify smokers and offer smoking cessation, like very brief intervention, and have updated the hospital's nicotine replacement therapy formularies to include a wider range of nicotine replacement modalities and to have them on hand so they are readily available as soon as somebody is identified as a smoker. They have also committed to better train all pharmacists in smoking cessation and nicotine addiction within the health service. I'm pleased to say that this initiative has led to smoking cessation champions in the wider hospital. The cardiology division now has trained specialists and last year held a training day for cardiac, neurology and respiratory nurses.


I won't forget the training that I was at early in my career when we were talking about smoking cessation and the time when people are most receptive. One of the junior doctors said that when someone came round from having a stroke or a heart attack, he'd lean in and say, 'I think it's time for you to stop smoking.' That type of intervention can work, at a time when people are most receptive.


Most people, like the dedicated pharmacists at Central Coast Health, understand that addiction is a complex health problem—it is not a lifestyle choice. But it is evident from other legislation introduced by this government, such as the proposals for mandatory drug testing of income support recipients, that some on the other side just don't seem to get it. Despite the clear evidence that our plain packaging legislation has worked and has clearly saved lives, many on the other side still think this is a 'nanny state' policy.


Labor have a long and proud record on tobacco control. We have shown consistent leadership, standing up to the big tobacco companies despite their formidable resources. It's now been 14 years since Labor announced that we would no longer take political donations from big tobacco. It took nearly 10 years for the Liberals to match us on that commitment. But, shamefully, the Nationals still haven't done the right thing. As recently as 2016-17 they took $15,700 from big tobacco companies. That is a disgrace, particularly when you consider that what they regard as their core constituency, rural and regional Australians, are at twice the risk from smoking as their city cousins—twice as likely to contract smoking caused diseases; twice as likely to die prematurely as result of smoking.


This is a really serious issue. This is about influence. The Southgate Institute were here this morning talking about the social determinants of health and wellbeing, and one of the social determinants they were talking about was the corporate or commercial influence in public health policy in Australia. As a former mental health worker and someone who has worked in inpatient mental health and drug and alcohol units, I believe it is something that needs to be called out and something that needs to be changed. We can't have more vulnerable people exploited by big tobacco and we can't have big tobacco continue to influence decision-making in public health policy in Australia—particularly when we know that rural and regional Australians are twice as likely to die prematurely as a result of smoking and twice as likely to contract smoking related diseases as people who live in the city.


I spent almost 10 years working in the mental health inpatient units of my local health service. During that time smoke-free policies were introduced across NSW Health. There is so much that we can do to support people so that they are able to quit, but we need to first acknowledge that nicotine is a highly addictive drug and it needs to be treated as a complex health problem, not a lifestyle choice.


The Prime Minister must explain why he thinks it is okay for his coalition partner to accept donations from companies who profit from the 19,000 premature deaths in Australia each year from smoking related disease. But that's what we see the Liberals and Nationals doing time and again: putting the interest of big business and big banks before the wellbeing of the Australian people.


As I said at the outset, I lost my grandparents to smoking related disease: heart disease, lung cancer and vascular dementia. In too many rural communities, lives are being cut short by smoking related diseases that are preventable. We know that this is the No. 1 preventable disease and we know what to do. What has to be done is that it needs to be properly funded. I call on the government to properly fund these community controlled, community led public health initiatives that are saving lives.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (13:28):  Today I table a petition. The petition has thousands of signatures and was presented to me by one of my constituents, David Forde, and by Professor Shahjahan Khan and Dr Mohammed Islam and others who drew it together. The petition requests the House to 'recognise the state of Palestine because, if the House is genuinely committed to a lasting two-state solution and advancing peace in the Middle East and beyond, then it must formally recognise the state of Palestine to ensure two sovereign states, based on the implementation of relevant United Nations resolutions and international law'.


It saddens me that millions of Palestinians continue to live under occupation or as refugees. The latest UNICEF situation report for Palestine reveals the dire living conditions of Palestinians. More than 80 per cent of the population are dependent on some form of assistance. There are 2.5 million people in need, most who call the Gaza Strip home. The security in that area is extremely fragile and unpredictable. Earlier this year, on 14 May, we saw the highest casualty toll in a single day since the 2014 hostilities were recorded: 60 Palestinians killed and 2,770 injured. Almost half of those killed and injured were by live ammunition. We now have three generations of refugees living in Gaza without any chance of economic capacity or having a decent standard of living. I applaud the efforts of David Forde and the wider Moreton community for bringing forward this petition, which I now table.




The petition read as follows—



TO THE HONOURABLE THE SPEAKER AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES It draws to the attention of the House, the following facts: That Palestinians are a stateless people who have suffered under the shadow of Israeli occupation for far too long. They want freedom, justice, equality and the right to self-determination. For 25 years, Palestinians have engaged in a rigged ""peace process"" while Israel has confiscated their lands, colonised their country with Jewish settlements and imposed a crippling blockade on Gaza that has pauperised its population. As Israel consolidates its hold over the Occupied Territories and the remaining Palestinian enclaves continue to shrink, the window of opportunity for a two-state solution is closing fast. The failure of the two-state solution will leave Israel as an apartheid state, ruling over an indigenous underclass of permanently disenfranchised Palestinians. Such a situation would destabilise the entire region and serve as an invaluable propaganda resource for extremist and terrorist organisations around the world. Given Israel's overwhelming political and military advantages, the Palestinians will never win their freedom and basic human rights without international intervention. . 


We request the House to: Recognise the State of Palestine, because if the House is genuinely committed to a lasting two-state solution and advancing peace in the Middle East and beyond, then it must formally recognise the State of Palestine (to ensure two sovereign states), based on the implementation of relevant United Nations resolutions and international law. The window of opportunity for a two state solution is fast closing.

Mr MORRISON:
  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I'll continue. What the post refers to is comments from feedlot operators from the north-west of New South Wales, Michael in Bellata and Sandy from near Moree, who are explaining what the drought means for them. It goes through a range of comments. There's another one from Mr Munroe that says: 'We know it will rain again. It always has. We've had droughts before, and we'll have them again. We'll get through this one. And most farmers—they're good operators—will survive because, to some extent, they have prepared in what way they can for this current event.'


The way our government is responding to the drought is to go out there and listen to what people in rural and regional communities are saying to us. I'm not going to censor their views; I'm going to listen to their views. That's what the member for New England is doing as the special envoy on drought. He's out there listening to, talking to and getting the feedback off farming communities in drought-affected areas. The Labor Party might want to close their ears to the voices of the bush, but the Liberal-National government never will. On that note, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.

The document read as follows—



REQUEST TO THE PARLIAMENT OF AUSTRALIA


MOTION: TERRITORY RIGHTS


On Thursday 23 August 2018, Mr Gunner (Chief Minister), pursuant to notice, moved:


(1)That this Assembly recognises:


(a)Australia's democracy is one of the best in the world;


(b)Territory rights are of paramount importance to citizens of the Northern Territory of Australia;


(c)the actions of the Australian Senate on the evening of 15 August 2018 in failing to agree to a legislative proposal to restore the rights of both the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory to consider and pass legislation on behalf of the residents of those Australian territories is a breach of democratic principles for Territorians;


(d)specifically, the failure of the Australian Parliament to repeal section 50A of the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978remains an impediment to democracy for Territorians;


(e)the ongoing disparity between the legislators elected by the residents of Australian territories and those elected to represent the people in the Australian states in relation to legislative capacity is anti-democratic;


(f)the distinction between the capacity to legislate and any actual legislation about the rights of terminally ill persons in the Northern Territory appears to have been deliberately confused by some Senators; and


(2)This Assembly requests that:


(a)the Federal Parliament not determine and distinguish between the rights of Australian citizens by virtue of where those Australians reside within this country; and


(b)the House of Representatives as soon as practicable consider and pass legislation to repeal section 50A of the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978.

"Wilkie, Andrew, MP",IND,2018-09-12,"



Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (15:15):  I start by pointing out that since 2012 Australia has fallen six places on the international corruption perception index. I also refer to some excellent research by the Australia Institute, which indicates that 85 per cent of Australians think there is corruption in federal politics. Indeed, the perception of corruption impacts business investment and the efficient allocation of resources, thereby reducing our GDP by about four per cent or a thumping $72.3 billion a year.


This is a dreadful situation, but it's completely understandable, because when you look around us and look at our recent history, scandal after scandal and question after question raised about conduct, at the federal level in particular, you can understand why 85 per cent of Australians think there is indeed corruption in federal politics. I have a few examples. Who can forget the Australian Wheat Board being caught up in the bribery scandal with Saddam Hussein when selling wheat into Iraq? Who could forget how the Reserve Bank was caught up in the bribery scandal related to winning note-printing contracts abroad? What about, just very recently, a former member of this House, Mr Bruce Billson? He was the executive chair of the Franchise Council of Australia while he was the Minister for Small Business. That's right. Bruce Billson sat in this place as a minister of the Crown, the Minister for Small Business, when he was at the same time the executive chair of the Franchise Council of Australia. What about former minister Andrew Robb? He was the trade minister when the Chinese company Landbridge secured the 99-year lease for the Port of Darwin. It was a company that Mr Robb then went and worked part-time on an income of almost $1 million a year. No wonder 85 per cent of Australians think there is corruption in federal politics. Who could forget the secrecy over the mysterious federal government grant of $30 million to Foxtel? What about more recently? There was an even more mysterious grant, seemingly on a whim, of $444 million to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. I'm going to labour this point to death: no wonder 85 per cent of Australians think there is corruption in federal politics. No wonder the overwhelming majority of Australians are strongly of the view that there is a need for some sort of federal integrity commission, perhaps modelled along the lines of the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption. 


Of course, the New South Wales ICAC has been wonderfully successful since it was established. A number of people have found themselves in prison, and many parliamentarians have been forced to resign from the New South Wales parliament. What a wonderful example of the effectiveness of having some sort of corruption body at an appropriate level.


I stood with my colleague the member for Mayo and Senator McKim from the Greens outside the Magistrates Court here in the ACT just today because today is the day that the directions hearing will be conducted into the Witness K and Bernard Collaery matter. What better example is there? In fact, if I only had time for one example of why we need a federal integrity commission, I would refer to the Witness K and Bernard Collaery matter.


In 2004, the Australian government, the then Howard government, had the Australian Secret Intelligence Service plant bugs in the East Timor parliamentary building in order to eavesdrop on the confidential and highly sensitive joint venture partner negotiations over the sharing of the oil and gas revenue from the Timor Gap. It was something that was and remains clearly illegal under Australian law. It is clearly illegal under Australian law to use one of our foreign intelligence agencies to eavesdrop or spy on confidential joint venture partner commercial negotiations. What is the federal government doing about it? It's charged the whistleblower, Witness K, who's trying to shine a light on government misconduct and charged his lawyer, who is doing nothing more than representing his client and who felt compelled to speak to some journalists to shine a light on this most serious federal government misconduct.


It is self-evident that Australia needs a federal integrity commission. It is remarkable that every state and territory now has or is putting in place an integrity watchdog. In my home state of Tasmania, we have the Integrity Commission. Yes, in Tasmania we might criticise the Integrity Commission and say it's not effective enough and we want it enhanced, but at least we have something. It beggars belief that, here in Canberra, we don't have any sort of watchdog to keep an eye on allegations of official misconduct—an organisation that we could have mobilised to look at the $444 million grant to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, that we could have mobilised to look into that mysterious $30 million grant to Foxtel or that could have looked into whether or not Andrew Robb got up to no good. He was the trade minister when Landbridge secured the 99-year lease for Darwin and then he went on to work for that company to the tune of almost $1 million a year for part-time work. I'm not alleging Mr Robb did anything wrong in that case, but, I'll tell you what, a reasonable person would look at that and say: 'It doesn't look or smell right. Someone should run a fine-tooth comb over that and make sure that Mr Robb acted properly.' It is the same with Bruce Billson. He sat in here as a minister of the Crown, the Minister for Small Business, while on the payroll of the Franchise Council of Australia.


One of the characteristics of a healthy democracy is that we can have confidence in it. You can only have confidence in your democracy, in your system of government, if you know you have effective processes in place, and that includes an effective integrity watchdog. It beggars belief that we don't have that just yet. I am very heartened and delighted, though, to see that the opposition, the Labor Party, which I understand has previously not been supportive of a federal ICAC-type body, has now adopted a policy. I say to the shadow Attorney-General: I hope that remains your policy and, when you speak, it'd be great to hear a commitment to that so that we can have confidence that, should the opposition become the government at the next election, you will move smartly to put in place some sort of federal integrity commission.



Mr Khalil interjecting—



Mr Keogh interjecting—




Mr WILKIE:
  I don't know why I'm being heckled by the ALP. I'm actually congratulating you and saying, 'That's great.' I think it's wonderful that you've adopted that policy. I'm hoping that the Attorney-General will offer some explanation for the continuing reluctance of the government, of the coalition, to accept some sort of integrity commission.


It affect us in all sorts of ways. If you don't have an integrity commission of some kind, not only does it allow people to get up to no good; it also diminishes the community's confidence in our system of government, it diminishes confidence in this country from other countries, and it diminishes investor confidence. That's why the Australia Institute has calculated that our GDP is, in fact, diminished by about four per cent a year, over $70 billion a year, because people and, in particular, international investors would be less keen to invest in our country.


Every way you cut it, there are reasons to establish such a body. It beggars belief that in 2018 we don't have such a body. I'm in no doubt that as time goes on and the Witness K and Bernard Collaery matter unfolds, the community will more and more understand that that is probably the very best exemplar we could have of the need to have some body to look into allegations of serious misconduct. There could be no more serious misconduct than the use of one of our foreign intelligence agencies. So good on the ALP for having this. I hope to hear some sort of commitment from the Attorney-General in the next few minutes.

"Porter, Christian, MP",LP,2018-09-12,"



Mr PORTER
 (Pearce—Attorney-General) (15:26):  I thank the member for Denison for his contribution. I have listened carefully, and it is an issue I've thought about for a long time. Having practised in some of these jurisdictions, at least for a period of time, I'm not unfamiliar with them. I might commence by saying I think you may have been a little bit inaccurate—we'll need to check the Hansard—in your characterisation of Mr Billson's circumstances. I think you may have said he was a minister whilst also being on the Franchise Council. I do not believe that that is actually correct. I think Mr Billson ended his ministerial position in September 2015 and went on to the Franchise Council in March 2016. So we will need to check my recollection and the Hansard.


It goes to this very interesting and, I think, central point: individual human beings, men or women, parliamentarians, public servants and hardworking servants of the Australian Commonwealth can find that they are in a difficult set of environments and circumstances where their reputations can be utterly destroyed by looseness of consideration, by looseness of language and by poor process. The member for Denison asks for an explanation as to why any side of this parliament might exact some level of caution with respect to the adoption of a proposal—which at the moment from Labor is, if I may say, in very vague terms—for an overarching federal integrity commission based on the New South Wales ICAC model. I'll give you a starting reason for some caution in adopting that approach, and that is the member's statement that the New South Wales ICAC has been wonderfully effective. It cannot possibly be the case that anybody who has followed the jurisdiction and the outcomes from the New South Wales ICAC could possibly put forward a conclusion that somehow or other the experience of the New South Wales ICAC has at least not been mixed.


There have been some absolutely outrageous outcomes and processes through the New South Wales ICAC. I'll raise one here today with respect to Margaret Cunneen, the very respected prosecutor and senior counsel. The High Court found that the New South Wales ICAC had exceeded its authority based on its misinterpretation of 'corrupt conduct', a term inside the ICAC Act in New South Wales. That is to say, the High Court of this country found that the New South Wales ICAC, which you say has been wonderfully effective, didn't even understand the scope of its own mandate. That ICAC was required to pay costs for both sides in what was a farcical exercise, adding a further waste of taxpayer funds to what had been a spurious exercise in the first place. The High Court held that the alleged conduct with respect to the very well respected Margaret Cunneen could not have amounted to corruption even if it had occurred, and it was never proved. It was an outrageous exercise. So to come here and offer an observation that the reason that we should breathlessly adopt a very, very vague suggestion from Labor is that comparative bodies have been wonderfully effective, I think, demonstrates the looseness of thinking and language which causes enormous problems in this area.


I've had some experience with the Western Australian Corruption and Crime Commission. You may not know, but you may be interested to know, that recently the parliamentary inspector, Michael Murray QC, described a CCC investigator's actions as inexcusable and grossly negligent. He was making warrant applications based on false information, which Michael Murray found to be ineffective and inappropriate. Michael Murray found, with respect to the Western Australian CCC, 'systemic cultural, behavioural and managerial failures within the covert operation unit'. I've watched that jurisdiction. I take your point seriously: that this notion that these bodies are without fault is so horrendously wrong as to be a terrible basis for adopting that model in this jurisdiction without enormous caution and forethought.


I'll just raise two other matters that have always concerned me with respect to activities in the Western Australian jurisdiction. One is with respect to a very well-respected public servant, Mr Michael Allen. This dates back to the Corruption and Crime Commission in Western Australia in or about 2007. They had a finding of misconduct against Mr Allen. He was a very well-respected senior civil servant who had served the state of Western Australia very well for many years. His reputation—and, I would suggest, his life—was utterly ruined by the report of the CCC in WA. He was a decent, hardworking man, and the finding of the parliamentary inspector into that report said:


The CCC should publicly acknowledge that it was in error in finding that Mr Allen was guilty of misconduct, and withdraw not only the ""opinion"" of misconduct by Mr Allen as expressed in its Report of 5 October 2007 … but also its ""substituted"" opinion of 13 February 2008, as neither opinion is supported by evidence, and both are inconsistent with evidence which the CCC had, but did not refer to in its Report …


The CCC destroyed a man's career by the single finding of a word in a report and it didn't include information that it had. You might find that that's perhaps not the sort of model that we want to breathlessly and thoughtlessly adopt here without some very, very serious structural understanding of what was going on. The parliamentary inspector found, with respect to the Allen matter:


… as well as the evidence of other relevant witnesses not interviewed by the CCC.


There was a Mr Lee in Western Australia who was the Mayor of the City of Coburg. He also was subject to an adverse inference of misconduct. The parliamentary inspector found:


An ""adverse inference""—


as the member for Isaacs will well know—


must not be drawn from ""circumstances""—


adverse to an accused person in matters such as this—


unless all of the circumstances are taken into consideration, and after having considered what alternative inferences are reasonably open.


What did the parliamentary inspector find with respect to these allegedly wonderfully effective bodies? He said:


The CCC has … disregarded the evidence which supports an alternative inference (as well as the sworn evidence of Mr Lee) that he did not know …


that a company—


had made any donation.


That was another man's reputation completely destroyed.


There was another famous matter in Western Australia of the Labor politician—a great bloke—John D'Orazio. He was found guilty in a CCC report of 'inappropriate conduct'. It destroyed his career and destroyed his reputation. What did the parliamentary inspector find with respect to that finding? That the problem was that 'inappropriate conduct' was not actually a term used in the CCC's act and that they shouldn't have made the finding because there was no such thing at law under the CCC's own act. The parliamentary inspector said:


… the Commission had no jurisdiction.


I might add that this was Malcolm McCusker AO QC—one of the greatest lawyers the country has ever seen. He said:


… the Commission had no jurisdiction to make a finding, or express an opinion, on ""inappropriate"" conduct. Section 4 of the Act contains a definition of what constitutes either ""misconduct"" or ""serious misconduct"". ""Inappropriate conduct"" is not defined, nor referred to, in the Act.


I would exercise extreme caution with your starting proposition that these are wonderfully effective bodies.


At the moment Australia has a multiagency approach. That ranking that you referred to has consistently had Australia in the top 20 countries as a low corruption jurisdiction. There has been movement, but we are consistently in the top 20 countries on Earth for low corruption. The Labor Party media release which gives their suggestion for this type of body—the findings of which I've just outlined—says that there is not, in effect, a corruption problem in Australia. To quote the Labor Party: 'Corruption has not become a major problem in Australian political life.'


We're consistently in the top 20 jurisdictions with the lowest levels of corruption on earth. Only two of those top 20 jurisdictions have the types of bodies that you're referring to. One of them is Hong Kong. I think the other one is Singapore. Most countries that have the low levels of corruption that we experience, irrespective of people's perceptions—and I acknowledge that is a problem and something that we can all work hard on to repair—have the type of specialised multiagency approach where a variety of very hardworking agencies specialise in looking at corruption of particular types at particular points. In our jurisdiction, those agencies are the AFP, ACLEI, the Australian Public Service Commission, ASIC, ANO, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority, which I'm sure you're aware we created; the Australian Electoral Commission, and the inspectors-general of intelligence, security and taxation.


I'm not utterly closed-minded to this suggestion, but in the Labor Party press release the detail is that it should have sufficient funding and sufficient jurisdiction, and one commissioner and two deputy commissioners—and that's about as far as the detail goes. That is hopelessly inadequate to try and draw a red line through what has been a perfectly well-operating system. That is not to say the system could not do with some form of reform, that some of the overlaps and inconsistencies can be clearly identified and repaired, but the idea that you put a line through that system and replace it with something that is not wonderfully effective is wrong-headed.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (15:36):  This is a classic reason as to why you need third voices in parliament. To hear the Liberal Attorney-General get up and effectively say there never should have been a body to investigate Labor's Eddie Obeid is truly reprehensible. The only reason that the government can give for not having a federal anticorruption watchdog is that sometimes it acts in ways that they don't like. What they fail to mention is that, of course, in many of those instances the anticorruption watchdog is subject to oversight by the courts, who can determine whether it is acting within its power. But, when a Liberal Attorney-General says there never should have been a body that could investigate people like Labor's Eddie Obeid, it tells you everything you need to know about this place. It's not good enough to resist an anticorruption watchdog on the basis that sometimes they do things that you don't like, because what the New South Wales experience has shown us is that an anticorruption watchdog picks up things that existing law enforcement agencies don't. Eddie Obeid was uncovered for his wrongdoing not because of the activities of a police force, not because of the activities of other investigatory bodies but because of the activities of an ICAC. If you ask anyone in this country, 'Do you think it's right that Labor's Eddie Obeid got sentenced?' they would say yes. There should be a body that is able to look at everyone without fear or favour, no matter what political party they come from—a body that can look under every conceivable rock and have the power to do it. You've just heard probably the best reason that we should have one. When one side of politics gets up to defend the other and says, 'There's nothing to see here; let's move on,' that is exactly why we need it. 


If you think that corruption stops at state borders, you've got rocks in your head. If it is happening at the New South Wales state level and if it's happening at other state levels, there's every reason to suspect it may have happened here over time as well. The idea that we don't need one because so far we haven't uncovered any evidence of it is the wrong way around. If there were an investigatory body, we might uncover some evidence.


This is something that the Greens have been pursuing for a very, very long time. Bob Brown introduced the first bill to give effect to a federal ICAC back in 2010. We repeated our claims for it in 2010; we pushed for it again in parliament in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016 and last year. Each step of the way, we have been opposed by the old parties. I am very pleased to see that we now might be seeing a repeat of the Greens' position on marriage equality, where we got opposed by all of the others until they agreed with us, and on the royal commission on the banks, where we got opposed by everyone else until they agreed with us. Now I am very pleased that the Labor Party has indicated that it is changing its position. That shows the value of having Greens and third voices in this parliament. We have been raising this since day one. We have been giving voice to what people in Australia want. Many other members of the crossbench have been part of that push as well. Now it seems to be bearing fruit.


Think about how this government asks other people to behave. If you're on welfare, you are automatically suspected of being a criminal and you are subject to random drug testing. If you happen to have the misfortune of not having a job and are in one of their trial sites, you can be forced to come in and have a drug test because apparently you may have broken the law and we want to know about it. When you ask for a modicum of that to be flicked back on politicians and for politicians to be treated in some ways with the same kind of oversight so that there's a hand on someone's shoulder, 'No, we couldn't possibly do that,' squeal the government. 


If the government doesn't want people looking into its activities, it probably tells you exactly why we need this body. One thing it will do is change the way ministers make decisions. We see day after day ministers with enormous power making decisions very often behind closed doors. They do it because they think they can get away with it and without scrutiny. If ministers know that they could be hauled before a corruption watchdog, it will change the way they act every time they make a decision, accept some money or do something that has a financial implication. There has been too much evidence of corruption in this country. There has been too much evidence to suggest that somehow it does exist at the federal level as well. A federal anticorruption watchdog, as championed by the Greens, would go a long way to restoring trust in politics.

"Laming, Andrew, MP",LP,2018-09-12,"



Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (15:42):  I want to pick up the member for Denison's important point there, which is that today as we consider an additional layer of investigatory power we have to ask what additional elements that are potentially corrupt would be picked up by this new body that are not picked up already in the ruthlessly rigorous media, the incredible access to data through freedom of information and the multifaceted approach the Attorney-General has already outlined. The two questions we should all be asking, as anyone listening to this debate would be, are: first of all, how many times has potentially corrupt activity either fallen through the cracks or been improperly litigated because of our current structures; secondly, just how much corruption is there out there that we're missing completely and we need a new body to deal with? I think the point made by the Attorney-General is that we're both in the handful of top nations in the world and frankly going nowhere as one of the truly gold-standard economies for identifying corruption.


We have three levels of government, and two of them do have ICAC-like structures. We can look at how they operate, but let's remember that the federal government and the areas in which we dwell are fundamentally different and we don't necessarily deal, like the tiny councils, in massive value-change propositions through development that require scrutiny. That isn't easily monitored because, by definition, they are small councils scattered all over the country, often with great variations in capacity within their staff. The federal area is predominantly immigration, defence and foreign affairs and then basically it's contract management through Defence and grants run by other federal departments. These are far less challenging areas to monitor than those at the state and local levels. This is one of the reasons why this multifaceted system has worked so well up to now. I think the Attorney-General expressed a willingness to look at strengthening our current multifaceted approach, and that's entirely reasonable.


Then the debate really comes down to whether small changes are required or whether we need to look at that Griffith University and Transparency International report, which gave three very valuable alternatives, one of which was an ICAC, an independent body with jurisdiction over the entire public sector. That was their model and it comes with a price tag of just under $50 million a year. So it is reasonable to ask whether that $50 million a year is going to result in anything fundamentally different.


I think it's fair to look at that significant list provided by the member for Denison. The Wheat Board was quite easily exposed in the public domain and was subject to litigation. He gave us the Billson example, which simply identified a federal MP with another activity outside of parliament—a pecuniary interest or otherwise, gaining or profiting from it. That was quite easily examined and litigated without the need for an overarching body. The very fact that we can list out what has been potentially corrupt before just shows that the multifaceted system is working okay.


Politically you can go to the Australian people and say, 'Do you reckon politicians are corrupt?' and 80 per cent say yes. But that is a fundamentally different question. I heard Labor members of parliament, as they were walking away from the MPI, saying, 'Just remember, vote for the ALP and you will get a federal ICAC.' It's politically convenient to argue for one, but in reality they have had four months since the budget reply speech and they have had, I think, a government that is quite willing to engage in the detail on this. Instead we just have one commissioner, two assistant commissioners and basically a roving job to move between existing public agencies. That's not really an ICAC at all.




Mr Dreyfus:
  I don't think you've read the proposal.




Mr LAMING:
  I think you could give us more detail if you chose to.




Mr Dreyfus:
  No, I don't think you've read the proposal.




Mr LAMING:
  I accept that you may say there's more detail. Yes, correct. I think the nation is yet to see it.


But I want to go back to Griffith University and Transparency International. They gave two other options. They gave the fully fledged Commonwealth integrity commission, which gave new standards on not just the Public Service but the individual parts of it, and to work directly with IPEA. Instead of just fitting in and around existing groups, it would have more direct involvement in their work. But you are moving into over $100 million a year. It's a fair question to ask what the additional gains are at the margins in having these bodies over and above what we already have. We have the public sector at the moment complaining about multiple codes of conduct they have to adhere to. Many of them would say the problem is not a lack of investigative powers; it is actually too many layers of investigative powers and not being aware of which one the Public Service has to respond to. That too is a fair question.


For thinking contributors of this—and I regard the member for Denison as one and the member for Melbourne Ports probably not so much; he is probably a bit more party political about this—we need to ask whether we take a small step. And that was the third option provided by Griffith University: an integrity and anticorruption council, which simply coordinates through a statutory referral pathway all of these potentially concerning, albeit potentially corrupt, activities. These are many of the minor ones that have been mentioned already by the member for Denison— (Time expired)

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (15:47):  I always welcome the opportunity to talk about Labor's call for a national integrity commission but particularly right now. This is because in the last week, if we ever needed it, the evidence supporting a federal anticorruption body has grown stronger. I'm glad to be speaking on this topic today with members of the crossbench, which shows the depth of support that this proposal has within this parliament.


This week we've seen the allegations against the Minister for Home Affairs, which have not been denied, that he used the power of his office to help others gain employment with the Australian Border Force. I quote from The Sydney Morning Herald front page yesterday: 


Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton pressed then Customs chief Roman Quaedvlieg to help two Queensland policemen get jobs in the new Border Force agency Mr Dutton was setting up—a revelation set to escalate the political furore surrounding Mr Dutton’s decisions as immigration minister. One of the two policemen, Matt Stock, is a good friend of Mr Dutton’s, according to sources with knowledge of the events. The second man, John Lewis, is the son of corrupt former police commissioner Terry Lewis.


The Minister for Home Affairs has not denied the substance of these allegations, merely stating that he does not believe he has done anything improper.


These are serious allegations which cannot go unanswered. If the Minister for Home Affairs thinks he can just brush them off and move on, he is sorely mistaken. We are talking here about a minister who created a new agency, Border Force, and then helped two people from his old workplace get jobs in that agency. There are serious questions to answer, and the Minister for Home Affairs has not gone anywhere near to answering them.


As strong as this recent case is, the need for a national integrity commission was already there. In recent years there has been a loss of public faith in our Commonwealth institutions. Australia currently ranks 13th out of 176 countries on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index. That doesn't sound so bad, but we were sixth on that list just six years ago. In January 2018 a survey of federal public servants by the Australian Public Service Commission revealed that five per cent of respondents had seen misconduct in their workplaces, with cronyism and nepotism the most common charges. With scandal after scandal unfolding over recent years, many involving ministers of the Abbott and Turnbull governments, Labor believes it's time to do what we can to restore the public's faith and trust in their government. Every state and territory either has already established or is in the process of establishing an anticorruption body. It's time we held Commonwealth public officials to the same standard and created a single broad-based body to prevent corruption.


It's extremely disappointing to hear the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth of Australia continue to resist the establishment of a national integrity commission. I suppose it's what we should expect from the government that voted 26 times against the establishment of a royal commission into the banks, but it is disappointing to hear the specious reasons given by the Attorney-General for not backing the establishment of a national integrity commission. The Attorney-General said that the proposal Labor has put forward—and, I can reassure the member for Denison, remains absolutely committed to and will take to the next election—is a vague one, but the fact of the matter is that the proposal we have committed to contains seven detailed design principles. Rightly, in addition to those principles, we have said that the fine grain of the design of a national integrity commission of necessity has to be left to government, because the Commonwealth already has some focused anticorruption bodies, and any national integrity commission needs to mesh with those bodies, but the seven detailed design principles were put out there so that we wouldn't get the somewhat nonsensical answer from the Attorney-General that we hadn't given enough detail. I invite the Attorney-General and the government to re-examine the proposal and the seven detailed design principles Labor has put forward and, having re-examined, change their position and come together with Labor to establish a national integrity commission, because if ever there were an area in which bipartisanship is vital, it's this area.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2018-09-12,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (15:52):  I'm pleased to rise to support the comments of the Attorney-General on this matter of public importance. The Attorney-General was very specific. He said that he's not closed to this idea and that he's giving it some consideration, but he did rightfully express some concerns. The member for Denison talked about ICAC in New South Wales. Being from New South Wales, we've been able to read these headlines on the front pages of our papers for well over a decade. When it comes to ICAC in New South Wales, we would do well to remember what is known as Blackstone's formulation, which was named after Sir William Blackstone, the 18th century English jurist:


… better that ten guilty persons escape, than that one innocent party suffer.


Benjamin Franklin said something similar:


… it is better 100 guilty persons should escape than that one innocent Person should suffer …


That brings me to ICAC in New South Wales and the lessons that we can learn from ICAC. Yes, they have done some good work. The Eddie Obeid and Joe Tripodi investigations were good work done by ICAC. Recently we have seen ICAC's investigation, Operation Dasha, into corrupt local council activities, where there have been allegations of blackmail, secret commissions and dodgy rezonings. ICAC are doing good work in that.


However, that has not always been the case. The royal commissioner—this goes back 25 years—wrote about ICAC in ICAC: ABarrister's Perspective:


The ICAC will ultimately be effective only if its performance justifies its extraordinary powers. If the Commission is to justify those powers it must be scrupulously fair, value the rights of individuals and accept that persons should only be convicted after due process in the relevant court. The experience of the first twelve months is that as a result of ICAC’s actions … great harm has been done to many innocent people.


As an example of that harm, we only have to look at what was done to Margaret Cunneen. She was hauled over the coals by ICAC, and had agents on her doorstep in the early hours of the morning. After she had been through it, the Solicitor-General announced that there was no wrongdoing and that there would be no charges laid against her.


Five months after Margaret Cunneen was cleared, the ICAC inspector, the Hon. David Levine AO, RFD, QC, published his report on ICAC's attempted investigation into her. He labelled it a 'debacle', a 'grotesquerie' and the stuff of a family's 'worst nightmare'. He illustrated injustices of illegality and unjust and oppressive behaviour in the aborted investigation. He concluded:


Whatever was captured by happenstance as having been said or done by Ms Cunneen finds no support in reliable, credible or cogent material, let alone material elevated to constitute evidence, of any conduct on her part, let alone of her son or his girlfriend, warranting the intervention and intrusive exploration by one of the most powerful agencies of this State.


I do not think the case has yet been made out for a federal ICAC. We currently have the Australian Federal Police. We have the Australian Crime Commission. We have the Australian Public Service Code of Conduct and the ministerial code of conduct, enforced by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and the Australian Public Service Commission. Most of all, we have a fierce and independent media.


As for the case that the opposition argues about the Minister for Home Affairs, where two young female tourists from Europe on a tourist visa were given an extension because they were going to act as nannies—if that is the best that the Labor Party can come up with, then the case has simply not been made out for a federal ICAC. I'm encouraged by the comments of the Attorney-General that his mind is not closed to this issue. I thank the House.

"Sharkie, Rebekha, MP",CA,2018-09-12,"



Ms SHARKIE
 (Mayo) (15:57):  In an era of declining trust in politicians, it should be essential that the parliament support a commission which holds all politicians, their advisers and senior public servants to account. When the Attorney-General said that we are in the top 20, yes, he's correct; that's true. We're ranked 13th but we were sixth. We are behind. New Zealand is No. 1. Canada, the UK and Germany are all ranked above us.


From 2012 we have declined from 85 out of 100 points to just 77. The trajectory is not good. Here we are fighting hard for what I believe is such an obviously good idea, and yet, as on so many issues in this parliament, we are dragging the coalition government kicking and screaming to consider it. The Labor Party has at least come out in support of the idea of a national integrity commission. However, it has not provided as much detail as we would like to see about its model, nor has it given us any idea of a time frame of implementation. But at least it is a start.


Speaking of models, I'll now briefly explore the common guiding principles for any possible commission models that might be adopted. The most recent authority of investigation of the serious options for an Australian national integrity commission was found in the Griffith University paper—and the member for Bowman talked about the Griffith University paper—called A national integrity commission—options for Australia, which came out in August this year. I wish to commend Professor AJ Brown—I believe he's here in the chamber today—and his team, the three universities, and Transparency International Australia, on this paper. I encourage anyone who takes the idea of a national integrity commission seriously to read it in its entirety. I have relied heavily upon it for this speech.


The paper found that at a federal level there is currently no coordinated oversight of high-risk misconduct; most strategic areas of corruption risk are unsupervised; no coherent system-wide framework for corruption prevention; inadequate support for parliamentary and ministerial standards; low and uncertain levels of resourcing; public and private cross-jurisdictional challenges; and a lack of public accessibility, including a lack of public and private whistleblower support. In assessing the options there should be several guiding principles that should apply across the board. The National Integrity Commission should not just be a carbon copy of state commissions against corruption. At a federal level, we can do better. I understand that many members in this House see flaws in some of the state integrity commissions. That's fine; we can do better—we are the federal parliament. This is a chance for the federal government to lead.


This morning I spoke at a rally in support of Witness K and Bernard Collaery, his lawyer—a case that epitomises the importance of effective whistleblower protection for government employees who ventilate serious allegations of government criminality. How can it be, after what we know of this case, that we don't need a federal IBAC? There is a fact: the Australian government at the time in 2004 bugged the East Timor cabinet, and we did that as an Australian government for commercial gain. That to me would be the first matter that a federal IBAC should look at. We need to examine who was involved and who gave the orders. Any possible model that's adopted should also, and I quote from the paper, 'include strong accountability arrangements for the agencies involved, especially those exercising coercive investigation powers.' For example, at a parliamentary level, instead of a collection of specialist parliamentary committees, there would ideally be a single committee that exercises parliamentary oversight of all major integrity agencies.


I could talk at considerable length and for considerable time but I'm running out of time. The Australian people demand, expect and deserve more political accountability, and we should give it to them because no-one—and I mean no-one—should be above the law. I seek leave to table the paper referred to: Griffith University's A national integrity commission—options for Australia.

"Drum, Damian, MP",Nats,2018-09-12,"



Mr DRUM
 (Murray—Nationals Whip) (16:03):  In speaking to this motion, it must be very clearly enunciated from the outset that the Attorney-General is not against this concept. He is very, very clear in saying that, if you are going to develop an IBAC, it has to be done in the correct manner and in the right format. He's listed a litany of New South Wales examples where it seems to have not worked very well, but he's absolutely not ruling out that we should go down this path. What he's saying is that we need to go down this path with caution.


Another example where an IBAC is in place but it doesn't seem to be working very well is in Victoria. With the current government in Victoria they have an absolute litany of examples of frauds and misuse of public money. They have a litany of examples of misuse of resources, of taxpayers' money. We had a minister in Victoria who was using taxpayers' money to have his dogs chauffeured around the state. He thought it was a good use of money for him to organise his own personal chauffeur—that the taxpayer was paying for—to take the dogs out to the weekender and then bring the dogs back into town. The IBAC didn't seem to pick that up. Somehow or other the IBAC didn't have an interest in that sort of misuse of public money.


There was another issue in the Victorian parliament that was a misuse of public money where the Speaker in the Victorian parliament and the Deputy Speaker in the Victorian parliament, both long-term Labor people, both long-term senior Labor figures in Victoria, had made a meticulous decision, a longstanding decision, that they would claim that they were living in a caravan down at the beach, 90 kilometres away from the parliament, as their primary place of residence. Making this claim, for these senior Labor people in Victoria, meant that they were then entitled to about $28,000 per year over a number of years. Both of them misused over $100,000 of the taxpayers' money for their own personal gain, and again the IBAC didn't have anything to do.


It's interesting that Labor's lead speaker on this, who himself is a Victorian, happened to just overlook what you might call these errors of judgement—errors of judgement that lasted three years—from these senior Victorian Labor people in his own state. Again, the IBAC didn't inquire into or judge these misuses of Victorian taxpayers' money.


Of course, we then have the rorts-for-votes scandal, which was another $380,000 rip-off of the Victorian taxpayers. Again the IBAC had nothing to do with this. It was simply raised, and the Labor Party then spent over a million dollars in Victoria fighting to have an inquiry into this issue. The rorts in Victoria, the misuse of the taxpayers' money in Victoria, under a Labor Party government have been absolutely stunning. The theft, effectively, of taxpayers' money for their own purposes has just been incredibly brazen, for everybody to see.


And this is nothing to do with having to pay back $1.2 billion when you said that you would not cost the Victorian taxpayer one cent. In a sense, the Premier was probably right. He wasn't going to make anyone pay a cent for knocking back the East West Link. He made the Victorian taxpayer pay $1.2 billion for a road that now Infrastructure Victoria has listed as a priority road.


I think the Attorney-General is right that, if we're going to go down this path of putting in place a federal IBAC, we need to make sure it's done in a manner that will have some opportunity to catch some of these incredibly brazen and deceitful members of parliament. We can only beg to understand what was going through those senior Labor figures' minds when they thought it was okay to rip off Victorian taxpayers for the 'red shirts' campaign; it was okay to get your dog chauffeured around the state; and it was okay to tell lies about the fact that where you lived as a primary place of residence was a caravan at the beach.

Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (16:08):  I'd like to begin my speech by seeking permission to table these reports mentioned by my colleague the member for Mayo.


Leave granted.




Ms McGOWAN:
  Thank you very much. I welcome the comments from my colleague and neighbour the member for Murray and absolutely agree with him about the importance of having a national integrity commission to do all the things and address all the issues that need to be done. Like him, I'm a great believer in having fair, open and transparent government. An independent integrity commission is, in my opinion, a really important part of that. In my speech I'll outline what we do to seriously consider an overarching integrity and anticorruption commission and why it matters in my community, and I put a call out to the government to take steps towards strengthening the integrity of all our institutions.


One of the key principles, colleagues, that I use in this place when I'm making decisions and voting is: will it bring good governance? With that background, I don't do deals, and I don't do deals in exchange for confidence or supply, because that's not good governance. I fiercely hold on to my right to vote on every bit of legislation on its merits. The trust and faith of my electorate in this House and the work we do relies on my community trusting and having good faith in the integrity of our system. I support a process where we regularly reassess and strengthen the system of integrity and anticorruption in this country.


So why do we need an integrity commission? At the very least, we need a commission to provide coordination and oversight of the many anticorruption efforts of integrity agencies at the Commonwealth level and to link into the work of the state and territory jurisdictions. A federal commission will be in a position to fill the gaps in our current system, to ensure there are investigative powers and to expose corrupt conduct in the federal government and the public sector. We have seen that every state in Australia now has an anticorruption commission that operates alongside other state integrity agencies. They have uncovered many examples of systemic corruption and misconduct that were not found by existing agencies. So I can't be convinced that there's nothing to see here at the Commonwealth level. We only have to look at the impact of the royal commission into the banking sector to see the potential for misconduct to be exposed even when there are existing systems and regulators with oversight. I say let the sun shine in.


When compared with state governments, the federal government falls short. No agency can investigate alleged misconduct of members of parliament, ministers or the judiciary. The agencies which do have strong investigative powers, such as the Federal Police, can only use them when investigating criminal charges, and no agency holds regular public hearings. This means corruption and misconduct are not properly exposed to the public and the only avenue for public hearings is through parliament, and this is controlled by the numbers and the major parties. So I think it's no accident today that it's been the Independents and the crossbench that have brought on this MPI.


Why does it matter for my community? Corruption and misconduct not only undermine the integrity out of our democracy but have a direct impact on the everyday lives of all Australians. It undermines the delivery of government policy and the delivery of services to our communities.


Ultimately, we are all here at taxpayers' expense and we need to make sure the best interests of Australians are put first and foremost, so today I call upon the government. I call upon the government to take steps towards strengthening the integrity of all our institutions. If they're not willing to support the establishment of an independent integrity commissioner now, today, then tell us how they're going to go about establishing an integrity coordinator—someone or some organisation to work with existing integrity agencies to assess our systems of integrity and anticorruption to at least coordinate what we're already doing. This assessment would identify gaps. It would coordinate activities across government and interaction with the state commissions.

It has no mandate to deprive the citizens of this state of basic civil liberties such as a right to natural justice. It has no right to invade the confidentiality of proper solicitor-client relationships. It has no right to invade the privacy or the confidentiality of the confessional. It has no right to muzzle the media. It has no right to prevent adequate parliamentary scrutiny by the proposed joint parliamentary committee and it has no right to protect the commission from debate and criticism in parliament by abrogating the ancient privileges of this parliament and its members. It has no right to set up an ""Australian gestapo"", as the President of the New South Wales Bar Association has aptly described it.' Those words are from the distinguished Labor icon and former New South Wales Treasurer Michael Egan in the debate on the first ICAC bill in 1988. Mr Egan's comments have proved prescient in relation to the performance of ICAC over the years.


It's with regret that I have to say that a number of the examples that have been given to us by the crossbench and by those opposite have underscored some of the problems of ICAC. Sometimes, to the man with a hammer, every problem is a nail, and so every government problem, it might be said, needs some sort of commission of inquiry or needs a standing ICAC-type body to solve it. Of a couple of the examples that the member for Denison gave us, his first example, the Australian Wheat Board, was, it is to be remembered, the subject of a very extensive royal commission: the oil-for-food inquiry. As for his second main example, in relation to the RBA banknotes scandal, there have now been some prosecutions in relation to that, and on 21 May 2018—a quick Google search demonstrated this—the former RBA officer Clifford Gerathy pleaded guilty to offences relating to that note-printing scandal. So it's not as if things get swept under the carpet. There are proper processes and proper mechanisms at the federal level to deal with such issues.


The member for Melbourne made much of the case of Eddie Obeid and Ian Macdonald, and isn't it wonderful that they've gone to jail, and isn't it wonderful that ICAC has done its job in relation to the two of them. I just want to compare and contrast the performance of the New South Wales ICAC inquiry into Ian Macdonald and Eddie Obeid and its performance in relation to two Liberal premiers, Nick Greiner and Barry O'Farrell. Nick Greiner and Barry O'Farrell were as honest as the day is long. They have high reputations in the community today, even having been found in breach by ICAC's particular findings. But all ICAC has managed to do in a political sense is to end the careers of two good, honest Liberal premiers. Yet—despite the fact the Labor Party ran government in New South Wales for 16 years—it was only after the Labor Party had left office that it finally did anything about Eddie Obeid and Ian Macdonald. So there is a complete lack of a level playing field in relation to the performance of ICAC. That's why, in some respects, those on our side of the House are very concerned about a federal facsimile of ICAC—that is, given the highly partisan experience in New South Wales.


David Levine, the former Inspector of ICAC, talked about the undeserved trashing of reputations that happens at ICAC. He said in his report: 'The reality is there's no appeal, in the generally understood meaning of that word, from a finding of ""serious corrupt conduct"".' Think of the number of people who have been found corrupt at ICAC and have then had those findings overturned, whether it is former SES Commissioner Kear, who was found to have engaged in corrupt conduct by ICAC but was later acquitted by the court; John Booth, the publisher, who was found to have lied to ICAC but then was found not guilty in the local court; or, as the Attorney-General spoke to us of today in his contribution to this debate, the celebrated case—or lamented case—of Margaret Cunneen, the highly regarded New South Wales prosecutor, in which the High Court found that the New South Wales ICAC had exceeded its powers in relation to its findings of corrupt conduct there. The nature of these bodies is that they trash reputations, first, and they overstep their powers. Nick Greiner, who established ICAC, had a few things to say about the nature of ICAC. He said this:


The problem from the start was the lack of high-quality commissioners and high-quality counsel assisting.


I think it was former High Court Judge Ian Callinan who once said, 'television cameras and lawyers are not a good mix'. And that's the problem with all of these bodies. The problem is they're often not really about finding corrupt conduct; they're about creating headlines for lawyers, and sensationalism. That's the important thing here. I think we need to be very careful before we go down this route.

Mr HART
 (Bass) (16:28):  Slavery is one of the most heinous, most offensive human rights abuses possible. However, shamefully, it is not something consigned to the history books despite the conflicts which featured slavery and anti-slavery forces at their core, including the American Civil War, and despite the high aspirations of the abolitionists of the 19th century. There are more people trapped in slavery in the world today than there have been at any time in human history. This has to be a shocking statistic. Walk Free Foundation estimates that there are approximately 40.3 million victims of modern slavery worldwide. Two-thirds of these people are in the Asia-Pacific region, many of them stuck in the global supply chains of products and services that Australians use every day. We, each of us, are part of the problem supporting slavery and we can be instrumental in providing a solution. 


Trafficking and slavery are occurring right here in Australia, in our suburbs and in our communities. The fact that this is happening should not be concealed. According to the Attorney-General's Department, between 2004 and 31 December 2015, the Australian Federal Police took 619 referrals for human trafficking, slavery and slavery-like practices. We cannot and should not tolerate either worker exploitation or human rights abuses. Walk Free Foundation estimates that there are thousands of people trapped in slavery right here in Australia that need our help and assistance.


The word 'slavery' conjures certain images from long ago, but there is a very modern face of slavery here in Australia that is represented in our communities in a number of ways. Modern slavery can include control of movement; control of a physical environment; psychological control; measures taken to prevent or deter escape; force; threat of force; coercion or deception; assertion of exclusivity; power to use services without commensurate compensation; subjection to cruel treatment and abuse; control of sexuality; and forced labour. We simply must do more to prevent these practices and these types of practices. They need to be reported and called out. An effective, strong, modern slavery act is a key part of that battle.


The bill that we have before us, the Modern Slavery Bill 2018, would establish a modern slavery reporting requirement to require certain large businesses and other entities in Australia to make an annual public statement on their actions to address modern slavery risks in their operations and supply chains. This is a positive development and deserves the support of this House. However, the government has refused to include in this bill penalties for companies that breach the proposed modern slavery act, and have chosen to have what is described as a business engagement unit instead of an independent antislavery commissioner, both of which were contemplated under a Labor policy and the model it proposed. This weak commitment to the most laudable policy objective is disappointing but hardly surprising from a government that has showed itself time and again to be utterly toothless and completely lacking ambition when it comes to regulating big business. Most recently, they've been distracted by their own internal shemozzle and disputes.


This weak commitment to this most laudable objective, as I said, is disappointing, but it's particularly disappointing in that over a year ago Labor announced its own modern slavery policy. Our policy announcement included a commitment to establishing a modern slavery act with a transparency in supply chain mechanism which contained penalties for noncompliance and an independent antislavery commissioner. When we announced this policy we called on the government to match our commitment because tackling slavery should be above politics. We all have good reason to make that call-out. Our policy was warmly greeted by business, civil society and the union movement. As a consequence, we've moved amendments to this bill to introduce penalties for companies that fail to comply with the modern slavery act. We'll be calling on the government to establish an office of an independent antislavery commissioner.


Labor was impressed during the development of our policy with the extensive feedback that we got after an extensive consultation process with business and civil society. Labor continues to be impressed by the genuine passion within both the business community and the broader community, and the commitment to fight slavery. The overwhelming majority of stakeholders who gave evidence to the Senate inquiry tasked with investigating the matter, including the Human Rights Law Centre, the Law Council of Australia and Oxfam, called for penalties to be a key part of this bill. This government can and must do better to tackle this appalling human rights abuse. It is an absolute imperative that any modern slavery act should have penalties for noncompliance. This should be self-evident. It cannot be left to big business alone to police themselves on this important issue. 


There are concerns that some companies would not comply with the bill in its current form. There's some instruction from overseas as to that issue. In fact, evidence provided to the Senate inquiry into this bill shows that in the UK, where there are no penalties, the percentage of businesses that reported—and who supposedly have an obligation to do so—still hovers at around 30 per cent of those. If it's an obligation, it shouldn't be limited to only 30 per cent of people complying. This is not good enough. We have an obligation to do better. Combating slavery should not be optional. There is no excuse for a culture of not looking and not asking. 


In their submission to the Senate inquiry, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the ACTU, noted that: 


The absence of sanctions seriously undermines the effectiveness of the reporting requirements for the purposes of fighting modern slavery. 


Further, the ACTU argued:


In order to make any difference to the lives of workers in Australia and abroad, the Modern Slavery Act must act as a serious motivator for companies to start acting upon the values expressed in their statements and guidelines and provide an effective deterrent for those who fall short of their obligations.


Hence, any Australian legislation enacted should include a strong enforcement mechanism imposing penalties on companies that do not comply with due diligence and reporting requirements. 


Similarly, the organisation Anti Slavery Australia, has said, as to this issue:


There have been gaps identified in this ‘market disclosure-based’ regulatory approach. Market disclosure is a weak regulatory tool for a variety of reasons, including the fact that consumers may fail to understand the implications of the disclosures, fail to collect the full range of pertinent information, or lack the resources or expertise to fully research issues. Furthermore, consumers’ decisions may continue shaped by economic considerations, rather than adverse human trafficking or slavery disclosures. There is also limited empirical evidence concerning the effect of ethical considerations on consumer behaviour. On the contrary, research has shown that only between 3% and 10% of consumers are willing to modify their purchasing decisions based on social or environmental criteria.  


Moreover, the same organisation continued on to say: 


As such, market-regulated disclosure legislation is not appropriate in situations where the risks associated with certain activities is not catastrophic or likely to give rise to grave consequences. Without an adequate penalty or sanction to deter non-compliance with reporting obligations, there is little incentive for organisations to engage with supply chain transparency. The serious risk of criminal slavery and human trafficking being supported and hidden by complex supply chains necessitates a stronger regulatory framework.


Penalties for noncompliance of reporting obligations are a key part of Labor's policy, as is the establishment of an office of an independent antislavery commissioner. We need an independent commissioner to assist victims, not just a support unit for big business. I say again: victims deserve an independent commissioner for their assistance, particularly having regard to their weak position. The government's decision to walk away from an independent commissioner in exchange for a business engagement unit shows that their primary concern is, as always, protecting big business.


There are, according to the statistics that I've seen, an estimated 4,300 people trapped in slavery in Australia. But, as Senate estimates last year revealed, we only have had seven slavery convictions in half a decade—4,300 people trapped in slavery but only seven convictions. We urgently need a commissioner to help victims and to crack down on this sickening crime. Victims of modern slavery are often incredibly vulnerable and face cultural, social, economic and language barriers. 


There are also significant gaps in the support services we provide for victims of modern slavery. A commissioner would assist to remedy these gaps in enforcement, help victims and work with civil society to help prevent and detect slavery in Australia. Key stakeholders, including ACRATH, Anti-Slavery Australia and the ACTU, have joined Labor in the call for the establishment of the independent antislavery commissioner. The Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia, for example, in their submission to the Senate inquiry argued that the creation of an independent antislavery commissioner would be vital to securing the cooperation of key stakeholders and increasing successful outcomes. Certainly evidence in the first year after the UK established via legislation its independent antislavery commissioner showed that more victims were identified, more proactive and reactive police investigations were undertaken, more prosecutions and convictions were achieved, judicial awareness was notably increasing and more training was put in place.


Key stakeholders and well-respected independent voices have added powerful support to the proposition advanced by Labor that I'm putting here today. Fiona McLeod SC has stated: 'It is critical that someone independent of government with the capacity to speak to government, NGOs, unions and business holds the office of antislavery commissioner. In-house public servants providing information to the public with no compulsory powers will be inherently weaker and less effective than the creation of an independent officer. Evidence presented through the Modern Slavery Act inquiry process shows that Australia is a world leader in antislavery laws. But the awareness of the laws is low, enforcement is weak—certainly the existence of only seven prosecutions shows that—and there are gaps in communication between civil society and criminal frameworks despite efforts to reduce these.'


Labor has set, in my submission, the standard for a policy. The amendments that we propose to this legislation, I think, make right the deficiencies within this bill. Labor will be fighting to ensure that Australia gets a modern slavery act that will actually make a difference.


In closing, I'd like to add again to the submissions that were made and the public comments that have been made by civil society in connection with this issue of modern slavery. I speak as a former President of the Law Society of Tasmania and a member of the Law Council of Australia. I think that this parliament should listen to the representations made by organisations like the Law Council of Australia. The Law Council of Australia strongly supports the fact that we need tougher penalties in this legislation and we need the independence of that antislavery commissioner. It's vitally important that we consider that this has operation not just within Australia but also within the supply chains that apply to these large corporations. This is something that is a national and international scandal. We have an opportunity to do something about it. We should do it now.

"Kearney, Ged, MP",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Ms KEARNEY
 (Batman) (16:43):  I'm incredibly proud to rise today to speak on the Modern Slavery Bill 2018. As the ACTU president, I had the honour of standing with the member for Hotham to support her announcement over a year ago of Labor's commitment to a modern slavery act. I thank the member for Hotham for the work and time she's put into this issue.


I am proud the Labor Party has led the way with this. Tackling slavery and exploitation is core to our mission. If we are honest, we are only here today debating this bill because the government succumbed to Labor's leadership and pressure. But, like with so many other issues, the government has produced watered-down, less-effective legislation. If the government is going to follow Labor's lead, I wish they'd do it properly.


The bill seeks to establish a modern slavery reporting requirement to require certain large businesses and other entities in Australia to make public on an annual basis their actions to address modern slavery risks in their operations and supply chains. This is long overdue and welcome news, but there are two crucial elements to tackling slavery that this bill is missing: penalties for noncompliance and the introduction of an independent antislavery commissioner. These were put forward by Labor in our modern slavery act, an announcement which was warmly greeted by business, union and civil society stakeholders. Labor is proposing amendments so that the bill includes penalties and an independent antislavery commissioner. These amendments force companies to take seriously their obligations regarding due diligence in their supply chain. If the government won't support them, it will prove they are not serious about tackling the scourge of modern slavery.


In my previous role as president of the ACTU I worked with the Labor government on their modern slavery policy. Through this process and my own personal experience in the union movement I learned about the extent and horror of modern slavery. It's not a faraway issue or a distant problem. It's not someone else's issue; it's our issue. There are more people trapped in slavery in the world today than ever before. The Walk Free Foundation estimates that there are 40.3 million victims of modern slavery worldwide. Two-thirds of these poor people are in our region, the Asia-Pacific region, many of them stuck in the global supply chains of products and services which Australians use every day.


Figures vary with respect to the number of people enslaved in Australia. The Global Slavery Index estimates that there could be around 15,000 people currently trapped in modern slavery right here in Australia. Trafficking and slavery are occurring in our suburbs and communities. That should shock people. When people think of slaves their minds take them to past notions of slavery as an issue which perhaps has been solved. This could not be further from the truth. Research shows that those high-risk areas and industries where workers are most likely to be held in slave-like conditions in Australia are, not surprisingly, industries that engage workers on employer sponsored visa arrangements, where temporary low-skilled migrant workers are trapped far away from home. These workers are vulnerable to forced labour exploitation, starting with exploitation by those who facilitate their journey to Australia.


According to the 2018 Global Slavery Index those industries that are high risk for forced labour include agriculture, construction, domestic work, meat processing, cleaning, hospitality and food services. There are red flags for identifying victims of modern slavery. These include workers being housed in substandard accommodation, illegal pay deductions for food or rent, situations of debt bondage, confiscation of passports and pay well below the minimum wage. There have even been cases of exploitation of domestic workers who have endured and escaped conditions of modern slavery in diplomatic households right here in Canberra.


Individuals reported withholding of passports, working excessive hours, low wages and threats to themselves or even to their family back home as well as restrictions on their movement. The majority of modern slavery victims identified by authorities to date have been women from Asia who have been exploited within the sex industry. While modern slavery occurs within Australia, the realities of global trade and business make it inevitable that products bought, sold and consumed here have been brought about by enslaved workers just off our shores. The offshore industries most likely to engage in modern slave labour are those involved in making laptops, computers, mobile phones, apparel and clothing, fish products like tinned tuna, and rice and cocoa.


Australia has a big role to play in fixing this issue. As a country, as a parliament, we simply must do more to prevent this practice. An effective, strong, modern slavery act is a key part of that battle, which is why it is so disappointing that the government has put forward a modern slavery bill without penalties for companies that fail to comply with the act's requirements. This is an incredibly serious misstep, though it's no surprise coming from a government who constantly kowtows to big business.


Essentially, the government is setting up a scheme that provides a written obligation for companies to do something with no penalties if they don't comply. Companies will be free to decide if they can comply with this or not. That's not good enough. If the royal commission into the financial sector has taught us anything, it is that self-regulation and self-reporting are a farce and don't work. We cannot trust big business to police themselves on slavery within their own business or supply chains. I note with interest that the NAB, one of the star witnesses at the banking royal commission, which has been setting the bar lower and lower every day with allegations of misconduct including charging deceased people fees, does not support the key plank of Labor's amendments—that is, the introduction of an antislavery commissioner. Do we really believe a simple self-report mechanism will work with these big businesses? Evidence provided to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill showed that in the UK, where there were no penalties, the percentage of businesses that have reported still hovers around 30 per cent of those who have an obligation to do so. I'm sorry, but that is not good enough. As the ACTU said in their submission:


In order to make any difference to the lives of workers in Australia and abroad, the Modern Slavery Act must act as a serious motivator for companies to start acting upon the values expressed in their statements and guidelines and provide an effective deterrent for those who fall short of their obligations.


Hence, any Australian legislation enacted should include a strong enforcement mechanism imposing penalties on companies that do not comply with due diligence and reporting requirements.


The risk of noncompliance is real and high and it is obvious that this would severely undermine the effectiveness of the act and the goal to help eliminate modern slavery in supply chains. If the government want to be serious about tackling modern slavery, they must support Labor's amendments. If they do not, they just prove to the Australian people that once again they are utterly toothless when it comes to regulating big business, which brings us to our second point about how the government has completely fluffed this legislation, which lacks the establishment of an office of an independent antislavery commissioner. Rather, the government intends to establish a modern slavery business engagement unit within the Department of Home Affairs. A unit buried deep in the department, charged with engaging with reporting entities, will not be able to fulfil all the tasks that would make the act effective.


It is critical that someone independent of government, with the capacity to speak out to government, NGOs, unions and business, holds the role of the antislavery commissioner. In Senate estimates last year, it was revealed we have only had seven slavery convictions in half a decade. As I mentioned before, the prevalence of modern slavery is far greater than that. We urgently need a commissioner to help victims and crackdown on this sickening crime. In the United Kingdom, the independence of the commissioner has been vital in ensuring cooperation from business and in addressing labour exploitation in creative and proactive ways. This has increased reporting of breaches of the act, victim identification and, ultimately, successful prosecutions. The role of the commissioner as someone who can engage with victims of slavery is incredibly important.


Victims are incredibly vulnerable and face cultural, social, economic and language barriers in wresting themselves free from their situation. They often have a mistrust and fear of police and government authority in general, which is why so many of my colleagues in the union movement have been the ones coming across these workers and trying to advocate for them and for justice. Union organisers are close to the workplace and workers. They build up trust and camaraderie over time, which is vital in helping the victims of forced labour to come forward and speak up. The unions show empathy and compassion and, sadly, often find themselves unable to properly advocate for these workers. In fact, comrades in the CFMEU have been fined for going on site to help workers caught in situations like this. The fact of the matter is the organisers can encourage the use of and provide explanation of the role of an independent commissioner, a concept that hopefully the workers will be more likely to engage with.


There are also significant gaps in the support services we provide for victims of modern slavery. As the entrapped victims are mostly from foreign countries, language is a massive issue and interpreters are essential. Many of them have no understanding of their rights as workers, of what their pay and conditions should be, of occupational health and safety, of the industrial relations issues with respect to representation or even joining a union. They have no idea of who to go to for help. They may not even understand the banking system or payment modes or what the employer can charge them for rent or food and so on.


We have a responsibility, to workers in this country, for their safety and to ensure they know their rights and can have them enforced. A commissioner would assist to remedy these gaps, help victims and work with civil society to help prevent and detect slavery in Australia. The government's decision to walk away from independent commissioner in exchange for a business engagement unit shows that their primary concern is, as always, protecting big business with little regard for the real barriers the victims face.


In Labor's amendments, we propose that the commissioner will also lead our global efforts to fight slavery, including working with other countries and international organisations. It's incredibly important that the government agrees to this. If we are to have any impact on modern slavery in the global supply chains, we will need global cooperation and international instruments.


I was a delegate to the International Labour Conference for many years and had the honour of being elected to the governing body of the ILO. I have seen firsthand the importance of international cooperation and globally negotiated instruments, like standards and conventions, in combating serious issues, like slavery, and in enforcing rights around the world. Indeed, I've had the pleasure and honour of negotiating a number of these with employers and governments, but I also know that working domestically is just as important.


As I said, I am very proud to speak on this legislation today. It is long overdue. It acknowledges that modern slavery is occurring in our region because of our products and it's our responsibility to fix it. If the government supports Labor's amendments, it will be a bill we can trust will actually go much further to address that responsibility.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Modern Slavery Bill 2018</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (16:57):  Labor is proud to have led on the issue of modern slavery in Australia. Our proposal for a modern slavery act made by the shadow minister for justice, the member for Hotham, in June 2017, has finally prompted the government to act. We welcome the fact that the government has introduced this bill, the Modern Slavery Bill 2018.


Modern slavery is a horrific problem that is more prevalent in our society than many realise. It's estimated by the Walk Free Foundation that there are 40.3 million victims of modern slavery worldwide. Two-thirds of those people are in the Asia-Pacific, where many of the products we buy every day are made. It's fair to say that many Australians would not be aware of the extent of this problem, but modern slavery occurs both in our region and here in Australia—on our streets and in our homes. In fact, there are an estimated 4,300 people trapped in slavery in Australia right now. It's time to do something about that and to take as tough an approach as we can. With this in mind, Labor supports the intent of this bill but believes it can be so much better than it currently is.


Currently, this bill imposes a modern slavery reporting requirement which applies to businesses with revenues of more than $100 million a year which are based in Australia or operate in Australia. It requires the company to make a modern slavery statement once a year which details: the entity's structure, operations and supply chains; the modern slavery risks in the entity's operations and supply chains; the actions the entity has taken to assess and address those risks, including due diligence and remediation processes; and how the entity assesses the effectiveness of those actions. This is good detail. However, there is one large problem with the government's proposed bill: this requirement is not enforced in any way. Companies are free to completely ignore this statutory requirement and will face no penalty. In sum, it is a completely toothless law.


I think it says everything about how this government approaches big business. They are too cosy with their big business mates. They are so frightened of standing up to them that they will not even stand up for a cause as important as this. When it comes to regulating big business, this government are just hopeless. We saw it first in their ongoing refusal to hold a royal commission into the financial services sector until the banks asked them for it, and then of course they said yes. They are in the middle of an apparent fight to the death—goodness knows why—to give their big business mates an $80 billion tax cut. Is it surprising that they would commit to the virtue signal of modern slavery reporting requirements without being willing to enforce compliance? Of course not. It's just another part of their pattern of cosying up to their big business mates. On an issue as important as this, we should not leave it to big business to police themselves. Evidence proves it. In the United Kingdom, where they also do not have penalties for not meeting reporting requirements, only 30 per cent of eligible businesses comply.


By contrast, Labor is committed to strong penalties for noncompliance. Labor wants to see the following added to this bill: firstly, a civil penalty provision for failure to report, with an immediate start date, with 1,000 penalty units to apply; secondly, a civil penalty provision for submitting an inadequate report, with a delayed start date of two years from the date on which the bill receives royal assent, also with 1,000 penalty units to apply; and, thirdly, a requirement that the minister report annually to the parliament on the companies that have failed to comply with the act. We will move amendments to the bill to this effect, and we urge the crossbench to join with us to ensure that the good intent of this bill is made real.


Another very disappointing element of the government's bill is the absence of an office of an independent antislavery commissioner, as Labor has proposed. Instead, the government is proposing, if you can believe it, something called a modern slavery business engagement unit inside the Department of Home Affairs to support Australian businesses under the new laws. It all sounds very friendly, doesn't it? But it is completely the wrong way around. We want a body to assist victims, not to assist businesses. We want a body that supports victims, not businesses. We want a body to identify issues, if necessary, publicly; not an engagement unit buried within a huge department with, as I understand it, some 23,000 employees. Like so often with the coalition, their priorities are completely wrong. Labor's model of a commissioner would be independent. A commissioner would take a holistic approach to the problem of modern slavery, looking at gaps in law enforcement, encouraging cultural change and examining support services, among other things. A commissioner would play a public advocacy role, help victims and work with civil society to help prevent and detect slavery in Australia.


I met with the former United Kingdom Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner, Kevin Hyland OBE, in May this year. Though that position has not been without its problems, Mr Hyland played a vital role in the three years he was commissioner in the United Kingdom. Mr Hyland's position was created, I would note, under a conservative government. Among his achievements, Mr Hyland lists an over 100 per cent increase in the identification of potential victims referred for support, an unprecedented uplift in policing operations, training for the judiciary and a significant increase in public awareness, including a four-month campaign with two newspapers. Mr Hyland also played a regional and global role, including working with the United Kingdom's trading partners and undertaking advocacy at the United Nations. I left my meeting with Mr Hyland in no doubt of the need for Australia to have its own independent antislavery commissioner.


For the government to look at the achievements of Mr Hyland, as I assume they did, and for the government to have looked at the model proposed by Labor for an independent antislavery commissioner and then to suggest that it will be good enough to have a business engagement unit buried in the Department of Home Affairs is simply laughable. Come on! Are they really so blinded by their devotion to big business that they cannot see that their real priorities should be the victims of modern slavery instead? Labor calls on the government, in the strongest possible terms, to establish an office of an independent antislavery commissioner. The bill would be incomplete without it.


Finally, this government has, oddly and unnecessarily, conflated the issue of forced marriage with modern slavery in this bill. They are related, of course, but entirely separate in terms of how they should be tackled as issues. In fact Labor has an entirely separate policy on tackling the issue of forced marriage. As the shadow minister for justice, the member for Hotham, said when we announced our policy in June this year:


Forced marriage is an abuse of human rights.


It can create 'a structure through which subjugation, abuse and sexual assault can occur over decades'. She said:


A failure to adequately prevent, address and respond to this practice is a failure to protect individuals—including young people and children—from crime and abuse.


Labor's policy to stamp out forced marriage in Australia includes the introduction of forced-marriage protection orders, which will ensure civil protections are available to help all persons at risk of forced marriage, not limited by age. Labor would also provide an additional $2.25 million to civil society groups over four years to adequately resource the key organisations working on the ground to support victims.


Bizarrely, the government has brought forced marriage under the definition of the forms of modern slavery required to be reported on by business. Do not get me wrong: Labor supports efforts to eliminate modern slavery from Australia—it is an abhorrent practice—but requiring businesses to inquire after the marriage status and private lives of their employees is surely not the way to go about it. In fact, this could be completely counterproductive, forcing victims further into hiding. An advocacy group, Good Shepherd, stated in its submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill:


Ordinarily it is not the role of business to inquire into the private lives of its employees, contractors or suppliers (or employees of its contractors) in order to identify practices such as forced marriage. If we liken the practice of forced marriage to that of family violence, corporate responsibility lies with supporting the wellbeing of individuals impacted by violence, not in identification and reporting on violence.


I would urge the government to seriously rethink this part of the bill and focus on introducing a separate, strong, forced-marriage policy of its own.


In sum, we in Labor are glad the government has finally acted on the issue of modern slavery. It's important that tackling this ghastly problem has bipartisan support. If necessary, we will support even the government's partial solution in the form of this bill. But the government can and must do better. We cannot rely on self-policing in an area as important as this. Penalties are necessary. I urge the government to support our amendments to this bill.

Dr ALY
 (Cowan) (17:08):  I think that, if you spoke to most people about slavery, the perception that they would have is that slavery was something that ended in the 19th century with the abolition of slavery. In 2013, when I was establishing a not-for-profit, non-government organisation, I consulted with Walk Free, which has done some fabulous work in modern slavery, about what some of the challenges were in establishing their not-for-profit. Back then, which is five years ago now, they spoke to me about how increasing awareness of modern slavery and what modern slavery is was probably the first horizon of the work that they needed to do, because there was such a lack of information but also a lack of awareness about what modern slavery actually constitutes. For me to stand up here in parliament five years on and speak in support of a Modern Slavery Act is actually quite momentous when you consider that, just five years ago, it was my very first time to hear about modern slavery, particularly in speaking with a not-for-profit, non-government organisation that dealt in that area. Modern slavery is a term that we use to refer to a whole range of exploitive practices that include slavery and slavery-like conditions such as debt bondage, servitude, forced marriage, forced labour and human trafficking, also referred to as trafficking in persons.


Most recently a global estimate—and it's only ever an estimate, because it's difficult to collect data on this—of the extent of modern slavery was that on any given day around 40 million people around the world are victims of modern slavery. Compared to this global phenomenon the estimated prevalence of modern slavery in Australia is relatively low, but it does exist here in Australia. There are victims of modern slavery here in Australia, but it is more likely that modern slavery exists in the supply chains for goods and services sold here in Australia and by Australian companies. This bill goes some way in attempting to address this, but I have some reservations, as have been expressed by my other colleagues from this side of the House, about just how far and how effective this bill is, and I'll talk about them in a minute.


The bill requires that entities based or operating in Australia prepare annual statements on potential modern slavery risks in their operations and supply chains and the steps that they've taken to address those risks. Labor's support for this bill is fundamentally about the desperate need for a modern slavery act. As a starting point this bill indicates an awareness of modern slavery and a willingness to at least define modern slavery, but it doesn't go far enough. Several members from this side of the House have spoken about the shortfalls in the bill and the amendments that Labor has put forward to ensure that this bill is impactful and effects much-needed change in addressing modern slavery.


This bill has a couple of particularly worrying shortfalls. The first is to do with compliance measures. There are no penalties for any of the companies that are found to be utilising modern slavery in their supply chains. On top of that, compliance with the provisions of the bill is voluntary. You don't have to comply, and if you do not comply then there are no penalties for that. Many of the civil society stakeholders have argued that, without any kinds of compliance measures, the supposedly mandatory reporting requirements in the bill are effectively made voluntary. I'll give you some quotes about why this is so important:


The Law Council considers that without penalties, a mandatory reporting requirement is rendered merely aspirational—


We hear a lot about aspiration from that side of the House, don't we? Perhaps this is what they mean—


as there is no enforcement mechanism, nor any consequence for non-compliance.


…   …   …




While the Law Council appreciates that there may be reputational costs for non-compliance, the ability and willingness of civil society to identify non-compliant entities, the media to expose them, and consumers to react appropriately, are easily overstated. In addition, reputational risk does not apply equally to all entities, but mostly to consumer-facing entities.



The Human Rights Law Centre pointed to the low rate of compliance with the UK scheme in making their case for penalties for noncompliance. They said:


… the failure to include penalties for non-compliance in the UK has led to extremely low rates of reporting … and even fewer reporting against all of the recommended criteria. It is clear that the threat of reputational damage alone is not a sufficient incentive to ensure compliance, particularly for businesses whose public profile, scale, services or products are not reputation-sensitive.


Even the UK's Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner stated in April 2018 that compliance with the UK act's reporting requirements had been 'patchy at best'. He said:


While some companies are showing leadership, others are producing generic statements with little substantive detail or failing to produce them at all. In 2017, 43 of the FTSE 100 failed to be compliant with the basic requirements of this legislation.


If this is the model before us, if this is the example that we have before us, why wouldn't we learn from the mistakes and shortfalls of the UK legislation, really take this seriously and include compliance in this bill?


Instead, what this government has proposed is some kind of fluffy, friendly engagement unit based within the Department of Home Affairs. I'm not quite sure what any kind of engagement unit would do, but I think that several members have spoken quite strongly on the fact that this setting up of an engagement unit shows very much that this government's focus is on appeasing business rather than looking after and looking out for the victims of modern slavery. That's very clear, and I'd like to reiterate that here. The second of those shortfalls is that the bill doesn't provide for an independent antislavery commissioner and doesn't require the government to publish a list of entities required to report, which would actually greatly assist in identifying any entities that failed to report.


On the topic of the antislavery commissioner, I find it quite interesting because there have been a number of inquiries since I've been in this parliament—at least two that I've found—that make recommendations around a modern slavery act and recommendations about how we should approach this scourge of modern slavery as well as our responsibilities around that. One of them comes out of the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, which undertook an inquiry into human trafficking as well as antislavery provisions; it was on human trafficking and slavery. They made several recommendations in their report—I'm a member of that committee—I'll go through a couple of them.


One of them is that the committee recommended that the Commonwealth government increase the number of Australian Federal Police officers with specialised human trafficking and antislavery training in all states and territories. Well, I don't see the government doing any of that! It recommended that the government expand training for frontline staff employed by the AFP, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection—which would now be Home Affairs—and the Fair Work Ombudsman with respect to Commonwealth offences, divisions 270 and 271 of the Criminal Code Act 1995.


It also recommended that the Commonwealth government considered appointing an antislavery and trafficking commissioner to monitor the implementation of the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking and Slavery 2015–19; to provide recommendations, advice and guidance; and to oversee the effectiveness of Commonwealth legislation and policies intended to reduce the prevalence of human trafficking, slavery and slavery-like practices and respond to corresponding offences. It makes a number of other recommendations, particularly with regard to strengthening visa protections, but, quite interestingly, all of those recommendations are about looking after victims. They have a focus on victims and have a focus on doing something substantive to actually stop modern slavery.


The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade had an inquiry into establishing a modern slavery act in Australia. The report is called Hidden in plain sight. Guess what this inquiry recommended? It recommended the introduction of a modern slavery act. Okay. It also recommended provisions for an independent antislavery commissioner; mandatory supply chain reporting that requires certain entities to report on modern slavery risks; measures to support victims of modern slavery, including establishing a national compensation scheme; and measures to improve criminal justice responses to modern slavery. It recommends that the Australian government establish an independent antislavery commissioner under the proposed modern slavery act with powers and resources to undertake several functions, including the overseeing and implementation of a national action plan; investigation and compliance; support services to victims; education guidance and awareness training for government agencies; engaging with government and entities on the implementation and operation of supply chain reporting; collecting and analysing data; undertaking legislated reviews of the proposed modern slavery act at least every three years; improving coordination between criminal justice agencies; providing advice on how to improve the modern slavery act et cetera.


It's quite confounding that the government has come up with a modern slavery act that really only touches the tip of the iceberg, that does not go far enough and that does not provide for any kind of substantive action to address the issue of modern slavery—an issue that I earlier said affects 40 million people worldwide and that we know Australian companies are partaking in through their supply chains. It really does nothing to address that at all.


In closing, I reiterate, firstly, our support for the principle of a modern slavery act. It's been a long time coming, and we welcome that. Secondly, I also record my disappointment that this act does not go far enough and that this government hasn't heeded any of the recommendations of inquiries and reports that have been undertaken by this parliament. I reiterate again that, on the amendments put forward by Labor to strengthen the act, including around compliance and for a modern antislavery commissioner, we would be willing to work with the government on achieving those and on achieving real, effective change and effective responses to modern slavery.

"Keogh, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Mr KEOGH
 (Burt) (17:23):  I rise also to speak on the Modern Slavery Bill. When we think about slavery, often this brings to mind images of workers in fields suffering terrible abuse at the hands of their masters and being marched across deserts, and images of chained hands and scars from lashings. Growing up in late 20th century Australia, this is what comes to mind—historical injustices. You wouldn't immediately consider working in a family restaurant in Northbridge as a form of slavery. You wouldn't expect working as a brickie in Southern River as a form of slavery. You certainly wouldn't expect a new marriage in Australia to be shrouding exploitation.


It is reprehensible that there are more people trapped in slavery in the world today than there have been at any other time in human history. The Walk Free Foundation estimates that there are more than 40 million victims of modern slavery in the world today. Right here in Australia, I'm repulsed to say the number of individuals trapped in a cycle of exploitation is estimated to be in the thousands. Human trafficking, slavery and exploitation are occurring in our suburbs behind closed doors. As a country and as a parliament, we are obligated to do more to prevent these practices. A robust modern slavery act is a step in the right direction.


This bill establishes a modern slavery reporting requirement that requires large businesses and other entities to make annual public statements on their actions to address modern slavery risks in their operations and, importantly, in their supply chains. Many of these big companies have already experienced cases of modern slavery in their supply chains and have found them, and are now leading the charge in combatting this deplorable practice once and for all. Even mining magnate and founder of the Walk Free Foundation, Andrew Forrest, discovered slavery in the supply chain of his own Fortescue Metals Group in 2012. Thousands of workers connected to one of our country's biggest companies were earning next to nothing and their passports were being held to ransom by their employer. Upon finding this, Mr Forrest said the supplier claimed no knowledge of these slavery-type practices and their response was instantaneous: passports were returned, illegal recruitment fees were back paid and major overhauls were made to ensure this did not happen again.


It's proactivity like this from big business that will ensure modern slavery is then tackled head-on, but we need to support them in doing so; we need to ensure that there is a level playing field for them. This bill will ensure that businesses are constantly reviewing their supply chains and business practices so that they can catch out this dastardly behaviour in their supply chains and bring financial pressure to bear in an effort to eradicate such modern slavery. The bill requires entities with annual revenue of more than $100 million to make a public statement on a yearly annual basis of their actions to address modern slavery risks in their operation and their supply chains.


Labor support this bill, but we feel that this bill doesn't go far enough. Tackling slavery and exploitation is core to Labor's mission and in no way, shape or form do we tolerate worker exploitation or human rights abuses of any kind. We recognise that modern slavery is a hidden problem that won't be discovered without meaningful attempts to expose it and requirements on businesses to check their supply chains to that end. It's why, over a year ago, Labor committed to legislating a modern slavery act with penalties for noncompliance.


We believe the bill now before the House should include a strong enforcement mechanism, imposing penalties on those who do not comply with the act. We recognise that the implementation of this reporting obligation will be significant for all companies, so we worry that, without penalties, companies may not be sufficiently incentivised to comply with the bill's requirements. The reason for our scepticism is not unfounded. Last year's Senate inquiry heard that, in the three years since the implementation of the UK's similar antislavery act, only about half of the 11,000 or so organisations that were required to report had produced their slavery and human trafficking statements. Combatting slavery should not be optional. It is an obligation of a progressive society such as ours. We cannot turn our eyes away from what is occurring. Bad things happen when good people say and do nothing. There is simply no excuse for not looking. This is why we are moving amendments to introduce penalties for failing to comply with the modern slavery act provisions.


We are not alone in this mindset, with the overwhelming majority of stakeholders who gave evidence to last year's Senate committee inquiry calling for penalties to be included in the bill as well—organisations like the Human Rights Law Centre, who told the committee:


The Bill should be amended to include a robust enforcement framework, including penalties for entities that fail to report or provide inadequate, false or misleading information. Penalties should include both financial and non-financial penalties …


These sentiments were echoed by Anti-Slavery Australia, Australian Lawyers for Human Rights, Oxfam, Stop the Traffik, the Law Council of Australia, the Advisory Committee of the Modern Slavery Registry, the ACTU, the Ethnic Communities Council of Victoria and the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia—and that is not all.


These supply chain reporting requirements must divulge specific information, including information about the company's supply chain where risk has been identified in that supply chain, what steps are being taken to ensure slavery isn't part of that supply chain and how they are training staff to manage all of this appropriately. A list of the companies required to report will be publicly available for the sake of transparency and a central repository of statements will ensure each company is meeting their obligations, or at least allow the public to check. It's only through such steps that this parliament can take the first steps to combating modern slavery.


In conjunction with this, we are calling on the government to remove forced marriage from the reporting requirements. Stakeholders are concerned the inclusion of forced marriage will have unintended consequences. After all, it is not ordinarily the role of business to inquire into the private lives of their employees. It is up to businesses to support employees that might find themselves in family violence situations and possible forced marriage. But we do not believe it is appropriate for this form of modern slavery to be addressed in this particular bill. 


We are well aware Australia's current approach to forced marriage is not working. Under the current government, we haven't had a single successful prosecution of forced marriage offences under the Criminal Code. Of course, that doesn't mean that it's not happening. We instead propose that we should establish a forced marriage unit to provide a one-stop shop to connect victims to the support that they need and to remove the cooperation requirements as part of our forced marriage protection order, among other things. We ask the government to match Labor's forced marriage policy commitment, in order to give these victims the support they need, rather than driving this repulsive practice further underground.


We also ask that the government go back to the drawing board and propose a second reading amendment in this House to establish an office of an independent antislavery commissioner. This current bill proposes a modern slavery business engagement unit. Essentially, this would be a unit buried in the Department of Home Affairs, focused on assisting business in fulfilling their reporting requirements, but not actively helping victims to get the help that they need. This will not be seen as a solution to the problem and it won't do anything to assist the thousands of people trapped in slavery in Australia now. We call on the government to establish an office of an independent antislavery commissioner, because we know victims in Australia deserve more than another bureaucratic big business liaison unit. We need an independent commissioner to assist victims and to remedy the current gaps in law enforcement. 


Last year's Senate estimates revealed we only had seven slavery convictions in Australia in the last five years. Victims of modern slavery are often some of society's most vulnerable. They are often individuals with cultural, social economic and language disadvantage. An independent commissioner would have the capacity to not only support these victims after the fact, but to work with civil society to prevent and detect this sickening spiral of crime.


The underground nature of slavery makes it very difficult for authorities to detect and even more complex to investigate and prosecute. The intention would be for the commissioner to work with victims of slavery to resolve inquiries and complaints. In addition, they would have the capacity to assist business to build best-practice structures and to receive inquiries and complaints. 


Through the implementation of an independent commissioner, we would be following in the footsteps of the similar legislation that is currently in place in the United Kingdom, France, California and the European Union. Through this approach, we would expect the commissioner to work with these other countries and international organisations to lead the global effort to fight slavery. A number of consulted key stakeholders are in support of this proposal, including the Australian Catholic Religious Against Trafficking in Humans, Anti Slavery Australia and Walk Free. 


Stop the Traffik told us: 'There are at least six government departments whose engagement and action will be required to implement the act effectively. An independent commissioner would be able to work with these departments in a more effective manner than one department. It is the nature of government departments that they are siloed with different priorities and different ministers. Through an adequately supported and resourced independent commissioner, this matter would be given the priority status that it deserves.' 


The Australian Lawyers Alliance furthered this thought, saying that an independent commissioner would 'strengthen Australia's response to combatting modern slavery'. They said it could undertake the legislated review of the modern slavery act every three years to ensure the long-term effectiveness of the legislation and hold big business to account for compliance. 


Labor will not oppose this bill in the House, as the passage of this bill is vital to combat the scourge of modern slavery. However, we do implore this government to add penalties to the bill, remove forced marriage and re-evaluate the need for an antislavery commissioner. By enacting a robust modern slavery act in Australia with these amendments, this parliament in a bipartisan manner will be ensuring we are doing all that we can, as we should, together, in modern 21st century Australia, to eradicate modern slavery during our lifetime.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (17:35):  I too rise to speak on the Modern Slavery Bill 2018. I do so because this is a very important bill being debated here in parliament. Members of parliament should make it our mission to stand up for those who are some of the most vulnerable people in our communities, for those who need us to be their voice, and I couldn't think of a better way to do so than in the debate on this particular bill, which deals with modern slavery in today's world. As we heard from other speakers earlier, you would think that slavery ended in the 19th century. But, unfortunately and sadly, it exists today. It exists all around the world and even here in our own nation.


The purpose of this bill, I suppose, is to establish a reporting requirement that requires certain businesses and other entities in Australia to make annual public statements on their actions to address modern slavery—the modern slavery risks in their operations and supply chains. I'm proud to say that this was a Labor initiative for fighting modern slavery. Over a year ago, Labor committed to a modern slavery act with penalties and an independent antislavery commissioner in an announcement which was warmly greeted by businesses, unions and civil society stakeholders.


We know that slavery is one of the most heinous human rights abuses possible. There are more people trapped in slavery in the world today than there have been at any other time in human history. As a country, as a parliament, we simply must do more to prevent this horrible, horrendous practice, and an effective modern strong slavery act is a key part of this battle. A year ago, on this side of the House, we committed to a modern slavery act with penalties, as I said, and an independent antislavery commissioner. It was deeply disappointing that the government's put forward this bill, which we'll be supporting because it's a way forward, but without penalties—in other words, a toothless tiger.


The government has chosen to have a business engagement unit instead of an independent antislavery commission or commissioner—I mean, honestly, a business engagement unit! Let's deal with the victims of modern slavery, not set up a toothless tiger that engages but doesn't enforce. Let's not be fooled here. This isn't the carrot-and-stick approach; it's all carrot. There is no stick—it's enough carrot to embarrass Bugs Bunny! This weak commitment is so disappointing but hardly surprising from this government that has shown itself time after time to be utterly toothless when it comes to regulating big business.


Here we have an opportunity to actually do something about slavery to ensure that big businesses do have a process or a system in place that ensures that their supply chain doesn't engage in slavery. But if there is no incentive, if there is no stick at the end of it, why go through it? Unfortunately, without any way of enforcing this through fines, et cetera, I just can't see it taking off and being an instrument that will curb slavery. It's a weak commitment. It's disappointing but, as I said, it is hardly surprising from a government which, from time to time, has shown itself to be utterly useless when it comes to regulating big businesses.


The absence of penalties in this bill is absolutely baffling. We cannot leave it to big business to police themselves on slavery. We are talking about slavery; we are not talking about something minor. We could take this government's explanation and say: 'Okay, let's see how a no-penalty model goes. Maybe we're the first to do this.' Well, you'd be wrong. We heard other speakers speak on this earlier: evidence provided to the Senate inquiry into this bill showed that in the UK, where there are no penalties, the percentage of businesses that have reported, of those that supposedly have an obligation to do so, still hovers around the 30 per cent mark. There it is: no penalty, no difference. It fails the test.


Civil society has argued passionately for companies who breach the Modern Slavery Act to be penalised. The overwhelming majority of stakeholders who gave evidence to the Senate inquiry, including the Human Rights Law Centre, the Law Council of Australia, Oxfam and FECCA, all called for penalties to be included in the bill. Labor will be moving amendments to introduce penalties into this bill, because combatting slavery should not be optional. There is simply no excuse for not looking.


We also need an independent commissioner to assist victims who are trapped in slavery in our towns and cities, and to lead our nation's fight against this practice within our region. We heard some examples earlier of how it takes place here in Australia. Women are being sent over from Asia to work in horrendous situations, being told they'll be doing something else, and they are not able to leave because their families may be bonded back home. They're trapped in slavery right here in Australia.


It's estimated that an incredible 4,300 people are currently trapped in slavery here in Australia. These are the victims of modern slavery. Victims of modern slavery are often incredibly vulnerable and face cultural, social, economic and language barriers, especially when they're away from their own country. There are also significant gaps in the support services we provide for victims of modern slavery. An independent antislavery commissioner is urgently needed to deal with these issues, to help remedy these gaps in enforcement, to help the victims and to work with civil society to help prevent and detect slavery here in Australia.


The government's decision to walk away from an independent commissioner in exchange for a business engagement unit—the title tells you all. It shows that the government's primary concern is, as always, protecting big business instead of looking at the victims here, who are the vulnerable ones. Key stakeholders, including Anti-Slavery Australia, the ACTU, FECCA and many more, have joined Labor in the call for the establishment of an independent antislavery commissioner.


On this side of the House, we'll be fighting to ensure that Australia gets a modern slavery act that will actually make a difference. We'll also introduce forced marriage protection orders to provide civil protection against forced marriage for all victims, no matter their age. Currently there are no protection orders available for victims or persons at risk of forced marriage who are over the age of 18 years. When a victim or at-risk child turns 18, any pre-existing order is automatically lifted and ceases to protect them. We know that forced marriages don't stop at 18; they still take place well into any age. Many victims of forced marriage are over the age of 18 and victims who are children are likely to continue to face threats right up to early adulthood.


A Shorten Labor government will overhaul Australia's response to forced marriage. Let's not forget that potentially a thousand young Australians are at risk of forced marriage each and every year. Forced marriage is no different than slavery; you are being forced into a situation that you don't want to be in. Forced marriage is an abuse of human rights. It can create a structure through all sorts of things. Abuse and sexual assault can occur over decades. A failure to adequately prevent, address and respond to this practice is a failure to protect individuals, including young people and children, from crime and abuse.


Australia's current approach to forced marriage isn't working. Under this government, we've not had a single successful prosecution of the forced marriage offences under the Criminal Code. Victims have limited civil protections and struggle to access government funded support. This is a disgrace, and it demonstrates that we need an independent commissioner to provide some teeth to make sure it's taken seriously, because we know that when you allow businesses to self-regulate in most cases it doesn't work. You need an outside, independent body that can come in and ensure that things are being done properly. This is important, because, as I said at the beginning of this speech, slavery is one of the most heinous human rights abuses possible. There is nothing worse than being held against your will, whether it be in a work situation or in a marriage situation or in any other situation where you're doing things that you don't want to be doing. There are more people trapped in slavery today, in this year, than there ever have been in the history of mankind.


As a country and as a parliament, we have an absolute duty to do what we can to simply prevent this practice. You need an effective, strong, modern slavery act. It should be part of the battle. It should have an independent commissioner, and it should ensure that we also have fines for people who aren't adhering to this particular instrument. I'm very pleased that we've moved some amendments to this bill, and that a year ago we committed on this side to a modern slavery act with penalties and with an independent anti-slavery commissioner. I know that the announcement that we made was actually warmly greeted by businesses. We heard a great example of a particular mining company earlier. Our announcement was greeted warmly by businesses and civil society and unions.


I'm deeply disappointed that the government has put forward this particular bill, a bill with no penalties, and has chosen to have a business engagement unit instead of an independent antislavery commissioner. It is a weak commitment by this government. It's tokenism and it's disappointing, but hardly surprising, coming from a government who panders continuously to big business. But this is not about whether you're on the side of business or whether you're on the side of unions; this is about human beings and their lives. This is about people who are forced to do things, not of their own free will. I suppose this bill is one way forward. There are the amendments that we've put forward and I know, if we are in government, we will put things in place that will actually ensure that businesses do what they can along their supply chain to ensure that their company isn't involved in any slavery acts whatsoever. We'll also ensure that there is an independent commissioner that can look into these things.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fenner) (17:47):  My wife is American, and earlier this year we took the kids along to the Independence Seaport Museum in Philadelphia. There is a display there that puts in stark relief the experience of slave sales. There is a place in the museum where you can stand on a slave auction block and hear recordings put together by actors. It allows you to visualise what it would be like: the horror of coming off a ship and then being sold. If there's one statistic that sums up the sheer cruelty of the American slavery scheme, it is that one in three slave children were sold before their 10th birthday. We look back at this experience in the United States with horror, but yet there is much slavery still in the world today. The Walk Free Foundation estimates there are 40 million victims of modern slavery worldwide, two-thirds of whom are in the Asia-Pacific region.


Just in Australia, the Attorney-General's Department estimates that between 2004 and 2015 the Australian Federal Police took 619 referrals for human trafficking, slavery and slavery-like practices. That's why Labor, last year, recognised the importance of the issue of modern slavery in announcing our modern slavery policy. I pay tribute to the shadow Attorney-General, the member for Isaacs; the shadow minister for justice, the member for Hotham; Senator Lisa Singh; and many others in Labor who worked to produce this policy. It was a policy warmly greeted by business, civil society and the union movement. We were joined by representatives from the Business Council of Australia, the ACTU and the Salvation Army. Our policy ensured that there would be penalties for noncompliance and an independent antislavery commissioner.


The government has brought forward this bill in large part due to pressure from Labor and other civil society groups that have campaigned on the issue of modern slavery. But it has failed to put in place as part of this bill a regime of penalties and an independent commissioner. Penalties have been called for by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Anti-Slavery Australia, the Law Council of Australia, the Human Rights Law Centre, Oxfam, Stop the Traffic, the Ethnic Communities Council of Victoria, the Advisory Committee of the Modern Slavery Registry, Australian Lawyers for Human Rights, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia, the Top End Women's Legal Service and Fiona McLeod SC. An independent commissioner has been called for by Fiona McLeod SC, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Law Council of Australia, the Human Rights Law Centre, the Business Council of Australia, Project Respect, the Australian Lawyers Alliance, Anti-Slavery Australia, the synod of Victoria and Tasmania Uniting Church in Australia, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia, Good Shepherd Australia and New Zealand, the Top End Women's Legal Service, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, the Salvation Army, Oxfam and Stop the Traffik. These organisations recognise the importance of a regime which has strong penalties and an independent commissioner. Labor will be moving appropriate amendments to this bill to see those issues better resolved, and we hope the government will support those amendments.


I want to turn to the treatment of domestic workers employed by foreign diplomats in Australia. I will begin with a case study that is highlighted in a report produced the Freedom Partnership to End Modern Slavery—a project of the Salvation Army. It is about Cristina, and I quote:


Cristina (pseudonym) was recruited to work for a foreign diplomat in Australia. Cristina had a written contract that said she would be paid $2,150 per month for 40 hours per week as a livein housekeeper. From the time she arrived, Cristina’s conditions and pay were not as agreed. Her employer took her passport, refused to let her go out, and forced her to work seven days per week. She was not paid according to her contract and was forced to sign false declarations about payment of her salary. Cristina’s employer warned there were cameras in the house watching her. Cristina’s employer also threatened that there were many poor people in her country where 'there is a lot of corruption and a man’s life is only worth $100.' 


She was ultimately able to escape. Other cases of domestic workers indicate Christina's situation was not an anomaly.


There are challenges in Australian authorities cracking down on the mistreatment of domestic workers employed by foreign diplomats. The Salvation Army notes that, historically, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade 'has referred employment disputes to the Fair Work Ombudsman, which, in turn, has declined to investigate on the basis of immunity', and if employer sponsorship is revoked—which is a common response to worker complaints—they 'have only 28 daysbefore being legally required to leave Australia', which makes it in practice 'impossible to bring a private civil action'. Not all diplomats enjoy the same degree of immunity, but immunity from prosecution does make the resolution of cases involving mistreatment of domestic workers for foreign diplomats more difficult.


According to the Salvation Army, there are approximately 150 private domestic workers currently employed by diplomats and foreign officials—most of them concentrated here in the ACT. The Salvation Army note that they have assisted dozens of workers who have come to them over the years, including at least 11 workers employed by diplomats or foreign officials in Australia. At least four of those cases involved a head of mission. They quote a survivor trafficked into domestic servitude by a foreign diplomat posted to Australia, who said:


For me this is not just about the wages that I am owed and the time that I have lost fighting for my rights. It is bigger than that. It is about justice for a group of people who are not treated as human beings. Their freedom and their labour are being stolen.


This is a significant issue for many in the ACT who want to see proper conditions provided to all workers in the ACT, whether or not they're working for embassies or high commissions.


As Heather Moore of the Salvation Army, who has been a passionate and tireless voice on this issue, has noted:


The US has made … progress, having amended its federal anti-trafficking laws to enable trafficking victims of diplomats and employees of international organisations to pursue civil lawsuits without fear of deportation.


Ms Moore notes:


The US based Human Trafficking Pro Bono Legal Centre and others have brought 25 civil suits against diplomats.


Not all of those have been resolved in favour of the plaintiff, but there have been a number of out-of-court settlements. She also notes:


In Switzerland, the Protocols section offers mediation services for employment disputes and refers workers to NGOs for support when more serious allegations are made. In Ireland, workers must report … for welfare checks and diplomats are now required to permit labour inspections and allow workers to attend workshops on their rights.


It is vital that we in Australia ensure that those who are working at foreign embassies are treated according to Australian law. They may technically be on foreign soil, but they are our responsibility. Because they are workers performing work in Australia, it is the moral responsibility of the Australian government to see that those workers are not subjected to a form of modern slavery.


This mistreatment of domestic workers in foreign embassies and high commissions must receive stronger attention from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I urge that department to work more constructively with organisations such as the Salvation Army to ensure that those who are affected by modern slavery in diplomatic missions here in Canberra don't slip through the legal cracks and that their rights are upheld.


This bill is welcomed by this side of the House. As I noted in my opening remarks, we would have liked to have seen it sooner, and we would like to see it include an independent commissioner and penalties. Beyond that, we urge the government to take all reasonable steps to also ensure that they work with diplomatic missions to ensure that there is no domestic worker in an Australian diplomatic mission subject to modern slavery.

"Khalil, Peter, MP",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Mr KHALIL
 (Wills) (17:58):  I also rise to speak on the Modern Slavery Bill 2018, because the fact is that there are more people trapped in slavery in the world today than there have been at any other time in human history. That's a very disturbing fact. It seems unbelievable, but it is true. I rise to speak on this bill very proudly, because many of my constituents in my electorate of Wills have a very strong social conscience and many have been writing to me about the implementation of a modern slavery act for many, many months.


The Walk Free Foundation estimates that there are 40.3 million victims of modern slavery worldwide. Two-thirds of these are in the Asia-Pacific region. We have come so far on so many things, and yet in our own region, in our own suburbs and in our own communities trafficking and slavery are still occurring. It's true to say, and I think the previous speakers have touched on this, that Australia has a critical role, frankly, to play in fighting modern slavery. Trafficking and modern slavery are hidden problems that will not be eradicated without meaningful attempts to expose them. It is our responsibility to do so. It is our responsibility to do everything in our power to prevent human trafficking and exploitation, so a strong, effective modern slavery act as an integral part of that responsibility.


It's our moral responsibility to our fellow human beings to do whatever we can to prevent human rights abuses and exploitation. That is why tackling slavery and exploitation is core to Labor's mission to protect the vulnerable, to protect workers and to implement and enforce human rights. I'm proud to stand with a party that is so committed to doing so. That's why last year the Labor Party announced our modern slavery policy, a policy that was welcomed by business, civil society and the union movement. I want to acknowledge all the work that was done by our shadow minister for justice, Clare O'Neil, and the commitment that she's shown to this policy in introducing it and announcing it publicly.


But tackling slavery must be above politics. That is why Labor has called on the government to match our commitment in establishing the act. We further called on the government to match the commitment to a transparency-in-supply-chain mechanism that contains penalties for noncompliance and to an independent antislavery commissioner. In putting forward this particular bill, the government have finally agreed—they caved in, if you want to put it that way—but have neglected to include the penalties for companies that breach the proposed act. They have also chosen to have what's called a business engagement unit rather than have an independent antislavery commissioner.


A modern slavery act must have penalties for noncompliance. It's a no-brainer. The coalition had an opportunity during the Turnbull government and now under the Morrison government to work with us in a bipartisan fashion on this bill and to match the commitments that we made when we announced our policy. Frankly, the government's commitment is weak, and we can't afford to be weak on human rights abuses. The government can and must do better. Combating slavery cannot be optional—there is no excuse for that—but unfortunately it's not very surprising coming from a government that has continued to prove itself really useless at regulating big business. We should not be leaving it to big business to police themselves on slavery.


Penalties, therefore, are vital to the success of this act. The experts know this and have been absolutely clear about it. In submissions to the Senate inquiry, the ACTU, Anti-Slavery Australia, the Human Rights Law Centre, Oxfam and many other organisations all spoke of the importance of penalties in effectively exposing and preventing human trafficking and exploitation. The Australian Council of Trade Unions, the ACTU, said in their submission:


The absence of sanctions seriously undermines the effectiveness of the reporting requirements for the purposes of fighting modern slavery.


Anti-Slavery Australia wrote:


The serious risk of human trafficking and slavery being supported and hidden by complex supply chains necessitates a stronger regulatory framework.


Oxfam's submission put it simply when they said:


Without penalties for non-compliance, there is a real risk that companies will not report ...


The overwhelming majority of stakeholders have called for penalties to be included in this bill. It is on this clear advice that we will be moving amendments to introduce penalties for failing to comply with any modern slavery act. It is also on the advice of these independent experts that we move amendments to institute an independent antislavery commissioner. A commissioner will work with victims, assist businesses to establish and protect transparency in supply chains and work to prevent and detect slavery in Australia. A commissioner will provide independent assessments, uninfluenced by other interests, on the effectiveness of the government's actions to fight slavery. It will scrutinise the government's work to tackle modern slavery.


But the government has once again prioritised protecting big business over the estimated 4,300 people who are trapped in slavery in Australia today. This decision, against all advice, to propose a business engagement unit in place of an independent commissioner, makes it perfectly clear that protecting themselves and protecting big business is their primary concern when their primary concern should be the thousands of people in Australia who are trapped in slavery and exploitation.


We call on the government to establish an independent antislavery commissioner. We call on the government to prioritise the victims, not a support unit for big business. It has been seen in the United Kingdom that the institution of an independent commissioner meant more victims identified, more proactive police investigations undertaken, more prosecutions and convictions achieved—substantive results. It has been seen in similar legislation in France, in the US state of California and across the European Union that the evidence backs in the importance and the critical role of an independent commissioner. The stakes, frankly, are too high to ignore those facts. It is clear that a modern slavery act will be weaker without an independent antislavery commissioner, and a business engagement unit is an utterly inadequate alternative.


The government have before them an opportunity to markedly strengthen the accountability framework of the bill and they are missing it. The victims of slavery in Australia deserve better. These amendments cannot be optional if this bill is to be effective. It is a complex and nuanced issue; we all know that. It cannot be taken lightly or without the proper advice. That is exactly why Labor took the time to consult with stakeholders about concerns the bill includes forced marriage as one of the forms of exploitation required to be reported on by business. It is also why Labor has committed to overhauling Australia's response to forced marriage. I want to acknowledge the work of our shadow minister for justice, the member for Hotham, Clare O'Neil, on this particular aspect of the policy work as well.


Forced marriage is an issue that needs to be dealt with properly, not flippantly, so if the government want to actually address it, they should match Labor's forced marriage policy commitment to establish forced marriage protection orders and a forced marriage unit to connect victims with the appropriate services and agencies that can assist them. Clearly, Australia's current approach to forced marriage is not working. Something has to change. But the inclusion of forced marriage in the modern slavery act may drive forced marriage underground, so it needs to be handled with care and in consultation with the experts, just as Labor's comprehensive commitment does. A Shorten Labor government, if elected, will ensure we lead a coordinated national response to combatting the practice of forced marriage. It will ensure that an overhaul of Australia's response to modern slavery, trafficking, human rights abuses and forced marriage. Our policy commits us to stamping out these atrocious practices. It is focused on prevention and on the support of vulnerable victims.


Today, I speak to this bill and, as many of the previous speakers on our side have, call on the Morrison government to match the Labor Party's commitments in this policy area. Again, I call on the government to listen to the advice of expert stakeholders who know firsthand what is necessary for real and effective change. We all, I know, speak on this bill because there are more people trapped in slavery in the world today than there have been at any other time in human history, a terrible statistic. An Australian modern slavery act will ensure that Australia is at the forefront in the fight against modern slavery.

"Dick, Milton, MP",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Mr DICK
 (Oxley) (18:08):  I rise to place on record and, like many of my colleagues and those opposite, to show my support for eradicating modern slavery. My remarks tonight probably will be in a similar theme to most speakers on this issue tonight. Whilst it probably won't make the news tonight or even be talked about across dinner tables while people are picking up their groceries on their way home or sitting in transport, waiting to get home to their loved ones, it is indeed a serious issue. After researching in preparation for this legislation and reading some of the evidence, it's a far bigger problem than most Australians and people across the globe would expect it to be. I know I was one of those people who was genuinely horrified and shocked about the true nature of modern slavery. As MPs in this place, we have a duty to stand up for those who find themselves in vulnerable circumstances—I certainly pride myself on that as an elected representative in this chamber—and the sad issue of modern slavery certainly fits this category.


Modern slavery is a term that can be used to describe a range of extreme labour rights abuses including: slavery, servitude, human trafficking and forced or compulsory labour. If you were to ask someone out on the street or across Australia whether slavery still exists today, the answer you'd get, no doubt, would be no. There's no denying that slavery is one of the most heinous human rights abuses possible. But there are more people trapped in slavery in the world today than there have been at any other time in human history. Let's just unpack that for a minute. Across our history, across this world, there are more people trapped in slavery than there have ever been.


Even though almost every country in the world has laws against slavery and the practice was banned globally by the United Nations in 1926 and again in 1953, modern slavery continues as an issue of huge proportions. Indeed, the Human Rights Law Centre estimates that there are currently in excess of 25 million slaves worldwide, including almost 5,000 right here in Australia. It's hard to believe, and it's hard to understand. According to the Attorney-General's Department, between 2004 and 31 December 2015 the AFP took 619 referrals for human trafficking, slavery and slavery-like practices, meaning that there are many more who go unnoticed and without the help they need.


I'm proud that the Labor Party has been at the forefront of this fight. We continue that fight here today because all of us, in this chamber and outside this chamber, do not tolerate human rights abuses. We recognise that modern slavery continues to be a hidden problem that will not be resolved without meaningful attempts to expose it. That's why last year, after months and months of consultation with stakeholders, Labor announced our modern slavery policy. We met with not only not-for-profit organisations working at the coalface against modern slavery but businesses and groups such as the BCA; ACCI, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry; Wesfarmers; Rio Tinto; BHP Billiton; Woolworths; Ernst & Young; and Fortescue Metals Group, just to name a few. That is because we are serious about an inclusive policy that works alongside the not-for-profits, the business sector, advocacy groups and community to stop modern slavery. What resulted was a constructed and strategic policy to help the thousands of victims right here in Australia and the millions and millions of people trapped in slavery worldwide, many of whom are victims of exploitation in private sector activities such as manufacturing, construction and agriculture.


Australia has an important leadership role to play in fighting modern slavery. Two-thirds of people trapped in slavery worldwide are reported to be in the Asia-Pacific region. I was pleased at the time to see our policy warmly greeted by business, civil society and the union movement, and we were joined by representatives from the BCA, the Business Council; the ACTU; and the Salvation Army. Our policy announcement included a commitment to establishing a Modern Slavery Act with transparency in a supply-chain mechanism which contained penalties for noncompliance and, most importantly, the establishment of an independent antislavery commissioner.


I'm pleased to be here today with members of the government—I note there were five government members who spoke on this important bill today—and join with the government, who are now following Labor's crackdown on modern slavery. I applaud them for that, and I recognise the government's response to strengthen Australia's response to modern slavery by establishing a modern slavery reporting requirement.


However, like most things this government produces, it falls well short of what I believe is required and is accepted. This includes the government refusing, as we've just heard from the member from Wills and other speakers—and no doubt the member for Canberra and the member for Bendigo, who are in the chamber tonight, will endorse this—to include penalties for companies that breach the proposed Modern Slavery Act. Yes, it seems there's no piece of legislation where this government wants to offend big business. I simply ask the question tonight: what's the purpose of this legislation if it doesn't have the teeth needed to impose penalties on businesses which continue to flout it and, dare I say, profit from modern slavery?


Any modern slavery act must have penalties for noncompliance. We should not be leaving big business to police themselves on slavery. In the three years since the United Kingdom implemented a similar ban only approximately half of the 9,000 to 11,000 organisations the UK government estimates are required to report have produced a slavery and human-trafficking statement. The evidence is clear: this type of self-reporting system simply does not work, so why has the government chosen to have a business engagement unit instead of an independent antislavery commission? According to an ABC report:


Adeline Lambert is the director of analytics and customer experience at Made In A Free World, an organisation that works with businesses to stop human trafficking and modern slavery in supply chains.


…   …   …


As it stands, the bill does not impose any penalties, financial or otherwise, on companies who fail to report slavery risks in their supply chain.


Because of this, Adeline Lambert said ""companies could look at this bill and say 'there's a way we can get around this'.""


Keren Adams, a Director of Legal Advocacy at the Australian Human Rights Law Centre, agrees.


""A mandatory reporting scheme is not really mandatory if there are no consequences for companies that fail to comply,"" she said in a statement.


Again I ask members of the government: what's the point of this bill if there are no penalties? Without financial penalties and an independent commissioner to help enforce them, these new laws lack the necessary teeth to ensure the worst offenders lift their game. The list of stakeholders who support the introduction of penalties in this bill is long and wide. I read into the Hansard a number of these, including, unsurprisingly, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Law Council of Australia, the Human Rights Law Centre, the Queensland University of Technology Faculty of Law, Australian Lawyers for Human Rights and the Australian Lawyers Alliance.


I'm pleased to see that Labor is moving amendments to this bill to introduce penalties for companies that fail to comply with the modern slavery act and is calling on the government to establish an office of an independent antislavery commissioner. We need an independent commissioner to assist victims, not just a support unit for big business. They are not the victims in this horrendous modern slavery trade. The support for an independent antislavery commissioner is strong out in the community, including in the following submission:


The Law Council is concerned that the Bill does not establish an Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner (Commissioner). In the Law Council's view, the case for an Anti-Slavery Commissioner was well-made in the Hidden in Plain Sight report, which notes that it would complement the existing roles of the Attorney-General's Department and the Ambassador for People Smuggling and Human Trafficking.


The Australian Lawyers Alliance added, with reference to that same report:


The Committee was clearly of the view that an independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner could play a vital role in strengthening Australia's response to combatting modern slavery. In particular, the Committee envisaged that the Commissioner would undertake a legislated review of the Modern Slavery Act every three years after its commencement, to assess the effectiveness of the Act, the level of public awareness of modern slavery and the effectiveness of the operation of the proposed supply chain reporting requirements.


Even the Business Council of Australia said:


We are open to any form of independent oversight, like the UK Anti-Slavery Commissioner model, if it works constructively with businesses to lift performance.


Instead the government's decision to walk away from an independent commissioner in exchange for a business engagement unit shows in my view where their primary concern is. Good Shepherd Australia New Zealand noted:


The Business Engagement Unit is not an adequate alternative to a Commissioner particularly given their own reporting requirements under the law—and their necessary relationships with business outside of the context of modern slavery.


In contrast, Labor's modern slavery act would require large companies to report annually to the government on the steps they've taken to ensure modern slavery is not occurring in their business or supply chain through a slavery and human-trafficking statement. Each statement must include specific information about the company's supply chain, where a risk has been identified in that supply chain, what steps are being undertaken to ensure slavery is not part of the supply chain, what training is provided to staff on these matters, whether slavery has been found in the supply chain and then what action has been taken subsequently. Despite the huge numbers I read out earlier that indicate we have almost 5,000 modern slaves in Australia tonight at this very moment in time, recent Senate estimates revealed that we've had only seven slavery convictions in half a decade. Simply put, that's unacceptable. We urgently need a commissioner to help victims and crack down on this sickening crime.


Victims of modern slavery are often incredibly vulnerable and face cultural, social, economic and language barriers. There have also been significant gaps in the support services we provide for victims of modern slavery. A commissioner would assist to remedy these gaps in enforcement, help victims and work with civil society to help prevent and detect slavery in Australia.


As was reported earlier this year, Australia is not alone in proposing such laws. Business reporting on human rights is a growing trend, with a large number of jurisdictions having introduced reporting or due diligence requirements in recent years. Some Australian companies already report under the UK act. In addition, comparable laws have been introduced across the European Union and in some states and sectors in the United States. Denmark has laws requiring corporate social responsibility reporting, and in Brazil there is a 'dirty list' enabling public shaming of businesses using forced labour. In 2017 the French parliament introduced a new due diligence law on Human Rights and the environment for businesses. Other European countries are also in the process of developing comparable laws, such as the Netherlands' child labour due diligence laws, and I believe Australia must and should follow suit. Before us today we have that opportunity to do so and play a lead role in eradicating modern slavery.


I note that the minister said in his second reading speech on this bill:


2018 is a landmark year in terms of tackling modern slavery within Australia. 


We have a moral imperative to eradicate this practice from our supply chains and our businesses.


I say to those opposite that we have an opportunity to do just that, just as the minister said in his second reading speech. If we support the amendments in this bill moved by Labor and get serious about eradicating modern slavery, we can get this done.


In conclusion, tonight I do want to acknowledge the bipartisan nature of the way that this issue has been handled, even though we have moved amendments tonight. In particular, on this side of the chamber I acknowledge the dedication and hard work of our shadow justice minister, the member for Hotham, but also the work of Senator Lisa Singh and Senator Louise Pratt, who have been at the forefront, championing this issue and making sure that it is in the public arena and that those people who are trapped in slavery in Australia and across the world do have a voice and do have an opportunity to be freed from the situation they're in. That is the hard work of many members on this side of the chamber but also across the government as well.


If the offer of bipartisanship on this stands, we must work together to strengthen the penalties against modern slavery and to ensure that there is adequate oversight against this cruel measure to make it end once and for all.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (18:23):  Slavery isn't something that most Australians associate with the 21st century. They have those images from what they've read and from what they've heard. There are really powerful songs that we're all familiar with, and there is what we've seen on television or at the movies. It is something very much associated with the past, with hundreds of years ago. There is that sense that, in a way, it is a thing of the past and not a modern phenomenon, but the extent of human trafficking, of slavery, of forced labour, of child labour, of the removal of organs and of other slavery-like practises in our region and within our borders is appalling. It is happening right now here in Australia, in our region and in Canberra in 2018. It is very much hidden in plain sight, as my colleague mentioned today.


The numbers are horrifying. There are reportedly 48.5 million people in slavery worldwide, many of whom are victims of exploitation in private sector activities like manufacturing, like construction and like agriculture. As we've heard from this side throughout the course of this debate tonight and this afternoon, about two-thirds of people trapped in slavery are reported to be in our own region, in the Asia-Pacific region, in 2018. Many of these people are stuck in the global supply chain of products and services that Australians use each and every day. Victims of exploitation are in private sector activities like manufacturing, construction and agriculture—as I said, in the supply chain of products that either create what we use every day or are used every day. It is estimated that thousands of people are currently trapped in slavery right here in Australia. Those current estimates place around 4,300 people in slavery or slavery-like conditions here in Australia, which is simply horrific in a nation such as ours in the 21st century.


It's particularly distressing that it is happening here in Canberra, in our nation's capital, as I speak. Just recently—in fact, in the last few months—we heard about police raids here in the ACT where women were discovered having been trafficked into the country from Thailand to forcibly work in the ACT sex industry. One woman claimed she was subject to a $50,000 debt, while others were working illegally on tourist visas. This case is still ongoing and before the courts. We've heard about the Filipino workers who were exploited at local massage parlours, forced to work long hours, underpaid, discriminated against and allegedly threatened that their families back home in the Philippines would be killed if they complained to anyone. Imagine the lives that those Filipino workers were living, being exploited in terms of working long hours and being underpaid and discriminated against. Imagine the fear they were living in each and every day about the fact that their family members were going to be killed should they speak out.


That people engage in this activity just outrages me so much. I find I am speechless. I just cannot believe that one individual, individuals, consortia or gangs could actually do this to other human beings—exploit someone and instil that fear in someone. I find it absolutely appalling. I find it horrifying that it is actually happening here in the ACT today, as I speak.


Some of these workers worked 12 hours a day, six days a week, and were paid for only 38 hours per week. They were brought into Australia on 457 visas with the promise of an annual salary of $52,000. Some had their pay docked by $800 per fortnight over a nine-month period because the massage parlour owner deemed the shop was not getting enough income and not getting enough customers. Last year, thanks to the involvement of the AFP and the Fair Work Ombudsman, the workers were each back paid a fraction of what they were owed. Some of these workers are still owed individual amounts ranging from $92,000 to $125,000.


But what about the employers? Deputy Speaker, do you know what they did to avoid all this liability? Those dirty dogs—that's the only term that you can use for the employers exploiting these people so appallingly—actually put the company into voluntary administration. That means that these workers who were being exploited, who were living with fear each and every day that their families were going to be killed, are unlikely to receive everything that they are owed.


Then there are the 20 or so domestic workers who were kept in slavery-like conditions in embassies here in Canberra. They were being forced to work 12- to 18-hour days for a fraction of the minimum wage, with no weekends off, no holidays and no time off in lieu of overtime. They were forbidden to leave the premises. Again, they were locked away, living in fear, and being exploited in the process. While the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade requires all domestic staff in diplomatic residences to hold onto their passports at all times, some of the workers had theirs taken away. The then foreign minister said in a statement that her department 'treats allegations of mistreatment of domestic workers by foreign diplomats very seriously and are a matter for the police'.


But the issue here is the issue of diplomatic immunity. Australian authorities, when there is diplomatic immunity, are powerless to act. I know from having been a diplomat that the requirement is that, when you go and live in someone else's country, yes, there is diplomatic immunity, but you live by the laws. You abide by the laws and you respect the laws of the country in which you are living. So there is a kind of agreement that that's how you go about it if you are being decent. The fact that people are hiding behind diplomatic immunity and making it very difficult for Australian authorities to address these issues of incidents of exploitation and fearmongering is absolutely appalling. If we can't address this through legal means, what political or values based pressure can or should we bring to bear?


We also heard a few weeks ago about the chef working 12-hour shifts in a restaurant six days a week. He had not only been working in those appalling conditions but had also been asked by his boss to pay the boss's tax bill. When I was in Melbourne when I heard this story, I was in a taxi and heading into a conference. The story came up on the radio, and the taxi driver turned to me and said, 'This is an issue that is far more widespread than people are talking about.' He said, 'I know of many instances of this happening.' The fact that this person was getting so badly exploited with 12-hour days six days a week, being underpaid and then being asked to pay the boss's tax bill was not news to the driver. Again, what human being does that to another human being? It's just breathtaking this is actually happening in Australia and we have got these incidents in Canberra in this day and age.


Already we have ratified a number of international legal instruments to combat this exploitation—as we should, because slavery is one of the most heinous human rights abuses possible. We've ratified the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery; the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime; the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children; and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention. As a country and as a parliament, we must do more to prevent this practice. We must be ever-vigilant, and an effective, strong modern slavery act is a key part of that battle.


In August this year, along with another 65 of my colleagues, I met with representatives from the Australian Catholic Religious Against Trafficking in Humans to discuss aspects and recommendations of this bill. We talked about what the face of modern slavery looks like: sex trafficking, child sex trafficking, forced labour, bonded labour or debt bondage, domestic servitude, unlawful recruitment and use of child soldiers. We talked about the issue of forced marriage. There have been 173 referrals of forced marriage to the AFP, with the number growing steadily since 2013. The 2018 Trafficking in persons report: June 2018 from the Department of State in the United States highlights the actions signatory countries are taking to address modern slavery. Australia is a signatory, but there are still 18 countries that haven't become part of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. The protocol supplements the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. That's 18 countries, and within our own region there are at least six countries that haven't signed up.


In the 2018 Trafficking in persons report, Australia's own country narrative shows we are committed to addressing modern slavery, but it also shows us where we can focus our attention in the future. According to the report, in 2017 we investigated 166 suspected cases of trafficking; prosecuted six defendants; convicted five traffickers, one sex trafficker and four labour traffickers; and investigated one case of domestic slavery in a diplomatic household but were unable to prosecute due to the diplomatic immunity I mentioned before. We prosecuted four defendants for allegedly travelling overseas for child sex tourism, but no convictions were reported.


One of the observations made in the report about Australia's legal framework was the apparent preference to pursue labour and employment charges over trafficking charges. It was noted that the labour and employment charges attract a lesser sentence or penalty than trafficking charges. It is hoped the introduction of the framework outlined in this bill will help address this. It is important to remember that we have come a long way and it has taken some time for us to get to this point where we are even looking at legislation.


It was a Labor government back in 2013 that first recognised the need to consider the risks of slavery-like conditions in Australian supply chains and noted the actions that other countries where taking or were going to undertake in response. The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recommended the government undertake a review to establish antitrafficking and antislavery mechanisms, including legislation to improve transparency and supply chains, increasing the prominence of fair trade, and the development of a labelling and certification strategy for products and services produced ethically. Noting the hard work and the involvement of non-government organisations in vulnerable communities where slavery-like conditions are able to be identified, the committee also recommended that contracts for these NGOs be refunded one year ahead of the current contract's conclusion.


I know from my conversations with ACRATH that there is some concern about funding certainty from many NGOs working in this area. The current 12-month funding cycle is competitive, meaning many organisations are competing against each other for funding rather than working in a cooperative and collaborative way, the approach that is needed for their work on crime prevention and advocacy and support of trafficked persons. ACRATH has sought a three- to five-year funding cycle from the Department of Home Affairs budget as part of the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking and Slavery. I will be watching this space carefully to see what steps the government takes to move this plan forward in collaboration with the people working on the ground—that is, the NGOs.


One year ago, Labor committed to a modern slavery act with penalties and an independent antislavery commissioner. That's how seriously Labor takes this issue; we put the role of an independent antislavery commissioner front and centre of our act. The commissioner would work with victims of slavery, receive inquiries and complaints and assist business in building best practices that protect their supply chains. The commissioner would also work with civil society to help detect and prevent slavery in Australia, as well as lead our global efforts to fight slavery, including working with other countries and international organisations.


Labor sought to work in a bipartisan way on this issue to develop this legislation, so you can imagine our frustration and disappointment with the current bill. It is without penalties, and evidence provided to the Senate inquiry into this bill showed that in the UK, where there are no penalties, the percentage of businesses that are reported still hovers at around 30 per cent of those that supposedly have an obligation to report. That is just not good enough. The absence of penalties in this bill is baffling. We cannot leave it to these absolutely dirty dogs to police themselves on slavery. We cannot leave it to them. Key stakeholders, including ACRATH, Anti-Slavery Australia and the ACTU have joined Labor in the call for the establishment of an independent antislavery commissioner, and we will be fighting to ensure that Australia gets a slavery act that will actually make a difference.

Mr HASTIE
 (Canning) (18:38):  I would like to commend this bill to the House. Slavery has, of course, been a persistent evil throughout human history and, as we know, it remains; there are still 25 million victims of modern slavery who are exploited in global supply chains.


My first contact with people who were slavery victims was actually on 24 December 2014. I was deployed with the Australian Defence Force to a Middle Eastern country and some of my colleagues and I ended up at a Christmas Eve service. We came into contact with some women working at a women's refuge which was helping to get women who had been the victims of slavery back to their home country. I don't want to go into too much detail because I think that refuge continues to operate and continues to look after women from a certain country, but women were coming to that country and finding work, then they would have their passports stripped from them and then they would be forced into sex slavery. The refuge where these women could flee to was established, and then, through their home country, they would be recovered and reunited with their families. It really did emphasise that slavery is a problem, and that's why I'm so heartened that this government is taking action to make sure that Australian businesses have no place for slavery and to ensure that we have transparency in our supply chains.


The central objective of the bill is to combat modern slavery in the supply chains of our goods and services. As I said, the UN estimates that up to 25 million modern slavery victims are exploited in global supply chains. The government has worked very hard, through a range of consultations with stakeholders, on the key features of the bill to ensure that the bill is practical to implement for business and is consistent with community expectations. Under the reporting requirement, for example, over 3,000 corporations, trusts, partnerships and other entities will need to publish annual modern slavery statements.


The bill will set a $100 million threshold for reporting. This ensures that it focuses on entities that have the capacity to meaningfully comply and the market influence to clean up global supply chains. Statements will need to address mandatory criteria set out in the bill, including identifying the entity's key modern slavery risks and describing its actions to address these risks. These criteria will provide certainty for business about how to report and will ensure statements can be easily compared.


I won't go on because many have spoken on this bill already. I just wanted to lend my voice to it, and also to commend my colleague the member for Dunkley, who's done a lot of hard work in getting the bill to this point. I acknowledge the support we've received from those opposite, although we disagree on key features of the bill. This bill is a really important historic step by Australia in its fight against modern slavery. It's sensible, it's practical and perhaps over time we can enhance it once we get a sense of how the incentives embedded in the bill work to eradicate slavery from goods and services in our supply chains.

"Wilson, Josh, MP",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Mr JOSH WILSON
 (Fremantle) (18:42):  I support the Modern Slavery Bill 2018. More particularly, I support the amendment moved by the shadow minister for justice, the member for Hotham. Clearly, there's broad support for this bill because we want a legislative framework in place to combat the scourge of modern slavery. I particularly support the amendment moved by the shadow minister for justice because it adds some sensible, constructive changes that will ensure that this bill and its framework will implement stronger and more effective action. It's the sort of thing that I'd like to think the government would consider. I'll come to the detail of some of that in a moment.


The theme of what I have to say is almost in the vein of 'so close and yet so far'. It's great that we've finally reached this point, but it's a shame that there are some very significant shortcomings. Labor has pushed for action to combat modern slavery for some time. It was more than a year ago that we committed to a modern slavery act. It's good that the government has seen fit to follow along, although not in the way that it could if it were really serious about getting some sort of change, both within Australia and other countries that Australian companies use for the purposes of their supply chains.


As others have said, the government's bill imposes a reporting requirement on entities with consolidated revenue of more than $100 million. It includes an obligation to make public on an annual basis action taken to address modern slavery risks by companies in their operations and supply chains. It also creates a modern slavery business engagement unit within the Department of Home Affairs.


The bill follows in the wake, to some degree, of the commitment that Labor made. More particularly, it follows from the inquiry undertaken by the Foreign Affairs and Aid Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Like the member for Canning, I recognise that work. The report of the inquiry was called Hidden in plain sight: an inquiry into establishing a Modern Slavery Act inAustralia. I congratulate the chair, the member for Dunkley, and the deputy chair, the member for Wakefield.


It is worth thinking carefully and closely about what addressing modern slavery really means. 'Modern slavery' describes circumstances in which a person is compelled to work through some kind of coercion or is trafficked for work and in other ways exploited for their labour. It describes circumstances in which a person is inevitably deprived of their liberty, deprived of their basic human rights and often—I would say in many cases—subjected to abuse, mistreatment, violence, danger and of course the denial of proper wages and conditions.


It's estimated that modern slavery could be the circumstances that face somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 people in Australia. Worldwide, it affects more than 40 million—some estimate close to 50 million. It is sobering to think that more people are trapped in slavery today than there have been at any other time in human history.


It's not hard to imagine the kinds of people who are typically prey to those who practise and profit from modern slavery. They're people who are vulnerable. They're people who are subject to coercion and can be threatened, who can be motivated by the application of force or some other kind of advantage. Children, women, migrants, refugees, people in seasonal work, people in regional and remote areas, seafarers—these are the kinds of people who are at risk of experiencing modern slavery. People in countries without effective governance and regulation, people in countries without strong unions and other civil society organisations—these are the kinds of people who are at risk of being victims of modern slavery.


For all those reasons, our response has to look well beyond our own shores. As I said, it may be 5,000 to 10,000 people here; it's more than 40 million people elsewhere. That's why there needs to be an appropriate obligation on Australian companies to interrogate and be vigilant about the reality of the work practice in their supply chains. I note one of the comments from the Human Rights Law Centre in relation to the parliamentary inquiry:


We've heard horrific stories of abuse linked to some of Australia's biggest brands. Burmese migrants chained … to Thai fishing boats supplying the seafood we eat. Australian surf wear made in North Korean sweatshops.


Those are just two examples of the way in which Australian companies can unwittingly be involved in and effectively support practices that constitute modern slavery. It picks up the title of the committee inquiry report, which was Hidden in plain sight. I think very few Australians as they go about their lives, when they get dressed and put on a T-shirt that's made in Thailand or open a can of tuna that is sourced from somewhere else, would think that, inherent in that aspect of their daily life, is quite extraordinary suffering of someone else; that, in order for them to get the tuna at the price they get it or the unbelievably cheap cotton T-shirt, the value is extracted from another human being, a value in terms of their labour and worse—that their liberty is infringed upon; that they suffer in all of the kinds of ways that humans can bring other humans to suffer.


We do need to recognise that, as the world becomes more globally interlinked and companies seek to make extended supply chains part of how they are competitive and successful in our country, the push to be competitive and efficient and to take advantage of those kinds of global opportunities does come with an inherent risk. If, as an Australian company, you come to know of an opportunity that is attractive to you because the labour costs involved seem to be too good to be true, or part of your product or enterprise relies on a good or a service that is labour-intensive and the price of that good or service seems too good to be true, it probably is. It probably is too good to be true, in the sense that it may well rely on the kinds of practices that we regard as modern slavery.


I would just make a side observation, separate to this bill. I think if we are serious about modern slavery, we have to go well beyond the reporting requirements that this bill places on Australian companies—and the extent to which they actually place those on Australian companies is something I'll come back to—and look at things like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which, as a modern trade and investment agreement, does include some labour standards and environmental standards—but they are weak. They are standards that are not capable of being enforced. There are mechanisms within those agreements that provide oversight, transparency and compliance but the consequences for noncompliance are non-existent.


We have to think about the fact that Australia doesn't presently have a debarment policy that operates at the national level. It's not just private companies that are involved in contracting with foreign companies and having access to sort of foreign labour. Australian governments typically do that through their procurement and other contracting arrangements, yet we don't have in place the debarment architecture that would mean that, where a company or an operation overseas has been found to engage in exploitive practices or modern slavery, they would be prevented from being involved in Australian procurement processes.


Having talked about the way modern slavery occurs overseas and the way Australian companies are at risk of being complicit in that kind of conduct, we shouldn't think it doesn't happen in Australia—it does. There have been some examples in my home state of Western Australia. It was not that long ago that we had a live export ship, known as Bader III, where, in addition to the mistreatment of animals that the Bader III delivered, it also involved the mistreatment of humans. It involved the mistreatment of its crew, who hadn't been paid for six months, who weren't allowed to go ashore, who were owed, in sum, about half a million dollars, and who had been forced to sign contracts under which, if they were injured or ill, they would pay for their own repatriation.


There were also agricultural operations in Carabooda and Pemberton in Western Australia that came to the attention of authorities and seemed to constitute a practice of modern slavery in the agricultural setting. When you looked at the Fair Work Commission's assessment of those circumstances, it was interesting to note the elements that they identified that made the employment of the people involved akin to modern slavery. They were migrant workers; their movements were controlled; their basic liberty was compromised; they lived under the threat of further jeopardy; they lived in substandard conditions; and they were required to work for unacceptable pay in unacceptable conditions. That is essentially the definition of modern slavery, and it was happening in Western Australia.


As I said at the beginning, it's a bit of a case of so close and yet so far. It's disappointing that this bill and the mechanism or the structure it puts in place doesn't apply any penalties for a failure to comply. I think it's pretty obvious to people out there in the community that, if you put in place a requirement and you say that people have an obligation to report and they do not comply and nothing happens, there's a big question mark over exactly how effective that would be. This bill does not create or fund an independent anti-slavery commissioner. Instead, it has this sort of unit within the Department of Home Affairs. It seems that that unit will focus on helping businesses to undertake their compliance work. I'm not saying that's a bad thing. I'm not saying that assistance shouldn't be provided. But an independent antislavery commissioner would ensure that there would be some focus on victims, that there would be some perhaps investigative capacity or at least the capacity to work with and advise other kinds of law enforcement bodies. It's not as if that's just something that the opposition and the shadow minister for justice had been calling for; that's the unanimous recommendation of the foreign affairs subcommittee, which had, as its recommendation No. 6, the creation of an independent antislavery commissioner precisely to 'ensure victims of modern slavery, including children, have access to appropriate support services', and also under a separate bullet point 'to work with various agencies, law enforcement bodies, prosecutors and others to increase the identification and reporting of modern slavery crimes and to bolster the prosecution rates for modern slavery offences'. That won't occur because there is no independent antislavery commission.


We know that the bill in some respects takes the UK's Modern Slavery Act, which was introduced in 2015, as something of a model but, again, it doesn't really follow that closely enough. One of the best examples is in the threshold that's been set for Australian companies. At $100 million, it's considerably higher than the threshold in the UK. The committee, again, unanimously recommended a $50 million threshold. Civil society organisations suggested the threshold be the same as ASIC's definition of a large corporation, which would be $25 million.


In conclusion, it's a welcome step forward; we support it. We particularly support the amendment, which would make it even better. It's a shame we've come so far and yet fall short. If we are going to do these things—they are important regulatory steps—why not get them right? Why not follow the process? You task a committee with doing it, it's led by a member of the government, it produces a unanimous report that follows international best practice and civil society advice, and yet we don't take it.

"Chesters, Lisa, MP",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (18:57):  There are two key components, I believe, in this bill, and two key purposes, I believe, in this bill introducing a modern slavery act here in Australia. The first is that it will say that, here in this country, we will require companies to look at their supply chain. As previous speakers have said, that's the international supply chain. That means requiring companies who import goods into our country, whether they be used in manufacturing or whether they go straight to sales, to look to see if there is modern slavery occurring in their supply chain. As others have said, it is critical that Australia be involved and take this lead given that two-thirds of the victims, it's estimated, are in our region of South-East Asia.


We have all seen the modern slavery horror stories. We have all heard of the horror stories when they have been exposed via the media. And we do only have estimates because it is hard to quantify unless we actually start requiring multinationals, large companies, to start to do this work. So that's the first important part of this bill. As a country, Australia will join countries like the UK and say: if you wish to do business in Australia then we want to know that your business is doing everything it can to stop acts of modern slavery.


The other key part to this bill makes us look at ourselves as a country and ask: are we doing all we can to stop modern slavery in our own country? One estimate is that there's roughly 4,300 victims of modern slavery today in Australia. Other estimates have it as high as 15,000. And it's quite confronting, I think, for some Australians to learn that we have victims of slavery in our country, because many thought that this was dealt with centuries ago. But it wasn't. 


I have one example of modern slavery here in our country that I wish to raise. The industries that are most at risk are well established. We've spoken about what's going on in agriculture, in our hospitality industry, in beauty and massage services, in construction and in other areas of our economy. A few weeks ago I had the opportunity to meet with some farm workers. The member for Blair and the member for Hotham were there. One young woman told us her story. She's Indonesian and she first entered the country on a tourist visa. She was coming here to study. She'd received some bad advice from the agency who'd recruited her. She had entered the country and was immediately put on a minivan with blacked-out windows. She was basically driven from Melbourne Airport to rural New South Wales, where she was dropped off at a caravan park and stayed in shared accommodation that was quite substandard with about 10 men whom she'd never met before. She was then forced to pick fruit for long hours of the day and was paid very little, if anything. She was told she had a debt that she had to pay back.


She was completely scared, completely isolated. This could be an example of modern slavery. She was scared to speak up because she knew that what was happening was wrong. She was scared to speak to police because she wasn't sure, first of all, how to access them or whom to speak to. And she was very scared by what her employer, if you can call them that, was saying. She feared for her family back home, she feared being deported and she also feared the debt that was hanging over her head. Fast-forward five years and she's now seeking help through the NUW about her circumstance and about how to go forward. But, if we had some sort of amnesty for this particular work, then we might be able to start to go down the path of prosecution for her experience. Unfortunately, this particular worker is not alone. When she spoke to us, there were, in fact, eight other workers in similar situations.


I'm not saying that all cases of worker exploitation are cases of modern slavery. There is a degree of worker exploitation in our country that is unprecedented, that we have never seen before. Some of those really extreme cases could be cases for modern slavery, hence the reason for this bill to come before us so we can start exposing that. It is also about the importance of penalties and the importance of having an independent antislavery commissioner established here in this country so that they can make recommendations on how to prosecute and how to toughen up the laws to crack down on this behaviour. That is one of the reasons why the amendments that Labor has put forward should really be considered by those opposite.


This bill doesn't have penalties. This bill should include strong enforcement mechanisms imposing penalties on companies that do not comply with the act. A failure to include penalties in the bill renders the reporting requirement optional. We know that the worst offenders won't report if it is optional. We know that because that's how corporates behave. Companies like McDonald's have already proudly said: 'We've already done this. We're already doing this.' They have actually met several MPs to say, 'This is what we're doing.' Part of what triggered it for them as a multinational corporation is the UK's version of the modern slavery act. So there are some companies in our country that are already acting, but they've taken that first step. It's the ones that don't do it that are the problem, and that's why there need to be penalties: to ensure we force the companies that don't actually report.


The reason for the independent antislavery commissioner is to assist with compliance to ensure that the bill has a unit that works within the department. It's also to help suggest how we can continue to strengthen and prosecute throughout the supply chain to ensure that we are doing our bit to crack down on modern slavery.


Every time I drive past one of those massage parlours, in an old converted house with the neon signs, I do fear for the women who could be working in there. We know from faith based organisations who reach out to these women that there are cases that could constitute modern slavery—women who are locked into these massage parlours, having their passports taken, being forced to work long hours and, in some cases, being forced to work as sex workers. Prosecutions in this space have been low, because of the fear and the intimidation. That is why we need to do more. We need to do more to crack down on modern slavery in our country.


It's not just in that sector or in agriculture that we're seeing it. We're also starting to see gross examples of worker exploitation in the construction industry. As we stand here today, there are over 100 guest workers or temporary workers who've come here from China that are working as plasterers in Hobart at the Hobart Hospital site who haven't been paid. They haven't been paid for nine weeks now. At a very basic level you would say that that is a case of underpayment; it is a case of worker exploitation. Yes, it is, and it needs to be resolved. However, once you start that prosecution and start exploring and unpacking what has happened, you may find that their passports have been taken. You may find that they have a bonded debt that they have to pay back to the agency or the company that's recruited them. You may find that there are threats against their family back home in their country of origin.


Fair Work has a critical role to play in this, in that that could be the entry point where people first start to seek help. We know this because it's appeared in a number of reports that the Fair Work Ombudsman has released into the treatment of temporary workers, people who are here on visa arrangements. That's why I think that what the government are trying to do is a bit tokenistic. It's about saying, 'Yes, we want to tick the box to say that we are doing something about modern slavery.' But in some ways what they have put forward is bit of window-dressing—it's optional whether you comply. It also doesn't have enough steps in place to act on that very good step of saying, 'We are taking modern slavery seriously,' by building the links back to where someone might be a victim of modern slavery but they have entered through, say, an underpayment case or through the Migrant Workers Centre which has just opened up in Melbourne.


Others in this place have spoken about cases of domestic servants—people who have entered the country, maybe on a tourist visa, who are now working as domestic servants. There have been cases in Melbourne and Canberra where they have actually said that they could constitute a form of modern slavery—passports taken; not paid; underpaid; locked in and unable to leave the premises; and threats being made against their person or against family members. It is just unacceptable that that is happening here in Australia in plain sight. We know that it is a problem in the cleaning industry, the construction industry and the hotel industry—practically, wherever there are workers who are here on a temporary arrangement, they could be victims of modern slavery. The government needs to be doing more to support them where they have been underpaid and doing more to investigate and to ensure that we've got that practical support for people going forward.


Last week I held a modern slavery discussion forum in my electorate, in both Woodend and Kyneton, where the shadow minister, Clare O'Neil, and I discussed with the local community how it is our human rights obligation to start acting up and speaking up about this issue. We need to make sure that any bill that is put forward on this issue isn't just tokenistic, that we are genuinely trying to change and make a real effort towards cracking down on modern slavery.


At the forum, people asked several questions. At the forum, there was a bit of surprise at the statistics that at this point in time we have more people trapped in slave-like conditions than ever before in our modern history and that two-thirds of the people are in our region. They talked about how as consumers they want to be more aware—aware of the companies that are trying to crack down on modern slavery—so they can use their purchasing power to ensure that they, as good global citizens, are buying products and securing services from companies which are committed to cracking down on and ending the scourge of modern slavery.


An interesting sort of development with one of our multinational companies is that CUB, which is part of a global beer beverage company, has moved in a number of its workplaces here in Australia to start using Australian-made bottles, labels and cartons. Therefore there's an opportunity within this, when we ask major companies to look at their supply chain, for these companies to potentially say, 'Well, if I have to comply with the Modern Slavery Act and the work that's involved in that and the fact that it is quite hard to police what's happening in other countries—it can get complicated and it can get costly—maybe the cost-benefit analysis says that it's actually easier and more affordable to start using Australian based products.' That is something that could be also a positive outcome when we start to ask companies to ethically look at how they are procuring product, whether it be for sale in this country or to be used in further manufacturing.


I strongly urge the government to consider the amendments that have been put forward by Labor. We need to have penalties. We need to make sure that these companies, all companies, are complying with the act. We also need to make sure that we have an independent antislavery commissioner that is working towards ending modern slavery in our country but also ending modern slavery in our region.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (19:12):  The Modern Slavery Bill 2018 is what I would describe as inadequate legislation that purports to respond to a very serious global problem. The previous speaker, the member for Bendigo—and I commend her remarks—referred to it as 'tokenistic' legislation, and I agree with her.


For millions of people around the world, human slavery didn't end in the early 19th century, despite William Wilberforce's commendable efforts and the British parliament, I think, in 1833 passing legislation outlawing slavery. It simply pushed slavery underground, screened by a veneer of conventions and laws that gave hope to those enslaved at the time and those who were fighting to have slavery stopped. In reality, it didn't end the slavery but simply changed the modus operandi of those who still use people as slaves to profit from.


As other speakers on this side have also made clear—and it follows the comments about it being inadequate legislation or tokenistic legislation—we only have the legislation before us because of the efforts of those on this side of the House, who have continued to raise this issue, as have so many other groups in society. Indeed, I can recall, as a member of the joint standing committee that looked into procurement, in our discussions and in listening to witnesses who appeared before that committee, stressing the point that one of the first things the government itself should do as part of its procurement obligations is ensure that any government procurement did not come from a place where slavery of any kind or indeed any kind of worker exploitation had been used at the time. So it's an issue that's been before this parliament for some time.


Whilst I say that the legislation is inadequate, at least the legislation is a step in the right direction. More importantly, it actually acknowledges that there is a real problem out there.


Others have talked about figures of somewhere between 40 and 50 million people around the world being enslaved today. I've seen figures that go up to perhaps 70 million. The truth of the matter is that we don't know how many people are enslaved in the world today, because those people who operate this way are not likely to report the number of people that they have working for them and whom they are exploiting. But, regardless of what the figures are, we do know that the figures are quite revealing. Indeed, as others have made clear, there are more people in slavery today than at any other time before.


We're aware from reports that we've had from within this country and from overseas that people are working in mines, brick kilns, garment factories, farms, shipping boats, brothels and other places as slaves. What's even more concerning is that in some cases they are working from within their own homes. We've heard of terms like bonded slavery, forced migrant labour, sex slavery or even early forced marriages, child labour and so on. These are terms that arise again because there is an acknowledgement that the problem exists, but it's always dealt with in a very simplistic way where we might deal with one particular problem over here and another over there. It's never been looked at as the problem that it really is, and that is a problem of people working as slaves right around the world. Their work and their exploitation is taking place not only from those who have got them under their control but from everyone else who deals with those firms and people that abuse slaves to make a profit.


One of the other concerns—and I'll be speaking about this when we come back next week—is the concern I have about people who are in slave camps today under oppressive governments that imprison people because they are dissidents to the regime and then use them from within those camps as slave labour to manufacture products and goods for their state. But I'll have a bit more to say about that next week.


It's also the case that, as inequality across the world widens, including here in Australia, more and more people are enslaved by extreme poverty and shackled not by chains but by their needs and their commitment to their families. They work as slaves in order to ensure a living for themselves and the people who depend on them. As others have also said, they become vulnerable to heartless employers who exploit them in way that I personally cannot understand. I cannot understand how one person is willing to profit from the harm they do to another in the way that we know is occurring perhaps in Australia and certainly in other parts of the world.


Sadly, what is also of concern is that governments in so-called respectable countries, including our own, have not only looked the other way when we know this is possibly happening but have at times, through deregulation policies such as the shipping legislation this government brought in this parliament only a few weeks ago, enabled those people who want to exploit others to do so and to do so much more easily. The member for Fremantle talked about those people on the ships that take away our live animals. I've no doubt that they are exploited, if not enslaved. But I'm aware of others who work in the shipping industry who are treated equally badly.


In the minister's second reading speech, I picked several phrases which I'm going to quote because, quite frankly, they highlight why this is inadequate legislation and why this legislation will not address the issue as it could have. The minister said, 'This legislation will shine a light.' He went on to say: 'It will require large business to be transparent to address modern slavery by establishing a flexible, risk based reporting framework. It will transform the way the Australian business community responds to modern slavery. It will create a level playing field, and businesses that fail to take action will be penalised by the market and consumers and severely tarnish their reputations.' What nonsense! Who out of the people who are currently exploiting their labour or enslaving people would do so if they had any conscience at all? If they have any conscience at all, are they going to declare what they are doing to the government every time the government asks them to annually prepare their reports? Of course they won't. It is the very people who are allowing this to happen who are the ones who are the most likely to have the lowest standards of morality and who will be the people who are not law abiding. If we're asking them to effectively turn themselves in and tell you what they are doing, it's not going to happen.


The truth of the matter is that right now people around this country are buying products from businesses that bring them in from countries where they know that the products have been made by slave labour. Again, even consumers are prepared to say: 'I'm not responsible for where the product comes from. I will buy what I can afford.' So it happens, and it happens under our very eyes. The fact that the government will publish an annual modern slavery statement is not going to resolve this problem, because the statement will rely on the information provided to it by the businesses that are expected to report, and those businesses are not going to declare anything that will harm their reputation.


If the government wants industries to comply, then the truth of the matter is that we need several other aspects to this legislation, which members of this side of the House have talked about. Firstly, there needs to be real penalties in place, and the government needs to set up an agency that is able to monitor the situation and carry out its own investigations should any reports of exploitation or slavery arise. If you have those two things together, it will mean that businesses will comply, because it is not up to them to simply report—there is another authority that's being established to ensure that they comply. If they don't, then they will be penalised accordingly, and the penalties should be severe enough to prevent exploitation taking place in the first instance.


We should also have some sort of independent authority, whether it's a commissioner or something of a similar nature, to ensure that the intent of this legislation is carried out. That person or that department should not only have the ability to ensure that the legislation or the intent of it is carried out and that the bad practices are stopped but also be a person or a department with real authority—the authority to go in, the authority to audit and inspect books if need be, and the authority to make the relevant inquiries and get the information that it needs in order to, again, ascertain whether there has been any exploitation taking place of any kind.


The last matter that concerns me about this legislation as it currently stands is that it only applies to businesses with a turnover of $100 million or more. My view is that that figure is too high, and my view is that there are many, many businesses in Australia today that already deal with overseas companies who in turn make products by using slave labour. Those companies will be left out of the net that this legislation hopes to capture. I suspect that there is as much of the slavery products resold through those companies as there is through the companies that have got a $100 million or more turnover.


Again, this legislation will not address the issue adequately. It could easily be fixed by reducing the dollar amount of companies' turnover that requires them to report annually. It could be fixed by having an independent commissioner of some sort. It could be fixed by having much higher penalties. These are matters that I would hope the government—whether it's this government or a future government—would look at, because the reality is that, rather than reducing the number of people around the world that are being treated as slaves today, we're going backwards and the figures are rising with each and every report that is prepared.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (19:25):  I rise to speak on the Modern Slavery Bill 2018. I say up-front that I wholeheartedly welcome the introduction of a modern slavery bill into this parliament. I had the idea of bringing in this legislation with some contacts put to me by a former senator from Western Australia, Chris Evans, in London a few years ago, the idea being that we copy the UK model. We have taken aspects of the United Kingdom's legislation—sadly, not all of it. It's long past time that our laws addressed the horrific reality of modern slavery and slavery-like practices. People don't need to have an image of some slave ships with manacles; there are now sweatshops and workshops where people are in slave-like conditions. Sadly, we have people enduring slavery-like practices even in our own suburbs.


Labor announced its policy to address this scourge last year. It was a policy formed after extensive consultation with stakeholders, as all good policies should be. Labor's policy received support from business, civil society and the union movement. When you have the Business Council of Australia, the ACTU and the Salvation Army all coming together to say that this is good legislation and that they're supportive of it, you know that you're consulting with stakeholders appropriately.


Labor wants to see an end to modern slavery, so it has called on the government to match its commitment. After pressure from all corners—Labor, parliamentary committees and stakeholders—the government has finally introduced this bill. But don't be fooled; unfortunately, this is not exactly the same policy put forward by the Shorten-led Australian Labor Party. Sadly, this is a much watered down version. Labor's proposed modern slavery act included transparency and supply chain mechanisms, which, importantly, contained penalties for non-compliance. Labor's policy also proposed the creation of an independent antislavery commissioner, much like the commissioner in the United Kingdom. It is disappointing that the Morrison-McCormack government has stopped short of Labor's proposal, although it is not surprising that the Morrison-McCormack government is not prepared to be tough on big business. Labor will be moving amendments to this bill to make sure it is not a toothless tiger.


I'm horrified that human trafficking, forced labour, sexual slavery, child labour and trafficking, domestic servitude, forced marriage, bonded labour—including debt bondage—and slavery are still being inflicted on our fellow human beings in the 21st century. But that is the reality. This piece of legislation is important in that it sends the message that we will not tolerate this anymore. It is drawing a line in the sand and saying 'no more' to this insidious practice of modern slavery.


There are estimated to be around 48.5 million people in slavery worldwide. Two-thirds of those trapped in slavery are in our own neighbourhood, in the Asia-Pacific region—an area where we are seen to be a beacon, a healthy democracy, as one of the five oldest democracies on the planet. We can be a role model by engaging with many of these countries.


Sadly, even on our shores here in Australia, there are estimated to be around 4,300 people who are trapped in slavery right now. Many of those are victims of exploitation in private sector activities, even in things like manufacturing, construction and agriculture—activities that we can support as Australian consumers. Some Australian companies, such as Fortescue Metals and Wesfarmers, have acknowledged that they have found forms of forced labour in their own company supply chains.


Products that we consume regularly are linked to this horrifying exploitation. One is chocolate. Australians consume three million tonnes of chocolate every year. We need to be very careful when it comes to consuming chocolate to make sure that the supply chains are appropriate, and that workers are appropriately remunerated.


Debate interrupted.

"Hart, Ross, MP",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Mr HART
 (Bass) (16:28):  Slavery is one of the most heinous, most offensive human rights abuses possible. However, shamefully, it is not something consigned to the history books despite the conflicts which featured slavery and anti-slavery forces at their core, including the American Civil War, and despite the high aspirations of the abolitionists of the 19th century. There are more people trapped in slavery in the world today than there have been at any time in human history. This has to be a shocking statistic. Walk Free Foundation estimates that there are approximately 40.3 million victims of modern slavery worldwide. Two-thirds of these people are in the Asia-Pacific region, many of them stuck in the global supply chains of products and services that Australians use every day. We, each of us, are part of the problem supporting slavery and we can be instrumental in providing a solution. 


Trafficking and slavery are occurring right here in Australia, in our suburbs and in our communities. The fact that this is happening should not be concealed. According to the Attorney-General's Department, between 2004 and 31 December 2015, the Australian Federal Police took 619 referrals for human trafficking, slavery and slavery-like practices. We cannot and should not tolerate either worker exploitation or human rights abuses. Walk Free Foundation estimates that there are thousands of people trapped in slavery right here in Australia that need our help and assistance.


The word 'slavery' conjures certain images from long ago, but there is a very modern face of slavery here in Australia that is represented in our communities in a number of ways. Modern slavery can include control of movement; control of a physical environment; psychological control; measures taken to prevent or deter escape; force; threat of force; coercion or deception; assertion of exclusivity; power to use services without commensurate compensation; subjection to cruel treatment and abuse; control of sexuality; and forced labour. We simply must do more to prevent these practices and these types of practices. They need to be reported and called out. An effective, strong, modern slavery act is a key part of that battle.


The bill that we have before us, the Modern Slavery Bill 2018, would establish a modern slavery reporting requirement to require certain large businesses and other entities in Australia to make an annual public statement on their actions to address modern slavery risks in their operations and supply chains. This is a positive development and deserves the support of this House. However, the government has refused to include in this bill penalties for companies that breach the proposed modern slavery act, and have chosen to have what is described as a business engagement unit instead of an independent antislavery commissioner, both of which were contemplated under a Labor policy and the model it proposed. This weak commitment to the most laudable policy objective is disappointing but hardly surprising from a government that has showed itself time and again to be utterly toothless and completely lacking ambition when it comes to regulating big business. Most recently, they've been distracted by their own internal shemozzle and disputes.


This weak commitment to this most laudable objective, as I said, is disappointing, but it's particularly disappointing in that over a year ago Labor announced its own modern slavery policy. Our policy announcement included a commitment to establishing a modern slavery act with a transparency in supply chain mechanism which contained penalties for noncompliance and an independent antislavery commissioner. When we announced this policy we called on the government to match our commitment because tackling slavery should be above politics. We all have good reason to make that call-out. Our policy was warmly greeted by business, civil society and the union movement. As a consequence, we've moved amendments to this bill to introduce penalties for companies that fail to comply with the modern slavery act. We'll be calling on the government to establish an office of an independent antislavery commissioner.


Labor was impressed during the development of our policy with the extensive feedback that we got after an extensive consultation process with business and civil society. Labor continues to be impressed by the genuine passion within both the business community and the broader community, and the commitment to fight slavery. The overwhelming majority of stakeholders who gave evidence to the Senate inquiry tasked with investigating the matter, including the Human Rights Law Centre, the Law Council of Australia and Oxfam, called for penalties to be a key part of this bill. This government can and must do better to tackle this appalling human rights abuse. It is an absolute imperative that any modern slavery act should have penalties for noncompliance. This should be self-evident. It cannot be left to big business alone to police themselves on this important issue. 


There are concerns that some companies would not comply with the bill in its current form. There's some instruction from overseas as to that issue. In fact, evidence provided to the Senate inquiry into this bill shows that in the UK, where there are no penalties, the percentage of businesses that reported—and who supposedly have an obligation to do so—still hovers at around 30 per cent of those. If it's an obligation, it shouldn't be limited to only 30 per cent of people complying. This is not good enough. We have an obligation to do better. Combating slavery should not be optional. There is no excuse for a culture of not looking and not asking. 


In their submission to the Senate inquiry, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the ACTU, noted that: 


The absence of sanctions seriously undermines the effectiveness of the reporting requirements for the purposes of fighting modern slavery. 


Further, the ACTU argued:


In order to make any difference to the lives of workers in Australia and abroad, the Modern Slavery Act must act as a serious motivator for companies to start acting upon the values expressed in their statements and guidelines and provide an effective deterrent for those who fall short of their obligations.


Hence, any Australian legislation enacted should include a strong enforcement mechanism imposing penalties on companies that do not comply with due diligence and reporting requirements. 


Similarly, the organisation Anti Slavery Australia, has said, as to this issue:


There have been gaps identified in this ‘market disclosure-based’ regulatory approach. Market disclosure is a weak regulatory tool for a variety of reasons, including the fact that consumers may fail to understand the implications of the disclosures, fail to collect the full range of pertinent information, or lack the resources or expertise to fully research issues. Furthermore, consumers’ decisions may continue shaped by economic considerations, rather than adverse human trafficking or slavery disclosures. There is also limited empirical evidence concerning the effect of ethical considerations on consumer behaviour. On the contrary, research has shown that only between 3% and 10% of consumers are willing to modify their purchasing decisions based on social or environmental criteria.  


Moreover, the same organisation continued on to say: 


As such, market-regulated disclosure legislation is not appropriate in situations where the risks associated with certain activities is not catastrophic or likely to give rise to grave consequences. Without an adequate penalty or sanction to deter non-compliance with reporting obligations, there is little incentive for organisations to engage with supply chain transparency. The serious risk of criminal slavery and human trafficking being supported and hidden by complex supply chains necessitates a stronger regulatory framework.


Penalties for noncompliance of reporting obligations are a key part of Labor's policy, as is the establishment of an office of an independent antislavery commissioner. We need an independent commissioner to assist victims, not just a support unit for big business. I say again: victims deserve an independent commissioner for their assistance, particularly having regard to their weak position. The government's decision to walk away from an independent commissioner in exchange for a business engagement unit shows that their primary concern is, as always, protecting big business.


There are, according to the statistics that I've seen, an estimated 4,300 people trapped in slavery in Australia. But, as Senate estimates last year revealed, we only have had seven slavery convictions in half a decade—4,300 people trapped in slavery but only seven convictions. We urgently need a commissioner to help victims and to crack down on this sickening crime. Victims of modern slavery are often incredibly vulnerable and face cultural, social, economic and language barriers. 


There are also significant gaps in the support services we provide for victims of modern slavery. A commissioner would assist to remedy these gaps in enforcement, help victims and work with civil society to help prevent and detect slavery in Australia. Key stakeholders, including ACRATH, Anti-Slavery Australia and the ACTU, have joined Labor in the call for the establishment of the independent antislavery commissioner. The Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia, for example, in their submission to the Senate inquiry argued that the creation of an independent antislavery commissioner would be vital to securing the cooperation of key stakeholders and increasing successful outcomes. Certainly evidence in the first year after the UK established via legislation its independent antislavery commissioner showed that more victims were identified, more proactive and reactive police investigations were undertaken, more prosecutions and convictions were achieved, judicial awareness was notably increasing and more training was put in place.


Key stakeholders and well-respected independent voices have added powerful support to the proposition advanced by Labor that I'm putting here today. Fiona McLeod SC has stated: 'It is critical that someone independent of government with the capacity to speak to government, NGOs, unions and business holds the office of antislavery commissioner. In-house public servants providing information to the public with no compulsory powers will be inherently weaker and less effective than the creation of an independent officer. Evidence presented through the Modern Slavery Act inquiry process shows that Australia is a world leader in antislavery laws. But the awareness of the laws is low, enforcement is weak—certainly the existence of only seven prosecutions shows that—and there are gaps in communication between civil society and criminal frameworks despite efforts to reduce these.'


Labor has set, in my submission, the standard for a policy. The amendments that we propose to this legislation, I think, make right the deficiencies within this bill. Labor will be fighting to ensure that Australia gets a modern slavery act that will actually make a difference.


In closing, I'd like to add again to the submissions that were made and the public comments that have been made by civil society in connection with this issue of modern slavery. I speak as a former President of the Law Society of Tasmania and a member of the Law Council of Australia. I think that this parliament should listen to the representations made by organisations like the Law Council of Australia. The Law Council of Australia strongly supports the fact that we need tougher penalties in this legislation and we need the independence of that antislavery commissioner. It's vitally important that we consider that this has operation not just within Australia but also within the supply chains that apply to these large corporations. This is something that is a national and international scandal. We have an opportunity to do something about it. We should do it now.

"Kearney, Ged, MP",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Ms KEARNEY
 (Batman) (16:43):  I'm incredibly proud to rise today to speak on the Modern Slavery Bill 2018. As the ACTU president, I had the honour of standing with the member for Hotham to support her announcement over a year ago of Labor's commitment to a modern slavery act. I thank the member for Hotham for the work and time she's put into this issue.


I am proud the Labor Party has led the way with this. Tackling slavery and exploitation is core to our mission. If we are honest, we are only here today debating this bill because the government succumbed to Labor's leadership and pressure. But, like with so many other issues, the government has produced watered-down, less-effective legislation. If the government is going to follow Labor's lead, I wish they'd do it properly.


The bill seeks to establish a modern slavery reporting requirement to require certain large businesses and other entities in Australia to make public on an annual basis their actions to address modern slavery risks in their operations and supply chains. This is long overdue and welcome news, but there are two crucial elements to tackling slavery that this bill is missing: penalties for noncompliance and the introduction of an independent antislavery commissioner. These were put forward by Labor in our modern slavery act, an announcement which was warmly greeted by business, union and civil society stakeholders. Labor is proposing amendments so that the bill includes penalties and an independent antislavery commissioner. These amendments force companies to take seriously their obligations regarding due diligence in their supply chain. If the government won't support them, it will prove they are not serious about tackling the scourge of modern slavery.


In my previous role as president of the ACTU I worked with the Labor government on their modern slavery policy. Through this process and my own personal experience in the union movement I learned about the extent and horror of modern slavery. It's not a faraway issue or a distant problem. It's not someone else's issue; it's our issue. There are more people trapped in slavery in the world today than ever before. The Walk Free Foundation estimates that there are 40.3 million victims of modern slavery worldwide. Two-thirds of these poor people are in our region, the Asia-Pacific region, many of them stuck in the global supply chains of products and services which Australians use every day.


Figures vary with respect to the number of people enslaved in Australia. The Global Slavery Index estimates that there could be around 15,000 people currently trapped in modern slavery right here in Australia. Trafficking and slavery are occurring in our suburbs and communities. That should shock people. When people think of slaves their minds take them to past notions of slavery as an issue which perhaps has been solved. This could not be further from the truth. Research shows that those high-risk areas and industries where workers are most likely to be held in slave-like conditions in Australia are, not surprisingly, industries that engage workers on employer sponsored visa arrangements, where temporary low-skilled migrant workers are trapped far away from home. These workers are vulnerable to forced labour exploitation, starting with exploitation by those who facilitate their journey to Australia.


According to the 2018 Global Slavery Index those industries that are high risk for forced labour include agriculture, construction, domestic work, meat processing, cleaning, hospitality and food services. There are red flags for identifying victims of modern slavery. These include workers being housed in substandard accommodation, illegal pay deductions for food or rent, situations of debt bondage, confiscation of passports and pay well below the minimum wage. There have even been cases of exploitation of domestic workers who have endured and escaped conditions of modern slavery in diplomatic households right here in Canberra.


Individuals reported withholding of passports, working excessive hours, low wages and threats to themselves or even to their family back home as well as restrictions on their movement. The majority of modern slavery victims identified by authorities to date have been women from Asia who have been exploited within the sex industry. While modern slavery occurs within Australia, the realities of global trade and business make it inevitable that products bought, sold and consumed here have been brought about by enslaved workers just off our shores. The offshore industries most likely to engage in modern slave labour are those involved in making laptops, computers, mobile phones, apparel and clothing, fish products like tinned tuna, and rice and cocoa.


Australia has a big role to play in fixing this issue. As a country, as a parliament, we simply must do more to prevent this practice. An effective, strong, modern slavery act is a key part of that battle, which is why it is so disappointing that the government has put forward a modern slavery bill without penalties for companies that fail to comply with the act's requirements. This is an incredibly serious misstep, though it's no surprise coming from a government who constantly kowtows to big business.


Essentially, the government is setting up a scheme that provides a written obligation for companies to do something with no penalties if they don't comply. Companies will be free to decide if they can comply with this or not. That's not good enough. If the royal commission into the financial sector has taught us anything, it is that self-regulation and self-reporting are a farce and don't work. We cannot trust big business to police themselves on slavery within their own business or supply chains. I note with interest that the NAB, one of the star witnesses at the banking royal commission, which has been setting the bar lower and lower every day with allegations of misconduct including charging deceased people fees, does not support the key plank of Labor's amendments—that is, the introduction of an antislavery commissioner. Do we really believe a simple self-report mechanism will work with these big businesses? Evidence provided to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill showed that in the UK, where there were no penalties, the percentage of businesses that have reported still hovers around 30 per cent of those who have an obligation to do so. I'm sorry, but that is not good enough. As the ACTU said in their submission:


In order to make any difference to the lives of workers in Australia and abroad, the Modern Slavery Act must act as a serious motivator for companies to start acting upon the values expressed in their statements and guidelines and provide an effective deterrent for those who fall short of their obligations.


Hence, any Australian legislation enacted should include a strong enforcement mechanism imposing penalties on companies that do not comply with due diligence and reporting requirements.


The risk of noncompliance is real and high and it is obvious that this would severely undermine the effectiveness of the act and the goal to help eliminate modern slavery in supply chains. If the government want to be serious about tackling modern slavery, they must support Labor's amendments. If they do not, they just prove to the Australian people that once again they are utterly toothless when it comes to regulating big business, which brings us to our second point about how the government has completely fluffed this legislation, which lacks the establishment of an office of an independent antislavery commissioner. Rather, the government intends to establish a modern slavery business engagement unit within the Department of Home Affairs. A unit buried deep in the department, charged with engaging with reporting entities, will not be able to fulfil all the tasks that would make the act effective.


It is critical that someone independent of government, with the capacity to speak out to government, NGOs, unions and business, holds the role of the antislavery commissioner. In Senate estimates last year, it was revealed we have only had seven slavery convictions in half a decade. As I mentioned before, the prevalence of modern slavery is far greater than that. We urgently need a commissioner to help victims and crackdown on this sickening crime. In the United Kingdom, the independence of the commissioner has been vital in ensuring cooperation from business and in addressing labour exploitation in creative and proactive ways. This has increased reporting of breaches of the act, victim identification and, ultimately, successful prosecutions. The role of the commissioner as someone who can engage with victims of slavery is incredibly important.


Victims are incredibly vulnerable and face cultural, social, economic and language barriers in wresting themselves free from their situation. They often have a mistrust and fear of police and government authority in general, which is why so many of my colleagues in the union movement have been the ones coming across these workers and trying to advocate for them and for justice. Union organisers are close to the workplace and workers. They build up trust and camaraderie over time, which is vital in helping the victims of forced labour to come forward and speak up. The unions show empathy and compassion and, sadly, often find themselves unable to properly advocate for these workers. In fact, comrades in the CFMEU have been fined for going on site to help workers caught in situations like this. The fact of the matter is the organisers can encourage the use of and provide explanation of the role of an independent commissioner, a concept that hopefully the workers will be more likely to engage with.


There are also significant gaps in the support services we provide for victims of modern slavery. As the entrapped victims are mostly from foreign countries, language is a massive issue and interpreters are essential. Many of them have no understanding of their rights as workers, of what their pay and conditions should be, of occupational health and safety, of the industrial relations issues with respect to representation or even joining a union. They have no idea of who to go to for help. They may not even understand the banking system or payment modes or what the employer can charge them for rent or food and so on.


We have a responsibility, to workers in this country, for their safety and to ensure they know their rights and can have them enforced. A commissioner would assist to remedy these gaps, help victims and work with civil society to help prevent and detect slavery in Australia. The government's decision to walk away from independent commissioner in exchange for a business engagement unit shows that their primary concern is, as always, protecting big business with little regard for the real barriers the victims face.


In Labor's amendments, we propose that the commissioner will also lead our global efforts to fight slavery, including working with other countries and international organisations. It's incredibly important that the government agrees to this. If we are to have any impact on modern slavery in the global supply chains, we will need global cooperation and international instruments.


I was a delegate to the International Labour Conference for many years and had the honour of being elected to the governing body of the ILO. I have seen firsthand the importance of international cooperation and globally negotiated instruments, like standards and conventions, in combating serious issues, like slavery, and in enforcing rights around the world. Indeed, I've had the pleasure and honour of negotiating a number of these with employers and governments, but I also know that working domestically is just as important.


As I said, I am very proud to speak on this legislation today. It is long overdue. It acknowledges that modern slavery is occurring in our region because of our products and it's our responsibility to fix it. If the government supports Labor's amendments, it will be a bill we can trust will actually go much further to address that responsibility.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (16:57):  Labor is proud to have led on the issue of modern slavery in Australia. Our proposal for a modern slavery act made by the shadow minister for justice, the member for Hotham, in June 2017, has finally prompted the government to act. We welcome the fact that the government has introduced this bill, the Modern Slavery Bill 2018.


Modern slavery is a horrific problem that is more prevalent in our society than many realise. It's estimated by the Walk Free Foundation that there are 40.3 million victims of modern slavery worldwide. Two-thirds of those people are in the Asia-Pacific, where many of the products we buy every day are made. It's fair to say that many Australians would not be aware of the extent of this problem, but modern slavery occurs both in our region and here in Australia—on our streets and in our homes. In fact, there are an estimated 4,300 people trapped in slavery in Australia right now. It's time to do something about that and to take as tough an approach as we can. With this in mind, Labor supports the intent of this bill but believes it can be so much better than it currently is.


Currently, this bill imposes a modern slavery reporting requirement which applies to businesses with revenues of more than $100 million a year which are based in Australia or operate in Australia. It requires the company to make a modern slavery statement once a year which details: the entity's structure, operations and supply chains; the modern slavery risks in the entity's operations and supply chains; the actions the entity has taken to assess and address those risks, including due diligence and remediation processes; and how the entity assesses the effectiveness of those actions. This is good detail. However, there is one large problem with the government's proposed bill: this requirement is not enforced in any way. Companies are free to completely ignore this statutory requirement and will face no penalty. In sum, it is a completely toothless law.


I think it says everything about how this government approaches big business. They are too cosy with their big business mates. They are so frightened of standing up to them that they will not even stand up for a cause as important as this. When it comes to regulating big business, this government are just hopeless. We saw it first in their ongoing refusal to hold a royal commission into the financial services sector until the banks asked them for it, and then of course they said yes. They are in the middle of an apparent fight to the death—goodness knows why—to give their big business mates an $80 billion tax cut. Is it surprising that they would commit to the virtue signal of modern slavery reporting requirements without being willing to enforce compliance? Of course not. It's just another part of their pattern of cosying up to their big business mates. On an issue as important as this, we should not leave it to big business to police themselves. Evidence proves it. In the United Kingdom, where they also do not have penalties for not meeting reporting requirements, only 30 per cent of eligible businesses comply.


By contrast, Labor is committed to strong penalties for noncompliance. Labor wants to see the following added to this bill: firstly, a civil penalty provision for failure to report, with an immediate start date, with 1,000 penalty units to apply; secondly, a civil penalty provision for submitting an inadequate report, with a delayed start date of two years from the date on which the bill receives royal assent, also with 1,000 penalty units to apply; and, thirdly, a requirement that the minister report annually to the parliament on the companies that have failed to comply with the act. We will move amendments to the bill to this effect, and we urge the crossbench to join with us to ensure that the good intent of this bill is made real.


Another very disappointing element of the government's bill is the absence of an office of an independent antislavery commissioner, as Labor has proposed. Instead, the government is proposing, if you can believe it, something called a modern slavery business engagement unit inside the Department of Home Affairs to support Australian businesses under the new laws. It all sounds very friendly, doesn't it? But it is completely the wrong way around. We want a body to assist victims, not to assist businesses. We want a body that supports victims, not businesses. We want a body to identify issues, if necessary, publicly; not an engagement unit buried within a huge department with, as I understand it, some 23,000 employees. Like so often with the coalition, their priorities are completely wrong. Labor's model of a commissioner would be independent. A commissioner would take a holistic approach to the problem of modern slavery, looking at gaps in law enforcement, encouraging cultural change and examining support services, among other things. A commissioner would play a public advocacy role, help victims and work with civil society to help prevent and detect slavery in Australia.


I met with the former United Kingdom Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner, Kevin Hyland OBE, in May this year. Though that position has not been without its problems, Mr Hyland played a vital role in the three years he was commissioner in the United Kingdom. Mr Hyland's position was created, I would note, under a conservative government. Among his achievements, Mr Hyland lists an over 100 per cent increase in the identification of potential victims referred for support, an unprecedented uplift in policing operations, training for the judiciary and a significant increase in public awareness, including a four-month campaign with two newspapers. Mr Hyland also played a regional and global role, including working with the United Kingdom's trading partners and undertaking advocacy at the United Nations. I left my meeting with Mr Hyland in no doubt of the need for Australia to have its own independent antislavery commissioner.


For the government to look at the achievements of Mr Hyland, as I assume they did, and for the government to have looked at the model proposed by Labor for an independent antislavery commissioner and then to suggest that it will be good enough to have a business engagement unit buried in the Department of Home Affairs is simply laughable. Come on! Are they really so blinded by their devotion to big business that they cannot see that their real priorities should be the victims of modern slavery instead? Labor calls on the government, in the strongest possible terms, to establish an office of an independent antislavery commissioner. The bill would be incomplete without it.


Finally, this government has, oddly and unnecessarily, conflated the issue of forced marriage with modern slavery in this bill. They are related, of course, but entirely separate in terms of how they should be tackled as issues. In fact Labor has an entirely separate policy on tackling the issue of forced marriage. As the shadow minister for justice, the member for Hotham, said when we announced our policy in June this year:


Forced marriage is an abuse of human rights.


It can create 'a structure through which subjugation, abuse and sexual assault can occur over decades'. She said:


A failure to adequately prevent, address and respond to this practice is a failure to protect individuals—including young people and children—from crime and abuse.


Labor's policy to stamp out forced marriage in Australia includes the introduction of forced-marriage protection orders, which will ensure civil protections are available to help all persons at risk of forced marriage, not limited by age. Labor would also provide an additional $2.25 million to civil society groups over four years to adequately resource the key organisations working on the ground to support victims.


Bizarrely, the government has brought forced marriage under the definition of the forms of modern slavery required to be reported on by business. Do not get me wrong: Labor supports efforts to eliminate modern slavery from Australia—it is an abhorrent practice—but requiring businesses to inquire after the marriage status and private lives of their employees is surely not the way to go about it. In fact, this could be completely counterproductive, forcing victims further into hiding. An advocacy group, Good Shepherd, stated in its submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill:


Ordinarily it is not the role of business to inquire into the private lives of its employees, contractors or suppliers (or employees of its contractors) in order to identify practices such as forced marriage. If we liken the practice of forced marriage to that of family violence, corporate responsibility lies with supporting the wellbeing of individuals impacted by violence, not in identification and reporting on violence.


I would urge the government to seriously rethink this part of the bill and focus on introducing a separate, strong, forced-marriage policy of its own.


In sum, we in Labor are glad the government has finally acted on the issue of modern slavery. It's important that tackling this ghastly problem has bipartisan support. If necessary, we will support even the government's partial solution in the form of this bill. But the government can and must do better. We cannot rely on self-policing in an area as important as this. Penalties are necessary. I urge the government to support our amendments to this bill.

Dr ALY
 (Cowan) (17:08):  I think that, if you spoke to most people about slavery, the perception that they would have is that slavery was something that ended in the 19th century with the abolition of slavery. In 2013, when I was establishing a not-for-profit, non-government organisation, I consulted with Walk Free, which has done some fabulous work in modern slavery, about what some of the challenges were in establishing their not-for-profit. Back then, which is five years ago now, they spoke to me about how increasing awareness of modern slavery and what modern slavery is was probably the first horizon of the work that they needed to do, because there was such a lack of information but also a lack of awareness about what modern slavery actually constitutes. For me to stand up here in parliament five years on and speak in support of a Modern Slavery Act is actually quite momentous when you consider that, just five years ago, it was my very first time to hear about modern slavery, particularly in speaking with a not-for-profit, non-government organisation that dealt in that area. Modern slavery is a term that we use to refer to a whole range of exploitive practices that include slavery and slavery-like conditions such as debt bondage, servitude, forced marriage, forced labour and human trafficking, also referred to as trafficking in persons.


Most recently a global estimate—and it's only ever an estimate, because it's difficult to collect data on this—of the extent of modern slavery was that on any given day around 40 million people around the world are victims of modern slavery. Compared to this global phenomenon the estimated prevalence of modern slavery in Australia is relatively low, but it does exist here in Australia. There are victims of modern slavery here in Australia, but it is more likely that modern slavery exists in the supply chains for goods and services sold here in Australia and by Australian companies. This bill goes some way in attempting to address this, but I have some reservations, as have been expressed by my other colleagues from this side of the House, about just how far and how effective this bill is, and I'll talk about them in a minute.


The bill requires that entities based or operating in Australia prepare annual statements on potential modern slavery risks in their operations and supply chains and the steps that they've taken to address those risks. Labor's support for this bill is fundamentally about the desperate need for a modern slavery act. As a starting point this bill indicates an awareness of modern slavery and a willingness to at least define modern slavery, but it doesn't go far enough. Several members from this side of the House have spoken about the shortfalls in the bill and the amendments that Labor has put forward to ensure that this bill is impactful and effects much-needed change in addressing modern slavery.


This bill has a couple of particularly worrying shortfalls. The first is to do with compliance measures. There are no penalties for any of the companies that are found to be utilising modern slavery in their supply chains. On top of that, compliance with the provisions of the bill is voluntary. You don't have to comply, and if you do not comply then there are no penalties for that. Many of the civil society stakeholders have argued that, without any kinds of compliance measures, the supposedly mandatory reporting requirements in the bill are effectively made voluntary. I'll give you some quotes about why this is so important:


The Law Council considers that without penalties, a mandatory reporting requirement is rendered merely aspirational—


We hear a lot about aspiration from that side of the House, don't we? Perhaps this is what they mean—


as there is no enforcement mechanism, nor any consequence for non-compliance.


…   …   …




While the Law Council appreciates that there may be reputational costs for non-compliance, the ability and willingness of civil society to identify non-compliant entities, the media to expose them, and consumers to react appropriately, are easily overstated. In addition, reputational risk does not apply equally to all entities, but mostly to consumer-facing entities.



The Human Rights Law Centre pointed to the low rate of compliance with the UK scheme in making their case for penalties for noncompliance. They said:


… the failure to include penalties for non-compliance in the UK has led to extremely low rates of reporting … and even fewer reporting against all of the recommended criteria. It is clear that the threat of reputational damage alone is not a sufficient incentive to ensure compliance, particularly for businesses whose public profile, scale, services or products are not reputation-sensitive.


Even the UK's Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner stated in April 2018 that compliance with the UK act's reporting requirements had been 'patchy at best'. He said:


While some companies are showing leadership, others are producing generic statements with little substantive detail or failing to produce them at all. In 2017, 43 of the FTSE 100 failed to be compliant with the basic requirements of this legislation.


If this is the model before us, if this is the example that we have before us, why wouldn't we learn from the mistakes and shortfalls of the UK legislation, really take this seriously and include compliance in this bill?


Instead, what this government has proposed is some kind of fluffy, friendly engagement unit based within the Department of Home Affairs. I'm not quite sure what any kind of engagement unit would do, but I think that several members have spoken quite strongly on the fact that this setting up of an engagement unit shows very much that this government's focus is on appeasing business rather than looking after and looking out for the victims of modern slavery. That's very clear, and I'd like to reiterate that here. The second of those shortfalls is that the bill doesn't provide for an independent antislavery commissioner and doesn't require the government to publish a list of entities required to report, which would actually greatly assist in identifying any entities that failed to report.


On the topic of the antislavery commissioner, I find it quite interesting because there have been a number of inquiries since I've been in this parliament—at least two that I've found—that make recommendations around a modern slavery act and recommendations about how we should approach this scourge of modern slavery as well as our responsibilities around that. One of them comes out of the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, which undertook an inquiry into human trafficking as well as antislavery provisions; it was on human trafficking and slavery. They made several recommendations in their report—I'm a member of that committee—I'll go through a couple of them.


One of them is that the committee recommended that the Commonwealth government increase the number of Australian Federal Police officers with specialised human trafficking and antislavery training in all states and territories. Well, I don't see the government doing any of that! It recommended that the government expand training for frontline staff employed by the AFP, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection—which would now be Home Affairs—and the Fair Work Ombudsman with respect to Commonwealth offences, divisions 270 and 271 of the Criminal Code Act 1995.


It also recommended that the Commonwealth government considered appointing an antislavery and trafficking commissioner to monitor the implementation of the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking and Slavery 2015–19; to provide recommendations, advice and guidance; and to oversee the effectiveness of Commonwealth legislation and policies intended to reduce the prevalence of human trafficking, slavery and slavery-like practices and respond to corresponding offences. It makes a number of other recommendations, particularly with regard to strengthening visa protections, but, quite interestingly, all of those recommendations are about looking after victims. They have a focus on victims and have a focus on doing something substantive to actually stop modern slavery.


The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade had an inquiry into establishing a modern slavery act in Australia. The report is called Hidden in plain sight. Guess what this inquiry recommended? It recommended the introduction of a modern slavery act. Okay. It also recommended provisions for an independent antislavery commissioner; mandatory supply chain reporting that requires certain entities to report on modern slavery risks; measures to support victims of modern slavery, including establishing a national compensation scheme; and measures to improve criminal justice responses to modern slavery. It recommends that the Australian government establish an independent antislavery commissioner under the proposed modern slavery act with powers and resources to undertake several functions, including the overseeing and implementation of a national action plan; investigation and compliance; support services to victims; education guidance and awareness training for government agencies; engaging with government and entities on the implementation and operation of supply chain reporting; collecting and analysing data; undertaking legislated reviews of the proposed modern slavery act at least every three years; improving coordination between criminal justice agencies; providing advice on how to improve the modern slavery act et cetera.


It's quite confounding that the government has come up with a modern slavery act that really only touches the tip of the iceberg, that does not go far enough and that does not provide for any kind of substantive action to address the issue of modern slavery—an issue that I earlier said affects 40 million people worldwide and that we know Australian companies are partaking in through their supply chains. It really does nothing to address that at all.


In closing, I reiterate, firstly, our support for the principle of a modern slavery act. It's been a long time coming, and we welcome that. Secondly, I also record my disappointment that this act does not go far enough and that this government hasn't heeded any of the recommendations of inquiries and reports that have been undertaken by this parliament. I reiterate again that, on the amendments put forward by Labor to strengthen the act, including around compliance and for a modern antislavery commissioner, we would be willing to work with the government on achieving those and on achieving real, effective change and effective responses to modern slavery.

"Keogh, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Mr KEOGH
 (Burt) (17:23):  I rise also to speak on the Modern Slavery Bill. When we think about slavery, often this brings to mind images of workers in fields suffering terrible abuse at the hands of their masters and being marched across deserts, and images of chained hands and scars from lashings. Growing up in late 20th century Australia, this is what comes to mind—historical injustices. You wouldn't immediately consider working in a family restaurant in Northbridge as a form of slavery. You wouldn't expect working as a brickie in Southern River as a form of slavery. You certainly wouldn't expect a new marriage in Australia to be shrouding exploitation.


It is reprehensible that there are more people trapped in slavery in the world today than there have been at any other time in human history. The Walk Free Foundation estimates that there are more than 40 million victims of modern slavery in the world today. Right here in Australia, I'm repulsed to say the number of individuals trapped in a cycle of exploitation is estimated to be in the thousands. Human trafficking, slavery and exploitation are occurring in our suburbs behind closed doors. As a country and as a parliament, we are obligated to do more to prevent these practices. A robust modern slavery act is a step in the right direction.


This bill establishes a modern slavery reporting requirement that requires large businesses and other entities to make annual public statements on their actions to address modern slavery risks in their operations and, importantly, in their supply chains. Many of these big companies have already experienced cases of modern slavery in their supply chains and have found them, and are now leading the charge in combatting this deplorable practice once and for all. Even mining magnate and founder of the Walk Free Foundation, Andrew Forrest, discovered slavery in the supply chain of his own Fortescue Metals Group in 2012. Thousands of workers connected to one of our country's biggest companies were earning next to nothing and their passports were being held to ransom by their employer. Upon finding this, Mr Forrest said the supplier claimed no knowledge of these slavery-type practices and their response was instantaneous: passports were returned, illegal recruitment fees were back paid and major overhauls were made to ensure this did not happen again.


It's proactivity like this from big business that will ensure modern slavery is then tackled head-on, but we need to support them in doing so; we need to ensure that there is a level playing field for them. This bill will ensure that businesses are constantly reviewing their supply chains and business practices so that they can catch out this dastardly behaviour in their supply chains and bring financial pressure to bear in an effort to eradicate such modern slavery. The bill requires entities with annual revenue of more than $100 million to make a public statement on a yearly annual basis of their actions to address modern slavery risks in their operation and their supply chains.


Labor support this bill, but we feel that this bill doesn't go far enough. Tackling slavery and exploitation is core to Labor's mission and in no way, shape or form do we tolerate worker exploitation or human rights abuses of any kind. We recognise that modern slavery is a hidden problem that won't be discovered without meaningful attempts to expose it and requirements on businesses to check their supply chains to that end. It's why, over a year ago, Labor committed to legislating a modern slavery act with penalties for noncompliance.


We believe the bill now before the House should include a strong enforcement mechanism, imposing penalties on those who do not comply with the act. We recognise that the implementation of this reporting obligation will be significant for all companies, so we worry that, without penalties, companies may not be sufficiently incentivised to comply with the bill's requirements. The reason for our scepticism is not unfounded. Last year's Senate inquiry heard that, in the three years since the implementation of the UK's similar antislavery act, only about half of the 11,000 or so organisations that were required to report had produced their slavery and human trafficking statements. Combatting slavery should not be optional. It is an obligation of a progressive society such as ours. We cannot turn our eyes away from what is occurring. Bad things happen when good people say and do nothing. There is simply no excuse for not looking. This is why we are moving amendments to introduce penalties for failing to comply with the modern slavery act provisions.


We are not alone in this mindset, with the overwhelming majority of stakeholders who gave evidence to last year's Senate committee inquiry calling for penalties to be included in the bill as well—organisations like the Human Rights Law Centre, who told the committee:


The Bill should be amended to include a robust enforcement framework, including penalties for entities that fail to report or provide inadequate, false or misleading information. Penalties should include both financial and non-financial penalties …


These sentiments were echoed by Anti-Slavery Australia, Australian Lawyers for Human Rights, Oxfam, Stop the Traffik, the Law Council of Australia, the Advisory Committee of the Modern Slavery Registry, the ACTU, the Ethnic Communities Council of Victoria and the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia—and that is not all.


These supply chain reporting requirements must divulge specific information, including information about the company's supply chain where risk has been identified in that supply chain, what steps are being taken to ensure slavery isn't part of that supply chain and how they are training staff to manage all of this appropriately. A list of the companies required to report will be publicly available for the sake of transparency and a central repository of statements will ensure each company is meeting their obligations, or at least allow the public to check. It's only through such steps that this parliament can take the first steps to combating modern slavery.


In conjunction with this, we are calling on the government to remove forced marriage from the reporting requirements. Stakeholders are concerned the inclusion of forced marriage will have unintended consequences. After all, it is not ordinarily the role of business to inquire into the private lives of their employees. It is up to businesses to support employees that might find themselves in family violence situations and possible forced marriage. But we do not believe it is appropriate for this form of modern slavery to be addressed in this particular bill. 


We are well aware Australia's current approach to forced marriage is not working. Under the current government, we haven't had a single successful prosecution of forced marriage offences under the Criminal Code. Of course, that doesn't mean that it's not happening. We instead propose that we should establish a forced marriage unit to provide a one-stop shop to connect victims to the support that they need and to remove the cooperation requirements as part of our forced marriage protection order, among other things. We ask the government to match Labor's forced marriage policy commitment, in order to give these victims the support they need, rather than driving this repulsive practice further underground.


We also ask that the government go back to the drawing board and propose a second reading amendment in this House to establish an office of an independent antislavery commissioner. This current bill proposes a modern slavery business engagement unit. Essentially, this would be a unit buried in the Department of Home Affairs, focused on assisting business in fulfilling their reporting requirements, but not actively helping victims to get the help that they need. This will not be seen as a solution to the problem and it won't do anything to assist the thousands of people trapped in slavery in Australia now. We call on the government to establish an office of an independent antislavery commissioner, because we know victims in Australia deserve more than another bureaucratic big business liaison unit. We need an independent commissioner to assist victims and to remedy the current gaps in law enforcement. 


Last year's Senate estimates revealed we only had seven slavery convictions in Australia in the last five years. Victims of modern slavery are often some of society's most vulnerable. They are often individuals with cultural, social economic and language disadvantage. An independent commissioner would have the capacity to not only support these victims after the fact, but to work with civil society to prevent and detect this sickening spiral of crime.


The underground nature of slavery makes it very difficult for authorities to detect and even more complex to investigate and prosecute. The intention would be for the commissioner to work with victims of slavery to resolve inquiries and complaints. In addition, they would have the capacity to assist business to build best-practice structures and to receive inquiries and complaints. 


Through the implementation of an independent commissioner, we would be following in the footsteps of the similar legislation that is currently in place in the United Kingdom, France, California and the European Union. Through this approach, we would expect the commissioner to work with these other countries and international organisations to lead the global effort to fight slavery. A number of consulted key stakeholders are in support of this proposal, including the Australian Catholic Religious Against Trafficking in Humans, Anti Slavery Australia and Walk Free. 


Stop the Traffik told us: 'There are at least six government departments whose engagement and action will be required to implement the act effectively. An independent commissioner would be able to work with these departments in a more effective manner than one department. It is the nature of government departments that they are siloed with different priorities and different ministers. Through an adequately supported and resourced independent commissioner, this matter would be given the priority status that it deserves.' 


The Australian Lawyers Alliance furthered this thought, saying that an independent commissioner would 'strengthen Australia's response to combatting modern slavery'. They said it could undertake the legislated review of the modern slavery act every three years to ensure the long-term effectiveness of the legislation and hold big business to account for compliance. 


Labor will not oppose this bill in the House, as the passage of this bill is vital to combat the scourge of modern slavery. However, we do implore this government to add penalties to the bill, remove forced marriage and re-evaluate the need for an antislavery commissioner. By enacting a robust modern slavery act in Australia with these amendments, this parliament in a bipartisan manner will be ensuring we are doing all that we can, as we should, together, in modern 21st century Australia, to eradicate modern slavery during our lifetime.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (17:35):  I too rise to speak on the Modern Slavery Bill 2018. I do so because this is a very important bill being debated here in parliament. Members of parliament should make it our mission to stand up for those who are some of the most vulnerable people in our communities, for those who need us to be their voice, and I couldn't think of a better way to do so than in the debate on this particular bill, which deals with modern slavery in today's world. As we heard from other speakers earlier, you would think that slavery ended in the 19th century. But, unfortunately and sadly, it exists today. It exists all around the world and even here in our own nation.


The purpose of this bill, I suppose, is to establish a reporting requirement that requires certain businesses and other entities in Australia to make annual public statements on their actions to address modern slavery—the modern slavery risks in their operations and supply chains. I'm proud to say that this was a Labor initiative for fighting modern slavery. Over a year ago, Labor committed to a modern slavery act with penalties and an independent antislavery commissioner in an announcement which was warmly greeted by businesses, unions and civil society stakeholders.


We know that slavery is one of the most heinous human rights abuses possible. There are more people trapped in slavery in the world today than there have been at any other time in human history. As a country, as a parliament, we simply must do more to prevent this horrible, horrendous practice, and an effective modern strong slavery act is a key part of this battle. A year ago, on this side of the House, we committed to a modern slavery act with penalties, as I said, and an independent antislavery commissioner. It was deeply disappointing that the government's put forward this bill, which we'll be supporting because it's a way forward, but without penalties—in other words, a toothless tiger.


The government has chosen to have a business engagement unit instead of an independent antislavery commission or commissioner—I mean, honestly, a business engagement unit! Let's deal with the victims of modern slavery, not set up a toothless tiger that engages but doesn't enforce. Let's not be fooled here. This isn't the carrot-and-stick approach; it's all carrot. There is no stick—it's enough carrot to embarrass Bugs Bunny! This weak commitment is so disappointing but hardly surprising from this government that has shown itself time after time to be utterly toothless when it comes to regulating big business.


Here we have an opportunity to actually do something about slavery to ensure that big businesses do have a process or a system in place that ensures that their supply chain doesn't engage in slavery. But if there is no incentive, if there is no stick at the end of it, why go through it? Unfortunately, without any way of enforcing this through fines, et cetera, I just can't see it taking off and being an instrument that will curb slavery. It's a weak commitment. It's disappointing but, as I said, it is hardly surprising from a government which, from time to time, has shown itself to be utterly useless when it comes to regulating big businesses.


The absence of penalties in this bill is absolutely baffling. We cannot leave it to big business to police themselves on slavery. We are talking about slavery; we are not talking about something minor. We could take this government's explanation and say: 'Okay, let's see how a no-penalty model goes. Maybe we're the first to do this.' Well, you'd be wrong. We heard other speakers speak on this earlier: evidence provided to the Senate inquiry into this bill showed that in the UK, where there are no penalties, the percentage of businesses that have reported, of those that supposedly have an obligation to do so, still hovers around the 30 per cent mark. There it is: no penalty, no difference. It fails the test.


Civil society has argued passionately for companies who breach the Modern Slavery Act to be penalised. The overwhelming majority of stakeholders who gave evidence to the Senate inquiry, including the Human Rights Law Centre, the Law Council of Australia, Oxfam and FECCA, all called for penalties to be included in the bill. Labor will be moving amendments to introduce penalties into this bill, because combatting slavery should not be optional. There is simply no excuse for not looking.


We also need an independent commissioner to assist victims who are trapped in slavery in our towns and cities, and to lead our nation's fight against this practice within our region. We heard some examples earlier of how it takes place here in Australia. Women are being sent over from Asia to work in horrendous situations, being told they'll be doing something else, and they are not able to leave because their families may be bonded back home. They're trapped in slavery right here in Australia.


It's estimated that an incredible 4,300 people are currently trapped in slavery here in Australia. These are the victims of modern slavery. Victims of modern slavery are often incredibly vulnerable and face cultural, social, economic and language barriers, especially when they're away from their own country. There are also significant gaps in the support services we provide for victims of modern slavery. An independent antislavery commissioner is urgently needed to deal with these issues, to help remedy these gaps in enforcement, to help the victims and to work with civil society to help prevent and detect slavery here in Australia.


The government's decision to walk away from an independent commissioner in exchange for a business engagement unit—the title tells you all. It shows that the government's primary concern is, as always, protecting big business instead of looking at the victims here, who are the vulnerable ones. Key stakeholders, including Anti-Slavery Australia, the ACTU, FECCA and many more, have joined Labor in the call for the establishment of an independent antislavery commissioner.


On this side of the House, we'll be fighting to ensure that Australia gets a modern slavery act that will actually make a difference. We'll also introduce forced marriage protection orders to provide civil protection against forced marriage for all victims, no matter their age. Currently there are no protection orders available for victims or persons at risk of forced marriage who are over the age of 18 years. When a victim or at-risk child turns 18, any pre-existing order is automatically lifted and ceases to protect them. We know that forced marriages don't stop at 18; they still take place well into any age. Many victims of forced marriage are over the age of 18 and victims who are children are likely to continue to face threats right up to early adulthood.


A Shorten Labor government will overhaul Australia's response to forced marriage. Let's not forget that potentially a thousand young Australians are at risk of forced marriage each and every year. Forced marriage is no different than slavery; you are being forced into a situation that you don't want to be in. Forced marriage is an abuse of human rights. It can create a structure through all sorts of things. Abuse and sexual assault can occur over decades. A failure to adequately prevent, address and respond to this practice is a failure to protect individuals, including young people and children, from crime and abuse.


Australia's current approach to forced marriage isn't working. Under this government, we've not had a single successful prosecution of the forced marriage offences under the Criminal Code. Victims have limited civil protections and struggle to access government funded support. This is a disgrace, and it demonstrates that we need an independent commissioner to provide some teeth to make sure it's taken seriously, because we know that when you allow businesses to self-regulate in most cases it doesn't work. You need an outside, independent body that can come in and ensure that things are being done properly. This is important, because, as I said at the beginning of this speech, slavery is one of the most heinous human rights abuses possible. There is nothing worse than being held against your will, whether it be in a work situation or in a marriage situation or in any other situation where you're doing things that you don't want to be doing. There are more people trapped in slavery today, in this year, than there ever have been in the history of mankind.


As a country and as a parliament, we have an absolute duty to do what we can to simply prevent this practice. You need an effective, strong, modern slavery act. It should be part of the battle. It should have an independent commissioner, and it should ensure that we also have fines for people who aren't adhering to this particular instrument. I'm very pleased that we've moved some amendments to this bill, and that a year ago we committed on this side to a modern slavery act with penalties and with an independent anti-slavery commissioner. I know that the announcement that we made was actually warmly greeted by businesses. We heard a great example of a particular mining company earlier. Our announcement was greeted warmly by businesses and civil society and unions.


I'm deeply disappointed that the government has put forward this particular bill, a bill with no penalties, and has chosen to have a business engagement unit instead of an independent antislavery commissioner. It is a weak commitment by this government. It's tokenism and it's disappointing, but hardly surprising, coming from a government who panders continuously to big business. But this is not about whether you're on the side of business or whether you're on the side of unions; this is about human beings and their lives. This is about people who are forced to do things, not of their own free will. I suppose this bill is one way forward. There are the amendments that we've put forward and I know, if we are in government, we will put things in place that will actually ensure that businesses do what they can along their supply chain to ensure that their company isn't involved in any slavery acts whatsoever. We'll also ensure that there is an independent commissioner that can look into these things.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fenner) (17:47):  My wife is American, and earlier this year we took the kids along to the Independence Seaport Museum in Philadelphia. There is a display there that puts in stark relief the experience of slave sales. There is a place in the museum where you can stand on a slave auction block and hear recordings put together by actors. It allows you to visualise what it would be like: the horror of coming off a ship and then being sold. If there's one statistic that sums up the sheer cruelty of the American slavery scheme, it is that one in three slave children were sold before their 10th birthday. We look back at this experience in the United States with horror, but yet there is much slavery still in the world today. The Walk Free Foundation estimates there are 40 million victims of modern slavery worldwide, two-thirds of whom are in the Asia-Pacific region.


Just in Australia, the Attorney-General's Department estimates that between 2004 and 2015 the Australian Federal Police took 619 referrals for human trafficking, slavery and slavery-like practices. That's why Labor, last year, recognised the importance of the issue of modern slavery in announcing our modern slavery policy. I pay tribute to the shadow Attorney-General, the member for Isaacs; the shadow minister for justice, the member for Hotham; Senator Lisa Singh; and many others in Labor who worked to produce this policy. It was a policy warmly greeted by business, civil society and the union movement. We were joined by representatives from the Business Council of Australia, the ACTU and the Salvation Army. Our policy ensured that there would be penalties for noncompliance and an independent antislavery commissioner.


The government has brought forward this bill in large part due to pressure from Labor and other civil society groups that have campaigned on the issue of modern slavery. But it has failed to put in place as part of this bill a regime of penalties and an independent commissioner. Penalties have been called for by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Anti-Slavery Australia, the Law Council of Australia, the Human Rights Law Centre, Oxfam, Stop the Traffic, the Ethnic Communities Council of Victoria, the Advisory Committee of the Modern Slavery Registry, Australian Lawyers for Human Rights, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia, the Top End Women's Legal Service and Fiona McLeod SC. An independent commissioner has been called for by Fiona McLeod SC, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Law Council of Australia, the Human Rights Law Centre, the Business Council of Australia, Project Respect, the Australian Lawyers Alliance, Anti-Slavery Australia, the synod of Victoria and Tasmania Uniting Church in Australia, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia, Good Shepherd Australia and New Zealand, the Top End Women's Legal Service, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, the Salvation Army, Oxfam and Stop the Traffik. These organisations recognise the importance of a regime which has strong penalties and an independent commissioner. Labor will be moving appropriate amendments to this bill to see those issues better resolved, and we hope the government will support those amendments.


I want to turn to the treatment of domestic workers employed by foreign diplomats in Australia. I will begin with a case study that is highlighted in a report produced the Freedom Partnership to End Modern Slavery—a project of the Salvation Army. It is about Cristina, and I quote:


Cristina (pseudonym) was recruited to work for a foreign diplomat in Australia. Cristina had a written contract that said she would be paid $2,150 per month for 40 hours per week as a livein housekeeper. From the time she arrived, Cristina’s conditions and pay were not as agreed. Her employer took her passport, refused to let her go out, and forced her to work seven days per week. She was not paid according to her contract and was forced to sign false declarations about payment of her salary. Cristina’s employer warned there were cameras in the house watching her. Cristina’s employer also threatened that there were many poor people in her country where 'there is a lot of corruption and a man’s life is only worth $100.' 


She was ultimately able to escape. Other cases of domestic workers indicate Christina's situation was not an anomaly.


There are challenges in Australian authorities cracking down on the mistreatment of domestic workers employed by foreign diplomats. The Salvation Army notes that, historically, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade 'has referred employment disputes to the Fair Work Ombudsman, which, in turn, has declined to investigate on the basis of immunity', and if employer sponsorship is revoked—which is a common response to worker complaints—they 'have only 28 daysbefore being legally required to leave Australia', which makes it in practice 'impossible to bring a private civil action'. Not all diplomats enjoy the same degree of immunity, but immunity from prosecution does make the resolution of cases involving mistreatment of domestic workers for foreign diplomats more difficult.


According to the Salvation Army, there are approximately 150 private domestic workers currently employed by diplomats and foreign officials—most of them concentrated here in the ACT. The Salvation Army note that they have assisted dozens of workers who have come to them over the years, including at least 11 workers employed by diplomats or foreign officials in Australia. At least four of those cases involved a head of mission. They quote a survivor trafficked into domestic servitude by a foreign diplomat posted to Australia, who said:


For me this is not just about the wages that I am owed and the time that I have lost fighting for my rights. It is bigger than that. It is about justice for a group of people who are not treated as human beings. Their freedom and their labour are being stolen.


This is a significant issue for many in the ACT who want to see proper conditions provided to all workers in the ACT, whether or not they're working for embassies or high commissions.


As Heather Moore of the Salvation Army, who has been a passionate and tireless voice on this issue, has noted:


The US has made … progress, having amended its federal anti-trafficking laws to enable trafficking victims of diplomats and employees of international organisations to pursue civil lawsuits without fear of deportation.


Ms Moore notes:


The US based Human Trafficking Pro Bono Legal Centre and others have brought 25 civil suits against diplomats.


Not all of those have been resolved in favour of the plaintiff, but there have been a number of out-of-court settlements. She also notes:


In Switzerland, the Protocols section offers mediation services for employment disputes and refers workers to NGOs for support when more serious allegations are made. In Ireland, workers must report … for welfare checks and diplomats are now required to permit labour inspections and allow workers to attend workshops on their rights.


It is vital that we in Australia ensure that those who are working at foreign embassies are treated according to Australian law. They may technically be on foreign soil, but they are our responsibility. Because they are workers performing work in Australia, it is the moral responsibility of the Australian government to see that those workers are not subjected to a form of modern slavery.


This mistreatment of domestic workers in foreign embassies and high commissions must receive stronger attention from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I urge that department to work more constructively with organisations such as the Salvation Army to ensure that those who are affected by modern slavery in diplomatic missions here in Canberra don't slip through the legal cracks and that their rights are upheld.


This bill is welcomed by this side of the House. As I noted in my opening remarks, we would have liked to have seen it sooner, and we would like to see it include an independent commissioner and penalties. Beyond that, we urge the government to take all reasonable steps to also ensure that they work with diplomatic missions to ensure that there is no domestic worker in an Australian diplomatic mission subject to modern slavery.

"Khalil, Peter, MP",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Mr KHALIL
 (Wills) (17:58):  I also rise to speak on the Modern Slavery Bill 2018, because the fact is that there are more people trapped in slavery in the world today than there have been at any other time in human history. That's a very disturbing fact. It seems unbelievable, but it is true. I rise to speak on this bill very proudly, because many of my constituents in my electorate of Wills have a very strong social conscience and many have been writing to me about the implementation of a modern slavery act for many, many months.


The Walk Free Foundation estimates that there are 40.3 million victims of modern slavery worldwide. Two-thirds of these are in the Asia-Pacific region. We have come so far on so many things, and yet in our own region, in our own suburbs and in our own communities trafficking and slavery are still occurring. It's true to say, and I think the previous speakers have touched on this, that Australia has a critical role, frankly, to play in fighting modern slavery. Trafficking and modern slavery are hidden problems that will not be eradicated without meaningful attempts to expose them. It is our responsibility to do so. It is our responsibility to do everything in our power to prevent human trafficking and exploitation, so a strong, effective modern slavery act as an integral part of that responsibility.


It's our moral responsibility to our fellow human beings to do whatever we can to prevent human rights abuses and exploitation. That is why tackling slavery and exploitation is core to Labor's mission to protect the vulnerable, to protect workers and to implement and enforce human rights. I'm proud to stand with a party that is so committed to doing so. That's why last year the Labor Party announced our modern slavery policy, a policy that was welcomed by business, civil society and the union movement. I want to acknowledge all the work that was done by our shadow minister for justice, Clare O'Neil, and the commitment that she's shown to this policy in introducing it and announcing it publicly.


But tackling slavery must be above politics. That is why Labor has called on the government to match our commitment in establishing the act. We further called on the government to match the commitment to a transparency-in-supply-chain mechanism that contains penalties for noncompliance and to an independent antislavery commissioner. In putting forward this particular bill, the government have finally agreed—they caved in, if you want to put it that way—but have neglected to include the penalties for companies that breach the proposed act. They have also chosen to have what's called a business engagement unit rather than have an independent antislavery commissioner.


A modern slavery act must have penalties for noncompliance. It's a no-brainer. The coalition had an opportunity during the Turnbull government and now under the Morrison government to work with us in a bipartisan fashion on this bill and to match the commitments that we made when we announced our policy. Frankly, the government's commitment is weak, and we can't afford to be weak on human rights abuses. The government can and must do better. Combating slavery cannot be optional—there is no excuse for that—but unfortunately it's not very surprising coming from a government that has continued to prove itself really useless at regulating big business. We should not be leaving it to big business to police themselves on slavery.


Penalties, therefore, are vital to the success of this act. The experts know this and have been absolutely clear about it. In submissions to the Senate inquiry, the ACTU, Anti-Slavery Australia, the Human Rights Law Centre, Oxfam and many other organisations all spoke of the importance of penalties in effectively exposing and preventing human trafficking and exploitation. The Australian Council of Trade Unions, the ACTU, said in their submission:


The absence of sanctions seriously undermines the effectiveness of the reporting requirements for the purposes of fighting modern slavery.


Anti-Slavery Australia wrote:


The serious risk of human trafficking and slavery being supported and hidden by complex supply chains necessitates a stronger regulatory framework.


Oxfam's submission put it simply when they said:


Without penalties for non-compliance, there is a real risk that companies will not report ...


The overwhelming majority of stakeholders have called for penalties to be included in this bill. It is on this clear advice that we will be moving amendments to introduce penalties for failing to comply with any modern slavery act. It is also on the advice of these independent experts that we move amendments to institute an independent antislavery commissioner. A commissioner will work with victims, assist businesses to establish and protect transparency in supply chains and work to prevent and detect slavery in Australia. A commissioner will provide independent assessments, uninfluenced by other interests, on the effectiveness of the government's actions to fight slavery. It will scrutinise the government's work to tackle modern slavery.


But the government has once again prioritised protecting big business over the estimated 4,300 people who are trapped in slavery in Australia today. This decision, against all advice, to propose a business engagement unit in place of an independent commissioner, makes it perfectly clear that protecting themselves and protecting big business is their primary concern when their primary concern should be the thousands of people in Australia who are trapped in slavery and exploitation.


We call on the government to establish an independent antislavery commissioner. We call on the government to prioritise the victims, not a support unit for big business. It has been seen in the United Kingdom that the institution of an independent commissioner meant more victims identified, more proactive police investigations undertaken, more prosecutions and convictions achieved—substantive results. It has been seen in similar legislation in France, in the US state of California and across the European Union that the evidence backs in the importance and the critical role of an independent commissioner. The stakes, frankly, are too high to ignore those facts. It is clear that a modern slavery act will be weaker without an independent antislavery commissioner, and a business engagement unit is an utterly inadequate alternative.


The government have before them an opportunity to markedly strengthen the accountability framework of the bill and they are missing it. The victims of slavery in Australia deserve better. These amendments cannot be optional if this bill is to be effective. It is a complex and nuanced issue; we all know that. It cannot be taken lightly or without the proper advice. That is exactly why Labor took the time to consult with stakeholders about concerns the bill includes forced marriage as one of the forms of exploitation required to be reported on by business. It is also why Labor has committed to overhauling Australia's response to forced marriage. I want to acknowledge the work of our shadow minister for justice, the member for Hotham, Clare O'Neil, on this particular aspect of the policy work as well.


Forced marriage is an issue that needs to be dealt with properly, not flippantly, so if the government want to actually address it, they should match Labor's forced marriage policy commitment to establish forced marriage protection orders and a forced marriage unit to connect victims with the appropriate services and agencies that can assist them. Clearly, Australia's current approach to forced marriage is not working. Something has to change. But the inclusion of forced marriage in the modern slavery act may drive forced marriage underground, so it needs to be handled with care and in consultation with the experts, just as Labor's comprehensive commitment does. A Shorten Labor government, if elected, will ensure we lead a coordinated national response to combatting the practice of forced marriage. It will ensure that an overhaul of Australia's response to modern slavery, trafficking, human rights abuses and forced marriage. Our policy commits us to stamping out these atrocious practices. It is focused on prevention and on the support of vulnerable victims.


Today, I speak to this bill and, as many of the previous speakers on our side have, call on the Morrison government to match the Labor Party's commitments in this policy area. Again, I call on the government to listen to the advice of expert stakeholders who know firsthand what is necessary for real and effective change. We all, I know, speak on this bill because there are more people trapped in slavery in the world today than there have been at any other time in human history, a terrible statistic. An Australian modern slavery act will ensure that Australia is at the forefront in the fight against modern slavery.

"Dick, Milton, MP",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Mr DICK
 (Oxley) (18:08):  I rise to place on record and, like many of my colleagues and those opposite, to show my support for eradicating modern slavery. My remarks tonight probably will be in a similar theme to most speakers on this issue tonight. Whilst it probably won't make the news tonight or even be talked about across dinner tables while people are picking up their groceries on their way home or sitting in transport, waiting to get home to their loved ones, it is indeed a serious issue. After researching in preparation for this legislation and reading some of the evidence, it's a far bigger problem than most Australians and people across the globe would expect it to be. I know I was one of those people who was genuinely horrified and shocked about the true nature of modern slavery. As MPs in this place, we have a duty to stand up for those who find themselves in vulnerable circumstances—I certainly pride myself on that as an elected representative in this chamber—and the sad issue of modern slavery certainly fits this category.


Modern slavery is a term that can be used to describe a range of extreme labour rights abuses including: slavery, servitude, human trafficking and forced or compulsory labour. If you were to ask someone out on the street or across Australia whether slavery still exists today, the answer you'd get, no doubt, would be no. There's no denying that slavery is one of the most heinous human rights abuses possible. But there are more people trapped in slavery in the world today than there have been at any other time in human history. Let's just unpack that for a minute. Across our history, across this world, there are more people trapped in slavery than there have ever been.


Even though almost every country in the world has laws against slavery and the practice was banned globally by the United Nations in 1926 and again in 1953, modern slavery continues as an issue of huge proportions. Indeed, the Human Rights Law Centre estimates that there are currently in excess of 25 million slaves worldwide, including almost 5,000 right here in Australia. It's hard to believe, and it's hard to understand. According to the Attorney-General's Department, between 2004 and 31 December 2015 the AFP took 619 referrals for human trafficking, slavery and slavery-like practices, meaning that there are many more who go unnoticed and without the help they need.


I'm proud that the Labor Party has been at the forefront of this fight. We continue that fight here today because all of us, in this chamber and outside this chamber, do not tolerate human rights abuses. We recognise that modern slavery continues to be a hidden problem that will not be resolved without meaningful attempts to expose it. That's why last year, after months and months of consultation with stakeholders, Labor announced our modern slavery policy. We met with not only not-for-profit organisations working at the coalface against modern slavery but businesses and groups such as the BCA; ACCI, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry; Wesfarmers; Rio Tinto; BHP Billiton; Woolworths; Ernst & Young; and Fortescue Metals Group, just to name a few. That is because we are serious about an inclusive policy that works alongside the not-for-profits, the business sector, advocacy groups and community to stop modern slavery. What resulted was a constructed and strategic policy to help the thousands of victims right here in Australia and the millions and millions of people trapped in slavery worldwide, many of whom are victims of exploitation in private sector activities such as manufacturing, construction and agriculture.


Australia has an important leadership role to play in fighting modern slavery. Two-thirds of people trapped in slavery worldwide are reported to be in the Asia-Pacific region. I was pleased at the time to see our policy warmly greeted by business, civil society and the union movement, and we were joined by representatives from the BCA, the Business Council; the ACTU; and the Salvation Army. Our policy announcement included a commitment to establishing a Modern Slavery Act with transparency in a supply-chain mechanism which contained penalties for noncompliance and, most importantly, the establishment of an independent antislavery commissioner.


I'm pleased to be here today with members of the government—I note there were five government members who spoke on this important bill today—and join with the government, who are now following Labor's crackdown on modern slavery. I applaud them for that, and I recognise the government's response to strengthen Australia's response to modern slavery by establishing a modern slavery reporting requirement.


However, like most things this government produces, it falls well short of what I believe is required and is accepted. This includes the government refusing, as we've just heard from the member from Wills and other speakers—and no doubt the member for Canberra and the member for Bendigo, who are in the chamber tonight, will endorse this—to include penalties for companies that breach the proposed Modern Slavery Act. Yes, it seems there's no piece of legislation where this government wants to offend big business. I simply ask the question tonight: what's the purpose of this legislation if it doesn't have the teeth needed to impose penalties on businesses which continue to flout it and, dare I say, profit from modern slavery?


Any modern slavery act must have penalties for noncompliance. We should not be leaving big business to police themselves on slavery. In the three years since the United Kingdom implemented a similar ban only approximately half of the 9,000 to 11,000 organisations the UK government estimates are required to report have produced a slavery and human-trafficking statement. The evidence is clear: this type of self-reporting system simply does not work, so why has the government chosen to have a business engagement unit instead of an independent antislavery commission? According to an ABC report:


Adeline Lambert is the director of analytics and customer experience at Made In A Free World, an organisation that works with businesses to stop human trafficking and modern slavery in supply chains.


…   …   …


As it stands, the bill does not impose any penalties, financial or otherwise, on companies who fail to report slavery risks in their supply chain.


Because of this, Adeline Lambert said ""companies could look at this bill and say 'there's a way we can get around this'.""


Keren Adams, a Director of Legal Advocacy at the Australian Human Rights Law Centre, agrees.


""A mandatory reporting scheme is not really mandatory if there are no consequences for companies that fail to comply,"" she said in a statement.


Again I ask members of the government: what's the point of this bill if there are no penalties? Without financial penalties and an independent commissioner to help enforce them, these new laws lack the necessary teeth to ensure the worst offenders lift their game. The list of stakeholders who support the introduction of penalties in this bill is long and wide. I read into the Hansard a number of these, including, unsurprisingly, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Law Council of Australia, the Human Rights Law Centre, the Queensland University of Technology Faculty of Law, Australian Lawyers for Human Rights and the Australian Lawyers Alliance.


I'm pleased to see that Labor is moving amendments to this bill to introduce penalties for companies that fail to comply with the modern slavery act and is calling on the government to establish an office of an independent antislavery commissioner. We need an independent commissioner to assist victims, not just a support unit for big business. They are not the victims in this horrendous modern slavery trade. The support for an independent antislavery commissioner is strong out in the community, including in the following submission:


The Law Council is concerned that the Bill does not establish an Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner (Commissioner). In the Law Council's view, the case for an Anti-Slavery Commissioner was well-made in the Hidden in Plain Sight report, which notes that it would complement the existing roles of the Attorney-General's Department and the Ambassador for People Smuggling and Human Trafficking.


The Australian Lawyers Alliance added, with reference to that same report:


The Committee was clearly of the view that an independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner could play a vital role in strengthening Australia's response to combatting modern slavery. In particular, the Committee envisaged that the Commissioner would undertake a legislated review of the Modern Slavery Act every three years after its commencement, to assess the effectiveness of the Act, the level of public awareness of modern slavery and the effectiveness of the operation of the proposed supply chain reporting requirements.


Even the Business Council of Australia said:


We are open to any form of independent oversight, like the UK Anti-Slavery Commissioner model, if it works constructively with businesses to lift performance.


Instead the government's decision to walk away from an independent commissioner in exchange for a business engagement unit shows in my view where their primary concern is. Good Shepherd Australia New Zealand noted:


The Business Engagement Unit is not an adequate alternative to a Commissioner particularly given their own reporting requirements under the law—and their necessary relationships with business outside of the context of modern slavery.


In contrast, Labor's modern slavery act would require large companies to report annually to the government on the steps they've taken to ensure modern slavery is not occurring in their business or supply chain through a slavery and human-trafficking statement. Each statement must include specific information about the company's supply chain, where a risk has been identified in that supply chain, what steps are being undertaken to ensure slavery is not part of the supply chain, what training is provided to staff on these matters, whether slavery has been found in the supply chain and then what action has been taken subsequently. Despite the huge numbers I read out earlier that indicate we have almost 5,000 modern slaves in Australia tonight at this very moment in time, recent Senate estimates revealed that we've had only seven slavery convictions in half a decade. Simply put, that's unacceptable. We urgently need a commissioner to help victims and crack down on this sickening crime.


Victims of modern slavery are often incredibly vulnerable and face cultural, social, economic and language barriers. There have also been significant gaps in the support services we provide for victims of modern slavery. A commissioner would assist to remedy these gaps in enforcement, help victims and work with civil society to help prevent and detect slavery in Australia.


As was reported earlier this year, Australia is not alone in proposing such laws. Business reporting on human rights is a growing trend, with a large number of jurisdictions having introduced reporting or due diligence requirements in recent years. Some Australian companies already report under the UK act. In addition, comparable laws have been introduced across the European Union and in some states and sectors in the United States. Denmark has laws requiring corporate social responsibility reporting, and in Brazil there is a 'dirty list' enabling public shaming of businesses using forced labour. In 2017 the French parliament introduced a new due diligence law on Human Rights and the environment for businesses. Other European countries are also in the process of developing comparable laws, such as the Netherlands' child labour due diligence laws, and I believe Australia must and should follow suit. Before us today we have that opportunity to do so and play a lead role in eradicating modern slavery.


I note that the minister said in his second reading speech on this bill:


2018 is a landmark year in terms of tackling modern slavery within Australia. 


We have a moral imperative to eradicate this practice from our supply chains and our businesses.


I say to those opposite that we have an opportunity to do just that, just as the minister said in his second reading speech. If we support the amendments in this bill moved by Labor and get serious about eradicating modern slavery, we can get this done.


In conclusion, tonight I do want to acknowledge the bipartisan nature of the way that this issue has been handled, even though we have moved amendments tonight. In particular, on this side of the chamber I acknowledge the dedication and hard work of our shadow justice minister, the member for Hotham, but also the work of Senator Lisa Singh and Senator Louise Pratt, who have been at the forefront, championing this issue and making sure that it is in the public arena and that those people who are trapped in slavery in Australia and across the world do have a voice and do have an opportunity to be freed from the situation they're in. That is the hard work of many members on this side of the chamber but also across the government as well.


If the offer of bipartisanship on this stands, we must work together to strengthen the penalties against modern slavery and to ensure that there is adequate oversight against this cruel measure to make it end once and for all.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (18:23):  Slavery isn't something that most Australians associate with the 21st century. They have those images from what they've read and from what they've heard. There are really powerful songs that we're all familiar with, and there is what we've seen on television or at the movies. It is something very much associated with the past, with hundreds of years ago. There is that sense that, in a way, it is a thing of the past and not a modern phenomenon, but the extent of human trafficking, of slavery, of forced labour, of child labour, of the removal of organs and of other slavery-like practises in our region and within our borders is appalling. It is happening right now here in Australia, in our region and in Canberra in 2018. It is very much hidden in plain sight, as my colleague mentioned today.


The numbers are horrifying. There are reportedly 48.5 million people in slavery worldwide, many of whom are victims of exploitation in private sector activities like manufacturing, like construction and like agriculture. As we've heard from this side throughout the course of this debate tonight and this afternoon, about two-thirds of people trapped in slavery are reported to be in our own region, in the Asia-Pacific region, in 2018. Many of these people are stuck in the global supply chain of products and services that Australians use each and every day. Victims of exploitation are in private sector activities like manufacturing, construction and agriculture—as I said, in the supply chain of products that either create what we use every day or are used every day. It is estimated that thousands of people are currently trapped in slavery right here in Australia. Those current estimates place around 4,300 people in slavery or slavery-like conditions here in Australia, which is simply horrific in a nation such as ours in the 21st century.


It's particularly distressing that it is happening here in Canberra, in our nation's capital, as I speak. Just recently—in fact, in the last few months—we heard about police raids here in the ACT where women were discovered having been trafficked into the country from Thailand to forcibly work in the ACT sex industry. One woman claimed she was subject to a $50,000 debt, while others were working illegally on tourist visas. This case is still ongoing and before the courts. We've heard about the Filipino workers who were exploited at local massage parlours, forced to work long hours, underpaid, discriminated against and allegedly threatened that their families back home in the Philippines would be killed if they complained to anyone. Imagine the lives that those Filipino workers were living, being exploited in terms of working long hours and being underpaid and discriminated against. Imagine the fear they were living in each and every day about the fact that their family members were going to be killed should they speak out.


That people engage in this activity just outrages me so much. I find I am speechless. I just cannot believe that one individual, individuals, consortia or gangs could actually do this to other human beings—exploit someone and instil that fear in someone. I find it absolutely appalling. I find it horrifying that it is actually happening here in the ACT today, as I speak.


Some of these workers worked 12 hours a day, six days a week, and were paid for only 38 hours per week. They were brought into Australia on 457 visas with the promise of an annual salary of $52,000. Some had their pay docked by $800 per fortnight over a nine-month period because the massage parlour owner deemed the shop was not getting enough income and not getting enough customers. Last year, thanks to the involvement of the AFP and the Fair Work Ombudsman, the workers were each back paid a fraction of what they were owed. Some of these workers are still owed individual amounts ranging from $92,000 to $125,000.


But what about the employers? Deputy Speaker, do you know what they did to avoid all this liability? Those dirty dogs—that's the only term that you can use for the employers exploiting these people so appallingly—actually put the company into voluntary administration. That means that these workers who were being exploited, who were living with fear each and every day that their families were going to be killed, are unlikely to receive everything that they are owed.


Then there are the 20 or so domestic workers who were kept in slavery-like conditions in embassies here in Canberra. They were being forced to work 12- to 18-hour days for a fraction of the minimum wage, with no weekends off, no holidays and no time off in lieu of overtime. They were forbidden to leave the premises. Again, they were locked away, living in fear, and being exploited in the process. While the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade requires all domestic staff in diplomatic residences to hold onto their passports at all times, some of the workers had theirs taken away. The then foreign minister said in a statement that her department 'treats allegations of mistreatment of domestic workers by foreign diplomats very seriously and are a matter for the police'.


But the issue here is the issue of diplomatic immunity. Australian authorities, when there is diplomatic immunity, are powerless to act. I know from having been a diplomat that the requirement is that, when you go and live in someone else's country, yes, there is diplomatic immunity, but you live by the laws. You abide by the laws and you respect the laws of the country in which you are living. So there is a kind of agreement that that's how you go about it if you are being decent. The fact that people are hiding behind diplomatic immunity and making it very difficult for Australian authorities to address these issues of incidents of exploitation and fearmongering is absolutely appalling. If we can't address this through legal means, what political or values based pressure can or should we bring to bear?


We also heard a few weeks ago about the chef working 12-hour shifts in a restaurant six days a week. He had not only been working in those appalling conditions but had also been asked by his boss to pay the boss's tax bill. When I was in Melbourne when I heard this story, I was in a taxi and heading into a conference. The story came up on the radio, and the taxi driver turned to me and said, 'This is an issue that is far more widespread than people are talking about.' He said, 'I know of many instances of this happening.' The fact that this person was getting so badly exploited with 12-hour days six days a week, being underpaid and then being asked to pay the boss's tax bill was not news to the driver. Again, what human being does that to another human being? It's just breathtaking this is actually happening in Australia and we have got these incidents in Canberra in this day and age.


Already we have ratified a number of international legal instruments to combat this exploitation—as we should, because slavery is one of the most heinous human rights abuses possible. We've ratified the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery; the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime; the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children; and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention. As a country and as a parliament, we must do more to prevent this practice. We must be ever-vigilant, and an effective, strong modern slavery act is a key part of that battle.


In August this year, along with another 65 of my colleagues, I met with representatives from the Australian Catholic Religious Against Trafficking in Humans to discuss aspects and recommendations of this bill. We talked about what the face of modern slavery looks like: sex trafficking, child sex trafficking, forced labour, bonded labour or debt bondage, domestic servitude, unlawful recruitment and use of child soldiers. We talked about the issue of forced marriage. There have been 173 referrals of forced marriage to the AFP, with the number growing steadily since 2013. The 2018 Trafficking in persons report: June 2018 from the Department of State in the United States highlights the actions signatory countries are taking to address modern slavery. Australia is a signatory, but there are still 18 countries that haven't become part of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. The protocol supplements the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. That's 18 countries, and within our own region there are at least six countries that haven't signed up.


In the 2018 Trafficking in persons report, Australia's own country narrative shows we are committed to addressing modern slavery, but it also shows us where we can focus our attention in the future. According to the report, in 2017 we investigated 166 suspected cases of trafficking; prosecuted six defendants; convicted five traffickers, one sex trafficker and four labour traffickers; and investigated one case of domestic slavery in a diplomatic household but were unable to prosecute due to the diplomatic immunity I mentioned before. We prosecuted four defendants for allegedly travelling overseas for child sex tourism, but no convictions were reported.


One of the observations made in the report about Australia's legal framework was the apparent preference to pursue labour and employment charges over trafficking charges. It was noted that the labour and employment charges attract a lesser sentence or penalty than trafficking charges. It is hoped the introduction of the framework outlined in this bill will help address this. It is important to remember that we have come a long way and it has taken some time for us to get to this point where we are even looking at legislation.


It was a Labor government back in 2013 that first recognised the need to consider the risks of slavery-like conditions in Australian supply chains and noted the actions that other countries where taking or were going to undertake in response. The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recommended the government undertake a review to establish antitrafficking and antislavery mechanisms, including legislation to improve transparency and supply chains, increasing the prominence of fair trade, and the development of a labelling and certification strategy for products and services produced ethically. Noting the hard work and the involvement of non-government organisations in vulnerable communities where slavery-like conditions are able to be identified, the committee also recommended that contracts for these NGOs be refunded one year ahead of the current contract's conclusion.


I know from my conversations with ACRATH that there is some concern about funding certainty from many NGOs working in this area. The current 12-month funding cycle is competitive, meaning many organisations are competing against each other for funding rather than working in a cooperative and collaborative way, the approach that is needed for their work on crime prevention and advocacy and support of trafficked persons. ACRATH has sought a three- to five-year funding cycle from the Department of Home Affairs budget as part of the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking and Slavery. I will be watching this space carefully to see what steps the government takes to move this plan forward in collaboration with the people working on the ground—that is, the NGOs.


One year ago, Labor committed to a modern slavery act with penalties and an independent antislavery commissioner. That's how seriously Labor takes this issue; we put the role of an independent antislavery commissioner front and centre of our act. The commissioner would work with victims of slavery, receive inquiries and complaints and assist business in building best practices that protect their supply chains. The commissioner would also work with civil society to help detect and prevent slavery in Australia, as well as lead our global efforts to fight slavery, including working with other countries and international organisations.


Labor sought to work in a bipartisan way on this issue to develop this legislation, so you can imagine our frustration and disappointment with the current bill. It is without penalties, and evidence provided to the Senate inquiry into this bill showed that in the UK, where there are no penalties, the percentage of businesses that are reported still hovers at around 30 per cent of those that supposedly have an obligation to report. That is just not good enough. The absence of penalties in this bill is baffling. We cannot leave it to these absolutely dirty dogs to police themselves on slavery. We cannot leave it to them. Key stakeholders, including ACRATH, Anti-Slavery Australia and the ACTU have joined Labor in the call for the establishment of an independent antislavery commissioner, and we will be fighting to ensure that Australia gets a slavery act that will actually make a difference.

Mr HASTIE
 (Canning) (18:38):  I would like to commend this bill to the House. Slavery has, of course, been a persistent evil throughout human history and, as we know, it remains; there are still 25 million victims of modern slavery who are exploited in global supply chains.


My first contact with people who were slavery victims was actually on 24 December 2014. I was deployed with the Australian Defence Force to a Middle Eastern country and some of my colleagues and I ended up at a Christmas Eve service. We came into contact with some women working at a women's refuge which was helping to get women who had been the victims of slavery back to their home country. I don't want to go into too much detail because I think that refuge continues to operate and continues to look after women from a certain country, but women were coming to that country and finding work, then they would have their passports stripped from them and then they would be forced into sex slavery. The refuge where these women could flee to was established, and then, through their home country, they would be recovered and reunited with their families. It really did emphasise that slavery is a problem, and that's why I'm so heartened that this government is taking action to make sure that Australian businesses have no place for slavery and to ensure that we have transparency in our supply chains.


The central objective of the bill is to combat modern slavery in the supply chains of our goods and services. As I said, the UN estimates that up to 25 million modern slavery victims are exploited in global supply chains. The government has worked very hard, through a range of consultations with stakeholders, on the key features of the bill to ensure that the bill is practical to implement for business and is consistent with community expectations. Under the reporting requirement, for example, over 3,000 corporations, trusts, partnerships and other entities will need to publish annual modern slavery statements.


The bill will set a $100 million threshold for reporting. This ensures that it focuses on entities that have the capacity to meaningfully comply and the market influence to clean up global supply chains. Statements will need to address mandatory criteria set out in the bill, including identifying the entity's key modern slavery risks and describing its actions to address these risks. These criteria will provide certainty for business about how to report and will ensure statements can be easily compared.


I won't go on because many have spoken on this bill already. I just wanted to lend my voice to it, and also to commend my colleague the member for Dunkley, who's done a lot of hard work in getting the bill to this point. I acknowledge the support we've received from those opposite, although we disagree on key features of the bill. This bill is a really important historic step by Australia in its fight against modern slavery. It's sensible, it's practical and perhaps over time we can enhance it once we get a sense of how the incentives embedded in the bill work to eradicate slavery from goods and services in our supply chains.

"Wilson, Josh, MP",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Mr JOSH WILSON
 (Fremantle) (18:42):  I support the Modern Slavery Bill 2018. More particularly, I support the amendment moved by the shadow minister for justice, the member for Hotham. Clearly, there's broad support for this bill because we want a legislative framework in place to combat the scourge of modern slavery. I particularly support the amendment moved by the shadow minister for justice because it adds some sensible, constructive changes that will ensure that this bill and its framework will implement stronger and more effective action. It's the sort of thing that I'd like to think the government would consider. I'll come to the detail of some of that in a moment.


The theme of what I have to say is almost in the vein of 'so close and yet so far'. It's great that we've finally reached this point, but it's a shame that there are some very significant shortcomings. Labor has pushed for action to combat modern slavery for some time. It was more than a year ago that we committed to a modern slavery act. It's good that the government has seen fit to follow along, although not in the way that it could if it were really serious about getting some sort of change, both within Australia and other countries that Australian companies use for the purposes of their supply chains.


As others have said, the government's bill imposes a reporting requirement on entities with consolidated revenue of more than $100 million. It includes an obligation to make public on an annual basis action taken to address modern slavery risks by companies in their operations and supply chains. It also creates a modern slavery business engagement unit within the Department of Home Affairs.


The bill follows in the wake, to some degree, of the commitment that Labor made. More particularly, it follows from the inquiry undertaken by the Foreign Affairs and Aid Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Like the member for Canning, I recognise that work. The report of the inquiry was called Hidden in plain sight: an inquiry into establishing a Modern Slavery Act inAustralia. I congratulate the chair, the member for Dunkley, and the deputy chair, the member for Wakefield.


It is worth thinking carefully and closely about what addressing modern slavery really means. 'Modern slavery' describes circumstances in which a person is compelled to work through some kind of coercion or is trafficked for work and in other ways exploited for their labour. It describes circumstances in which a person is inevitably deprived of their liberty, deprived of their basic human rights and often—I would say in many cases—subjected to abuse, mistreatment, violence, danger and of course the denial of proper wages and conditions.


It's estimated that modern slavery could be the circumstances that face somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 people in Australia. Worldwide, it affects more than 40 million—some estimate close to 50 million. It is sobering to think that more people are trapped in slavery today than there have been at any other time in human history.


It's not hard to imagine the kinds of people who are typically prey to those who practise and profit from modern slavery. They're people who are vulnerable. They're people who are subject to coercion and can be threatened, who can be motivated by the application of force or some other kind of advantage. Children, women, migrants, refugees, people in seasonal work, people in regional and remote areas, seafarers—these are the kinds of people who are at risk of experiencing modern slavery. People in countries without effective governance and regulation, people in countries without strong unions and other civil society organisations—these are the kinds of people who are at risk of being victims of modern slavery.


For all those reasons, our response has to look well beyond our own shores. As I said, it may be 5,000 to 10,000 people here; it's more than 40 million people elsewhere. That's why there needs to be an appropriate obligation on Australian companies to interrogate and be vigilant about the reality of the work practice in their supply chains. I note one of the comments from the Human Rights Law Centre in relation to the parliamentary inquiry:


We've heard horrific stories of abuse linked to some of Australia's biggest brands. Burmese migrants chained … to Thai fishing boats supplying the seafood we eat. Australian surf wear made in North Korean sweatshops.


Those are just two examples of the way in which Australian companies can unwittingly be involved in and effectively support practices that constitute modern slavery. It picks up the title of the committee inquiry report, which was Hidden in plain sight. I think very few Australians as they go about their lives, when they get dressed and put on a T-shirt that's made in Thailand or open a can of tuna that is sourced from somewhere else, would think that, inherent in that aspect of their daily life, is quite extraordinary suffering of someone else; that, in order for them to get the tuna at the price they get it or the unbelievably cheap cotton T-shirt, the value is extracted from another human being, a value in terms of their labour and worse—that their liberty is infringed upon; that they suffer in all of the kinds of ways that humans can bring other humans to suffer.


We do need to recognise that, as the world becomes more globally interlinked and companies seek to make extended supply chains part of how they are competitive and successful in our country, the push to be competitive and efficient and to take advantage of those kinds of global opportunities does come with an inherent risk. If, as an Australian company, you come to know of an opportunity that is attractive to you because the labour costs involved seem to be too good to be true, or part of your product or enterprise relies on a good or a service that is labour-intensive and the price of that good or service seems too good to be true, it probably is. It probably is too good to be true, in the sense that it may well rely on the kinds of practices that we regard as modern slavery.


I would just make a side observation, separate to this bill. I think if we are serious about modern slavery, we have to go well beyond the reporting requirements that this bill places on Australian companies—and the extent to which they actually place those on Australian companies is something I'll come back to—and look at things like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which, as a modern trade and investment agreement, does include some labour standards and environmental standards—but they are weak. They are standards that are not capable of being enforced. There are mechanisms within those agreements that provide oversight, transparency and compliance but the consequences for noncompliance are non-existent.


We have to think about the fact that Australia doesn't presently have a debarment policy that operates at the national level. It's not just private companies that are involved in contracting with foreign companies and having access to sort of foreign labour. Australian governments typically do that through their procurement and other contracting arrangements, yet we don't have in place the debarment architecture that would mean that, where a company or an operation overseas has been found to engage in exploitive practices or modern slavery, they would be prevented from being involved in Australian procurement processes.


Having talked about the way modern slavery occurs overseas and the way Australian companies are at risk of being complicit in that kind of conduct, we shouldn't think it doesn't happen in Australia—it does. There have been some examples in my home state of Western Australia. It was not that long ago that we had a live export ship, known as Bader III, where, in addition to the mistreatment of animals that the Bader III delivered, it also involved the mistreatment of humans. It involved the mistreatment of its crew, who hadn't been paid for six months, who weren't allowed to go ashore, who were owed, in sum, about half a million dollars, and who had been forced to sign contracts under which, if they were injured or ill, they would pay for their own repatriation.


There were also agricultural operations in Carabooda and Pemberton in Western Australia that came to the attention of authorities and seemed to constitute a practice of modern slavery in the agricultural setting. When you looked at the Fair Work Commission's assessment of those circumstances, it was interesting to note the elements that they identified that made the employment of the people involved akin to modern slavery. They were migrant workers; their movements were controlled; their basic liberty was compromised; they lived under the threat of further jeopardy; they lived in substandard conditions; and they were required to work for unacceptable pay in unacceptable conditions. That is essentially the definition of modern slavery, and it was happening in Western Australia.


As I said at the beginning, it's a bit of a case of so close and yet so far. It's disappointing that this bill and the mechanism or the structure it puts in place doesn't apply any penalties for a failure to comply. I think it's pretty obvious to people out there in the community that, if you put in place a requirement and you say that people have an obligation to report and they do not comply and nothing happens, there's a big question mark over exactly how effective that would be. This bill does not create or fund an independent anti-slavery commissioner. Instead, it has this sort of unit within the Department of Home Affairs. It seems that that unit will focus on helping businesses to undertake their compliance work. I'm not saying that's a bad thing. I'm not saying that assistance shouldn't be provided. But an independent antislavery commissioner would ensure that there would be some focus on victims, that there would be some perhaps investigative capacity or at least the capacity to work with and advise other kinds of law enforcement bodies. It's not as if that's just something that the opposition and the shadow minister for justice had been calling for; that's the unanimous recommendation of the foreign affairs subcommittee, which had, as its recommendation No. 6, the creation of an independent antislavery commissioner precisely to 'ensure victims of modern slavery, including children, have access to appropriate support services', and also under a separate bullet point 'to work with various agencies, law enforcement bodies, prosecutors and others to increase the identification and reporting of modern slavery crimes and to bolster the prosecution rates for modern slavery offences'. That won't occur because there is no independent antislavery commission.


We know that the bill in some respects takes the UK's Modern Slavery Act, which was introduced in 2015, as something of a model but, again, it doesn't really follow that closely enough. One of the best examples is in the threshold that's been set for Australian companies. At $100 million, it's considerably higher than the threshold in the UK. The committee, again, unanimously recommended a $50 million threshold. Civil society organisations suggested the threshold be the same as ASIC's definition of a large corporation, which would be $25 million.


In conclusion, it's a welcome step forward; we support it. We particularly support the amendment, which would make it even better. It's a shame we've come so far and yet fall short. If we are going to do these things—they are important regulatory steps—why not get them right? Why not follow the process? You task a committee with doing it, it's led by a member of the government, it produces a unanimous report that follows international best practice and civil society advice, and yet we don't take it.

"Chesters, Lisa, MP",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (18:57):  There are two key components, I believe, in this bill, and two key purposes, I believe, in this bill introducing a modern slavery act here in Australia. The first is that it will say that, here in this country, we will require companies to look at their supply chain. As previous speakers have said, that's the international supply chain. That means requiring companies who import goods into our country, whether they be used in manufacturing or whether they go straight to sales, to look to see if there is modern slavery occurring in their supply chain. As others have said, it is critical that Australia be involved and take this lead given that two-thirds of the victims, it's estimated, are in our region of South-East Asia.


We have all seen the modern slavery horror stories. We have all heard of the horror stories when they have been exposed via the media. And we do only have estimates because it is hard to quantify unless we actually start requiring multinationals, large companies, to start to do this work. So that's the first important part of this bill. As a country, Australia will join countries like the UK and say: if you wish to do business in Australia then we want to know that your business is doing everything it can to stop acts of modern slavery.


The other key part to this bill makes us look at ourselves as a country and ask: are we doing all we can to stop modern slavery in our own country? One estimate is that there's roughly 4,300 victims of modern slavery today in Australia. Other estimates have it as high as 15,000. And it's quite confronting, I think, for some Australians to learn that we have victims of slavery in our country, because many thought that this was dealt with centuries ago. But it wasn't. 


I have one example of modern slavery here in our country that I wish to raise. The industries that are most at risk are well established. We've spoken about what's going on in agriculture, in our hospitality industry, in beauty and massage services, in construction and in other areas of our economy. A few weeks ago I had the opportunity to meet with some farm workers. The member for Blair and the member for Hotham were there. One young woman told us her story. She's Indonesian and she first entered the country on a tourist visa. She was coming here to study. She'd received some bad advice from the agency who'd recruited her. She had entered the country and was immediately put on a minivan with blacked-out windows. She was basically driven from Melbourne Airport to rural New South Wales, where she was dropped off at a caravan park and stayed in shared accommodation that was quite substandard with about 10 men whom she'd never met before. She was then forced to pick fruit for long hours of the day and was paid very little, if anything. She was told she had a debt that she had to pay back.


She was completely scared, completely isolated. This could be an example of modern slavery. She was scared to speak up because she knew that what was happening was wrong. She was scared to speak to police because she wasn't sure, first of all, how to access them or whom to speak to. And she was very scared by what her employer, if you can call them that, was saying. She feared for her family back home, she feared being deported and she also feared the debt that was hanging over her head. Fast-forward five years and she's now seeking help through the NUW about her circumstance and about how to go forward. But, if we had some sort of amnesty for this particular work, then we might be able to start to go down the path of prosecution for her experience. Unfortunately, this particular worker is not alone. When she spoke to us, there were, in fact, eight other workers in similar situations.


I'm not saying that all cases of worker exploitation are cases of modern slavery. There is a degree of worker exploitation in our country that is unprecedented, that we have never seen before. Some of those really extreme cases could be cases for modern slavery, hence the reason for this bill to come before us so we can start exposing that. It is also about the importance of penalties and the importance of having an independent antislavery commissioner established here in this country so that they can make recommendations on how to prosecute and how to toughen up the laws to crack down on this behaviour. That is one of the reasons why the amendments that Labor has put forward should really be considered by those opposite.


This bill doesn't have penalties. This bill should include strong enforcement mechanisms imposing penalties on companies that do not comply with the act. A failure to include penalties in the bill renders the reporting requirement optional. We know that the worst offenders won't report if it is optional. We know that because that's how corporates behave. Companies like McDonald's have already proudly said: 'We've already done this. We're already doing this.' They have actually met several MPs to say, 'This is what we're doing.' Part of what triggered it for them as a multinational corporation is the UK's version of the modern slavery act. So there are some companies in our country that are already acting, but they've taken that first step. It's the ones that don't do it that are the problem, and that's why there need to be penalties: to ensure we force the companies that don't actually report.


The reason for the independent antislavery commissioner is to assist with compliance to ensure that the bill has a unit that works within the department. It's also to help suggest how we can continue to strengthen and prosecute throughout the supply chain to ensure that we are doing our bit to crack down on modern slavery.


Every time I drive past one of those massage parlours, in an old converted house with the neon signs, I do fear for the women who could be working in there. We know from faith based organisations who reach out to these women that there are cases that could constitute modern slavery—women who are locked into these massage parlours, having their passports taken, being forced to work long hours and, in some cases, being forced to work as sex workers. Prosecutions in this space have been low, because of the fear and the intimidation. That is why we need to do more. We need to do more to crack down on modern slavery in our country.


It's not just in that sector or in agriculture that we're seeing it. We're also starting to see gross examples of worker exploitation in the construction industry. As we stand here today, there are over 100 guest workers or temporary workers who've come here from China that are working as plasterers in Hobart at the Hobart Hospital site who haven't been paid. They haven't been paid for nine weeks now. At a very basic level you would say that that is a case of underpayment; it is a case of worker exploitation. Yes, it is, and it needs to be resolved. However, once you start that prosecution and start exploring and unpacking what has happened, you may find that their passports have been taken. You may find that they have a bonded debt that they have to pay back to the agency or the company that's recruited them. You may find that there are threats against their family back home in their country of origin.


Fair Work has a critical role to play in this, in that that could be the entry point where people first start to seek help. We know this because it's appeared in a number of reports that the Fair Work Ombudsman has released into the treatment of temporary workers, people who are here on visa arrangements. That's why I think that what the government are trying to do is a bit tokenistic. It's about saying, 'Yes, we want to tick the box to say that we are doing something about modern slavery.' But in some ways what they have put forward is bit of window-dressing—it's optional whether you comply. It also doesn't have enough steps in place to act on that very good step of saying, 'We are taking modern slavery seriously,' by building the links back to where someone might be a victim of modern slavery but they have entered through, say, an underpayment case or through the Migrant Workers Centre which has just opened up in Melbourne.


Others in this place have spoken about cases of domestic servants—people who have entered the country, maybe on a tourist visa, who are now working as domestic servants. There have been cases in Melbourne and Canberra where they have actually said that they could constitute a form of modern slavery—passports taken; not paid; underpaid; locked in and unable to leave the premises; and threats being made against their person or against family members. It is just unacceptable that that is happening here in Australia in plain sight. We know that it is a problem in the cleaning industry, the construction industry and the hotel industry—practically, wherever there are workers who are here on a temporary arrangement, they could be victims of modern slavery. The government needs to be doing more to support them where they have been underpaid and doing more to investigate and to ensure that we've got that practical support for people going forward.


Last week I held a modern slavery discussion forum in my electorate, in both Woodend and Kyneton, where the shadow minister, Clare O'Neil, and I discussed with the local community how it is our human rights obligation to start acting up and speaking up about this issue. We need to make sure that any bill that is put forward on this issue isn't just tokenistic, that we are genuinely trying to change and make a real effort towards cracking down on modern slavery.


At the forum, people asked several questions. At the forum, there was a bit of surprise at the statistics that at this point in time we have more people trapped in slave-like conditions than ever before in our modern history and that two-thirds of the people are in our region. They talked about how as consumers they want to be more aware—aware of the companies that are trying to crack down on modern slavery—so they can use their purchasing power to ensure that they, as good global citizens, are buying products and securing services from companies which are committed to cracking down on and ending the scourge of modern slavery.


An interesting sort of development with one of our multinational companies is that CUB, which is part of a global beer beverage company, has moved in a number of its workplaces here in Australia to start using Australian-made bottles, labels and cartons. Therefore there's an opportunity within this, when we ask major companies to look at their supply chain, for these companies to potentially say, 'Well, if I have to comply with the Modern Slavery Act and the work that's involved in that and the fact that it is quite hard to police what's happening in other countries—it can get complicated and it can get costly—maybe the cost-benefit analysis says that it's actually easier and more affordable to start using Australian based products.' That is something that could be also a positive outcome when we start to ask companies to ethically look at how they are procuring product, whether it be for sale in this country or to be used in further manufacturing.


I strongly urge the government to consider the amendments that have been put forward by Labor. We need to have penalties. We need to make sure that these companies, all companies, are complying with the act. We also need to make sure that we have an independent antislavery commissioner that is working towards ending modern slavery in our country but also ending modern slavery in our region.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2018-09-12,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (19:12):  The Modern Slavery Bill 2018 is what I would describe as inadequate legislation that purports to respond to a very serious global problem. The previous speaker, the member for Bendigo—and I commend her remarks—referred to it as 'tokenistic' legislation, and I agree with her.


For millions of people around the world, human slavery didn't end in the early 19th century, despite William Wilberforce's commendable efforts and the British parliament, I think, in 1833 passing legislation outlawing slavery. It simply pushed slavery underground, screened by a veneer of conventions and laws that gave hope to those enslaved at the time and those who were fighting to have slavery stopped. In reality, it didn't end the slavery but simply changed the modus operandi of those who still use people as slaves to profit from.


As other speakers on this side have also made clear—and it follows the comments about it being inadequate legislation or tokenistic legislation—we only have the legislation before us because of the efforts of those on this side of the House, who have continued to raise this issue, as have so many other groups in society. Indeed, I can recall, as a member of the joint standing committee that looked into procurement, in our discussions and in listening to witnesses who appeared before that committee, stressing the point that one of the first things the government itself should do as part of its procurement obligations is ensure that any government procurement did not come from a place where slavery of any kind or indeed any kind of worker exploitation had been used at the time. So it's an issue that's been before this parliament for some time.


Whilst I say that the legislation is inadequate, at least the legislation is a step in the right direction. More importantly, it actually acknowledges that there is a real problem out there.


Others have talked about figures of somewhere between 40 and 50 million people around the world being enslaved today. I've seen figures that go up to perhaps 70 million. The truth of the matter is that we don't know how many people are enslaved in the world today, because those people who operate this way are not likely to report the number of people that they have working for them and whom they are exploiting. But, regardless of what the figures are, we do know that the figures are quite revealing. Indeed, as others have made clear, there are more people in slavery today than at any other time before.


We're aware from reports that we've had from within this country and from overseas that people are working in mines, brick kilns, garment factories, farms, shipping boats, brothels and other places as slaves. What's even more concerning is that in some cases they are working from within their own homes. We've heard of terms like bonded slavery, forced migrant labour, sex slavery or even early forced marriages, child labour and so on. These are terms that arise again because there is an acknowledgement that the problem exists, but it's always dealt with in a very simplistic way where we might deal with one particular problem over here and another over there. It's never been looked at as the problem that it really is, and that is a problem of people working as slaves right around the world. Their work and their exploitation is taking place not only from those who have got them under their control but from everyone else who deals with those firms and people that abuse slaves to make a profit.


One of the other concerns—and I'll be speaking about this when we come back next week—is the concern I have about people who are in slave camps today under oppressive governments that imprison people because they are dissidents to the regime and then use them from within those camps as slave labour to manufacture products and goods for their state. But I'll have a bit more to say about that next week.


It's also the case that, as inequality across the world widens, including here in Australia, more and more people are enslaved by extreme poverty and shackled not by chains but by their needs and their commitment to their families. They work as slaves in order to ensure a living for themselves and the people who depend on them. As others have also said, they become vulnerable to heartless employers who exploit them in way that I personally cannot understand. I cannot understand how one person is willing to profit from the harm they do to another in the way that we know is occurring perhaps in Australia and certainly in other parts of the world.


Sadly, what is also of concern is that governments in so-called respectable countries, including our own, have not only looked the other way when we know this is possibly happening but have at times, through deregulation policies such as the shipping legislation this government brought in this parliament only a few weeks ago, enabled those people who want to exploit others to do so and to do so much more easily. The member for Fremantle talked about those people on the ships that take away our live animals. I've no doubt that they are exploited, if not enslaved. But I'm aware of others who work in the shipping industry who are treated equally badly.


In the minister's second reading speech, I picked several phrases which I'm going to quote because, quite frankly, they highlight why this is inadequate legislation and why this legislation will not address the issue as it could have. The minister said, 'This legislation will shine a light.' He went on to say: 'It will require large business to be transparent to address modern slavery by establishing a flexible, risk based reporting framework. It will transform the way the Australian business community responds to modern slavery. It will create a level playing field, and businesses that fail to take action will be penalised by the market and consumers and severely tarnish their reputations.' What nonsense! Who out of the people who are currently exploiting their labour or enslaving people would do so if they had any conscience at all? If they have any conscience at all, are they going to declare what they are doing to the government every time the government asks them to annually prepare their reports? Of course they won't. It is the very people who are allowing this to happen who are the ones who are the most likely to have the lowest standards of morality and who will be the people who are not law abiding. If we're asking them to effectively turn themselves in and tell you what they are doing, it's not going to happen.


The truth of the matter is that right now people around this country are buying products from businesses that bring them in from countries where they know that the products have been made by slave labour. Again, even consumers are prepared to say: 'I'm not responsible for where the product comes from. I will buy what I can afford.' So it happens, and it happens under our very eyes. The fact that the government will publish an annual modern slavery statement is not going to resolve this problem, because the statement will rely on the information provided to it by the businesses that are expected to report, and those businesses are not going to declare anything that will harm their reputation.


If the government wants industries to comply, then the truth of the matter is that we need several other aspects to this legislation, which members of this side of the House have talked about. Firstly, there needs to be real penalties in place, and the government needs to set up an agency that is able to monitor the situation and carry out its own investigations should any reports of exploitation or slavery arise. If you have those two things together, it will mean that businesses will comply, because it is not up to them to simply report—there is another authority that's being established to ensure that they comply. If they don't, then they will be penalised accordingly, and the penalties should be severe enough to prevent exploitation taking place in the first instance.


We should also have some sort of independent authority, whether it's a commissioner or something of a similar nature, to ensure that the intent of this legislation is carried out. That person or that department should not only have the ability to ensure that the legislation or the intent of it is carried out and that the bad practices are stopped but also be a person or a department with real authority—the authority to go in, the authority to audit and inspect books if need be, and the authority to make the relevant inquiries and get the information that it needs in order to, again, ascertain whether there has been any exploitation taking place of any kind.


The last matter that concerns me about this legislation as it currently stands is that it only applies to businesses with a turnover of $100 million or more. My view is that that figure is too high, and my view is that there are many, many businesses in Australia today that already deal with overseas companies who in turn make products by using slave labour. Those companies will be left out of the net that this legislation hopes to capture. I suspect that there is as much of the slavery products resold through those companies as there is through the companies that have got a $100 million or more turnover.


Again, this legislation will not address the issue adequately. It could easily be fixed by reducing the dollar amount of companies' turnover that requires them to report annually. It could be fixed by having an independent commissioner of some sort. It could be fixed by having much higher penalties. These are matters that I would hope the government—whether it's this government or a future government—would look at, because the reality is that, rather than reducing the number of people around the world that are being treated as slaves today, we're going backwards and the figures are rising with each and every report that is prepared.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (19:25):  I rise to speak on the Modern Slavery Bill 2018. I say up-front that I wholeheartedly welcome the introduction of a modern slavery bill into this parliament. I had the idea of bringing in this legislation with some contacts put to me by a former senator from Western Australia, Chris Evans, in London a few years ago, the idea being that we copy the UK model. We have taken aspects of the United Kingdom's legislation—sadly, not all of it. It's long past time that our laws addressed the horrific reality of modern slavery and slavery-like practices. People don't need to have an image of some slave ships with manacles; there are now sweatshops and workshops where people are in slave-like conditions. Sadly, we have people enduring slavery-like practices even in our own suburbs.


Labor announced its policy to address this scourge last year. It was a policy formed after extensive consultation with stakeholders, as all good policies should be. Labor's policy received support from business, civil society and the union movement. When you have the Business Council of Australia, the ACTU and the Salvation Army all coming together to say that this is good legislation and that they're supportive of it, you know that you're consulting with stakeholders appropriately.


Labor wants to see an end to modern slavery, so it has called on the government to match its commitment. After pressure from all corners—Labor, parliamentary committees and stakeholders—the government has finally introduced this bill. But don't be fooled; unfortunately, this is not exactly the same policy put forward by the Shorten-led Australian Labor Party. Sadly, this is a much watered down version. Labor's proposed modern slavery act included transparency and supply chain mechanisms, which, importantly, contained penalties for non-compliance. Labor's policy also proposed the creation of an independent antislavery commissioner, much like the commissioner in the United Kingdom. It is disappointing that the Morrison-McCormack government has stopped short of Labor's proposal, although it is not surprising that the Morrison-McCormack government is not prepared to be tough on big business. Labor will be moving amendments to this bill to make sure it is not a toothless tiger.


I'm horrified that human trafficking, forced labour, sexual slavery, child labour and trafficking, domestic servitude, forced marriage, bonded labour—including debt bondage—and slavery are still being inflicted on our fellow human beings in the 21st century. But that is the reality. This piece of legislation is important in that it sends the message that we will not tolerate this anymore. It is drawing a line in the sand and saying 'no more' to this insidious practice of modern slavery.


There are estimated to be around 48.5 million people in slavery worldwide. Two-thirds of those trapped in slavery are in our own neighbourhood, in the Asia-Pacific region—an area where we are seen to be a beacon, a healthy democracy, as one of the five oldest democracies on the planet. We can be a role model by engaging with many of these countries.


Sadly, even on our shores here in Australia, there are estimated to be around 4,300 people who are trapped in slavery right now. Many of those are victims of exploitation in private sector activities, even in things like manufacturing, construction and agriculture—activities that we can support as Australian consumers. Some Australian companies, such as Fortescue Metals and Wesfarmers, have acknowledged that they have found forms of forced labour in their own company supply chains.


Products that we consume regularly are linked to this horrifying exploitation. One is chocolate. Australians consume three million tonnes of chocolate every year. We need to be very careful when it comes to consuming chocolate to make sure that the supply chains are appropriate, and that workers are appropriately remunerated.


Debate interrupted.

Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (19:30):  Melbourne's west is the fastest-growing region in Australia's fastest-growing city. This growth is reshaping our city, and we need Melbourne's infrastructure to evolve with it. The Andrews Labor government has made tremendous progress on this front, both by committing real government funding for critical infrastructure projects and by bringing a long-term vision to infrastructure planning in Victoria. It's finally broken ground on the Melbourne Metro rail tunnel—an absolutely crucial investment to expand rail capacity from the west. It's picked a route and started the process of building the Melbourne Airport rail link through the Sunshine-Albion corridor. It's done this despite a federal coalition government that has largely abandoned Victorian infrastructure investment. It's done this despite a coalition government that, upon coming to office, withdrew $3 billion in funding for the Melbourne Metro rail tunnel, delaying the single most important infrastructure project in Victoria by years and, after that, invested less than nine per cent in federal infrastructure funding in Victoria, despite the fact that Victoria represents around a quarter of the country's population.


In the face of this rapid population growth, inaction and delay on infrastructure investment can have long-term consequences. The need for long-term planning on infrastructure investment is particularly acute in Melbourne's west. The population of Melbourne's west has grown at twice the rate of the rest of Victoria during the last decade. Unsurprisingly, during this time, the rail lines serving Melbourne's west have seen the highest growth in rail patronage of any lines in the state. Passenger numbers on the Werribee, Williamstown and Sunbury lines—all running through my electorate—have increased by more than 100 per cent during the last decade.


Metro's 2016 strategic operational plan warned that the Werribee and Sunbury lines would be at capacity by 2019, underlying the costs of the federal coalition government's delay of the Melbourne Metro Tunnel. Major investments from the Andrews government in upgrades to power, track, stations and modern signalling along these lines will increase capacity in the short term. When it's completed, the Melbourne Metro rail tunnel will provide even more capacity, which is why it's such a relief that—thanks to the Andrews government's management of the project—it's on track to be completed a year early.


But we need to be doing the long-term planning now to ensure that the next big investments in expanding rail capacity to these corridors of rapid population growth are well in train before we again reach the crush point. This is why it is important that detailed planning for Melbourne Metro 2 is happening now. Melbourne Metro 2 would create another Metro rail tunnel, connecting the Werribee line in Melbourne's west via a tunnel from Newport to Fishermans Bend and then on to Parkville and Clifton Hill, joining the Mernda-South Morang line in the north-east. Experts argue that Melbourne Metro 2 could quadruple passenger rail capacity for the Werribee line corridor, creating a vital new link to the city for the area's booming population. The Melbourne Metro 2 rail tunnel could also free up capacity on other lines in the inner west, allowing much needed higher service frequencies on the Altona and Williamstown lines.


Infrastructure Victoria CEO Michel Masson has been calling for planning on the Melbourne Metro 2 tunnel to commence within 12 months, recently telling The Age:


When it comes to additional capacity on public transport, there is absolutely no doubt that Melbourne Metro 2 has got a very important role to play.


The Rail Futures Institute has argued the Melbourne Metro 2 rail tunnel should be built by 2030. Again, the Andrews Labor government has shown long-term thinking in making allowances for the Melbourne Metro 2 rail tunnel in its existing rail construction and planning.


The Minister for Public Transport, for the state of Victoria, in parliament last week underlined that the design and delivery of the current Metro tunnel project would allow for future expansion of the underground network, including Melbourne Metro 2. If we get to work on the difficult work of planning, surveying, soil testing and property acquisition for the Melbourne Metro 2 rail tunnel now, we could be in a position to start work on it immediately upon completion of the Melbourne Metro rail tunnel, utilising the Victorian government's investments in tunnel boring expertise, as well as the equipment used on the current project. Given this, it's important that detailed cost-benefit analysis of the Melbourne Metro 2 rail project is able to be undertaken in parallel with other major infrastructure investments planned in Victoria over the coming decade to ensure that infrastructure funding can be allocated where the returns to the public are greatest.


The Andrews government has a proud record on urban public transport infrastructure investment. It's done the hard yards in allocating real money for public transport infrastructure projects and on delivering them for the public. It's provided real leadership and vision in the long-term plan for public transport, infrastructure and investment in Melbourne. I look forward to the Melbourne Metro 2 rail tunnel being delivered by this visionary government in the future.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (10:00):  The distance between Canberra and Sydney is 286 kilometres and the distance between Canberra and Melbourne is almost three times that at 662 kilometres, so it's understandable to ask why on earth the price of a flight between Sydney and Canberra is up to four times higher than that of a flight between Sydney and Melbourne. A last-minute flight from Canberra to Sydney tomorrow will cost you $263 at best, with no luggage and no flexibility, but tomorrow you can get from Sydney to Melbourne for just $80—less than one-third of the price. This is absolutely outrageous.


Earlier this month I received a letter from Canberran Monica Millgate, who said:


We are constantly shocked by the cost of airfares to and from Canberra in comparison to the rest of the country and wonder why this is happening. I work for a charity organisation and my partner is a motor mechanic, like many others in Canberra we are not high earners. The cost of airfares really puts my family at a disadvantage.


Monica is not alone. Since I started this campaign, countless Canberrans have told me about their expensive experiences, especially last-minute trips for funerals, so I wrote to the CEOs of Qantas and Virgin Australia asking them to please explain—'Please tell me why these airfares are so expensive.' The response was completely underwhelming. 


Qantas told me that $23.97 goes directly to Canberra Airport, which is by far the most expensive capital city airport in the country, according to them. Other than that, their advice was to book early. That was all of the advice. It failed to get to the nub of the question as to why so many Canberrans are paying $300-plus to fly from Canberra to Sydney. I wrote to them again because I was not satisfied with the answer. I asked for a breakdown of their fares. I'm happy to report that I'll be meeting with the Qantas government relations team this afternoon for an update. So, Canberrans, watch this space.


Virgin Australia are yet to reply to my letter, so last week I wrote to them again asking for them to please explain. Once again, I'm yet to see a reply. On top of these outrageous prices, my community is still seeing flight cancellations almost double the national average. Just this week six flights have been cancelled and, as we speak, two flights are delayed at Canberra Airport. I feel sorry for anyone relying on getting to Sydney today. That's a regular story for Canberrans. This is simply unacceptable.


Contrary to popular belief, not all Canberrans are politicians. Contrary to popular belief, many of them are not on high incomes. I've started this campaign. I encourage all Canberrans to get in touch with me to share their experience. I'll continue to fight for my community for fair fares for Canberra.

Mr GEE
 (Calare) (11:53):  on indulgence—I rise to mark the passing of United States Senator John McCain. He was a man who gave a lifetime of service to his country in times of war and peace. He will be remembered here as a true friend of Australia. The McCain family's relationship with our nation has spanned the generations—from John McCain's grandfather, who sailed here in the early 1900s and then in the Second World War commanded US air forces in the South Pacific and later aircraft carriers, to his father, who was a submarine commander out of Perth during that war and then commanded US forces in the Pacific theatre during the Vietnam conflict, to the senator's own service in Vietnam and, more recently, the service of Senator McCain's sons in Iraq and Afghanistan.


One of the common threads is Australians and Americans serving together, and that shared service and sacrifice is something John McCain understood and valued. His time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam is well documented. It was undoubtedly a dark and excruciatingly painful time, both physically and mentally. And yet, having gone through that hellish period, after the war he supported the normalisation of relations between the United States and Vietnam. John McCain said:


We have looked back in anger at Vietnam for too long. I cannot allow whatever resentments I incurred during my time in Vietnam to hold me from doing what is so clearly my duty. I believe it is my duty to encourage this country to build from the losses and the hopes of our tragic war in Vietnam a better peace for both the American and the Vietnamese people.


That generosity of spirit marked his time in politics as well. He was a man who was able to put aside partisan politics to serve the national interest.


There is no question that Senator McCain possessed a maverick streak. I think it could be said that he possessed a larrikin streak as well. And he was a straight talker. Those qualities are no doubt why Australians viewed him with such affection. They are sometimes said to be Australian qualities. But it was more than that. He understood the depth of the relationship between the United States and Australia, how important the Pacific is to global security and how important our alliance is to global security as well. Standing by your mates when the chips are down is another Australian characteristic, and Senator McCain was certainly the first to stand by Australia whenever he thought the relationship between our nations was threatened or imperilled.


I had the pleasure of briefly meeting Senator McCain when he was in Australia last year. During his visit he spoke of the bonds between our nations and how we are an alliance of free countries with shared values and a shared commitment to a safer, freer and better world. Australians will remember his courage, service, sacrifice and, above all, friendship. With John McCain's passing, we have lost a great friend, a great mate. We honour our mate in this House today. I extend the condolences of the Calare electorate to his family and to his country.
