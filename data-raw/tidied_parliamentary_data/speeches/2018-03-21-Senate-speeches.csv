"CHAIR, The",,2018-03-21,"



The CHAIR
 (09:32):  The committee is considering the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017. The question is that the bill as amended, and subject to requests, be agreed to.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-21,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:32):  Just to recap briefly, yesterday the group of amendments we started on was the group on sheet 8254. If senators in the chamber recall, we had just dealt with item (30), which related to schedule 15, which related to the compliance regime. We separated that out because the Labor Party requested that we deal with it separately. The Greens now oppose schedules 1, as amended, 2, 5, 6, 7 and 8 in the following terms:


(16) Schedule 1, page 5 (line 1) to page 54 (line 9), to be opposed.


(17) Schedule 2, page 55 (line 1) to page 70 (line 6), to be opposed.


(20) Schedule 5, page 117 (line 1) to page 140 (line 12), to be opposed.


(21) Schedule 6, page 141 (line 1) to page 152 (line 33), to be opposed.


(22) Schedule 7, page 153 (line 1) to page 164 (line 16), to be opposed.


(23) Schedule 8, page 165 (lines 1 to 18), to be opposed.


These schedules are: the schedule to create the jobseeker payment; the schedule for the cessation of widow B pension, which is schedule 2; schedule 5, which relates to the cessation of sickness allowance; schedule 6, which is for the cessation of widow allowance; schedule 7, which is for the cessation of partner allowance; and schedule 8, which is the schedule on the minister's rules.


We're seeking to move amendments to the schedules which relate to the jobseeker payment because we're concerned that a lot of these allowances are important allowances and are not actually about jobseeker payments. If you recall, we had a substantive discussion yesterday around the bereavement allowance, which isn't always about jobseeking. So we have concerns around all of those schedules. I raised all of these issues during my contribution in the second reading debate, and again when we've been discussing various schedules of this bill during this debate.


I do have a question for the minister around schedule 6. We've asked a lot of questions already. I'm not going to be asking a lot on these schedules, because we have dealt with some of them already. I want to ask about the widow allowance. How many women who will be on the jobseeker payment immediately before 1 January 2022, and who would have been eligible for widow allowance before 1 January 2018, won't be eligible for the age pension as they won't meet the residency requirements?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-21,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (09:35):  Thank you, Senator Siewert. In relation to schedule 6, widow allowance, I'll just take you through the information that I have. As you are aware, if the bill goes through it will be closed to new entrants from 1 July 2018 because of the changes in relation to the bill. So people who would have otherwise claimed widow allowance will be exempt from mutual obligation activities if they satisfy the criteria that currently apply to widow allowance—that is, they were born on or before 1 July 1955, ceased to be a member of a couple since turning 40, have no recent workforce experience and are not a member of a couple.


Over the forward estimates, the total population of people who will be on Newstart allowance, so the jobseeker payments that we're now referring to in this schedule, from March 2020 who would otherwise have been granted widow allowance is estimated as 4,818 over five years, so to 2021-22. Existing widow allowance recipients will be unaffected by the closure, remaining on the payment until they reach the age pension age, and then they will transfer to the age pension. From 1 January 2022, widow allowance will cease and around 400 recipients who are over age pension age but who do not meet the age pension residence qualification rules would be transferred to the age pension under one-off transition arrangements.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (09:38):  Senator Siewert, if you can hold on for one moment, I'm just going to get clarification for you. So in relation to the 400 recipients, they are people who, as of 1 January 2022 when the widow allowance will actually cease, will be over the pension age but do not meet the age pension residence qualification rules. They will be transferred to the age pension under the one-off transition arrangement.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:39):  So are you saying that in the future, when we get to 2022, that whole group, basically, will transfer in a one-off transfer to the age pension if they're over the age pension age?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:41):  by leave—Can I just have it noted that the Greens were the only people that voted no.



The CHAIR:  Yes, certainly.




Senator SIEWERT:
  Can I just take this opportunity to let the chamber know the order I intend to move our amendments. I had a conversation with Senator Birmingham and also Senator Pratt yesterday but I thought that it was fair to let the chamber know. I next intend to move amendments relating to schedule 3, which is on sheet 8243. I then intend to seek leave to move amendments relating to schedule 5 with amendments to schedule 6 on sheet 8243. I will then move further amendments relating to schedule 6 at the end of part 1, which is on sheet 8250. I'll seek leave to move items (1) to (3) together on schedule 13 on sheet 8315. And then I intend to move amendments on sheet 8243 that relate to schedule 4 but I'm not going to move the amendment relating to clause 2, because that has already been dealt with previously by vote on an ALP amendment. Is that okay with everybody?



The CHAIR:  I think it's as clear as mud! We shall proceed.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I move amendments to schedule 3, item 98, on sheet 8243 that relate to overseas portability of the wife pension:


(4) Schedule 3, item 98, page 85 (lines 24 to 26), omit the item, substitute:


(3) Subitem (3A) applies to a woman if, before the commencement of this item:


(a) the woman was receiving wife pension; and


(b) Division 2 of Part 4.2 of the Social Security Act 1991 applied in relation to the payment of wife pension to the woman.


(3A) Despite the amendments made by this Schedule, Parts 2.4 and 4.2 of the Social Security Act 1991, as in force immediately before the commencement of this item, and any other provision of that Act necessary to give effect to those Parts, continue to apply on and after that commencement in relation to the woman as if the amendments made by this Schedule had not been made.




Senator SIEWERT:
  We've had substantial discussion also around schedule 3 and there's already been rejection of our attempts to oppose schedule 3. Raised at the time of that debate were concerns around the women whose overseas portability of a wife pension will be affected, and this seeks to address this particular issue so that that group of around 200 women will not be affected by these changes. So this is to try to make this particular amendment to the changes to the income support system a bit fairer for those who are affected by the changes in this bill. It relates specifically to the overseas portability of the wife pension.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (09:45):  Labor is supporting these amendments by the Greens. We made our own attempt to prevent changes to the wife pension yesterday and the day before. Indeed, I take this opportunity to call on One Nation to do the right thing. They've sought to move amendments in relation to bereavement payments but if they truly believe in standing up for people who will be adversely affected by the changes in this legislation, they now have yet another opportunity to come forward and do the right thing.


We do not want to see the women affected by these changes become worse off. We need to remember the fact that people on this payment have been on this payment since 1995. They've been out of the workforce since 1995 and it is extraordinary that we would expect these women to have a reduction in their payments—to be put down to the jobseeker payment would have an extremely negative impact on their household incomes. Labor supports the Greens amendments and, indeed, calls on One Nation to support them.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:47):  Why was it not considered important to grandfather this group of people, as others have been grandfathered, either through the bill itself or through amendments that have been made?

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-21,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (09:47):  I'm instructed that the government did not consider grandfathering these women, as it would create additional complexity which would be contrary to the intent of the welfare reform bill. As you'd be aware, these 200 recipients who are affected have access to other income sources besides their wife pension payments, such as foreign pensions and investment income.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:48):  It begs the question: why then did you grandfather the others? I'm not complaining that others have been grandfathered; I want that clearly on the record. But the fact is that others have been grandfathered, which does make additional complexity. We went through some of that complexity yesterday in the discussions under the bereavement payment. Why was this considered too complex when there are other complex arrangements in place? Also, have you calculated the dollar impact on these women's incomes of losing access to this payment?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-21,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (09:49):  I'm instructed that, because these women are actually living overseas, the complexity is due to a number of international agreements that Australia is party to, and it would very much add to or create additional complexity to the system which we're streamlining. It would actually be contrary to the intent of the welfare reform bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-21,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:49):  I just want to put it on the record that there is complexity in a lot of the other areas we're talking about—it's 200 women. Could you tell me whether you did look into the impact it would have on women? I heard your answer in terms of foreign pensions and things, but those pensions and payments to these women are calculated on the fact that there's a proportionality there. In terms of the payments, have you calculated the impact of the loss of income on these women? Also do you know whether pensions from other countries will increase for those that receive them if they lose this payment, or if they are just directly losing a payment? If so, what impact is that likely to have on their income?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-21,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (09:50):  In relation to the 200 recipients who are living overseas—the ones who will be no longer eligible for Australian government payments—this equates to a loss, I'm advised, of up to $669.60 per fortnight. In relation to the costings, that has not been undertaken because each international agreement is actually different and, again, it would create additional complexity which would be contrary to the intent of the welfare reform bill.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-21,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (09:51):  It's up to $669.60 per fortnight, but the estimated average loss is approximately $457.10. So that's probably the better cost in terms of the average: $457.10 per fortnight.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-21,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:51):  That's a substantial amount of money that people will be losing. I'll just put on the record that I'm deeply concerned about the welfare of those people or those women. We don't know whether all of them have pensions from other countries. Do we know how many have pensions from other countries?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-21,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (09:51):  In relation to that question, I am advised that—I think I've previously stated this—the understanding is that these recipients do have access to other income sources besides their wife pension payments, such as foreign pensions and investment income.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-21,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:52):  But we don't know, and we don't know if those foreign pensions will in fact increase once those people lose access to an average of $457 a fortnight and up to $669 a fortnight. That is a substantial income if you're living on a small amount of money.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-21,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:59):  by leave—I move the amendment and the request for an amendment on sheet 8243 together:




Amendment



(6) Schedule 5, page 121 (after line 6), after item 17, insert:




17A


After subsection


603C(1)



Insert:


(1AA) If:


(a) immediately before the commencement of Part 1 of Schedule 5 to the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Act 2017 (the amending Act), sickness allowance is payable to a person; and


(b) sickness allowance would continue to be payable to the person for a period if the amendments to this Act by the amending Act had not been made;


the person is not required to satisfy the activity test in respect of that period and any further periods of incapacity immediately following that period.




Request



That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendement: 


(7) Schedule 6, item 16, page 144 (after line 15), after subsection 43(1C), insert:


(1D) A woman is qualified for an age pension if:


(a) the woman was receiving jobseeker payment immediately before 1 January 2022; and


(b) the woman would qualify for widow allowance if subsection 408AA(2) was not in force; and


(c) the woman is not otherwise qualified for an age pension.


Statement pursuant to the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000




Amendment (7)



Amendment (7) is framed as a request because it amends Schedule 6 of the bill in a way which would increase expenditure under the standing appropriation in section 242 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 from 1 January 2022.


Schedule 6 of the bill would close widow allowance to new entrants from 1 January 2018 (or the date of Royal Assent if that is later). The allowance would cease entirely from 1 January 2022. The effect of the amendment would be that, from 1 January 2022, women who have been receiving jobseeker payment, and would have been eligible for widow allowance if they had applied before the commencement of the amendments in Schedule 6, would instead be eligible for the aged pension. This will capture a group of women who may not otherwise be eligible for the aged pension because they do not meet the residence requirements in section 43 of the Social Security Act 1991. Without the amendment, this group may have been eligible to claim special benefit which is calculated at a lower rate.


Under sections 746 and 408FAof the Social Security Act 1991, special benefit and widow allowance are currently paid at a rate equivalent to (or no more than) newstart allowance (calculated under Benefit Rate Calculator B at the end of section 1068 of the Social Security Act 1991). This is a lower rate than the aged pension. The aged pension is calculated under the pension rate calculators in sections 1064 and 1065 of the Social Security Act 1991. The amendment would therefore increase the amount of expenditure under the standing appropriation in section 242 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999.


Statement by the Clerk of the Senate pursuant to the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000




Amendment (7)



If the effect of amendment (7) is to increase expenditure under the standing appropriation in section 242 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 then it is in accordance with the precedents of the Senate that the amendment be moved as a request.


All the items are important but I'm seeking to deal with them as expeditiously as I can, given the issues.


Amendment (6) provides for recipients of sickness allowance immediately before the commencement of schedule 5 of this bill to continue to be paid sickness allowance for a period without requiring them to satisfy the activity test for that period or further periods of incapacity that immediately follow the first period. We're extremely concerned about the impact of the changes under schedule 5 on those who are currently on sickness allowance, and we seek to ameliorate that impact to a certain extent with this amendment.


Amendment (7) is framed as a request for the House of Representatives. It provides that from 1 January 2022 women who were receiving jobseeker payment immediately before that date and who would have been eligible for the widow allowance before 1 January 2018 are eligible for the age pension, even if not otherwise qualified—that is, where they don't meet the qualifying residence requirements.

These are issues that were raised by members of the community and also by the National Welfare Rights Network, who raised very substantial concerns, particularly about the provision for widows. I was pursuing questions about that earlier. They are also extremely concerned about the impact on recipients of sickness allowance, given that people who have an illness aren't able to work for that reason, which is why we're seeking to ameliorate some of these issues. We did seek, through amendments, to remove this schedule. That was unsuccessful, so we're trying to ameliorate some of the impacts on people who could be significantly affected by this amendment. Hence, I urge the chamber to support these amendments.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-21,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:06):  One of the reasons for this amendment is to cement some of the comments that the government has made about how this particular provision will work. As I've said, the item provides for recipients of sickness allowance immediately before the commencement of part 1 of schedule 5 of this bill to continue to be paid sickness allowance for a period without requiring them to satisfy the activity test for that period or further periods of incapacity that immediately follow the first period. My understanding is that government has made comments around how this particular provision will operate, so can I ask the government if my understanding is, in fact, correct? Could you confirm that? That gives us at least a record in the Hansard of how this provision will operate, so that there can be a degree of certainty around that transition period.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-21,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (10:07):  I've got some information that I'm able to provide to you that will shed light on the issue at hand. The schedule itself, as you are aware, closes the sickness allowance to new entrants on 20 March 2020, and ceases the sickness allowance altogether on 20 September 2020. Just for the benefit of Hansard, sickness allowance is the short-term income support payment for people aged 22 years to under pension age who have a temporary incapacity due to illness or injury and who have a job or study to return to after their recovery. It is paid at the Newstart allowance rate. It is generally granted for the length of a person's medical certificate, up to a period of 13 weeks. If payment is required after 13 weeks, a person must lodge another medical certificate. As I've stated in answer to Senator Patrick's question, around 8,400 existing sickness allowance recipients will continue to receive sickness allowance beyond 20 March 2020 until their current medical certificate expires—so their medical certificate takes them beyond the March 2020 date. Of these existing recipients, it is estimated that around 7,700 will lodge another medical certificate after 20 March 2020 and will be required to transfer to the jobseeker payment. They will be exempt from mutual obligation requirements, if they meet the incapacitated exemption rules. From 20 March 2020, new entrants who would previously have been eligible for sickness allowance will be able to claim assistance through jobseeker payment instead. The new entrants will also be exempt from mutual obligation requirements if they meet, again, the incapacitated exemption rules. That's the information I have to provide to you.

They've got the medical certificate and they've been on sickness allowance, meeting those requirements. They have another medical certificate, but they've then hit that wall of the deadlines. They then transfer onto jobseeker allowance. Is that going to enable them to meet the requirements for incapacity under the jobseeker payment in that transition process? They've got the same illness.

Senator CASH


(Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (10:11):  Thank you, Senator Siewert. The rationale at the moment is: do you have a job to go to? For the persons that you are referring to, on 20 March 2020 there will be some who go over that date, and they'll be exempt from mutual obligation requirements if they meet the incapacitated exemption rule. That's the first cohort. Then there are those, obviously, who are new entrants, and they go straight to jobseeker payment, and they also meet the incapacitated exemption rules. In relation to those rules, it is then about incapacity as opposed to: do you have a job to go to?

Senator SIEWERT


(Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:12):  Thank you for that clarification. I'm hoping this will be my last question or set of questions. In terms of temporary incapacity under the current process and incapacity under the new jobseeker payment, will they be the same? That's a better way of articulating what I was trying to get to earlier.

(Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:13):  by leave—I just want it noted that the Greens were the only people that supported those amendments.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR

:  Thank you, Senator Siewert.





Senator SIEWERT:

I 
now move amendment (1) on sheet 8250:



(1) Schedule 6, Part 1, page 142 (after line 11), at the end of the Part, add:




4A


Subsection


729(1)



After ""subsection"", insert ""(1A) or"".




4B


After subsection


729(1)



Insert:


(1A) The Secretary must determine that a special benefit should be granted to a person for a period if:


(a) the person meets the eligibility requirements for widow allowance in Subdivision A of Division 2 of Part 2.8A; and


(b) the person is not qualified for widows allowance on the basis of subsection 408AA(2); and


(c) the person is not qualified for newstart allowance; and


(d) the person is not qualified for the aged pension.




4C


Paragraph 733(1
) (
b)



Before ""the value"", insert ""subject to subsection (1A),"".




4D


After subsection


733(1)



Insert:



(1A) If subsection 729(1A) applies to a person, whether the value of the person's assets exceeds the person's assets value limit is to be determined by reference to section 408CE (the assets test applying in relation to widow allowance).


This relates to the cessation of the widow allowance. We are seeking to make this slightly fairer. Again, we were unsuccessful in removing this particular schedule, so we are trying to make this amendment a bit fairer for those people that are affected on the cessation of the widow allowance.


This relates to inserting a section (1A) in this schedule. It requires the secretary to determine that a special benefit should be granted to a person for a period if the person meets the eligibility requirement for widow allowance in subdivision A of division 2, Part 2.8A—another set of provisions there. It also puts in an amendment that if subsection 729(1A) applies to a person where the value of the person's assets exceeds the person's asset value limit, that is to be determined by reference to another schedule. In other words, it's relating to some of the people that are affected by the cessation of the widow allowance.


We think some of these amendments unfairly impact on people currently receiving allowances but also on people into the future. Again, we urge the Senate to support these amendments that make schedule 6 slightly fairer and make the transition process into the jobseeker payment that much fairer.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (10:17):  I'm advised that existing recipients will receive widow allowance until 1 January 2022, when the remaining recipients will be transferred to the age pension. Approximately 420 recipients who were granted widow allowance after reaching age pension age but who do not meet residential qualifications will be transferred to the age pension under transitional arrangements.


Women who receive Newstart allowance or jobseeker payment who reach age pension age and who do not meet the age pension residency requirements will be required to claim special benefit instead. This will affect 24 people in 2018-19, 68 in 2019-20, 87 in 2019-21 and one in 2021-22.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-21,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:18):  My question is in terms of this provision and further explanation about why we're trying to move this provision. These amendments to schedule 6 are provisions for women who are over the age pension age, who would have been eligible for the widow allowance if it continued to be open for recipients after 1 January 2018, who are ineligible for Newstart due to their age and ineligible for the age pension due to the residency requirements. We're putting in provisions whereby they would automatically then go onto a special benefit payment with the same means test as the current widow allowance so that their cohort is not worse off than they would otherwise have been. That's why we are seeking to ameliorate some of the provisions of the creation of the jobseeker payment, which rolls a whole lot of allowances into the jobseeker payment. That's the reason for this particular amendment.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Reynolds
):  The question is that Australian Greens amendment (1), to schedule 6 at the end of part 1, on sheet 8250 be agreed to.


Question negatived.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-21,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:20):  by leave—Again, can I articulate that the Greens were the only people who voted to support that particular amendment. I now seek leave to move Australian Greens amendments (1) to (3) on sheet 8315 together:


Leave granted.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I move:


(1) Schedule 13, item 2, page 189 (line 14), omit ""(1)"".


(2) Schedule 13, item 2, page 189 (lines 17 to 20), omit subsection 28C(2).


(3) Schedule 14, item 7, page 193 (line 4), at the end of section 42U, add:


   (4) A determination under subsection 42U(3) does not apply in relation to a person who is a declared program participant.


These relate to schedule 13, which we've had quite a lot of discussion about previously where we've sought to remove these provisions. These are about declared program participants and serious failure determination not to apply to declared program participants. These amendments, as I said, relate to section 13. We're still concerned about some of the impacts, and it's not clear in this provision, on some of the exemptions around declared program participants.


I should say these amendments also relate to schedule 14. So there are amendments to schedule 13, item 2, and schedule 14, item 7. They remove subsection 28C(2), which gives the secretary the power to make provision in the determination made under subsection 21C(1) for the operation of the social security law in relation to people who become or stop being declared program recipients at a particular time, including in relation to things that happen before that time. They also amend schedule 14 to expressly exempt declared program participants.


During the Senate inquiry, issues were raised around the impact of sections 13 and 14 as they relate to declared program participants. We're seeking here to make it clearer about those declared program participants. These relate to those sections around drug and alcohol addiction. I'm not going to traverse those whole arguments again, because we did have substantive discussions on those around our previous amendments, the ALP's amendments and Senator Leyonhjelm's amendments. I'm not going to traverse those again. This is seeking to address some issues where the legislation is a bit grey in those particular areas, specifically as they relate to declared program participants.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:28):  My understanding, according to my calculation, is: it is the clause that relates to item (5) on sheet 8243. We dealt with item (2) earlier in the debate, yesterday. I articulated that we would be seeking to move the amendment as it relates to schedule 4, because schedule 4 is now different. It relates to the bereavement allowance. We had a long debate yesterday; I'm not going to go through that debate again. Chair, I don't know if I need to seek leave because I'm actually splitting that amendment.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Senator Siewert, you don't need to seek leave. My instructions are that you can move amendment (5), which opposes schedule 4.




Senator SIEWERT:
  The Greens oppose schedule 4 in the following terms:


(5) Schedule 4, page 92 (line 1) to page 116 (line 25), to be opposed.


Specifically I'm focused in this instance on schedule 4 because it changed with amendments yesterday. We had that debate yesterday, particularly as it related to the amendments moved by Senator Hanson. It was made clear then that a number of people will still be significantly affected by this, even with the previous amendments by the government and Senator Hanson, just as a number of people are significantly affected by all the clauses we've been talking about this morning. Having said that, I'll remind people about the debate we had yesterday, which clearly articulated those that would still remain affected. This amendment, while it deals with clause 2, is specifically focused on clause 4, which is in effect a new clause. It's a different vote than the vote that we took I think only two nights ago—it seems like a whole week—in this place on schedule 4. That is my intent and focus with this particular amendment.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (10:34):  I acknowledge that the amendments made yesterday go some way towards improving the situation for bereaved persons, who will no longer be reduced completely to the jobseeker rate of payment. Again, I say to One Nation: if you truly want to support people who are bereaved then we should go back to the income and assets tests for the age pension, not the income and assets tests for the jobseeker payment.


When One Nation tried to assure the chamber that they had won a great victory for bereaved people, because people would be paid more than they were currently, that was patently false. They were only being paid more relative to the cuts that this government had put on the table, which would have reduced people's payments to the jobseeker rate of payment. All that amendment did was to restore the current rate of payment, but not for everybody who will receive it, because of the change in the income and assets test. If One Nation truly wanted to help people who are on low incomes, who have few assets—who are eligible for the age pension, for example—then they would be supporting the Greens amendment here now.


I ask the minister: if someone is old enough to qualify for a pension and if their assets test is low enough that they would qualify for an age pension but they are otherwise working and they want to go back to that job after they have finished their period of bereavement—so it's a bereavement version—will you pay them the age pension for that period, or will you pay them a jobseeker bereavement allowance?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-21,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (10:37):  There are a number of qualifying conditions in relation to that, which I'd need to understand: Do they have leave? Do they have other income coming in?

For example: I'm 67 years old, I work 30 hours a week casually in a supermarket, I become bereaved, I'd like to go back to that job but I don't have leave and I don't have any other income support; what version of payment would I receive?

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-21,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (10:37):  In relation to the specific circumstances that you've articulated, I'm advised that it is the age pension.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-03-21,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (10:38):  Thank you. So, in concluding my remarks on this today, I say to the chamber: if someone is bereaved they may be employed and they may need income support just for the period of bereavement. They're not a jobseeker—they're quite capable of returning to the workforce—but they need that income support. I say to the chamber: there is nothing wrong with restoring the previous version of bereavement allowance. The previous version of the bereavement allowance pays it at the rate of the age pension. We can be secure knowing that it will continue to be paid at the rate of the age pension and not attached to a recalculated version of the jobseeker allowance, which we know has not tracked along as well as the age pension has. Historically, that allowance has been much lower than the age pension, and I would much prefer to see this allowance continue to retain its value alongside the age pension.


So I'm calling on Senator Hanson and her colleagues in One Nation: if you truly believe in making people who are bereaved better off in that very difficult time of their life, support the amendment put forward by the Greens.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-03-21,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (10:40):  In response to Labor: it's quite interesting to hear you say that you worry about people. Yesterday, the government said about 30 people will be affected by this—




Senator Watt:
  Worse off.




Senator HANSON:
  Thirty people you're saying will be worse off. It is the Labor Party that has just brought in a policy to do with franking credits that will affect at least 610,000 people. It could be up to a million people. Are they worried about it? Here they are in this chamber, screaming like pigs about 30 people, but they want to bring in franking credits that are going to affect 610,000 people. Let's get the figures into order.


Just so that we're clear, under the amendment put forward by One Nation, everyone who qualifies for the bereavement allowance under the jobseeker payment will be no worse off and some people will be better off than under the current arrangements. Payments are targeted to those who need it. Bereavement allowance is paid to people in lieu of work, and this is why it is exempt from normal mutual obligation tests and waiting periods.


Let's clarify a couple of things. Labor sat here last night, as I said, screaming like pigs that people would be left worse off. No, Senator Watt, they won't. One Nation has made the qualification very generous in its approach to the bereavement allowance. Initially, as you said, we voted with the government. We reflected on that with further information. That's why I introduced an amendment in this chamber. Under the government's amendment, if you look at it, as I clarified last night:




567FB Amount of payment 



(1) The amount of the person's payment is worked out using the following formula—


right? It is the 'daily rate of person's youth allowance on the relevant day' times 14 weeks times two by the government. Ours is times seven, which is far better than what the government was putting forward. It is far better for people. It will be income and asset tested, as all welfare money should be. Those people with less than $253,750, not including the family home, will be eligible. That takes out the family home. That is over a quarter of a million dollars. Those people who don't own a home will qualify for the bereavement allowance if they have less than $456,750 in cash and assets. That is not poor people. I don't think we could be fairer. Bereavement will be made available for people earning up to $1,053.34 per fortnight during the bereavement period. In regard to casual workers or people who have no access to leave arrangements, these people will qualify provided they do not earn over the income threshold during their bereavement period or hold assets higher than the amounts I quoted. This is because these people would be with little or no income during this period, during the lack of work.


Through the chair, I'm disgusted by the aspersions that Senator Watt put on me last night in the chamber. They have lied. Labor have lied and Senator Watt has lied about many things with regard to my involvement. They've lied about the penalty rates. In fact, in the federal parliament in 2017 PHON senators voted to restore penalty rates. Further, in the Senate in 2017 Labor stopped PHON, Pauline Hanson's One Nation, from moving an amendment  to restore penalty rates that had been removed in deals between union bosses, including Bill Shorten, and multinational companies. There was also the aspersion about asset sales. In fact, I've been the greatest advocate against selling assets. I have been for the last 22 years and I will continue to be. Labor's lies, as they have—




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Senator Hanson, please resume your seat. It is disorderly to refer to things said by the other side of the chamber as lies. Please reflect upon that.




Senator HANSON:
  The aspersions that have been put upon me are not true, and the verballing that has happened in this chamber is not correct. We're talking about 30 bereaved people that are going to be affected by this. We don't know the numbers of people who will go through bereavement, because death can happen to anyone at any time. Numbers cannot be put on this. The whole fact is that this country is in one hell of a mess when it comes to the welfare payments that are being put out. The welfare payments have to be restored. I have no problem with that, and we stand for those who really need help. But unless we address the expenditure that we pay in welfare payments, we are not going to rein in our debt. There are people who are abusing this.


This bill is quite generous. As I said, people who have assets of $253,750, not including the family home, can claim a bereavement payment. That is there in this. We will go back to it. Look at our amendment. Don't be hypocrites. You actually didn't vote against my amendment; you agreed with it. But you have used this chamber to put your comments across to discredit One Nation and me personally, which I will not stand for. I am a senator representing the people of Queensland and the people of Australia.

 (Victoria) (10:46):  I want to say with a heavy heart that I will be supporting the government in this situation. I say 'with a heavy heart' because a lot of the points put forward by the Greens and by Labor are very valid and I agree with a lot of them. But I've come to this decision because we can't throw the baby out with the bathwater, and what has convinced me is the up-front payment to bereaved people. When you have a death in your family, when your partner has died, you need that money up-front. You need it for funeral costs and you need it for immediate expenses. In my mind, that is the overriding issue here, and I will be voting with the government.

Turning to Senator Hanson's remarks, we've heard over and over again that, despite the amendment, which I congratulated them on yesterday—they saw the error of your ways, came back in here and moved an amendment—




Senator Hanson:
  Oh, don't give me that!




Senator WATT:
  Oh, you didn't see the error of your ways?




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Senator Watt, please address your comments through the Chair. It's disorderly to address comments across the chamber.




Senator WATT:
  Senator Hanson and her colleagues saw the error of their ways, came in yesterday and moved an amendment to try to reverse some of the cuts they had voted for twice when they turned up to the chamber on Monday night. It has been stated over and over again by the minister, both yesterday and today, that, despite that amendment, there will still be roughly 30 people per year who will be worse off as a result of the cuts that One Nation has voted for.


This amendment provides the opportunity for One Nation to fully rectify the mistake they made on Monday night. This amendment provides the opportunity to ensure that not one low-income person—mostly low-income women—whose husband dies will be worse off as a result of these changes. One Nation need to understand very clearly that if they vote against this amendment they will be making at least 30 low-income women around Australia worse off every year. They have the opportunity to stop that from happening. So this will be another test of Senator Hanson's rhetoric and claims that she stands up for battlers. Here are 30 low-income women a year who Senator Hanson and her colleagues can protect from these cuts every single year. Labor's going to be doing it. The Greens are going to be doing it. We'll see what the other crossbenchers have got to say. But if Senator Hanson and her colleagues vote with the government, as they do 85 per cent of the time, against this amendment, then they will be making people worse off.


In her remarks, Senator Hanson tried to draw some analogy with Labor's policy about dividend imputation. Every recognised expert in the country—even the Commonwealth Treasury, an arm of the government—recognises that Labor's policies will overwhelmingly affect wealthy retirees. There is a very small number of pensioners who would be affected, and Labor's position has consistently been to stand up for pensioners. So if Senator Hanson on the one hand is going to vote against this amendment and make 30 low-income women a year worse off, and on the other hand is going to oppose Labor's policies on dividend imputation, which overwhelmingly affect wealthy retirees, then Senator Hanson's absolute rubbish about standing up for battlers will be fully exposed. She will be actively taking the side of wealthy retirees in propping up a tax loophole that costs the budget $5 billion per year, and at the same time she'll be voting to hurt and make worse off 30 low-income women every year.


Senator Hanson, I would respectfully say to you that you should be taking the opposite approach. If you're serious about standing up for battlers, you should be voting with Labor on this amendment to protect these 30 low-income women, and you should stand with us in cracking down on a tax loophole that is overwhelmingly used by wealthy retirees. I wouldn't have thought that they are the people who are supporting you. I would be disappointed if what you have decided is that you're going to become a propaganda machine for wealthy retirees, but that seems to be the decision that you're making.


While I'm on my feet, I might also ask Senator Hanson whether overnight she has reflected on the other cuts that she and her colleagues voted for on Monday night. On Monday night, One Nation voted with the government, with the Liberals, to cut the wife pension, to cut the widow allowance and to cut the partner allowance—more cuts to pensions that are currently aimed at low-income people. So far, the only amendment that Senator Hanson has moved to rectify her cuts from the other night relates to the bereavement allowance. Senator Hanson, will you be bringing forward amendments today that reverse the cuts that you voted for on Monday night to the wife pension, the widow allowance and the partner allowance? Or are you going to stand by and see these low-income battlers hurt by your very own cuts?

 (Western Australia) (10:55):  I'm sorry, Minister, but I need to traverse some more discussion and questions with you in relation to what is actually paid to recipients. I know we've tried to go through this as thoroughly as we can. I'm clear about who misses out on receipt of the bereavement allowance. What I'm less clear about is the eligibility of people for a lump sum payment. I'm hopeful that the amendments that have been passed by this place substantially improve people's position. My understanding is that the bereavement allowance is typically paid at the rate of the age pension. What I'm less clear about is whether a current Newstart recipient who becomes bereaved continues to be paid at the Newstart rate or is bumped up to a bereavement allowance.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (10:58):  There is no lump sum for current recipients. It's the equivalent of the age pension over time, and it's the overall payment that is the same—sorry for making that assumption. I wanted to make sure that I understood fully that Newstart recipients are currently receiving the age pension version of the bereavement allowance if they become bereaved. That is, they move from the lower rate to the higher rate in their period of bereavement. I was unclear of whether that was currently the case. Just to be clear, currently, Newstart recipients who become bereaved get paid at the age pension rate of their bereavement allowance. Is that correct?

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (11:00):  It's considered that these people should be able to care for themselves at the time of bereavement. I feel for people who will go through this stressful time of losing a loved one. But in relation to a lot of people in Australia who are on welfare payments and who are trying to support themselves at this time, this is quite generous—having $253,000 apart from the family home or over $456,000 in cash and assets. This is when a lot of Australians are working extremely hard, paying taxes and trying to keep a roof over their own heads with escalating power prices—which I must say are in line with Labor's policies, renewable energies, plus also to do with the Greens and the escalating costs of power—to try and support themselves.


Senator Watt made reference to the wealthy end of town that are going to be affected by the franking credits. Let's put it into perspective. A lot of the people that were getting the refunds from the ATO with regard to the franking credits were those people who were not on tax returns, and they were under the $18,700. So it is going to affect those pensioners, those self-funded retirees, who are struggling. To sit here and criticise about 30 people who have assets in excess of $253,000 and own their own home is a joke. It is an absolute joke. You have used this platform here in this house, on a sensitive issue like this, to bag out me and One Nation with an amendment that we put forward that is going to assist—and no-one will be worse under this—to put across your political agenda. That is not good enough and you are pathetic in your performance.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:32):  Just to recap briefly, yesterday the group of amendments we started on was the group on sheet 8254. If senators in the chamber recall, we had just dealt with item (30), which related to schedule 15, which related to the compliance regime. We separated that out because the Labor Party requested that we deal with it separately. The Greens now oppose schedules 1, as amended, 2, 5, 6, 7 and 8 in the following terms:


(16) Schedule 1, page 5 (line 1) to page 54 (line 9), to be opposed.


(17) Schedule 2, page 55 (line 1) to page 70 (line 6), to be opposed.


(20) Schedule 5, page 117 (line 1) to page 140 (line 12), to be opposed.


(21) Schedule 6, page 141 (line 1) to page 152 (line 33), to be opposed.


(22) Schedule 7, page 153 (line 1) to page 164 (line 16), to be opposed.


(23) Schedule 8, page 165 (lines 1 to 18), to be opposed.


These schedules are: the schedule to create the jobseeker payment; the schedule for the cessation of widow B pension, which is schedule 2; schedule 5, which relates to the cessation of sickness allowance; schedule 6, which is for the cessation of widow allowance; schedule 7, which is for the cessation of partner allowance; and schedule 8, which is the schedule on the minister's rules.


We're seeking to move amendments to the schedules which relate to the jobseeker payment because we're concerned that a lot of these allowances are important allowances and are not actually about jobseeker payments. If you recall, we had a substantive discussion yesterday around the bereavement allowance, which isn't always about jobseeking. So we have concerns around all of those schedules. I raised all of these issues during my contribution in the second reading debate, and again when we've been discussing various schedules of this bill during this debate.


I do have a question for the minister around schedule 6. We've asked a lot of questions already. I'm not going to be asking a lot on these schedules, because we have dealt with some of them already. I want to ask about the widow allowance. How many women who will be on the jobseeker payment immediately before 1 January 2022, and who would have been eligible for widow allowance before 1 January 2018, won't be eligible for the age pension as they won't meet the residency requirements?

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-21,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (09:35):  Thank you, Senator Siewert. In relation to schedule 6, widow allowance, I'll just take you through the information that I have. As you are aware, if the bill goes through it will be closed to new entrants from 1 July 2018 because of the changes in relation to the bill. So people who would have otherwise claimed widow allowance will be exempt from mutual obligation activities if they satisfy the criteria that currently apply to widow allowance—that is, they were born on or before 1 July 1955, ceased to be a member of a couple since turning 40, have no recent workforce experience and are not a member of a couple.


Over the forward estimates, the total population of people who will be on Newstart allowance, so the jobseeker payments that we're now referring to in this schedule, from March 2020 who would otherwise have been granted widow allowance is estimated as 4,818 over five years, so to 2021-22. Existing widow allowance recipients will be unaffected by the closure, remaining on the payment until they reach the age pension age, and then they will transfer to the age pension. From 1 January 2022, widow allowance will cease and around 400 recipients who are over age pension age but who do not meet the age pension residence qualification rules would be transferred to the age pension under one-off transition arrangements.

So in relation to the 400 recipients, they are people who, as of 1 January 2022 when the widow allowance will actually cease, will be over the pension age but do not meet the age pension residence qualification rules. They will be transferred to the age pension under the one-off transition arrangement.

  Can I just take this opportunity to let the chamber know the order I intend to move our amendments. I had a conversation with Senator Birmingham and also Senator Pratt yesterday but I thought that it was fair to let the chamber know. I next intend to move amendments relating to schedule 3, which is on sheet 8243. I then intend to seek leave to move amendments relating to schedule 5 with amendments to schedule 6 on sheet 8243. I will then move further amendments relating to schedule 6 at the end of part 1, which is on sheet 8250. I'll seek leave to move items (1) to (3) together on schedule 13 on sheet 8315. And then I intend to move amendments on sheet 8243 that relate to schedule 4 but I'm not going to move the amendment relating to clause 2, because that has already been dealt with previously by vote on an ALP amendment. Is that okay with everybody?



The CHAIR:  I think it's as clear as mud! We shall proceed.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I move amendments to schedule 3, item 98, on sheet 8243 that relate to overseas portability of the wife pension:


(4) Schedule 3, item 98, page 85 (lines 24 to 26), omit the item, substitute:


(3) Subitem (3A) applies to a woman if, before the commencement of this item:


(a) the woman was receiving wife pension; and


(b) Division 2 of Part 4.2 of the Social Security Act 1991 applied in relation to the payment of wife pension to the woman.


(3A) Despite the amendments made by this Schedule, Parts 2.4 and 4.2 of the Social Security Act 1991, as in force immediately before the commencement of this item, and any other provision of that Act necessary to give effect to those Parts, continue to apply on and after that commencement in relation to the woman as if the amendments made by this Schedule had not been made.




Senator SIEWERT:
  We've had substantial discussion also around schedule 3 and there's already been rejection of our attempts to oppose schedule 3. Raised at the time of that debate were concerns around the women whose overseas portability of a wife pension will be affected, and this seeks to address this particular issue so that that group of around 200 women will not be affected by these changes. So this is to try to make this particular amendment to the changes to the income support system a bit fairer for those who are affected by the changes in this bill. It relates specifically to the overseas portability of the wife pension.

 (Western Australia) (09:45):  Labor is supporting these amendments by the Greens. We made our own attempt to prevent changes to the wife pension yesterday and the day before. Indeed, I take this opportunity to call on One Nation to do the right thing. They've sought to move amendments in relation to bereavement payments but if they truly believe in standing up for people who will be adversely affected by the changes in this legislation, they now have yet another opportunity to come forward and do the right thing.


We do not want to see the women affected by these changes become worse off. We need to remember the fact that people on this payment have been on this payment since 1995. They've been out of the workforce since 1995 and it is extraordinary that we would expect these women to have a reduction in their payments—to be put down to the jobseeker payment would have an extremely negative impact on their household incomes. Labor supports the Greens amendments and, indeed, calls on One Nation to support them.

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:46):  Shocked and surprised! I want to confirm that there are 200 recipients currently living overseas who are not anticipated to transfer to income support payments under this schedule.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-21,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (09:47):  That is correct.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-21,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:47):  Why was it not considered important to grandfather this group of people, as others have been grandfathered, either through the bill itself or through amendments that have been made?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-21,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (09:47):  I'm instructed that the government did not consider grandfathering these women, as it would create additional complexity which would be contrary to the intent of the welfare reform bill. As you'd be aware, these 200 recipients who are affected have access to other income sources besides their wife pension payments, such as foreign pensions and investment income.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-21,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:48):  It begs the question: why then did you grandfather the others? I'm not complaining that others have been grandfathered; I want that clearly on the record. But the fact is that others have been grandfathered, which does make additional complexity. We went through some of that complexity yesterday in the discussions under the bereavement payment. Why was this considered too complex when there are other complex arrangements in place? Also, have you calculated the dollar impact on these women's incomes of losing access to this payment?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-21,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (09:49):  I'm instructed that, because these women are actually living overseas, the complexity is due to a number of international agreements that Australia is party to, and it would very much add to or create additional complexity to the system which we're streamlining. It would actually be contrary to the intent of the welfare reform bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-21,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:49):  I just want to put it on the record that there is complexity in a lot of the other areas we're talking about—it's 200 women. Could you tell me whether you did look into the impact it would have on women? I heard your answer in terms of foreign pensions and things, but those pensions and payments to these women are calculated on the fact that there's a proportionality there. In terms of the payments, have you calculated the impact of the loss of income on these women? Also do you know whether pensions from other countries will increase for those that receive them if they lose this payment, or if they are just directly losing a payment? If so, what impact is that likely to have on their income?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-21,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (09:50):  In relation to the 200 recipients who are living overseas—the ones who will be no longer eligible for Australian government payments—this equates to a loss, I'm advised, of up to $669.60 per fortnight. In relation to the costings, that has not been undertaken because each international agreement is actually different and, again, it would create additional complexity which would be contrary to the intent of the welfare reform bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-21,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:51):  Did you say $660 per fortnight?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-21,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (09:51):  It's up to $669.60 per fortnight, but the estimated average loss is approximately $457.10. So that's probably the better cost in terms of the average: $457.10 per fortnight.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-21,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:51):  That's a substantial amount of money that people will be losing. I'll just put on the record that I'm deeply concerned about the welfare of those people or those women. We don't know whether all of them have pensions from other countries. Do we know how many have pensions from other countries?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-21,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (09:51):  In relation to that question, I am advised that—I think I've previously stated this—the understanding is that these recipients do have access to other income sources besides their wife pension payments, such as foreign pensions and investment income.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-21,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:52):  But we don't know, and we don't know if those foreign pensions will in fact increase once those people lose access to an average of $457 a fortnight and up to $669 a fortnight. That is a substantial income if you're living on a small amount of money.



The CHAIR:  The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Siewert be agreed to.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-21,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:59):  by leave—I move the amendment and the request for an amendment on sheet 8243 together:




Amendment



(6) Schedule 5, page 121 (after line 6), after item 17, insert:




17A


After subsection


603C(1)



Insert:


(1AA) If:


(a) immediately before the commencement of Part 1 of Schedule 5 to the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Act 2017 (the amending Act), sickness allowance is payable to a person; and


(b) sickness allowance would continue to be payable to the person for a period if the amendments to this Act by the amending Act had not been made;


the person is not required to satisfy the activity test in respect of that period and any further periods of incapacity immediately following that period.




Request



That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendement: 


(7) Schedule 6, item 16, page 144 (after line 15), after subsection 43(1C), insert:


(1D) A woman is qualified for an age pension if:


(a) the woman was receiving jobseeker payment immediately before 1 January 2022; and


(b) the woman would qualify for widow allowance if subsection 408AA(2) was not in force; and


(c) the woman is not otherwise qualified for an age pension.


Statement pursuant to the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000




Amendment (7)



Amendment (7) is framed as a request because it amends Schedule 6 of the bill in a way which would increase expenditure under the standing appropriation in section 242 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 from 1 January 2022.


Schedule 6 of the bill would close widow allowance to new entrants from 1 January 2018 (or the date of Royal Assent if that is later). The allowance would cease entirely from 1 January 2022. The effect of the amendment would be that, from 1 January 2022, women who have been receiving jobseeker payment, and would have been eligible for widow allowance if they had applied before the commencement of the amendments in Schedule 6, would instead be eligible for the aged pension. This will capture a group of women who may not otherwise be eligible for the aged pension because they do not meet the residence requirements in section 43 of the Social Security Act 1991. Without the amendment, this group may have been eligible to claim special benefit which is calculated at a lower rate.


Under sections 746 and 408FAof the Social Security Act 1991, special benefit and widow allowance are currently paid at a rate equivalent to (or no more than) newstart allowance (calculated under Benefit Rate Calculator B at the end of section 1068 of the Social Security Act 1991). This is a lower rate than the aged pension. The aged pension is calculated under the pension rate calculators in sections 1064 and 1065 of the Social Security Act 1991. The amendment would therefore increase the amount of expenditure under the standing appropriation in section 242 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999.


Statement by the Clerk of the Senate pursuant to the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000




Amendment (7)



If the effect of amendment (7) is to increase expenditure under the standing appropriation in section 242 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 then it is in accordance with the precedents of the Senate that the amendment be moved as a request.


All the items are important but I'm seeking to deal with them as expeditiously as I can, given the issues.


Amendment (6) provides for recipients of sickness allowance immediately before the commencement of schedule 5 of this bill to continue to be paid sickness allowance for a period without requiring them to satisfy the activity test for that period or further periods of incapacity that immediately follow the first period. We're extremely concerned about the impact of the changes under schedule 5 on those who are currently on sickness allowance, and we seek to ameliorate that impact to a certain extent with this amendment.


Amendment (7) is framed as a request for the House of Representatives. It provides that from 1 January 2022 women who were receiving jobseeker payment immediately before that date and who would have been eligible for the widow allowance before 1 January 2018 are eligible for the age pension, even if not otherwise qualified—that is, where they don't meet the qualifying residence requirements.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (10:03):  The government will be opposing these amendments.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-21,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:03):  I'm extremely disappointed to hear that answer. These are issues that were raised by members of the community and also by the National Welfare Rights Network, who raised very substantial concerns, particularly about the provision for widows. I was pursuing questions about that earlier. They are also extremely concerned about the impact on recipients of sickness allowance, given that people who have an illness aren't able to work for that reason, which is why we're seeking to ameliorate some of these issues. We did seek, through amendments, to remove this schedule. That was unsuccessful, so we're trying to ameliorate some of the impacts on people who could be significantly affected by this amendment. Hence, I urge the chamber to support these amendments.

"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-03-21,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:05):  Minister, relating to the cessation of sickness allowance, how many recipients will be affected by the transition to the Newstart payment?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-21,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (10:05):  I'm advised that approximately 8,400 existing sickness allowance recipients will continue to receive sickness allowance beyond 20 March 2020, until their current medical certificate expires.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-03-21,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:05):  Given the payment is the same as Newstart, how does the government project savings of $6.9 million over the forward estimates?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-21,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (10:06):  I'm advised that the save is due to the reduction in human service costs for servicing of recipients, including checking whether a person has a job to return to.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-21,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:06):  One of the reasons for this amendment is to cement some of the comments that the government has made about how this particular provision will work. As I've said, the item provides for recipients of sickness allowance immediately before the commencement of part 1 of schedule 5 of this bill to continue to be paid sickness allowance for a period without requiring them to satisfy the activity test for that period or further periods of incapacity that immediately follow the first period. My understanding is that government has made comments around how this particular provision will operate, so can I ask the government if my understanding is, in fact, correct? Could you confirm that? That gives us at least a record in the Hansard of how this provision will operate, so that there can be a degree of certainty around that transition period.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-21,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (10:07):  I've got some information that I'm able to provide to you that will shed light on the issue at hand. The schedule itself, as you are aware, closes the sickness allowance to new entrants on 20 March 2020, and ceases the sickness allowance altogether on 20 September 2020. Just for the benefit of Hansard, sickness allowance is the short-term income support payment for people aged 22 years to under pension age who have a temporary incapacity due to illness or injury and who have a job or study to return to after their recovery. It is paid at the Newstart allowance rate. It is generally granted for the length of a person's medical certificate, up to a period of 13 weeks. If payment is required after 13 weeks, a person must lodge another medical certificate. As I've stated in answer to Senator Patrick's question, around 8,400 existing sickness allowance recipients will continue to receive sickness allowance beyond 20 March 2020 until their current medical certificate expires—so their medical certificate takes them beyond the March 2020 date. Of these existing recipients, it is estimated that around 7,700 will lodge another medical certificate after 20 March 2020 and will be required to transfer to the jobseeker payment. They will be exempt from mutual obligation requirements, if they meet the incapacitated exemption rules. From 20 March 2020, new entrants who would previously have been eligible for sickness allowance will be able to claim assistance through jobseeker payment instead. The new entrants will also be exempt from mutual obligation requirements if they meet, again, the incapacitated exemption rules. That's the information I have to provide to you.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-21,"



Senator SIEWERT


(Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:09):  Can I just clarify: if they've gone past the March 2020 deadline, they're still incapacitated and they get their medical certificate for the next round but they transition into jobseeker payment and they've got a sickness allowance, does that then match up with the same details of the incapacity requirements under jobseeker payment?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-21,"



Senator CASH


(Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (10:10):  Yes, the rate of the allowance is the same.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-21,"



Senator SIEWERT


(Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:11):  I obviously didn't give enough detail in the question. They've got the medical certificate and they've been on sickness allowance, meeting those requirements. They have another medical certificate, but they've then hit that wall of the deadlines. They then transfer onto jobseeker allowance. Is that going to enable them to meet the requirements for incapacity under the jobseeker payment in that transition process? They've got the same illness.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-21,"



Senator CASH


(Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (10:11):  Thank you, Senator Siewert. The rationale at the moment is: do you have a job to go to? For the persons that you are referring to, on 20 March 2020 there will be some who go over that date, and they'll be exempt from mutual obligation requirements if they meet the incapacitated exemption rule. That's the first cohort. Then there are those, obviously, who are new entrants, and they go straight to jobseeker payment, and they also meet the incapacitated exemption rules. In relation to those rules, it is then about incapacity as opposed to: do you have a job to go to?

Senator SIEWERT


(Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:12):  Thank you for that clarification. I'm hoping this will be my last question or set of questions. In terms of temporary incapacity under the current process and incapacity under the new jobseeker payment, will they be the same? That's a better way of articulating what I was trying to get to earlier.

The TEMPORARY CHAIR

:  Thank you, Senator Siewert.





Senator SIEWERT:

I 
now move amendment (1) on sheet 8250:



(1) Schedule 6, Part 1, page 142 (after line 11), at the end of the Part, add:




4A


Subsection


729(1)



After ""subsection"", insert ""(1A) or"".




4B


After subsection


729(1)



Insert:


(1A) The Secretary must determine that a special benefit should be granted to a person for a period if:


(a) the person meets the eligibility requirements for widow allowance in Subdivision A of Division 2 of Part 2.8A; and


(b) the person is not qualified for widows allowance on the basis of subsection 408AA(2); and


(c) the person is not qualified for newstart allowance; and


(d) the person is not qualified for the aged pension.




4C


Paragraph 733(1
) (
b)



Before ""the value"", insert ""subject to subsection (1A),"".




4D


After subsection


733(1)



Insert:



(1A) If subsection 729(1A) applies to a person, whether the value of the person's assets exceeds the person's assets value limit is to be determined by reference to section 408CE (the assets test applying in relation to widow allowance).


This relates to the cessation of the widow allowance. We are seeking to make this slightly fairer. Again, we were unsuccessful in removing this particular schedule, so we are trying to make this amendment a bit fairer for those people that are affected on the cessation of the widow allowance.


This relates to inserting a section (1A) in this schedule. It requires the secretary to determine that a special benefit should be granted to a person for a period if the person meets the eligibility requirement for widow allowance in subdivision A of division 2, Part 2.8A—another set of provisions there. It also puts in an amendment that if subsection 729(1A) applies to a person where the value of the person's assets exceeds the person's asset value limit, that is to be determined by reference to another schedule. In other words, it's relating to some of the people that are affected by the cessation of the widow allowance.


We think some of these amendments unfairly impact on people currently receiving allowances but also on people into the future. Again, we urge the Senate to support these amendments that make schedule 6 slightly fairer and make the transition process into the jobseeker payment that much fairer.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (10:17):  I'm advised that existing recipients will receive widow allowance until 1 January 2022, when the remaining recipients will be transferred to the age pension. Approximately 420 recipients who were granted widow allowance after reaching age pension age but who do not meet residential qualifications will be transferred to the age pension under transitional arrangements.


Women who receive Newstart allowance or jobseeker payment who reach age pension age and who do not meet the age pension residency requirements will be required to claim special benefit instead. This will affect 24 people in 2018-19, 68 in 2019-20, 87 in 2019-21 and one in 2021-22.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:18):  My question is in terms of this provision and further explanation about why we're trying to move this provision. These amendments to schedule 6 are provisions for women who are over the age pension age, who would have been eligible for the widow allowance if it continued to be open for recipients after 1 January 2018, who are ineligible for Newstart due to their age and ineligible for the age pension due to the residency requirements. We're putting in provisions whereby they would automatically then go onto a special benefit payment with the same means test as the current widow allowance so that their cohort is not worse off than they would otherwise have been. That's why we are seeking to ameliorate some of the provisions of the creation of the jobseeker payment, which rolls a whole lot of allowances into the jobseeker payment. That's the reason for this particular amendment.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Reynolds
):  The question is that Australian Greens amendment (1), to schedule 6 at the end of part 1, on sheet 8250 be agreed to.


Question negatived.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-21,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:20):  by leave—Again, can I articulate that the Greens were the only people who voted to support that particular amendment. I now seek leave to move Australian Greens amendments (1) to (3) on sheet 8315 together:


Leave granted.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I move:


(1) Schedule 13, item 2, page 189 (line 14), omit ""(1)"".


(2) Schedule 13, item 2, page 189 (lines 17 to 20), omit subsection 28C(2).


(3) Schedule 14, item 7, page 193 (line 4), at the end of section 42U, add:


   (4) A determination under subsection 42U(3) does not apply in relation to a person who is a declared program participant.


These relate to schedule 13, which we've had quite a lot of discussion about previously where we've sought to remove these provisions. These are about declared program participants and serious failure determination not to apply to declared program participants. These amendments, as I said, relate to section 13. We're still concerned about some of the impacts, and it's not clear in this provision, on some of the exemptions around declared program participants.


I should say these amendments also relate to schedule 14. So there are amendments to schedule 13, item 2, and schedule 14, item 7. They remove subsection 28C(2), which gives the secretary the power to make provision in the determination made under subsection 21C(1) for the operation of the social security law in relation to people who become or stop being declared program recipients at a particular time, including in relation to things that happen before that time. They also amend schedule 14 to expressly exempt declared program participants.


During the Senate inquiry, issues were raised around the impact of sections 13 and 14 as they relate to declared program participants. We're seeking here to make it clearer about those declared program participants. These relate to those sections around drug and alcohol addiction. I'm not going to traverse those whole arguments again, because we did have substantive discussions on those around our previous amendments, the ALP's amendments and Senator Leyonhjelm's amendments. I'm not going to traverse those again. This is seeking to address some issues where the legislation is a bit grey in those particular areas, specifically as they relate to declared program participants.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-03-21,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:28):  My understanding, according to my calculation, is: it is the clause that relates to item (5) on sheet 8243. We dealt with item (2) earlier in the debate, yesterday. I articulated that we would be seeking to move the amendment as it relates to schedule 4, because schedule 4 is now different. It relates to the bereavement allowance. We had a long debate yesterday; I'm not going to go through that debate again. Chair, I don't know if I need to seek leave because I'm actually splitting that amendment.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Senator Siewert, you don't need to seek leave. My instructions are that you can move amendment (5), which opposes schedule 4.




Senator SIEWERT:
  The Greens oppose schedule 4 in the following terms:


(5) Schedule 4, page 92 (line 1) to page 116 (line 25), to be opposed.


Specifically I'm focused in this instance on schedule 4 because it changed with amendments yesterday. We had that debate yesterday, particularly as it related to the amendments moved by Senator Hanson. It was made clear then that a number of people will still be significantly affected by this, even with the previous amendments by the government and Senator Hanson, just as a number of people are significantly affected by all the clauses we've been talking about this morning. Having said that, I'll remind people about the debate we had yesterday, which clearly articulated those that would still remain affected. This amendment, while it deals with clause 2, is specifically focused on clause 4, which is in effect a new clause. It's a different vote than the vote that we took I think only two nights ago—it seems like a whole week—in this place on schedule 4. That is my intent and focus with this particular amendment.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-03-21,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (10:34):  I acknowledge that the amendments made yesterday go some way towards improving the situation for bereaved persons, who will no longer be reduced completely to the jobseeker rate of payment. Again, I say to One Nation: if you truly want to support people who are bereaved then we should go back to the income and assets tests for the age pension, not the income and assets tests for the jobseeker payment.


When One Nation tried to assure the chamber that they had won a great victory for bereaved people, because people would be paid more than they were currently, that was patently false. They were only being paid more relative to the cuts that this government had put on the table, which would have reduced people's payments to the jobseeker rate of payment. All that amendment did was to restore the current rate of payment, but not for everybody who will receive it, because of the change in the income and assets test. If One Nation truly wanted to help people who are on low incomes, who have few assets—who are eligible for the age pension, for example—then they would be supporting the Greens amendment here now.


I ask the minister: if someone is old enough to qualify for a pension and if their assets test is low enough that they would qualify for an age pension but they are otherwise working and they want to go back to that job after they have finished their period of bereavement—so it's a bereavement version—will you pay them the age pension for that period, or will you pay them a jobseeker bereavement allowance?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-21,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (10:37):  There are a number of qualifying conditions in relation to that, which I'd need to understand: Do they have leave? Do they have other income coming in?

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (10:37):  I said that they would otherwise qualify for income support. For example: I'm 67 years old, I work 30 hours a week casually in a supermarket, I become bereaved, I'd like to go back to that job but I don't have leave and I don't have any other income support; what version of payment would I receive?

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-03-21,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (10:37):  In relation to the specific circumstances that you've articulated, I'm advised that it is the age pension.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-03-21,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (10:38):  Thank you. So, in concluding my remarks on this today, I say to the chamber: if someone is bereaved they may be employed and they may need income support just for the period of bereavement. They're not a jobseeker—they're quite capable of returning to the workforce—but they need that income support. I say to the chamber: there is nothing wrong with restoring the previous version of bereavement allowance. The previous version of the bereavement allowance pays it at the rate of the age pension. We can be secure knowing that it will continue to be paid at the rate of the age pension and not attached to a recalculated version of the jobseeker allowance, which we know has not tracked along as well as the age pension has. Historically, that allowance has been much lower than the age pension, and I would much prefer to see this allowance continue to retain its value alongside the age pension.


So I'm calling on Senator Hanson and her colleagues in One Nation: if you truly believe in making people who are bereaved better off in that very difficult time of their life, support the amendment put forward by the Greens.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-03-21,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (10:40):  In response to Labor: it's quite interesting to hear you say that you worry about people. Yesterday, the government said about 30 people will be affected by this—




Senator Watt:
  Worse off.




Senator HANSON:
  Thirty people you're saying will be worse off. It is the Labor Party that has just brought in a policy to do with franking credits that will affect at least 610,000 people. It could be up to a million people. Are they worried about it? Here they are in this chamber, screaming like pigs about 30 people, but they want to bring in franking credits that are going to affect 610,000 people. Let's get the figures into order.


Just so that we're clear, under the amendment put forward by One Nation, everyone who qualifies for the bereavement allowance under the jobseeker payment will be no worse off and some people will be better off than under the current arrangements. Payments are targeted to those who need it. Bereavement allowance is paid to people in lieu of work, and this is why it is exempt from normal mutual obligation tests and waiting periods.


Let's clarify a couple of things. Labor sat here last night, as I said, screaming like pigs that people would be left worse off. No, Senator Watt, they won't. One Nation has made the qualification very generous in its approach to the bereavement allowance. Initially, as you said, we voted with the government. We reflected on that with further information. That's why I introduced an amendment in this chamber. Under the government's amendment, if you look at it, as I clarified last night:




567FB Amount of payment 



(1) The amount of the person's payment is worked out using the following formula—


right? It is the 'daily rate of person's youth allowance on the relevant day' times 14 weeks times two by the government. Ours is times seven, which is far better than what the government was putting forward. It is far better for people. It will be income and asset tested, as all welfare money should be. Those people with less than $253,750, not including the family home, will be eligible. That takes out the family home. That is over a quarter of a million dollars. Those people who don't own a home will qualify for the bereavement allowance if they have less than $456,750 in cash and assets. That is not poor people. I don't think we could be fairer. Bereavement will be made available for people earning up to $1,053.34 per fortnight during the bereavement period. In regard to casual workers or people who have no access to leave arrangements, these people will qualify provided they do not earn over the income threshold during their bereavement period or hold assets higher than the amounts I quoted. This is because these people would be with little or no income during this period, during the lack of work.


Through the chair, I'm disgusted by the aspersions that Senator Watt put on me last night in the chamber. They have lied. Labor have lied and Senator Watt has lied about many things with regard to my involvement. They've lied about the penalty rates. In fact, in the federal parliament in 2017 PHON senators voted to restore penalty rates. Further, in the Senate in 2017 Labor stopped PHON, Pauline Hanson's One Nation, from moving an amendment  to restore penalty rates that had been removed in deals between union bosses, including Bill Shorten, and multinational companies. There was also the aspersion about asset sales. In fact, I've been the greatest advocate against selling assets. I have been for the last 22 years and I will continue to be. Labor's lies, as they have—




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Senator Hanson, please resume your seat. It is disorderly to refer to things said by the other side of the chamber as lies. Please reflect upon that.




Senator HANSON:
  The aspersions that have been put upon me are not true, and the verballing that has happened in this chamber is not correct. We're talking about 30 bereaved people that are going to be affected by this. We don't know the numbers of people who will go through bereavement, because death can happen to anyone at any time. Numbers cannot be put on this. The whole fact is that this country is in one hell of a mess when it comes to the welfare payments that are being put out. The welfare payments have to be restored. I have no problem with that, and we stand for those who really need help. But unless we address the expenditure that we pay in welfare payments, we are not going to rein in our debt. There are people who are abusing this.


This bill is quite generous. As I said, people who have assets of $253,750, not including the family home, can claim a bereavement payment. That is there in this. We will go back to it. Look at our amendment. Don't be hypocrites. You actually didn't vote against my amendment; you agreed with it. But you have used this chamber to put your comments across to discredit One Nation and me personally, which I will not stand for. I am a senator representing the people of Queensland and the people of Australia.

Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (10:46):  I want to say with a heavy heart that I will be supporting the government in this situation. I say 'with a heavy heart' because a lot of the points put forward by the Greens and by Labor are very valid and I agree with a lot of them. But I've come to this decision because we can't throw the baby out with the bathwater, and what has convinced me is the up-front payment to bereaved people. When you have a death in your family, when your partner has died, you need that money up-front. You need it for funeral costs and you need it for immediate expenses. In my mind, that is the overriding issue here, and I will be voting with the government.

Turning to Senator Hanson's remarks, we've heard over and over again that, despite the amendment, which I congratulated them on yesterday—they saw the error of your ways, came back in here and moved an amendment—




Senator Hanson:
  Oh, don't give me that!




Senator WATT:
  Oh, you didn't see the error of your ways?




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Senator Watt, please address your comments through the Chair. It's disorderly to address comments across the chamber.




Senator WATT:
  Senator Hanson and her colleagues saw the error of their ways, came in yesterday and moved an amendment to try to reverse some of the cuts they had voted for twice when they turned up to the chamber on Monday night. It has been stated over and over again by the minister, both yesterday and today, that, despite that amendment, there will still be roughly 30 people per year who will be worse off as a result of the cuts that One Nation has voted for.


This amendment provides the opportunity for One Nation to fully rectify the mistake they made on Monday night. This amendment provides the opportunity to ensure that not one low-income person—mostly low-income women—whose husband dies will be worse off as a result of these changes. One Nation need to understand very clearly that if they vote against this amendment they will be making at least 30 low-income women around Australia worse off every year. They have the opportunity to stop that from happening. So this will be another test of Senator Hanson's rhetoric and claims that she stands up for battlers. Here are 30 low-income women a year who Senator Hanson and her colleagues can protect from these cuts every single year. Labor's going to be doing it. The Greens are going to be doing it. We'll see what the other crossbenchers have got to say. But if Senator Hanson and her colleagues vote with the government, as they do 85 per cent of the time, against this amendment, then they will be making people worse off.


In her remarks, Senator Hanson tried to draw some analogy with Labor's policy about dividend imputation. Every recognised expert in the country—even the Commonwealth Treasury, an arm of the government—recognises that Labor's policies will overwhelmingly affect wealthy retirees. There is a very small number of pensioners who would be affected, and Labor's position has consistently been to stand up for pensioners. So if Senator Hanson on the one hand is going to vote against this amendment and make 30 low-income women a year worse off, and on the other hand is going to oppose Labor's policies on dividend imputation, which overwhelmingly affect wealthy retirees, then Senator Hanson's absolute rubbish about standing up for battlers will be fully exposed. She will be actively taking the side of wealthy retirees in propping up a tax loophole that costs the budget $5 billion per year, and at the same time she'll be voting to hurt and make worse off 30 low-income women every year.


Senator Hanson, I would respectfully say to you that you should be taking the opposite approach. If you're serious about standing up for battlers, you should be voting with Labor on this amendment to protect these 30 low-income women, and you should stand with us in cracking down on a tax loophole that is overwhelmingly used by wealthy retirees. I wouldn't have thought that they are the people who are supporting you. I would be disappointed if what you have decided is that you're going to become a propaganda machine for wealthy retirees, but that seems to be the decision that you're making.


While I'm on my feet, I might also ask Senator Hanson whether overnight she has reflected on the other cuts that she and her colleagues voted for on Monday night. On Monday night, One Nation voted with the government, with the Liberals, to cut the wife pension, to cut the widow allowance and to cut the partner allowance—more cuts to pensions that are currently aimed at low-income people. So far, the only amendment that Senator Hanson has moved to rectify her cuts from the other night relates to the bereavement allowance. Senator Hanson, will you be bringing forward amendments today that reverse the cuts that you voted for on Monday night to the wife pension, the widow allowance and the partner allowance? Or are you going to stand by and see these low-income battlers hurt by your very own cuts?

I know we've tried to go through this as thoroughly as we can. I'm clear about who misses out on receipt of the bereavement allowance. What I'm less clear about is the eligibility of people for a lump sum payment. I'm hopeful that the amendments that have been passed by this place substantially improve people's position. My understanding is that the bereavement allowance is typically paid at the rate of the age pension. What I'm less clear about is whether a current Newstart recipient who becomes bereaved continues to be paid at the Newstart rate or is bumped up to a bereavement allowance.

That is, they move from the lower rate to the higher rate in their period of bereavement. I was unclear of whether that was currently the case.

 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (10:59):  I am instructed that to be found ineligible, based on the assets test, a single person needs to be have assets of more than $253,750, not including the family home, if they are a homeowner and $456,750 if they are not a homeowner.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (11:00):  It's considered that these people should be able to care for themselves at the time of bereavement. I feel for people who will go through this stressful time of losing a loved one. But in relation to a lot of people in Australia who are on welfare payments and who are trying to support themselves at this time, this is quite generous—having $253,000 apart from the family home or over $456,000 in cash and assets. This is when a lot of Australians are working extremely hard, paying taxes and trying to keep a roof over their own heads with escalating power prices—which I must say are in line with Labor's policies, renewable energies, plus also to do with the Greens and the escalating costs of power—to try and support themselves.


Senator Watt made reference to the wealthy end of town that are going to be affected by the franking credits. Let's put it into perspective. A lot of the people that were getting the refunds from the ATO with regard to the franking credits were those people who were not on tax returns, and they were under the $18,700. So it is going to affect those pensioners, those self-funded retirees, who are struggling. To sit here and criticise about 30 people who have assets in excess of $253,000 and own their own home is a joke. It is an absolute joke. You have used this platform here in this house, on a sensitive issue like this, to bag out me and One Nation with an amendment that we put forward that is going to assist—and no-one will be worse under this—to put across your political agenda. That is not good enough and you are pathetic in your performance.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (12:45):  Today I rise to congratulate Steven Marshall and the South Australian Liberal team on a stunning election victory on Saturday night.




Senator Farrell:
  Not seriously! You can't be serious. He scrapes in after 16 years—




Senator RUSTON:
  And I have to say that it was a very enjoyable evening that I spent with Senator Farrell, who seems to be rather noisy—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator McCarthy
):  Order!




Senator RUSTON:
  Thank you—




Senator Farrell:
  You can't be serious about this!




Senator RUSTON:
  Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. I note that there is some level of bleating coming from the other side! I had a very enjoyable evening with Senator Farrell, but I must say that as the night went on his predictions looked less and less likely to come about.


But it wasn't just an election victory for the Liberals in my home state of South Australia; it was actually a victory for all South Australians. This wasn't just any old typical election. We had an interesting third force in it, and that was the Nick Xenophon team. So with all the challenges that were thrown at Steven Marshall and his team and that they had to overcome, it was a resounding victory. It was a great victory. And I think that still, no matter how much of a challenge was thrown at us by the third-party Nick Xenophon team, the main challenge still remained the Weatherill Labor government.


There have been 16 years under this government, which has profoundly neglected South Australia, and I believe that it has profoundly neglected where I live in South Australia—rural and regional areas. South Australia was the laughing-stock of the country, with the highest-priced and most unreliable power in the nation.




Senator Farrell:
  What about the MDB Plan?




Senator RUSTON:
  The fact is that we've seen a debt of massive proportions bequeathed to the people of South Australia because of the reckless spending that we saw under the previous government. I think that the Labor Weatherill government is a very strong reason that the people of South Australia saw off this very incompetent and tired government.


We don't have to go very far to have a look at some of the things that caused the problems and caused the people of South Australia to decide to move away from that government. There were horrific scandals like the Oakden aged-care facilities and Families SA. This was a government that made an art form out of avoiding accountability and responsibility, and, as Senator Farrell just raised, this was a government which held a gun to the head of the Murray-Darling plan in its desperation to get re-elected.


I could go on, but I just want to reinforce that the neglected regions and rural sector in South Australia are the main reasons that I believe this government was thrown out, and resoundingly. A great example was South Australia's moratorium on the commercial production of genetically modified crops. This was politically and ideologically motivated. This moratorium has been constantly justified by the previous Premier, Jay Weatherill, and his previous minister for agriculture, Leon Bignal, who is yet to win his seat, on the basis that it provides farmers some sort of commercial advantage in being able to access markets sensitive about GM. However, they are yet to provide any real unequivocal evidence that supports this claim. Growers in New South Wales and Victoria have been able to grow GM canola for 10 straight seasons now. So far, they have experienced no adverse commercial impacts in growing this stuff. I think that the jury remains totally out on any evidence whatsoever that has been provided by South Australia about the advantage of doing that. When Premier Weatherill was confronted with the evidence, following calls from South Australian farmers for the moratorium on GM to be lifted, this was his response to ABC's Landline in July last year:


The truth is there are not a lot of votes out there in country South Australia for us, so in some ways we are free of the electoral imperatives about this.


That is a pretty sad indictment but I suppose it is a very truthful reflection on what Jay Weatherill thought about rural and regional South Australia. Make no mistake, this cynical neglect was only one of the factors that has motivated the South Australian public—but it was the main motivating factor for me to put my hand up to come into parliament in the first place. If you want to talk about cynicism, let's talk about the extraordinary circus of Nick Xenophon's hastily assembled team of party-hopping opportunists.




Senator Farrell:
  Now you're making some sense.




Senator RUSTON:
  I'm pleased to see Senator Farrell is at last starting to agree with some of my comments. It was extraordinary how the media pandered to Mr Xenophon's stunts and gimmicks for so many years and rarely held him to account or asked him to provide any funding substantiation for some of the things he threw out there. But as the election campaign rolled on, and Mr Xenophon went from being the populist 'keep the bastards honest' party to thinking he could be a real alternative to the two major parties, it was quite interesting how quickly the wheels fell off.


I pay credit to some of the people who worked extraordinarily hard on this election campaign. Nobody deserves more credit than Vince Tarzia—the lion of Hartley, as he is now called—who not only won his own marginal seat but also overcame the most extraordinary looming threat anybody could ever expect when Nick Xenophon decided he was going to move back to South Australia and take on Vince Tarzia in Hartley. The extraordinary hard work Vince has done over the past four years as member for Hartley saw the challenge very easily overcome in the end. The people of Hartley saw him as a genuine, hardworking grassroots local member, and he was rewarded on election night with quite an easy victory; he even saw a two-party preferred swing to him. I think Bollywood ads and campaign stunts were well and truly not what the voters of Hartley wanted; they wanted a solid local member.


The Liberal success didn't end there. Paula Luethen defeated the Labor candidate in a tight contest in King. Paula worked absolutely tirelessly for the entire election campaign and was rewarded by the people of King, who put their faith in her to be their representative for the next four years. Carolyn Habib overcame the incumbent, Annabel Digance, in Elder. She defeated her this time, after suffering the indignity of quite a nasty campaign in 2014 where a whole heap of racist tactics were used against Carolyn. Not to be dissuaded, she came back and ran a fantastic campaign for a very comfortable victory. Matt Cowdrey, Australia's most awarded Paralympian swimming star, fought a very tight contest in the seat of Colton and was also victorious. But that wasn't because he was a Paralympian; he succeeded because he doorknocked his entire electorate. There are a number of others. Josh Teague, in the Adelaide Hills seat of Heysen, fought off a very determined fight from the Nick Xenophon Team to win his seat, as did all our members and new candidates in the Adelaide Hills area. David Basham retained the seat of Finniss for us and, as I mentioned earlier, Andy Gilfillan is still fighting a very good fight against incumbent Leon Bignell in Mawson. A couple of other country members gave come in: Fraser Ellis, in Narungga, and Nick McBride in MacKillop.


It was a great result on Saturday night. It reflected that the people of South Australia obviously thought the hard work, determination and solid and stable government offered by Steven Marshall was what they wanted for the next four years. He has worked very hard and he had a plan. Gimmicks, stunts and playing around were never going to encourage the people of South Australia to support a party into government. They wanted stability, certainty into the future and somebody who wasn't going to play games.


The most important thing that will support and sustain Steven Marshall over the next four years is the fact that he has such depth in his team. He has a team of members of parliament, all of whom have worked extremely hard. He has a new team that's been elected, plus a team that's been there for a number of years—a solid team. It was great to see Vickie Chapman elected as the Deputy Premier, so we have a gender equity balance at the top of the ticket, with the Premier being a male and Vickie being a female. She is there because she is an absolutely competent and capable performer. She will be an absolute powerhouse to sit behind Steven and assist him as he delivers his first term as Premier of South Australia. Sitting behind them is a team of great members of parliament who will become great ministers. I look forward to working with my very dear friend and colleague Tim Whetstone as we implement policies for rural and regional South Australia. Given the neglect of rural and regional South Australia over the last 16 years, we have got a lot of work to do to catch up. But I am sure, with the combination of fantastic local members that we have out in rural and regional South Australia and the ministers who have been appointed to support rural and regional South Australia, we are now going to see all South Australians benefit from the actions of their government.

The PRESIDENT
 (15:03):  I was asked a question yesterday by Senator Wong with respect to the contract for cleaning services at Parliament House—whether it had been awarded and whether I could advise the Senate of the details of the company involved and payment. I have sought advice from the Department of Parliamentary Services and I can provide the following information. The new contract for cleaning services at Parliament House has yet to be awarded. The Department of Parliamentary Services expects to finalise the tender evaluation process within the next two weeks. Following this, a period of negotiation with the preferred tenderer will commence. The successful tenderer must comply with all government legislation, including the Fair Work Act 2009. At this stage it is too early to make judgements regarding wage rates for cleaners. Senators should rest assured that the tender and contract are being managed within the Commonwealth Procurement Rules. The Department of Parliamentary Services anticipates the process will be concluded by the end of April.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2018-03-21,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:04):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Jobs and Innovation (Senator Cash) to a question without notice asked by Senator Cameron today relating to the annual wage review undertaken by the Fair Work Commission.


Today I had the fortune to listen to the secretary of the ACTU, Sally McManus, and the misfortune to listen to the discredited Minister Cash, an absolutely discredited minister, a minister who should do the right thing and simply resign from the frontbench. This is a minister who presided over an absolute mess in her previous portfolios. This is a minister who does not care about the wages, conditions and rights of ordinary working families in this country. This is a minister who sets out constantly to attack working people, attack workers' wages and attack penalty rates. It's an outrageous position supported by every one of the rabble that sits across this place—every one of them. It is an absolute rabble of a government, a government who would rather give $65 billion worth of tax cuts to their mates in the banks than look after the penalty rates and the working conditions of ordinary workers in this country. They are an absolute disgrace.


But it's not just these sorts of attacks that we see taking place; we also see this government and this discredited Minister Cash using her agencies to attack the trade union movement and to run political attacks on her political opponents. We have seen that happen constantly with this minister. The other night I saw a BBC Panorama program called Taking on Putin. The BBC reporter was John Sweeney. He was showing the use by the Putin government of government agencies to attack their political opponents. Well, what you see here with Minister Cash is the agency that she set up, the ROC, being used to attack her political opponents. We also see the Fair Work Ombudsman and the ABCC being used to attack her political opponents. This government would sit nicely with the Putin administration in the USSR. They would be lovely there with the Russians, because they would fit in nicely. Using government agencies to attack your political opponents is just outrageous.


Minister Cash is completely discredited due to her failure to deal with any of the questions that were asked of her today. We asked her whether she would make a submission to the Fair Work Commission to defend workers in the hair and beauty industry who rely on penalty rates. She just wouldn't answer the question. She wouldn't answer the question, because she's not capable of answering the question or to have a submission prepared to actually support workers that are doing it tough. Yet we've got these organisations going in arguing for cutbacks to workers' wages, workers' penalty rates and workers' conditions, supported by this rabble of a government that is on its last legs. It is a decaying, dying government with a weak Prime Minister and ministers in this place that would use agencies to attack working people and working people's wages and conditions.


It's an outrageous proposition that a minister can't come in here and be honest and accurate in terms of the questions asked. She was asked again: 'Is the government's only plan to help struggling Australian workers this $65 billion tax cut?' They are relying on trickle-down economics that haven't worked anywhere else in the world. We heard the report from the President about the cleaners in this place, who do a great job and who deserve decent rates of pay and decent conditions. What was one of this government's first acts? To cut the wages of some of the lowest paid people in this place: the cleaners. They cut the wages of the cleaners—and I bet they'll do it again, because they don't care about workers, they don't care about the rights of workers and they don't care about workers' living standards. They are a disgrace. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-03-21,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:09):  This is what you can expect from Senator Cameron, with that diatribe of misinformation, accusations and political attacks against one of the most successful ministers this parliament has seen for a long time, who just happens to be a woman. It's interesting with Senator Cameron and a couple of other Labor senators that the vicious political attacks always seem to be on successful women ministers such as Senator Cash, Senator Payne and Senator Fierravanti-Wells. I just wonder why that is.


Senator Cash doesn't need me to defend or protect her. She's more than capable of doing that, and she has done that against vicious personal attacks by the likes of Senator Cameron over many, many months now. Why are Senator Cameron and the union movement so determined to attack Senator Cash and try to bring her down? It's because they know she is successful at her job, she understands the portfolio brilliantly and she can identify the rorts and rabble that pass as the union movement in Australia at the moment. No wonder only nine per cent of workers in the private industry in Australia choose to belong to a union movement.


I'd like to ask Senator Cameron—and also Senator Ketter, who I see here but who I might say takes a much more reasonable approach to policy debate—to explain to us how the superannuation industry is going to deal with Labor's policy on slashing the income of lower paid pensioners and older people with their dividend imputation approach? Both of those senators that I mentioned have been directors of large superannuation companies. I'm not quite sure of Senator Ketter's case, but I know in Senator Cameron's case as the director of one of Australia's biggest superannuation funds he was dragging in a salary of $150,000. He should understand just what the impact will be of Labor's policies on the superannuation holdings of people on very, very limited income. I challenge Senator Cameron to actually explain to this parliament just what impact the Australian Labor Party's policy will have on retirees and pensioners if their imputation policy goes ahead.


I want to quickly turn to the penalty rates that were the subject of the question and of Senator Cameron's diatribe. In passing, I say it is typical of Senator Cameron to accuse the government of doing something with cleaners' wages. He knows we all love the cleaners. As the President explained just previously, this is an independent process, quite removed from the government, and no decision's yet been made. Yet that doesn't stop Senator Cameron making these false and vile accusations on behalf of a group who we all love.


On penalty rates, I just reiterate again what Senator Cash said so well in answers given in question time. These penalty rates are determined by the Fair Work Commission. Who set up the Fair Work Commission? It was the Australian Labor Party in government and, in particular, Mr Bill Shorten. Who made the decisions on penalty rates? It was that Fair Work Commission set up by the Labor Party, the chairman and most of the members of which were appointed by the Australian Labor Party in government. I make no comment about that. I think they carefully looked at the issues and came to the decision. But it wasn't a government decision. In spite of Senator Cameron continually misinforming the parliament and anyone who might be listening to this debate about that fact, those decisions on penalty rates were made by the Labor set up and appointed Fair Work Commission, the independent umpire that Labor at one stage used to support.


If you want to talk about penalty rates, just have a look at the example Senator Cash gave about Mr Bill Shorten in his time as a union leader in giving away the penalty rates of lower paid workers. Senator Cameron should understand the truth of these matters. (Time expired)

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-03-21,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (15:14):  I rise today to also take note of the answers given by our Minister for Jobs and Innovation, Senator Cash, to Senator Cameron's question on the unwillingness of the government, and indeed Senator Cash's own role, in being prepared to protect the penalty rates of Australian workers, specifically hair and beauty workers across our country. I must say, despite Senator Cash's impressive attempts to try and avoid answering these targeted questions, her message was, nevertheless, fairly clear. It is clear this government will not stand up for the 85,000 workers in the beauty industry who are at risk of losing their penalty rates, after the hair and beauty employers made their submission to the Fair Work Commission this week. They have called for cuts to the penalty rates of workers in this industry. 


The minister's answers show us that this government is simply not prepared to stand up for these workers. These workers are not well paid, as anyone who talks to their hairdresser knows. I have to say I certainly hope that Senator Cash does not get her hair or her nails done on a weekend, because she doesn't think her hairdresser deserves to be paid for working on the weekend. No-one should have to put up with that. These 84,000 workers now join an ever-growing number of workers who are at risk of losing their penalty rates—penalty rates on which they very much depend to make ends meet week after week. 


We know that last July penalty rate cuts kicked in for 700,000 workers in the retail, hospitality, fast food and pharmacy sectors. Is it any coincidence that wage growth is stagnating in this country? You only need to look at these kinds of figures to see where wages in this country are going. It seems to me that it's likely that this government wants to see hair and beauty workers be next. Who after that? We know, importantly, that aged-care workers are specifically also very worried about their penalty rates. We know that cost of living is rising and wage growth has hit record lows, but we continue to see these attacks on the wages of workers. It's all very well for those opposite to talk about their trickle-down economics of company tax cuts. The simple fact is: why can't you stand up for the penalty rates of workers who work on the weekends for some of these very big corporations? Your failure to do so shows me very clearly that I don't have any confidence in your expectation, your argument, that company tax cuts will eventually benefit workers. Under this government, we see life just getting harder and harder for ordinary Australians. When will you stand up and support these workers? 


On the other hand, we are steadfastly clear in our opposition to penalty rate cuts. We want to see this parliament legislate on this question. Those opposite have done nothing to stand up to this issue. Penalty rates are not a luxury for workers in our country. Millions of Australians and their families rely on them every day. However, we have a Prime Minister that is too busy looking after the big end of town, looking after his friends in the top tax brackets, giving millionaires more than $16,000 a year in tax cuts and handing out tax cuts to big business while taking away from hardworking, low-paid Australians. It is absolutely deplorable that this government fails to stand up to protect Australian workers, and Minister Cash's answer shows this. (Time expired)

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2018-03-21,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:19):  I too rise to take note of the answers given. I want to start off by reflecting on the fact that penalty rates are based on a wage, the wage that is set and the percentages on top of that, but the starting point, surely, therefore is that you have to have a job in order to have a wage. One of the things that is really important for this chamber to remember, as we debate, this week, legislation looking at the implementation of some of the government's policies, is that the government's policies, in terms of engaging and encouraging business to create jobs and to invest in their workplaces, have been working.


At the start of this year, we were able to reflect on 2017 and see that the government's policies had set the environment where jobs growth across the nation was over 403,000, the majority—around three-quarters—of which were full-time jobs. In December alone, some 34,700 jobs were created. Contrast that with those opposite in their last year of government. They created only 89,000 jobs. Well, they didn't create them, but their policies put a lid on business's willingness to invest in their workforce and their workplaces such that only 89,000 jobs were created, and the majority of those were part time. Under this government's policy settings, the confidence of business has been such that they are employing, and the participation rate is now the highest it's been in seven years. In fact, since September 2013, over 950,000 jobs have been created. I think back to the promise made by then-Prime Minister Abbott of the target of the coalition in terms of jobs, and we're getting pretty close to the target he set in terms of the number of jobs created.


The starting point, when we talk about people working and receiving a wage or penalty rates, is that they need jobs. As people in this chamber consider whether or not they will support government policies, they should keep in mind what we have achieved since 2013, what we achieved just last year and what we achieved in the last month of last year and compare that to the policies and approaches of those opposite and the outcomes for Australia. What is important, if we're going to create jobs, is that businesses are competitive, and they need to be competitive for two things: they need to be competitive for capital—for the ability to attract funds to invest in the business, to recapitalise, to grow, to create opportunity and to pay more to attract workers to their business—and they need to be competitive for customers. If businesses price themselves out of the market, customers will go elsewhere, and we see that in Australia. We see that in the restaurant trade, for example, when businesses can't open on the weekend necessarily because they are not making money, when business owners can't employ staff and run the businesses themselves and when customers say, 'The prices are too high; we don't like the surcharges you're having to put on to cover penalty rates,' and choose to go elsewhere. So businesses need to be competitive, and that brings us back to things like the taxation policy that we are debating at the moment, which is going to be good for Australians because it creates the investment and it creates the opportunities for businesses to grow more jobs, to give people that starting point and to pay them more. 


When it comes to the penalty rates discussion, it's important to understand that the Fair Work Commission is there to provide independent arbitration around getting the balance right between the needs of workers and the needs of businesses in the economy at the time. People listening to this debate, when they hear the Labor Party going on about this, should remember that it was the Labor Party who set up the Fair Work Commission. It's the Labor Party who didn't object to rulings of the Fair Work Commission at times in the past but are objecting now because it's politically opportune for them to do so. If they were consistent—and we had members opposite in this debate today talk about the fast food industry—they would look at some of the outcomes that have been delivered for workers in the fast food industry as a result of agreements that were negotiated by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten. This government is the government that is creating opportunity, jobs and, eventually, higher wages for people. (Time expired)

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2018-03-21,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:24):  I too rise to take note of Minister Cash's answer to the question from Senator Cameron during question time. It was a pretty straightforward question, and it may surprise listeners that it's not unusual for a government to take a position in a case before the industrial relations commission. It's not unusual for a government to put a position in respect of a minimum wage outcome or a significant change. The question went to the heart of the matter: what is this government going to say to the Fair Work Commission? And the resounding answer was: nothing. This government is not going to step up and even have a view about this matter. If you'd listened to the three contributions to this debate from the other side—or was it two contributions?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  They were so good, it seemed like there were three!




Senator GALLACHER:
  Only two—you nearly got me; there were only two. I thought they were good enough for three, they were that misleading. The independence of the Fair Work Commission was raised in both contributions. Let's have a look at the independence of it. The last three appointees have been described by employers as 'bringing it back to balance'. There have been quite a number of appointees to the Fair Work Commission since 2016-17, and really all of those appointees have moved it away from the old-fashioned principle of balance—one representative from the employer side and one from the union side. Increasingly now, we see the appointments all being swung towards the employer side of representation, with people from the Farmers' Federation, ACCI and the like. There's a place for those people in that august organisation, but there should be some balance. Workers should be able to go to the Fair Work Commission, present their case and expect to be heard in a fair and just manner.


Senator Fawcett made the comment, 'We've created lots of jobs.' What unions do—and it may surprise him—is create better jobs out of those fundamental jobs. They create better jobs. They set a span of hours within which you can work your eight hours, and, if you've worked eight hours and you do another two, you get time and a half. Then, if you do any more time after 10 hours, you get double time. Surprise, surprise—after 10 hours work you get a little kick along to encourage you to keep putting your shoulder to the wheel in that job. By necessity, a lot of the jobs in the economy are not all that invigorating. They're hard-work jobs and there needs to be a penalty rate to get people to work beyond the ordinary hours. Heaven forbid, if people have to work on a Saturday or Saturday night, that they might get time and a half! They might even get into double time if they're lucky. On one day of the week, Sunday, they get double time.


I do know people who own and operate restaurants. One said to me, 'Alex, it's too expensive to bring in the kitchen hand on a Sunday.' I said, 'So what do you do?' He said, 'We don't open.' I said, 'Well, you've made a business decision. That's your business decision, but I can go into Darling Harbour on a Sunday night and there will be 10,000 people waiting to get a feed. So you made that decision in one part of the country; in other parts of the country they don't necessarily make that decision.'


Penalty rates are not the root of all evil. Penalty rates are the way that decent, hardworking Australian workers—whether they are members of a union or not—students, backpackers and the like go about sustaining themselves. They don't go around banking bloody $300 or $400 a week. The penalty rates are what pay the electricity, the rent and the going out, if they're fortunate enough to be able to do that. They sustain their necessities of life. If penalty rates are not there, it means that people will get less take-home pay. There will be less to share in families who are not doing very well. Cutting penalty rates is a ferocious attack on the lowest earners in the community, the people who are not at the top. As Keating always said, we've always got to be on the side of the angels—on the side of those who need a leg-up—not on the side of people in positions of privilege, where most of those on the other side come from, including Senator McGrath, who is grinning away. My bet is he's never worked a day in his life. He never, ever had to work for penalty rates or meal money, or worked past nine o'clock on a Saturday night or got up at five o'clock in the morning to earn some penalties.



Senator McGrath interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator GALLACHER:
  But he'll be over there campaigning as hard as he can for power, position and privilege. On this side, we're on the side of those who need a leg-up—not a handout but a leg-up.



Senator McGrath interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator GALLACHER:
  Penalty rates are one of those areas where workers should enjoy the fruits of their labour. It's a fair process that was fought for for over 100 years, and you lot will not be able to get rid of it.

  We do not support this motion, because several of the matters referred to are currently before the Federal Court and it would be inappropriate to seek to interfere in judicial processes.


Labor has long been a strong supporter of native title and Indigenous land rights and has worked for many decades to protect and strengthen these rights for Indigenous people around Australia. After the historic decision of the High Court in Mabo, it was Labor that introduced and legislated the Native Title Act in 1993, and we did that against strident and often hysterical opposition from the Liberal and National parties.


The Native Title Act aims to achieve a balance of certainty for existing landholders and to establish a process for the legal system for native title claimants to achieve recognition and ownership of their ancestral lands. It is our strong belief that this act and the development of further legislative amendments that affect the act need to be carried out in a consultative and respectful manner. Indigenous people need to provide their free, prior and informed consent to legislation that affects their interests, most especially on the issue of native title. (Time expired).

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (16:24):  We should remember the Port Arthur massacre—35 people killed, 23 people wounded. Right now the National Firearms Agreement, a very significant development that came out of that absolute tragedy, is under threat. There is some good news. The three pillars that that agreement was based on are still in place. Those three pillars are that anyone seeking to own a gun must be licensed, each weapon must be registered and gun ownership remains a conditional privilege rather than a right.


But what we see happening, side by side with that, is incredible pressure being put on state and territory governments to weaken the gun laws, and this is coming from the firearms lobby. Some of the changes are really insidious. Most states now allow children to use firearms—to actually fire guns.




Senator McKenzie:
  Yes.




Senator RHIANNON:
  I acknowledge the interjection. This is really shocking. We've seen the Nationals really out there, wanting to promote their commitment to the gun lobby—largely because their vote has been eroded by the firearms parties—and here they are, doing something really disgraceful: encouraging children to use arms on a regular basis.


It's also possible in this country for people to own more than 100 guns—in fact, hundreds and hundreds of guns. That, unfortunately, is one of the loopholes in the National Firearms Agreement that needs to be tidied up.


But there's a particularly sinister aspect of the weakening of the National Firearms Agreement that came out on the eve of the Tasmanian election. Just days before that election, which returned the Liberals to power, it became known that, if elected, that party would soften the state's gun laws. The Liberals' proposed legislation would breach the National Firearms Agreement in a very extensive way. The period for gun licences is to be extended from five years to 10 years. When the National Firearms Agreement was debated extensively in 1996, they settled on five years for a very good reason—so that it could be reviewed to see if the person who held that licence should continue to hold it. Ten years is too long.


Let's remember the agreement is actually thanks to former Prime Minister Howard and the National Party former Deputy Prime Minister—which is something that the Nationals senators who sit in this place should remember—who literally put their lives on the line to go out in country areas and advocate for this agreement. And here we see the Nationals and the Liberals falling over themselves to now weaken it. From what I understand, their ideal is to actually remove it.


The Liberal plan in Tasmania is also to permit farmers to have silencers on their semiautomatic rifles and shotguns, and to bring in a new category for prohibited firearms, category E—something that is very worrying. I've heard some people speculate that the firearm that Martin Bryant used for that absolutely horrendous massacre—some of the saddest stories that you could ever read—could again be available in Tasmania under this crazy plan that they've come forward with.


As for their tactic, this isn't something isolated to Tasmania. This is a tactic that the firearms lobby has in place: if they get the changes through in Tasmania, that becomes a springboard for other states.


We also know that there was a secret firearms consultation group—with no representation from the gun control lobby—with the Liberal government working very closely with those who advocate for firearms and often who make profits out of firearms. The reach of the gun lobby has come right into this parliament, with the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, considering establishing a committee to allow gun importers to review proposed changes to firearms regulations for 'appropriateness and intent'. There's no place, as I said, for gun control advocates in what they're bringing forward here. We also know that the firearms lobby are very generous donors to conservative parties—about half a million dollars has gone in—and that's something that my colleague Andrew Bartlett will expand on.


This Friday, 23 March, in Sydney, there will be a rally outside Martin Place under the slogan 'Never again', where students, teachers, families and survivors will stand in support of and join students across America in the March for Our Lives, demanding an end to gun violence. (Time expired)

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2018-03-21,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria—Minister for Rural Health, Minister for Sport, Minister for Regional Communications and Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (16:29):  I am a proud licensed firearm owner and also a senator. Senator Rhiannon, I agree that the tragedy of Port Arthur was exactly that and should never be allowed to happen again in this country. But to assume that licensed firearm owners are running around 20 years after the NFA was put in place, looking for schools, looking for opportunities to wreak crime and havoc on Australians, is an absolute joke. You stand up in this place and try to pretend that Australia is America and pretend that the NRA exists. The reality is that over a million Australians are law-abiding firearm owners who proudly protect their homes and property, hunt for food and are sporting shooters.


We've got the Commonwealth Games coming up. We are some of the best shooters in the world, and as a nation we're very proud when we see that. Senator Rhiannon, you only grow Olympian athletes, including sporting shooters, if you allow them to develop the skill over time. You don't get to 25, pick up a shotgun and become a gold medallist. You have to have a junior firearm licence, an incredibly appropriate thing to do.


Right now in Victoria it's duck season. It is a lovely cultural experience for many families. They go away for the weekend. They set up their tents. They go camping with friends and family. They get up early in the morning and they go shooting their ducks, and many of those get their bagful. And I thank the state Labor government in Victoria for the work they've done to ensure duck season continues to be the strong tradition it is for so many in my home state. But you can't go out and camp as a family if your kids aren't allowed to come and if you can't train them in how to be safe and appropriate with firearms.


Our firearm laws are amongst the strongest in the world, and I can tell you, because I hold one, that obtaining a firearm licence is a very long and expensive process involving character checks and criminal history checks. You have to do safety training. There are restrictions on how the firearm can be used. You've got to have a recognised need to purchase the firearm. Then you have to open up the door to the police to let them come into your home and make sure you're storing your firearm and your ammunition appropriately. There are waiting periods not just to get your licence but if you want to purchase a firearm. Indeed, law-abiding gun owners would never risk their licence by owning an illegal gun.


The tragedy of gun violence on the streets of Melbourne and Sydney and throughout Australia is not as a result of law-abiding firearm owners, and I absolutely guarantee that any changes that the state government in Tasmania are planning to make around how they register and regulate firearms in their state, as is their constitutional right, will not result in greater gun violence. I will tell you what will. What will result in greater gun violence is illicit and illegal firearms in the hands of criminals. And, Senator Rhiannon, that's why I suggest that, if you're really concerned about gun violence, instead of moving your meaningless MPI to make Batman voters feel a little better that you're standing up for them after the havoc that your particular factor wreaked in that by-election—I don't think it worked out too well for the Greens!—and instead of attacking the million law-abiding firearm owners in this country, you actually support the government legislation around cracking down on illicit firearms and on the trafficking of firearms. That's something tangible that you can actually do.


Indeed, Labor Party senators, if you care about reducing gun violence, don't start attacking mums and dads who take their kids out to go hunting on the weekend, don't start attacking our Olympians and our Commonwealth Games athletes. Start supporting the government's legislation around illicit gun trafficking, because getting illegal guns in the hands of criminals is where the problem is. I can tell you that it's not the gun that actually kills people; it's the person behind it. I know there are some opposite who may not think that is a fact, but the Australian Institute of Criminology, in its National Homicide Monitoring Program annual report, indicated that 1.3 per 100,000 Australians remains the lowest-ever rate since records began in 1989-90. Knives and sharp objects remain the most common weapons used in homicides.


Contrary to the rhetoric and claims of the Greens, who are trying to make this an NRA style conversation here, we have strong firearm laws. They are appropriate. They are stringent. We don't want to see gun crime. We do not want to see people being hurt by guns. That is why we have to support legislative measures that will actually crack down on gun trafficking. So get on board with measures that will make a tangible difference to this issue rather than continuing with your critique of law-abiding firearm owners, who are absolute champions. I am looking forward to handing out the shooting medals at the Commonwealth Games in a couple of weeks. (Time expired)

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (16:35):  What a pathetic attempt to try to justify what Minister Keenan tried to do last year. This is why Peter Dutton needs to be pulled into line by the Prime Minister. For those in the chamber and those up in the gallery, I am a Tasmanian who remembers very vividly what happened at Port Arthur in 1996. You only had to walk the streets of any town or city in Tasmania and see written on the faces of those Tasmanians the tragedy, the hurt and the horrific scars that had been left on our communities to know that any change to, any softening of, the gun laws in this country will not be tolerated by the Australian people.


I wasn't a great fan of Mr Howard's, but I will say this about John Howard at that time: he, with the Tasmanian state leaders at that time, helped bring about the world's best gun laws. Internationally, we are admired. We talk about what's been happening in America. You have students and parents marching to change things. I'm speaking as someone who was a licensed gun owner. I was. I was brought up in the country, so I knew how to shoot and to respect guns from a reasonably young age. But I turned my guns in and my husband relinquished his firearms as well because we believed that that was the right thing to do.


Now what we are seeing from these Liberals, both at a federal level and at a state level in my home state of Tasmania, are proposed changes to the gun laws. When did we find out about these changes by the Liberal state government? We heard nothing during the recent state election, but there was a leak to the media about secret meetings and the sneaky, underhand way that the Premier of that state had engaged with the gun lobby to make these changes. I have been inundated by people in Tasmania telling me they voted for the Hodgman government because they didn't know their proposal about changing the gun laws. That was sneaky, it was underhanded and it proves the Liberals cannot be trusted when it comes to gun laws in this country.


We know that there are people who use guns for sport. We know that. But they have to respect the gun laws that we currently have in this country. There is no way that as a Tasmanian I'm going to sit in this chamber and listen to the nonsense that the Minister for Sport has put before this chamber to try to justify the changes that Dutton and Keenan have proposed. It is about time that the Prime Minister grew a backbone and put an end to this debate. We saw how weak he is when he defended Minister Cash with her outlandish attack on women in the Leader of the Opposition's office during the estimates process. So he needs some credibility and this is a good place to start. 


It's not just people like me who have concerns. I want to also remind people that a Port Arthur survivor, Peter Crosswell, has said about the proposed changes in Tasmania that our gun laws were 'the only good thing' to come out of the Port Arthur tragedy and disaster. The Alannah and Madeline Foundation, which was set up by Walter Mikac, whose wife and two daughters were killed in the massacre, has said that Mr Hodgman's proposed changes are 'a total betrayal of those lost'. That's a man who is still grieving for his wife and his two beautiful young daughters.


There isn't a Tasmanian who would've supported any change proposed by the Hodgman government if they had been aware of it. It was deceitful, it was dishonest and it proves yet again that the Liberals cannot be trusted. There were those who were negotiating behind closed doors, hoping like hell that no-one would find out before election day. We found out on the Friday. The next day was polling day. It was disgusting. I would have expected so much more from the Premier of the day—to be open and honest with Tasmanians. 



I support this motion, because I'm speaking from experience, as a Tasmanian, of the impact of guns. We know that domestic violence, no matter what Senator McKenzie says, is still a big issue, and guns are part of that. (Time expired)

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (16:40):  I thank Senator Rhiannon from the bottom of my heart for bringing this motion on. I rise to strongly support this motion. In doing so I strongly support the National Firearms Agreement, which, as senators would know, came about due to the tragedy in 1996 at Port Arthur in Tasmania where 35 innocent people were massacred. In doing so, I want to very strongly suggest to this Senate that the Tasmanian Liberals were caught out in the 48 hours before the most recent state election by secretly providing a policy to the gun lobby that proposed to effectively destroy the National Firearms Agreement—in Tasmania, of all places. 


We had Will Hodgman, the Premier of our state, who likes to portray himself as a moderate, a nice guy and a reasonable person, secretly providing a policy to the gun lobby in Tasmania—not to the broader Tasmanian people and the voters of Tasmania, but to a very narrowly targeted section of our community who want gun laws relaxed, who want to make it easier to obtain licences and who want to make it more difficult to control dangerous guns and weapons in our community. A policy that would destroy the National Firearms Agreement was provided secretly to them.


We heard from Walter Mikac, who even today is still mourning the death of his wife and his two beautiful daughters at Port Arthur in 1996, who said:


We would be totally betrayed to think that within a 20-year period they are looking at going back.



Indeed, the Tasmanian Liberals are looking at going back. They're looking at destroying the National Firearms Agreement, breaking the national consensus. What makes it even worse is they did it in a secretive way, they did it in a duplicitous way, they did it in a cowardly way and they did it in a way that shows how grossly out of touch Will Hodgman and the Tasmanian Liberals are with community sentiment on this issue in our state of Tasmania. They were caught out. The question for Will Hodgman now is: are you going to come forward and seek to legislate in the Tasmanian parliament to destroy the National Firearms Agreement? I tell you what my message to Will Hodgman is: don't you dare try this, because you will be the subject of a revolt from the Tasmanian people bigger than you've ever experienced before— (Time expired)

Senator MOLAN
 (New South Wales) (16:43):  I'm speaking today to Senator Rhiannon's proposition that the following matter of public importance be submitted to the Senate for discussion: 


The need to strengthen our firearms laws to reduce gun violence.


It occurs to me that we have strengthened our firearm laws and we have reduced gun violence. The basic aspect of this that occurs to me is that the Greens have brought this motion on, but they haven't supported the Criminal Code Amendment (Firearms Trafficking) Bill. The Greens are saying, 'Strengthen firearms laws to reduce gun violence.' But if they were sincere about doing this then they would support our bill, which is about firearms trafficking and strengthening and refining firearms laws. The Greens are asking for something which occurred years ago and which will remain, certainly at the federal level. We must fight the scourge of illegal firearms trafficking; that's for sure. But it's not an issue of the need to strengthen our firearms laws to reduce gun violence.


Like Senator McKenzie, I know guns. I've lived with guns all my life. Guns were part of my trade, as is the case for the police force, hunters, farmers and many people. I've seen the best and the worst of guns, and I've seen them in places where they impact on society to an appalling degree. However, guns do have value in the right hands, and they have value for the right reasons. As to those who are legally entitled to carry guns and who are trained to use guns, there is no point at all in making the actions of those people, or implying that they are, in any sense illegal. We have a first-class record in this country, as every speaker so far has agreed—the Howard government's reforms in 1996 and the National Firearms Agreement. I don't support any more relaxing of firearms laws. I would not have a gun in my house, not because I hate guns, but because I have no use for guns—I'm not a sporting shooter—nor would I now use guns or need guns in what I do for a living.


We have our own example in Australia of crimes that are committed with guns. We have had massacres in this country. We have criminal use of guns. In the US, of course, we see examples on a daily basis of activities in schools related to gun crime and massacres at concerts, in bars and other places. But this is not in any way, shape or form the United States. Senator McKenzie gave us the statistics for the use of guns in murders—1.3 per 100,000 Australians, with knives and sharp implements being the main method of creating havoc and causing injury. The ability of a gun to cause death and injury is quite marked. That's why, having seen activities where this has occurred, we have strengthened our gun laws, and it's why we maintain their strength. Of course other implements that we would use in the house—knives, axes or metal bars—are available, but the difference between them and guns is quite dramatic. There is a great deal of logic in having strong firearms laws, and we already have them. A desire to have even more is very interesting. I keep on asking myself where the justification is, outside pure virtue signalling.


The Greens proposal is to strengthen firearms laws but not to remove guns. The question that I have is: is this is a generality? Are we saying we're going to remove all firearms? Are we going to say we're still going to accept certain firearms? We've all seen the basis of the National Firearms Agreement: a licence for each weapon, registered for each purpose, and owning guns is a privilege. To remove them from the hands of those who have a legitimate reason to use them and who use them as a legitimate tool is just plain silly. And any move to remove even more guns from our society is going to cost us. I ask: how much are we prepared to pay? We have reduced the risk of the use of gun violence, except for the trafficking of guns by criminals, to a reasonable level, to a world-standard level. If there is a solid business case for doing it, I certainly can't see it. This is merely virtue signalling. We need to know if there is a business case. We need to know what the risk is all about, and we need to know what we're getting for the money that we may have to pay. Are we wasting our time debating something which is now already decided? We have strong gun laws.


If the Greens want to be taken seriously, I would encourage them to produce a business case, to refine what they're talking about. There could be a case that, if you irrationally tighten up laws on guns and you force those guns underground, you in fact make the situation a lot worse. 


Of course, we need to do this with the states and territories, and we all remember how difficult a process that is. We already have a National Firearms Agreement, and that is working. What the firearms trafficking bill is trying to do is to address the illegal trafficking of firearms by tough, mandatory penalties, not tighten the conditions under which the legal use of guns operate. We all agree that penalties are a deterrent. Labor has agreed in the past that penalties are a deterrent, and that's certainly part of the bill. Mandatory sentences have a role in deterring crime, and society has a right to express its judgement on the seriousness of what they consider to be a crime. 


The Greens have now brought this motion into the House. They've asked for it to be discussed. It would be very good if they were prepared to support the Criminal Code Amendment (Firearms Trafficking) Bill. I finish by saying that if the Greens are serious about strengthening firearms laws in order to reduce gun violence then they will support the firearms trafficking bill. I make the point that the coalition can be trusted in relation to gun laws.

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (16:51):  Last Wednesday, tens of thousands of students walked out of schools across the United States. They did it in silence for 17 minutes—one minute for every victim of the Florida high school mass murder that had occurred exactly one month before. These children and families are joining the March For Our Lives movement. They will rally and take to the streets this Saturday in Washington DC to demand that their lives and safety become a priority and to demand that the United States ends the epidemic of mass shootings. Another school walkout is planned for 20 April, the 19th anniversary of Eric Harris's and Dylan Klebold's mass murder of their fellow students at Columbine High School in Colorado. Unfortunately, these students are walking out because they 'want to go to school without feeling afraid'. 


There are countless other anniversaries of horrific mass shooting murders of schoolchildren in the United States. These students could observe those, like that of Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012, when 20 children in first grade and six teachers were shot dead. Australian children have not suffered the terror of a school shooting, and are, hopefully, unlikely to ever do so, thanks to then Prime Minister John Howard's '97 gun reforms. 


The 10 largest American gun manufacturers produce and sell more than eight million guns a year to US citizens. This is two-thirds of the US gun market, which is worth around $8 billion a year. The United States has a gun ownership rate seven times higher than Australia and a gun death rate that is 11 times higher. By virtue of the ease with which guns are accessible and the regularity with which they are used to kill US citizens, more than 1.5 million Americans have died in gun related incidents since 1968. According to Gun Violence Archive, 37,577 Americans were killed by a gun just last year. 732 were children and 3,234 were teenagers killed or injured with a gun. There were 346 mass shootings. The key statistics are increasing each year. This year alone, there have been 48 mass shootings in the United States, and we are only in March. 3,067 people who celebrated New Year's Eve in the United States have been shot dead by someone, and 140 children and 562 teenagers have been killed or injured this year. These statistics show very clearly that in the US gun violence has become part of their reality and that it occurs all too often. There has been one school shooting a week in the United States since 2013. Since that horrifying massacre in Florida, there have been four more school shootings. Just yesterday, there was another high school shooting in the United States, in the state of Maryland.


During our Prime Minister's recent visit to the United States, at a joint press conference with President Trump, very shortly after the Florida massacre, Prime Minister Turnbull made a calculated decision to reject the example of Australia's laws and what they could set and provide. Australia's laws weren't an appropriate model for potential US gun control, the Prime Minister said, because the US has:


… a completely different context historically, legally and so forth. They are very different countries with very different sets of problems.


Well, on the contrary; I believe Australia has a valuable legacy to share. We suffered an average of one mass shooting per year in the decade to 1996. Then we faced the Port Arthur massacre, where one Sunday afternoon in my home state of Tasmania 35 people were killed by one man. In one of the most courageous Australian political acts in recent memory, the newly-elected Liberal Prime Minister, John Howard, with the support of Nationals leader Tim Fisher launched a buyback and tightened laws around access to firearms, particularly rifles and shotguns. Following those Port Arthur gun reforms, there have been no mass shootings in this country, no mass shootings in Australia.


Our legacy is strong not only domestically but internationally as well. Australia is one of seven co-authors of the 2006 UN General Assembly resolution calling for an arms trade treaty to 'better regulate the conventional arms trade and to reduce the impact of armed violence on communities around the world'. The treaty entered into force on 24 December 2014. Australia has a record of action, achievement and safety that we should be offering to share internationally, but instead what are we doing? We're chipping away at it slyly by the actions of conservative governments run by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Premier Will Hodgman in Tasmania.


Our shadow Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus, pointed out last week that Home Affairs Minister Dutton—Australia's would-be chief policeman and high interrogator—insidiously wants to put gun lobbyists on an advisory committee to review government firearms policy without any balance from gun control advocates. The shadow Attorney-General rightly pointed out that Peter Dutton, talking about putting gun lobby people on his advisory committee or Michael Keenan talking about removing red tape in gun regulation, is all 'just code for weakening the gun laws, allowing more powerful guns to be imported'. Australia needs to reverse this weakening of gun laws. We actually need more gun control, not a weakening of John Howard's legacy. 


But, on top of that, we've had Premier Will Hodgman's government sneakily unveiling a policy to water down our gun laws in Tasmania that was only revealed in the media the day before the Tasmanian election, after the Liberal Party released its policy privately to a consultation group. It was not published on the Liberal Party website prior to the recent election; it was hidden. They were so ashamed of it that, even though they were doing it, they hid it. It is horrific and frightening and will breach the National Firearms Agreement.


According to Tim Fisher, who as Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the National Party was instrumental in helping John Howard make the case for Australia's strict gun control laws, this sort of NRA-type push by Dutton and Hodgman must be resisted—and, indeed, it must be. Last weekend, Mr Fisher said he was deeply concerned about the rise of NRA inspired lobbying and right-wing parties who are influencing pushback against our laws. He said:


… the core structure and content of the Howard gun reforms must not be done away with. Creep and corrosion of the core of the gun law reforms is a danger.


Indeed it is a danger. The only positive thing that survivor Peter Crosswell believes came out of the Port Arthur massacre was the change to Australia's gun laws. Paramedic Peter James can't believe that a responsible person would want to weaken our gun laws, especially in Tasmania. First responder Dr Brian Walpole feels betrayed and asked:


How can you trust a government that does this, sort of sneakily, just before an election?


Walter Mikac, whose entire family was murdered at Port Arthur, feels Will Hodgman's proposed changes to the gun laws are a total betrayal of those lost. He said:


It's about people having the most basic human right of being able to go about their day to day life without the risk that they are going to get killed.


Thanks to our gun laws, Australian citizens currently enjoy that right, unlike those poor American schoolchildren. Ours is a legacy we should be sharing and strengthening, and never, never undermining.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (17:35):  According to popular legend, Hitler's master of propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, said: 'A lie told once is still a lie. But a lie told a thousand times becomes the truth.' The claim that there have been no mass shootings since the introduction of John Howard's 1996 gun laws has probably been repeated many more than a thousand times, which is perhaps why so many people believe it is the truth. But it was a lie when it was first told, and it's still a lie now. In the 20 years following 1996, there were 14 shootings in Australia involving multiple victims. Of these, 12 involved two or three fatalities, one involved four fatalities and one involved five fatalities. The death toll would have been higher but for some luck and life-saving medical attention. In the 20 years before 1996, there were also 12 shootings involving multiple victims, although there were more deaths in total.


According to America's FBI, a mass shooting is defined as 'four or more people shot and/or killed in a single event at the same general time and location, not including the shooter'. In 2014, there was a mass shooting in New South Wales involving the Hunt family in which there were four victims plus the shooter. This qualifies as a mass shooting under the FBI definition, and yet a couple of academics, Philip Alpers and Simon Chapman, who are in fact foundation members of the anti-gun lobby, recently wrote a paper in which they repeated the lie that there had been no mass shootings in Australia since 1996. Under their definition, a mass shooting requires at least six victims, including the shooter. They gained some publicity for themselves as a result of making this claim, but the simple fact is that they arbitrarily changed the definition of a mass shooting to suit their agenda.


Very few Australians will recognise the fabrication involved in this claim. Most of those claiming there have been no mass shootings since 1996 have never thought much about it. For them, it sounds sufficient to claim that massacres occurred before, but not after, the gun laws. They then draw the simple conclusion that the gun laws made the difference. It might be simplistic, but it sounds compelling. But it is false. There were just as many multiple-victim shootings in the 20 years after the introduction of the 1996 gun laws as there were in the 20 years before they were introduced.


But, really, is that all that matters? Is there something special about being murdered in a mass shooting, unlike being shot in some other way or even killed in some other way? Obviously not. A far better analysis of the impact of the 1996 gun laws would be to look at the overall level of murders attributable to firearms. When you look at that, what you find is that firearm deaths were declining in the 20 years before 1996 and they continued to fall after 1996 at precisely the same rate. Multiple statistical tests have confirmed that it is precisely the same rate. Furthermore, this occurred despite a substantial increase in licensed firearm ownership—many more guns, in other words. The simple fact is the gun laws in 1996 made no difference to the rate of decline—no difference at all.


This 'no massacres, no mass shootings' claim is also often accompanied by a comparison with the United States. There's no denying the US does have mass shootings. Australia doesn't—or not many, anyway—therefore, it must be the gun laws that explain it. Or so the argument goes. It's simple minded claptrap. It's so dumb that it's amazing anyone falls for it, and yet you hear it all the time. Once again, the facts are ignored. Notwithstanding the high-profile mass shootings that do occur from time to time in the United States, the rate of gun deaths in that country during the last three decades has declined quite fast—faster, indeed, than in Australia, albeit from a higher starting point. At the same time, over the same period, gun laws in America have been substantially relaxed. In fact, in 42 states, a person without a criminal record or violent history can now carry a gun for self-defence. In the other eight states, a gun can be carried in case of special need.


Of course, nobody bothers to compare us with countries such as New Zealand that continue to have gun laws resembling those that were found in Australia before 1996 but that, like us, continue to see falling gun deaths; or Switzerland, which has a far higher ratio of guns to people than Australia and yet its rate of gun violence is no greater than Australia's. Yet the assumption is made that, if we relaxed our gun laws to be more like those in New Zealand or Switzerland, we'd end up like America, not like New Zealand or Switzerland. It's an absurd assumption.


I'm all for debate about gun laws, but let's stick to incontrovertible facts, not those that become facts because they have been repeated many times.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (17:41):  I rise to speak in support of the continuing strength of Australia's gun laws. Indeed I would like to see gun laws strengthened—I say that up-front. I can't ever remember a time when I wasn't opposed to guns, even as a small child. Certainly as a parent I went to great lengths to try and educate my children about the dangers of guns. I appreciate that in some parts of Australian society we do have guns. Guns are needed on farms, our police force carry guns and so on. Our armed forces carry guns. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about the everyday carrying or use of guns by ordinary citizens. I simply don't see the point and I don't support the use of guns. We see the shocking deaths in the US, where thousands of schoolchildren have taken to the streets to say that they want to make their schools safe. What a sad indictment it is of a country when some children feel that it's no longer safe to go to schools. Our schools should be sanctuaries, and yet for some children they are not.


I don't really think it matters if gun violence and deaths from shootings are declining. What matters is that they're happening in the first place. Any death through a shooting is a shocking thing and we should all, as a society, be opposed to that. I certainly don't support young children being able to get gun licences, as is the case in some states across this country. I'm proud to say that in Western Australia you have to be 18 years of age to get a gun licence. In Western Australia, if you've got a history of domestic violence, you also can't get a gun licence. If you've got an issue around mental health, you are, again, unable to get a gun licence. But, really, our gun laws should be uniform across this country. What applies in one state should be the case in another state because we don't want to see people being able to take advantage in one state where they can't in another.


I've never been a fan of John Howard's—never ever—but his bravery in standing up after Port Arthur needs to be commended. I remember seeing him on the news being absolutely heckled by people who thought they had some right to carry arms and by the National Rifle Association, which is way, way too influential in our politics these days, particularly in state politics. He did a great job, but what we've seen since then is the watering down of gun laws. It's starting to become easier, and we don't want that. We don't have that history of the right to bear arms and the gun violence that we see in the US, and we certainly don't want to see that in Australia as a rule.


I commend my friend and colleague, Michelle Roberts, who is concerned that in Western Australia we have seen a spike in drive-by shootings and woundings. She has taken action on that, and she's looking at some of the recommendations by the WA Law Reform Commission to introduce what are known as firearms prohibition orders, which already exist in other states. Again, gun violence should be something where we simply have national standards so that, for every state and territory in this nation, there's a uniform provision around gun laws. I have to say that I was quite shocked to learn that there are differences, and I was really shocked to hear that, in some states, children of 10 years of age can be given a gun licence, presumably to shoot on a range somewhere. That's just inappropriate. Why we would want to introduce our children to guns at such an early age defies logic, as far as I'm concerned. And I want to make sure that Australia remains a safe country and that we don't have guns being freely available. I do admit that they are somewhat freely available at the moment, but the more we can clamp down on that, the stronger our laws can be on stopping guns, and the more we as a culture embrace the fact that we don't want to see guns in this country, the better off we'll be.

"Griff, Sen Stirling",CA,2018-03-21,"



Senator GRIFF
 (South Australia) (17:47):  The Nick Xenophon Team agrees with the need to strengthen our firearms laws to reduce gun violence. Indeed, we could have had stronger gun laws last year when the government's Criminal Code Amendment (Firearms Trafficking) Bill 2017 was amended and adopted by the Senate in February 2017. It’s now over 13 months since the nation could have had tougher, stronger and better gun laws, but, due to government stubbornness, the bill as agreed to by the Senate was rejected in the other place. As a result, we do not have those laws in place today.


The Nick Xenophon Team sought to strengthen the bill by moving sensible amendments that would have increased the maximum penalties for firearm-trafficking offences within Australia and into and out of Australia. As I said before, these amendments were supported by the Senate. We also supported Labor's amendments which sought to strengthen the bill with life sentences for the worst kinds of firearm traffickers and which also sought to remove the mandatory sentencing provisions in the bill. Mandatory minimum sentences are inappropriate and do not currently exist in the Commonwealth Criminal Code. They restrict judicial discretion and hamper the sentencing judge's ability to hand down a sentence that is appropriate after taking into account all of the circumstances of an individual case. Mandatory minimum sentences depart from the fundamental principle that the punishment should fit the crime. Law enforcement agencies don't like mandatory minimum sentences because they mean offenders are less likely to cooperate with the police to bring down other serious criminals.


Illegal firearms remain a major issue in Australia. During last year's national firearms amnesty, 57,324 firearms were handed in. Authorities received around 2,500 fully automatic or semiautomatic guns that were previously unaccounted for, and 2,900 handguns. That is a lot of firepower that had the potential to cause very serious harm.


All of us in this place must work to keep our communities safe. We must support tougher sentences for gun traffickers. The government should have passed the bill as it was agreed to in the Senate. It is now time to stop playing political games with peoples' lives and for the government to take the right action to protect all Australians.

Senator ANNING
 (Queensland) (17:50):  This MPI is another example of an attack on our individual freedoms, thinly veiled as a progressive solution to gun related violence. The real solution to gun related crime is to target criminals who use illegal weapons to commit acts of violence with effective jail terms, not law-abiding licensed gun owners. Australians already have some of the strictest gun laws in the world, yet our rate of gun crime is still similar to that of New Zealand. We have legislation that allows firearms to be banned just for their appearance—not for their effective range, rate of fire or capacity but for how they look. They can be banned just because they look scary. This is verging on the irrational.


Our firearms laws, according to Senator Rhiannon, are the envy of the world, yet she is still advocating stricter controls. For example, banning the Adler shotgun—a firearm that many rural Queenslanders have had to use—is making a tough life on their cattle places that little bit tougher. Firearms aren't the issue; people are. If you are a radical or a lunatic who wants to kill innocent people, you will find a way. As we have seen with Bourke Street, with the radical in France who took to the pavement in a truck or with the London Bridge attack, those who are hell-bent on causing terror and harming innocents will. However, by the same token, if you drive your van on to the sidewalk and kill people, are we going to ban vans? What about if you go on a stabbing spree—are we going to ban knives? Increasing the already chokingly restrictive gun controls isn't going to change the outcomes for our nation. We need a clearer focus on those who commit crimes, not more firearm controls.


There are approximately 34,000 gun related deaths each year in America, 94 per cent of which are committed by criminals with illegal weapons. A change in the gun laws will not get the desired outcome. They are already outside the regular framework. The bottom line is that, overwhelmingly, gun related violent crime is done by criminals using unlicensed firearms. Changing the legislation has no more effect on the gun crime rate than watering your geraniums. Look at Chicago, Detroit or New Orleans: they have some of the strictest gun laws in the US—and the highest murder rates. There is a common misconception that an increase in registered firearms means you are going to see more gun violence perpetrated across the community. Once again, law-abiding gun owners are being targeted and victimised simply for owning firearms. To reiterate, a real solution to gun— (Time expired)

Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (17:53):  I speak in support of this Matter of Public Importance. It is now over 20 years since the horrendous massacre in Port Arthur in Tasmania, and it is very important that we remain as vigilant as ever not to allow our gun laws to be weakened. Indeed, in some cases, I believe they need to still be further strengthened. It's particularly concerning to me—and the Greens more broadly, as my colleague Senator Rhiannon mentioned in her comments—the increasing amount of money that the gun lobby is pouring into Australian politics and towards Australian political parties.


In my own state of Queensland, it's very clear that the cashed-up gun lobby tried to buy the results it wanted in the Queensland election. The Queensland Shooters Union is affiliated with the notorious NRA in the US and threw thousands into the campaigns of One Nation candidates. The Katter party received over $175,000 from one particular gun dealer, and the Electoral Commission's disclosure system showed that in total the Katter party received nearly half a million dollars from firearms interest groups. The Shooting Industry Foundation of Australia spent over half a million dollars itself on TV, radio and online advertising trying to get a weakening of the gun laws in Queensland.


Just like the NRA, the Queensland Shooters Union and the Shooting Industry Foundation of Australia are not merely gun enthusiasts concerned about their rights. I support sporting shooters and their right to conduct legitimate activities. I support farmers and their right to use firearms appropriately in the course of their business. But what these lobby groups are about is trying to expand the firearms industry. In the US, the NRA buys politicians to protect the profits of the arms industry. That is something that cannot be disputed. Unless we move urgently to reform our own political donation system, we could see the same here. The lives of our friends, families, children and loved ones could, potentially, be sacrificed for profit.


So we need to ensure that we ban political donations from the gun lobby. The Greens' view is that we should ban political donations from all for-profit corporations but particularly those from industries that seek to promote profits in areas that are harmful. The Queensland government has made a small advance in moving to ban donations from property developers, which have been shown quite directly to corrupt our political system. Surely, in areas such as this, the gun lobby in particular is an industry we need to be banning donations from. (Time expired)

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (17:56):  The demonising of law-abiding gun owners is unhelpful to the debate about violence in this country. The bashing of gun owners must stop. Many law-abiding Australians responsibly use firearms to work and hunt and for sport, and this needs to be taken into consideration. A gun to a farmer is what a wrench is to a plumber—a tool that, if removed, makes the business unworkable. A farmer's central job is to protect the environment, to make the land profitable and productive. There is no greater threat to our precious environment than feral pests such as wild pigs, foxes, cats, dogs and rabbits.


If the Greens want to contribute to this debate in a productive way, they could analyse and honestly discuss the existing laws. Existing laws state that only licensed gun dealers can trade or sell guns. Adverts for guns are very closely monitored. The police work with gun traders and are tough on illegal gun sales, as they should be. If the Greens were serious about stopping gun violence, they would look at resourcing police. The trouble with guns comes when they get into the hands of criminals. The logical extension to solving gun violence is resourcing the police so they can find illegal arms dealers and bring them to justice.


Australians have been lawfully and reasonably carrying weapons for a variety of reasons for generations. New laws introduced over recent years have made owning a gun even tougher. Law-abiding citizens are not the problem with guns; criminals are. They are the ones who the Greens should focus on, not law-abiding gun owners.

That the Senate take note of the documents.


The committee received the responses from NBN Co last Wednesday, 24 March. The due date set by the committee, which I remind the Senate is chaired by the government, was Friday, 19 January—two months late again. This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't happening every single time. NBN Co, the department of communications and Minister Fifield seem to be in absolutely no rush to answer questions about the NBN rollout. These are questions, I might add, that are of vital importance to the proper functioning of this place: questions relating to the disastrous HFC rollout; questions on faults, complaints and customer satisfaction; questions on deployment and on minimal achievable speeds.


Prime Minister Turnbull thought he would switch on the HFC network like he would a toaster. Even after breaking his 2013 election promise, Mr Turnbull, the then communications minister, promised to have 2.6 million homes on HFC by the end of 2016. He only got up to 160,000—seven per cent of his target. HFC was meant to be the great saviour across many of our mainland cities. Instead, we then saw leaked reports that NBN Co would dump the Optus HFC network. We then heard of HFC cost blowouts. Of course, NBN denied these leaks. But then, in September 2016, the now Prime Minister announced that the Optus HFC would be dumped and that the cost of the remaining HFC network had blown out by $2 billion.


The lack of transparency in relation to the NBN project displayed by the non-answers provided by NBN Co to many of these questions and by the ridiculous delay in even responding is disappointing and reflects a paranoia that has gripped the Turnbull government. On 14 November 2017 the Senate voted to order a special hearing of the NBN committee. This vote in the Senate appears to have triggered panic within NBN Co, as they were sitting on further secrets about the HFC network that were not in the public domain. We have now learnt that only days later NBN Co executives ambushed public officials and Minister Fifield with news that NBN Co would halt the HFC rollout due to reliability problems. The HFC delay could cost taxpayers up to $500 million, money that could have been spent delivering a better technology mix, pushing more fibre closer to people's homes and businesses.


The constant delays in these responses to parliamentary scrutiny are nothing short of an attempt to reduce accountability. Minister Fifield, the Department of Communications and the Arts and NBN Co need to lift their game. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (18:48):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the statement.


This was a pathetic performance from this minister during question time. I'm not surprised that she was forced to come in here and make a clarification. This minister had not a clue about what she was trying to deal with here, and this is part of this government's attack on what is a reasonable proposition to make sure that people that are getting a dividend imputation have to pay tax. They should not get a tax refund if they have not paid any tax. This is a nonsense position from this government. If you go back to where this started, former Prime Minister John Howard, rolling in cash coming in from the mining boom, was trying to placate every group in the economy and across the country that had a gripe with the then Howard government by throwing money at them. That's exactly where this dividend imputation rort came in.



Government senators interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  It's all right for the National Party, bellowing away as they are. You understand that this was a John Howard rort that we are trying to fix and will fix in government because we are concerned to make sure that we've got enough funding for hospitals, health, education and infrastructure. These are the key issues for Labor and we're going to make sure that those that should be paying tax are paying tax.


This was Senator Fierravanti-Wells in attack mode, trying to attack what is a good policy position, and she couldn't even do that with her prepared answers. This is a government, as I've said before, that is in terminal decline and a government that doesn't understand what the key issues are for working people in this country. They just don't get it. Senator Fierravanti-Wells comes in here, completely out of her depth at question time, is incapable of giving a proper response and then has to suffer the humiliation of coming back in here and saying that she'd got it wrong. The government have got this wrong. The government have got their whole position on dividend imputation completely wrong. They keep saying that this is about pensioners. This is predominantly about self-funded superannuants who are getting tax refunds for tax that they never paid. That was never, ever the reason why dividend imputation was introduced, and former Prime Minister Paul Keating has been clear and unequivocal about that position. The Grattan Institute has clearly belled the cat when it comes to the coalition trying to misrepresent the position, and again we have Senator Fierravanti-Wells coming in here misrepresenting the position and trying to indicate that poor people are suffering because of the proper policy that Labor has introduced on dividend imputation. Senator Fierravanti-Wells is completely out of her depth and is just making statements that are wrong.


But it's not just Senator Fierravanti-Wells who has been making statements that are wrong—it's the government, trying to protect the rich, trying to protect the powerful and trying to protect their mates at the big end of town against ordinary working families that don't get this type of refund that the rich and powerful get because of decisions that John Howard made many years ago. This is simply another example of a government that will say anything and do anything to try and mislead the public. You're in so much trouble that you can't even get prepared answers correct when you come to question time. You've got a frontbench who don't understand the key issues for ordinary Australians in this country, don't understand the need for a good education, don't understand the need for a decent health system and don't understand that you can't keep throwing money at people who don't deserve it. You can't keep throwing money at people who don't need it. You should actually be putting money into the key issues that are important for building a decent society and a decent economy in this country—and they are education, health and dealing with inequality.


All you as a coalition want to do is continue inequality in this country—look after the rich and powerful at the expense of the poorest people in this country; look after your rich mates; look after those who are putting money into your pockets at election time. That's exactly what your lot do. And now we have Minister Fierravanti-Wells having to come in here, humiliated because she couldn't even get the basics right during question time.


She can't get the basics right because your Prime Minister can't get the basics right. Your Prime Minister is trying to mislead the public on this issue. The Prime Minister doesn't have a clue about what's important to working families in this country. Why would he have a clue, living in his mansion on the shores of Sydney Harbour? He's so divorced from the reality that families face day in, day out, trying to pay their rates, trying to pay power bills, trying to put food on the table.

(
Senator O'Sullivan

Senator Canavan:
  A point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President, on relevance. I believe the question before the chair is to take note of the ministerial statement that has been made. I respectfully point out that the senator is now departing into issues around someone in the other chamber. It is completely devoid—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Canavan, resume your seat. There's no point of order.




Senator CAMERON:
  I'll just take up where I left off. We have a Prime Minister who has not got a clue what it's like for ordinary working families in this country to battle to pay their rent, pay their mortgage, make sure they've got power coming to the house, make sure their kids can get school shoes to go to school. He would not have a clue, and if he had a clue then he would not be going down the track of continuing what was a rort by John Howard and by the weakest, worst Treasurer we've ever had in this country in Peter Costello—a Treasurer that was too weak to stand up to a Prime Minister that wanted to throw money out to the richest in the country just to make sure he got their vote at the election.


This is a government that is following in the footsteps of the Howard government by trying to maintain rorts to the rich and powerful in this country at the expense of working families. Any day, I'll look after the ordinary working-class people in this country against those that are sitting in their mansions on the shores of Sydney Harbour, picking up refunds for dividend imputation that they never paid any tax on. Where is the sense in that? Commentators around the country have got you guys well and truly picked on this. This is just an absolute rort that you are engaging in. There is absolutely no economic sense at all in what you are doing. You claim to be the party of economic responsibility, the grown-up party. Well, we've seen the grown-up party in action—an absolute rabble of a party, an absolute rabble of a government that is absolutely unconcerned about the key issues that affect ordinary working people. And that's why Senator Fierravanti-Wells had to come in here, humiliate herself and admit that she'd got it wrong and had misled us again.


This is a government that will mislead the public every chance it gets, because it doesn't care about the key issues that are required for workers to actually feed their families, get their kids to school and pay for their transport to get to work. The problems working families have got do not matter; all you lot want to do is keep the rorts that John Howard put in place for the rich and powerful. You are an absolute disgrace, and Senator Fierravanti-Wells should well look after her position in future. (Time expired)

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2018-03-21,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (18:59):  I also seek to take note of the ministerial statement. I do not seek to delay the work of the chamber, but there were a number of misrepresentations and simple mistruths aired by Senator Cameron that I believe require correction. The first point to make concerns the clear mistruth that is presented here by the Labor Party that somehow people should be made to pay tax twice. The refunds are provided to hardworking Australians who invest their money, often in Australian companies—in this case, they have to be Australian companies they invest in to get franking credits. They should not be made to pay tax twice. That should be a basic principle. We don't believe that people should be made to pay tax twice.


But, of course, the Labor Party think twice is not enough—they should be made to pay three times, four times, five times—because Labor constantly need more money to fund their ever-expanding schemes to waste your money. We're on the side of people who work and save and invest in this country. That's why we believe they should be able to keep some of their money in their pockets to provide for themselves in their retirement. The Labor Party see anybody's savings as a big nest egg for them to raid, and that is what they are trying to do.


The second point to make is: Senator Cameron is saying that this particular policy, which has now been in place for almost 20 years, is somehow a rort. If what Senator Cameron just said was half-true, even one-quarter true, why did the Labor Party, in their six years in government in the intervening 20-year period, do nothing to fix this rort? Mr Shorten was in fact the Assistant Treasurer for periods of time in that six years and apparently did nothing to fix this, according to Senator Cameron, obvious rort.



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator CANAVAN:
  That exactly shows the bankruptcy of the point you are making, Senator Cameron, because in your time in government you did nothing. What you have seen now in opposition is a need to fund your ever-expanding spending promises to the Australian people. At the last election, you didn't have enough money to fund them; you were $16 billion in the red for them. Now you need to raid people's piggy banks to fund the schemes you want to waste people's money on. We don't think that people's retirement savings are there for the Labor Party to come and raid when they run out of their own money. That is not what people should have to work and save and invest for. They should be able to provide for their own retirement themselves.


Finally—and I don't want to delay the chamber long here—we see now an opposition clearly not ready for government. We already see in the newspapers and the press that the policy, this major tax reform, according to the opposition, which it put out only a couple of weeks ago, is about to be changed. My colleague Senator Di Natale made the point earlier today in the chamber that the opposition is about to change its own policy. The policy has lasted just two weeks. It's clearly not an opposition ready for government, because it can't even get a simple policy announcement right. This is clearly a first draft for the Labor Party. It is a first draft of tax reform. It is not an opposition that is ready for government, and you can't trust an opposition that can't get the simple things right with the government's finances, with the Treasury benches. It obviously needs more time to get its act together, because it's about to change and dump a major tax reform that's only been in place for two weeks.


Instead, the Labor Party should join with others in this chamber to adopt real tax reform, which actually means trying to lower the tax burden on Australian businesses and families and lower corporate taxes, like we are trying to do here, to try and encourage more investment, more savings, better business conditions, more wealth, more prosperity and more job opportunities for all Australians.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AG,2018-03-21,"



Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (19:03):  I think it's an important debate that we're having here today, and it is important to ensure that the facts are fully out on the table. I welcome Senator Cameron's contribution and the continuing signs, intermittent as they are, that the Labor Party is gradually following the Greens' lead in addressing unjust tax measures in this country and reducing inequality, particularly wealth inequality. It was correct of Senator Cameron to point to the various measures, including the franking credits measure, that came in during the John Howard era. As he said, they were decisions John Howard made many years ago. But it is worth noting that these weren't just decisions of John Howard and the Liberal government; they were decisions of the Senate. These measures had to pass the parliament, and these measures were supported by the Labor Party.


As the minister, reasonably enough, just pointed out, the Labor Party had six years in government and didn't address this problem of a measure that clearly excessively benefits those who are the wealthiest. But the Labor Party also, of course, supported the measure coming in in the first place, as the Labor Party did with other John Howard measures, like the capital gains tax discount. Going back to the Hawke-Keating era, negative gearing was briefly abolished by that government and then restored by that government. There are the problems we are seeing now with increased casualisation and wage stagnation under Labor's Fair Work Act. And, of course, there was the privatisation regime that was followed by both Labor and Liberal. All of these things have contributed to growing inequality. It is pleasing to see Labor following the Greens, partially at least, on things like addressing, partially at least, the problem with negative gearing and the massive impact of that, combined with the capital gains tax discount—which Labor also supported being put in place in the Senate 15 or more years ago. That has caused a huge problem with housing affordability in this country. It's good to see some measures slowly being put in place to address that.


As Senator Di Natale made clear in this chamber earlier on today, the Greens support measures to reduce some of the tax loopholes, the tax breaks, that inappropriately favour those who are the wealthiest—clearly regressive tax measures. Anything the Labor Party puts forward that does that effectively we will certainly support. Let's not forget that many of these measures—and others such as the private health insurance rebate, which is billions of dollars in forgone revenue that goes to people who are on the wealthiest end of the spectrum—need to be wound back. These are all measures that the Greens have unequivocally opposed, and ones that, unfortunately, have been inconsistently addressed by the Labor Party. With regard to the Liberals, as Senator Cameron rightly pointed out repeatedly, the Liberal-National Party will do what they can to favour those at the top end of the wealth spectrum. They have made a key contribution to the continual increase in wealth inequality in this country. I just wanted to put on the record the Greens' unequivocal and continuing support for addressing the tax loopholes, the tax measures and the tax breaks—in superannuation and in other areas—that clearly are regressive and clearly contribute to growing inequality in this country. We will continue to push forward measures that address that and we will support them when others put them forward as well.

Senator BROCKMAN
 (Western Australia) (19:20):  I rise tonight to speak on Labor's big new tax on retirees—the changes to the dividend imputation system that have been proposed by Labor which will hit the retirement incomes of pensioners and self-funded retirees in what is a shameless tax grab. It's a $59 billion tax hit that will hurt one million Australians. One million Australians will be worse off as a result of this massive tax grab. According to the ATO, more than half of franking credit refunds were paid by individuals over the age of 65; 97 per cent had an income of less than $87,000; 86 per cent had an income of less than $37,000; and more than half had an income below $18,200. These are not high-income Australians; these are very modestly-living Australians on very modest incomes. Labor's tax grab will strip away vital income from many, many low-income earners.


Senator Cameron, in his contribution earlier, said that these people don't deserve this dividend imputation. I'm going to speak briefly to a letter I have a copy of here concerning one of those individuals who apparently don't deserve it—but I'll get to that in a moment. Labor tells us that these people shouldn't receive a refund because they haven't paid any tax, but that is just so patently false. The dividend imputation system was designed to ensure that tax is not paid twice on the same income. This is a key fact. Double taxation is wrong. Double taxation is unfair. The fact that we are even talking about double taxation again shows just how far backwards this Labor opposition has gone in its economic thinking.


Labor is proposing to slug low-income earners with the full corporate tax rate even if they don't earn enough to pay tax on their regular income. That is shameful. This is not a concession. As former Treasury secretary John Stone stated:


This is not a tax loophole or anything like this. This is a case where companies have paid tax, they've paid tax. They pay a dividend with a franking credit and if somebody doesn't have other tax liabilities to offset that, they're entitled to get the difference in cash. That is completely fair. It's been the case for nearly 20 years.


The Australian tax system is built on the simple principle that double taxation is inefficient and inequitable. Let's put it even more simply: double taxation is wrong. Taxing money twice is completely unfair. It's as unfair as retrospectivity and it's as unfair as death duties. I, along with many hundreds of thousands of hardworking Australians, believed that those ideas had been consigned to the dustbin of history. Unfortunately, that's not the case. Once again, we have seen this issue rear its ugly head. We have seen double taxation back on the agenda, and it's something that we must ensure never sees the light of day.


In the minute I have left I want to return to the comment from Senator Cameron about how these Australians don't deserve it. I will tell you the story of Glenn, a chap from Albany in Western Australia, who worked hard all his life and is a self-funded retiree. He is not a wealthy man, by any means. He was a teacher in the Department of Education for 40 years and he had a very modest self-managed super fund. When he retired it was around $500,000. Through some losses suffered during the global financial crisis, that reduced to around $350,000. He derives from that an income of around $33,000 per annum, $10,000 of which comes from dividend imputation. If Labor's policy goes ahead then this man, who has worked hard all his life, has looked after himself, aimed to be self-funded in retirement, doesn't take a pension, doesn't take a part-pension, doesn't want to take a part-pension— (Time expired)
