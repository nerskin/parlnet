"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2000-10-09,"—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the European institutions entitled Australia and the European institutions in 2000: an Australian parliamentary perspective. In June this year I had the honour and privilege of leading a delegation of this parliament on a visit to Europe. Apart from me, the other members on the delegation were the honourable member for Scullin and the honourable member for Bonython. One of the purposes of the delegation was to gain an appreciation of the role of key European institutions. The delegation also continued the dialogue between this parliament and the European parliament and put Australian views during discussions on various policy matters.
This relationship between the two parliaments has been developed through visits by delegations from both parliaments and over many hours of discussions. It was necessarily a brief visit of only five working days due in part to our amended parliamentary sitting pattern this year. The delegation went to Strasbourg for three days where we visited institutions related to both the European Union and the Council of Europe. The delegation had lengthy meetings with officials of the Council of Europe, including the Secretary-General, Herr Walter Schwimmer, and with officials of the European Court of Human Rights including the President of the Court, Mr Luzius Wildhaber.
At the European parliament in Strasbourg we had several long meetings with members of the European parliament, in particular its delegation for relations with Australia and New Zealand, chaired by Mr James Nicholson, a member from the UK. These discussions, both formal and informal, provided very valuable opportunities for our delegation members to exchange views. We were encouraged to see that Australia's position on some issues, in particular common agricultural policy, was sympathetically received. It was also very pleasant to receive the support of the European members in relation to Australia's role in helping East Timor. In fact, the congratulations were quite significant from various members of the European parliament at that time.
We also attended the plenary session of the European parliament as visitors in the gallery of the chamber, or Hemicycle. I found the outlook from the gallery, of over 500 members of the European parliament present that day taking successive votes electronically, to be most impressive. On our last day we received briefings from officials of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in Luxembourg and from officials of the European Commission in Brussels. As one would expect, the scale and complexity of the European institutions reflect the significant challenges they face in seeking to balance the individual national interests of members and in preparing for new members.
In conclusion I would like to extend my thanks to the retiring Ambassador to Belgium and the European Union, His Excellency Don Kenyon, with whom I had the pleasure to work a number of years ago when I was posted to Europe as a trade commissioner. Ambassador Kenyon and his staff at the embassy in Brussels, in particular Janaline Oh and Max Wang, prepared a very useful program of visits for the delegation and were in general very knowledgeable and helpful. Thanks are also due to Claressa Surtees, who did an outstanding job in the role of delegation secretary. Thanks, also, to the Parliamentary Library and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for their briefings before the delegation left. Finally, I extend my thanks to all members of the delegation for a most harmonious and successful expedition. I commend the report to the House.

"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,2000-10-09,"—In supporting the remarks of the honourable member for Cook with regard to the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the European institutions in June this year I would like to thank him for the way in which he led the delegation. The delegation comprised the honourable member for Bonython, Senator McGauran and Senator Stott Despoja, and it represented quite a diverse range of views on a number of matters. But on some matters there was a convergence of views. The fact that the delegation was able to convey these different views with good humour was no doubt in part due to the leadership of the honourable member for Cook and, also, the support we gained from Claressa Surtees, who, as secretary, carried out her duties with great diligence and efficiency. I join in thanking Ambassador Kenyon and all those at the mission for their support, especially Janaline Oh and Max Wang, who accompanied the delegation on our visits.
The value of a delegation to those who operate collectively on behalf of Europe cannot be underestimated. If we witness the impact and similar history over the past few weeks of the euro compared with the Australian dollar, it is of great importance that we understand the thinking of institutions such as the European Central Bank, with its responsibility for monetary policy and the further adoption of the euro throughout Europe. I think that is one of the institutions—which we did not visit—that perhaps future delegations might look at visiting. Another institution that we did not get the opportunity to visit was the Economic and Social Committee, which comprises representatives of management and labour as well as social and professional groups and is able to bring together the thinking of those bodies and help in formulating EU legislation. 
The report outlines a number of areas that we were able to discuss with various people from European institutions. I understand that the permanent delegation from the European parliament hopes to visit Australia in the New Year or very soon thereafter. I hope that is the case and I hope that a large number of our parliamentary colleagues take the opportunity that that will present to sit down with these members of the European parliament who show a special interest in matters to do with Australia and have some very forthright and worthwhile dialogue.
Europe, in its different collective guises, will continue to develop even further as an important political and economic bloc. As a nation, we should ensure that we build on the positive engagement that we have had and developed so far with the European institutions, because I believe that it will continue to be in our interests not only for trade reasons but also for a number of other reasons, including the way in which we associate throughout the globe.
In conclusion, what encouraged me was that we were able to visit with people who had a special interest in Australia. I was able to reacquaint myself with a number of people who have come here from the European parliament as part of the permanent delegation over their last two visits. I was also able, along with the honourable member for Bonython, to sit in on a caucus meeting of the socialist group of the European parliament. It was interesting that in the caucus there were the 11 interpreter booths, which were so characteristic of everything that is done in those European institutions. I commend the report to the House and look forward to those further relationships between this parliament and the European parliament and other European institutions.

"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,2000-10-09,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Shared endeavours: inquiry into employee share ownership in Australian enterprises, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed. 
—Robert Menzies led the Liberal Party of Australia to the 1949 federal election on a platform that included the belief that the best foundation for full employment would be found in `the prosperity of the business undertaking in which the man works'. One mechanism he nominated was `the encouragement and introduction of profit-sharing schemes wherever practicable'. Half a century later, though encouraged by successive governments to varying degrees, employee share ownership is yet to take root in the workplace of everyday working men and women. It remains largely confined to a flourishing executive remuneration sector. 
The objective of this report is to bring employee share ownership to the workplaces of everyday men and women. Employee share ownership should have at its core four fundamental policy objectives. The first is to align more closely the interests of employers and employees. The second is to provide a net contribution to national savings. The third is to facilitate the development of sunrise industries where equity in the company is as critical to key personnel as salary is. And the fourth is to facilitate succession planning and, in some cases, employee buyouts. But also, while close to half the Australian population directly own shares, half do not. Employee share plans provide an opportunity for many more Australians to experience the benefits of share ownership through the relatively stable and structured vehicle of employee share plans. If employee share ownership were to assume in the work force the status afforded superannuation savings, a practical vehicle would also exist for Australians to invest in their own companies. Not only can we buy Australian made goods but also, if we all had a stake in the company, Australia might find itself a little less reliant on foreign investment. 
Central to the report and the integrity of its recommendations, all of which should be seen as an integrated package, is the proposed establishment of an Employee Share Plan Monitoring Agency under the aegis of the Australian Taxation Office. In conjunction with a proposed single employee share plan legislative instrument, such a unit would administer and monitor employee share plans, enabling the construction of a more accurate picture of employee share ownership in Australian workplaces. An ESOP promotional unit is envisaged for the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business providing not only advice but also off-the-shelf plans for smaller businesses developed in consultation with the employee share plan regulatory unit. 
Division 13A of the Taxation Act is seen as being the most desirable mechanism for ESOPs. Recommendations are offered that would entrench but improve the operation of both tax exempt and tax deferred plans. The report proposes, amongst other things, that forgone income will be ultimately taxed as such but that any increased value in the shares should be treated as capital gain for taxation purposes; that shares acquired under ESOPs may be conditionally rolled over into a registered superannuation fund; conditional relaxation of the requirement that an individual taxpayer hold no more than five per cent of equities—critically important to small businesses and start-ups if we are to bring a share ownership culture into those workplaces; an increase in the $1,000 threshold under tax exempt plans; and that, consistent with the ACTU's `best practice' check list, the taxation of shares should be on disposal, rather than at 10 years in tax deferred plans, to facilitate long-term ownership and succession planning.
The committee recommends a cap be placed on salary sacrificed into `tax deferred' qualifying plans and that a review of FBT exemptions and concessional loan arrangements to finance executive salary packages be undertaken. In the context of an ESP regulatory agency, a specific identifying number for each plan and the public disclosure of the aggregate value of equities held by company employees, the foundation is laid for moving forward whilst strengthening the integrity of the tax base. 
Thank you to those individuals and organisations which gave so much of their time to assisting the committee's deliberations and the secretariat for its diligent hard work, in particular Mr Andrew Brien, Mr Paul McMahon and Mr  Richard Selth. Whilst I did not appreciate a dissenting report from the Labor members, I did enjoy working with them. This report includes recommendations to government that will be seen as controversial by some. It is a foundation building report intended to launch a constructive debate about a concept whose time has well and truly come. Finally, I especially thank my Liberal Party and National Party colleagues for the support that they gave not only to me but to the secretariat in developing these constructive suggestions.

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2000-10-09,"—The abuse of employee benefit arrangements by company executives is this government's bottom-of-the-harbour scheme. Company executives have been abusing employee share plans, trusts and offshore superannuation schemes and using them as a vehicle for tax avoidance on a massive scale. In many cases, they have claimed total tax wipe-outs. The sums involved have been conservatively estimated by the Taxation Office at $1.5 billion. The likeness between employee benefit arrangements and bottom-of-the-harbour schemes was identified by the Second Commissioner in the Australian Taxation Office, Michael D'Ascenzo, when he said:
... some of the arrangements that have emerged over recent years smack very much of the ingredients that were the tax avoidance paper scheme rorts of the 1970s and early 1980s.
The $1.5 billion estimate is little more than a guess, as at early 1999. When House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations member and Labor member for Lalor tabled at a reconvened hearing with the Taxation Office a scheme that has continued to be aggressively marketed, the tax office conceded that the $1.5 billion figure could have grown. They simply do not know. I believe Second Commissioner D'Ascenzo and Mr Michael O'Neill of the tax office, who gave evidence to our committee, to be honest officials who are genuinely frustrated about their inability to catch these tax cheats. Why wouldn't they be frustrated? The government refuses to legislate against the abuse of employee share plans by company executives, despite knowing for more than four years that tax avoidance activity has been occurring on a massive scale. How did the government know? The tax office told it. I quote from evidence given by the tax office:
... we certainly would be providing advice to governments of the day on tax issues. 
And:
We would have kept government informed all the way through the process.
The present Treasurer has known of this widespread avoidance activity, just as Treasury advised the Treasurer in the previous Labor government on 12 January 1994 that industry:
... says that it could envisage amounts in the billions of dollars being channelled through these sorts of arrangements. 
Treasury would have provided the same advice to the present Treasurer. The Labor government moved quickly on the advice it received, three times introducing legislation to combat these schemes. Three times the shadow Treasurer at the time, Peter Costello, opposed Labor's legislation, declaring the coalition would oppose this anti-avoidance legislation `root and branch', describing the legislation as `atrocious' and proudly boasting, on the third occasion, `Three strikes and you are out.' With that declaration, he took a baseball bat to the income tax system for company executives, and now into his fifth year as Treasurer he still refuses to legislate. 
There is a legal battle going on at the moment between the Taxation Office and the Remuneration Planning Corporation, a company we will be hearing a lot more of in coming days. I am advised that the tax office wrote to the Remuneration Planning Corporation more than two years ago telling them that their aggressively marketed executive share plans amounted to tax avoidance. The tax office told the committee that, if its court action against aggressive promoters of these schemes failed, it would recommend retrospective legislation to the government. I say to the tax office, `Don't hold your breath about that legislation.'  
Now we have a report from government members that recommends further increasing the tax generosity of executive share schemes. Their recommendations would allow company executives to defer tax indefinitely on their share options. David Murray, the managing director of the Commonwealth Bank, will be delighted. He has called for a more sympathetic tax treatment of his $40 million to $50 million in share options. The boardrooms of Australia will be celebrating today. I call on the Treasurer to reject these recommendations immediately and to introduce legislation to combat tax avoidance through executive share schemes without any further delay. This is not a Treasurer who was asleep at the wheel in his administration of the tax office. No, he has been driving the vehicle deliberately and the vehicle is named `Tax dodge: executive model'. The chair of the committee made major changes to the report after we were heading towards a bipartisan report with a few Labor reservations. For example, the word `abuse' previously appeared 69 times in a preliminary agreed draft of the report. It has now been expunged and replaced with the word `misuse'. So there is no abuse of these schemes, just a bit of misuse. Conditions allowing for indefinite tax deferral by company executives have been weakened from an earlier version of the report to virtually no conditions at all. The chair of the committee, the member for Bradfield, has done this. He is recommending the legalisation of these schemes. He has done it under pressure from senior ministers in this government. That is why we are completely dissenting from this report. ",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Education and Workplace Relations Committee</title>",Committees,2,1
"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,2000-10-09,"—by leave—I reject forcefully the spurious allegation that this report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations Shared endeavours: employee share ownership in Australia gives fresh hope to the tax avoidance industry. In fact, the facts tell quite a different story. The compliance powers enacted last year give any contrived scheme a very short life expectancy. Promoters and participants will be caught; in fact they will be prosecuted. It is claimed that we have tax avoidance today because the so-called loopholes which were just referred to were not closed in 1994. This is not only wrong but mischievous. In 1994, the Keating government tried to use the blunt instrument of fringe benefits tax to deal with tax avoidance schemes. This was a ridiculous approach. What employer would give shares to an employee so they may then have the privilege of paying fringe benefits tax? What emerged was division 13A, which taxes the recipient of the benefit. It taxes income. It is Labor Party legislation and it is supported by the coalition. It is interesting that, when the current member for Dickson was the Leader of the Australian Democrats, in her dissenting report she described the Labor Party's proposals in 1994 in the following way:
... the proposed legislation appears to be a sledgehammer to crack a walnut.
The Australian Taxation Office has confirmed that:
The introduction of Division 13A required tax planners to contemplate other means for maximising the after tax returns for their clients.
In other words, 13A worked. Tax avoiders used other approaches, described by the tax office as: 
... blatant, artificial and contrived, and designed to give a purpose other than intended by Parliament. 
But the committee was also advised by the tax office that, as a result of its activities, these blatant, artificial and contrived schemes were less attractive. The commissioner is currently paying special attention to these schemes, now the subject of recovery action. No-one in 1994, including parliamentarians, according to the Second Commissioner, Mr D'Ascenzo, could have anticipated the emergence of abusive arrangements. This is not a failure of the Australian Taxation Office, any government or parliament. Tax avoidance is never ignored. 
Recommending that tax be payable on disposal of a share acquired in a plan is no special deal for executives. Taxation on disposal is ACTU policy. If you actually go to the ACTU's document tendered to us during this inquiry, to `best practice' check list, item No. 6 states, `Tax is only payable when dividends are received or shares are sold.' The member for Rankin also made reference to the Remuneration Planning Corporation. I should also add that the member for Batman, when President of the ACTU, in writing the introduction, which was rather glowing, of this ACTU position, said:
This publication was produced with the assistance of the Australian Employee Share Ownership Association, in particular, Mr Geoff Price, the principal from the Remuneration Planning Corporation, who prepared the initial draft and provided ongoing advice. 
He also added that the Lend Lease Corporation was particularly helpful. Some of the compliance measures that are recommended in this report are: an employee share plan regulatory agency that will be required to register and approve all plans, ensure compliance with relevant laws and deregister abusive arrangements; the collection of comprehensive data on all employee share plans; and review of the FBT treatment of employee share plans, low and no interest loans and salary sacrifice arrangements. As I said in introducing the report, it is an integrated package of measures. If you take the abolition of the 10-year cessation rule, for example, in isolation from the fact that we are proposing to cap the amount of salary that can be sacrificed into such schemes, to have an identifying number for each scheme, 13A or non-13A, and also to have a regulatory agency which will collect and monitor information which is available about these schemes, you will appreciate, if you then add further to that that forgone income will be taxed as such compounded over time, that this environment could hardly be described as being conducive to exploitation of the Australian taxation system. 
Legislation to promote ESOPs will be most effective in attaining the public policy goals identified in our report if it is built on sound compliance infrastructure. So what we have is an integrated series of proposals, which means that we have legislative, administrative and regulatory infrastructure with a share plan regulatory agency, an employee share plan promotional unit to try to get an employee share culture into small businesses, medium businesses and start-ups. At the moment 95 per cent of everyday working men and women in this country work in businesses that employ fewer than 20 people. Instead of arguing about what is 3.5 per cent of total money invested in equity benefit arrangements, why not focus on things that are actually going to benefit everyday men and women in this country and bring them into an employee share ownership culture?

"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2000-10-09,"—The Labor members who participated in this inquiry think $1.5 billion hidden from taxation is worth arguing about, and we intend to argue about it in this place and outside it. Like my Labor colleagues, I was deeply concerned by the evidence of the Australian Taxation Office that more than $1.5 billion has been hidden from taxation. I am now also deeply disturbed by the fact that the government members of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations have ultimately refused to tackle the problem of tax avoidance head on. Indeed, a number of recommendations in this report, if implemented, will be rolled gold for the tax avoiders. 
It is worth noting that at an earlier stage, about two months ago in early August, the committee—both government and opposition—was largely in agreement about a draft version of this report which did explicitly mention the tax avoidance problem. All that remained was to finalise that version by way of teleconference. However, three days before that teleconference, on 21 August, committee members were advised by email of a fundamental change of heart by government members which led to the report being completely redrafted. Perhaps the government members here might like to explain that change of heart—why, after more than a year of serving on the inquiry, in the time the report is being finalised there was a complete reversal in their approach. We do not know why they had that change of heart, but what we do know is that as a result of it we have a majority report which is deeply flawed. It is flawed in two major respects. First, it takes a John Cleese `don't mention the war' approach to tax avoidance so that explicit references to the tax avoidance problem no longer appear. Second, it contains redrafted recommendations which will make tax avoidance easier.  
To highlight these problems let me refer to the following specific recommendations in the government's majority report. With regard to recommendation 1, originally there was agreement that ATO-collected information about employee share schemes would be public. Now the government can determine to cover it up. Recommendation 14 no longer contains a firm statement that FBT applies to executive only salary sacrifice arrangements. Recommendation 15 no longer contains a firm statement that FBT applies where equities are allocated in employment unless clear exemption conditions apply. Perhaps most startlingly of all, recommendation 31 has been amended so that it now allows effectively unlimited deferral of the payment of tax on employee share benefits. 
—It is the ACTU position. 
—As I take by way of interjection, this desperate and somewhat ironic clutching for the cover of the ACTU in relation to this recommendation is completely misconceived, because the big change to this recommendation has been that the tax deferral benefit can apply in circumstances where you have an executive only scheme. In the earlier versions of the report, that was not the case, and government members cannot deny that. What you can do now is piggyback a generous executive-only share scheme on some token scheme for general employees and those executives will get the benefit of tax deferral forever. That is what this recommendation is about, and government members know it. That is not what the ACTU recommended. They were dealing with general employee share schemes, and you know it. 
In respect of recommendation 34, we have seen a watering down so that now executive employees can carve up the equity of a company between a very limited number of them and they will still be entitled to concessional tax treatment. This government constantly tells the Australian people that it stands for ordinary Australians, for the battlers, for the mainstream. This report provides a test to see whether the rhetoric in any way matches the reality. The mainstream, the battlers who pay their fair share of tax, are advantaged if the privileged are required to pay their fair share too. That is what we believe in.

Promoters and participants will be caught; in fact they will be prosecuted. It is claimed that we have tax avoidance today because the so-called loopholes which were just referred to were not closed in 1994. This is not only wrong but mischievous. In 1994, the Keating government tried to use the blunt instrument of fringe benefits tax to deal with tax avoidance schemes. This was a ridiculous approach. What employer would give shares to an employee so they may then have the privilege of paying fringe benefits tax? What emerged was division 13A, which taxes the recipient of the benefit. It taxes income. It is Labor Party legislation and it is supported by the coalition. It is interesting that, when the current member for Dickson was the Leader of the Australian Democrats, in her dissenting report she described the Labor Party's proposals in 1994 in the following way:
... the proposed legislation appears to be a sledgehammer to crack a walnut.
The Australian Taxation Office has confirmed that:
The introduction of Division 13A required tax planners to contemplate other means for maximising the after tax returns for their clients.
In other words, 13A worked. Tax avoiders used other approaches, described by the tax office as: 
... blatant, artificial and contrived, and designed to give a purpose other than intended by Parliament. 
But the committee was also advised by the tax office that, as a result of its activities, these blatant, artificial and contrived schemes were less attractive. The commissioner is currently paying special attention to these schemes, now the subject of recovery action. No-one in 1994, including parliamentarians, according to the Second Commissioner, Mr D'Ascenzo, could have anticipated the emergence of abusive arrangements. This is not a failure of the Australian Taxation Office, any government or parliament. Tax avoidance is never ignored. 
Recommending that tax be payable on disposal of a share acquired in a plan is no special deal for executives. Taxation on disposal is ACTU policy. If you actually go to the ACTU's document tendered to us during this inquiry, to `best practice' check list, item No. 6 states, `Tax is only payable when dividends are received or shares are sold.' The member for Rankin also made reference to the Remuneration Planning Corporation. I should also add that the member for Batman, when President of the ACTU, in writing the introduction, which was rather glowing, of this ACTU position, said:
This publication was produced with the assistance of the Australian Employee Share Ownership Association, in particular, Mr Geoff Price, the principal from the Remuneration Planning Corporation, who prepared the initial draft and provided ongoing advice. 
He also added that the Lend Lease Corporation was particularly helpful. Some of the compliance measures that are recommended in this report are: an employee share plan regulatory agency that will be required to register and approve all plans, ensure compliance with relevant laws and deregister abusive arrangements; the collection of comprehensive data on all employee share plans; and review of the FBT treatment of employee share plans, low and no interest loans and salary sacrifice arrangements. As I said in introducing the report, it is an integrated package of measures. If you take the abolition of the 10-year cessation rule, for example, in isolation from the fact that we are proposing to cap the amount of salary that can be sacrificed into such schemes, to have an identifying number for each scheme, 13A or non-13A, and also to have a regulatory agency which will collect and monitor information which is available about these schemes, you will appreciate, if you then add further to that that forgone income will be taxed as such compounded over time, that this environment could hardly be described as being conducive to exploitation of the Australian taxation system. 
Legislation to promote ESOPs will be most effective in attaining the public policy goals identified in our report if it is built on sound compliance infrastructure. So what we have is an integrated series of proposals, which means that we have legislative, administrative and regulatory infrastructure with a share plan regulatory agency, an employee share plan promotional unit to try to get an employee share culture into small businesses, medium businesses and start-ups. At the moment 95 per cent of everyday working men and women in this country work in businesses that employ fewer than 20 people. Instead of arguing about what is 3.5 per cent of total money invested in equity benefit arrangements, why not focus on things that are actually going to benefit everyday men and women in this country and bring them into an employee share ownership culture?

"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2000-10-09,"—The Labor members who participated in this inquiry think $1.5 billion hidden from taxation is worth arguing about, and we intend to argue about it in this place and outside it. Like my Labor colleagues, I was deeply concerned by the evidence of the Australian Taxation Office that more than $1.5 billion has been hidden from taxation. I am now also deeply disturbed by the fact that the government members of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations have ultimately refused to tackle the problem of tax avoidance head on. Indeed, a number of recommendations in this report, if implemented, will be rolled gold for the tax avoiders. 
It is worth noting that at an earlier stage, about two months ago in early August, the committee—both government and opposition—was largely in agreement about a draft version of this report which did explicitly mention the tax avoidance problem. All that remained was to finalise that version by way of teleconference. However, three days before that teleconference, on 21 August, committee members were advised by email of a fundamental change of heart by government members which led to the report being completely redrafted. Perhaps the government members here might like to explain that change of heart—why, after more than a year of serving on the inquiry, in the time the report is being finalised there was a complete reversal in their approach. We do not know why they had that change of heart, but what we do know is that as a result of it we have a majority report which is deeply flawed. It is flawed in two major respects. First, it takes a John Cleese `don't mention the war' approach to tax avoidance so that explicit references to the tax avoidance problem no longer appear. Second, it contains redrafted recommendations which will make tax avoidance easier.  
To highlight these problems let me refer to the following specific recommendations in the government's majority report. With regard to recommendation 1, originally there was agreement that ATO-collected information about employee share schemes would be public. Now the government can determine to cover it up. Recommendation 14 no longer contains a firm statement that FBT applies to executive only salary sacrifice arrangements. Recommendation 15 no longer contains a firm statement that FBT applies where equities are allocated in employment unless clear exemption conditions apply. Perhaps most startlingly of all, recommendation 31 has been amended so that it now allows effectively unlimited deferral of the payment of tax on employee share benefits. 
—It is the ACTU position. 
—As I take by way of interjection, this desperate and somewhat ironic clutching for the cover of the ACTU in relation to this recommendation is completely misconceived, because the big change to this recommendation has been that the tax deferral benefit can apply in circumstances where you have an executive only scheme. In the earlier versions of the report, that was not the case, and government members cannot deny that. What you can do now is piggyback a generous executive-only share scheme on some token scheme for general employees and those executives will get the benefit of tax deferral forever. That is what this recommendation is about, and government members know it. That is not what the ACTU recommended. They were dealing with general employee share schemes, and you know it. 
In respect of recommendation 34, we have seen a watering down so that now executive employees can carve up the equity of a company between a very limited number of them and they will still be entitled to concessional tax treatment. This government constantly tells the Australian people that it stands for ordinary Australians, for the battlers, for the mainstream. This report provides a test to see whether the rhetoric in any way matches the reality. The mainstream, the battlers who pay their fair share of tax, are advantaged if the privileged are required to pay their fair share too. That is what we believe in.

"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2000-10-09,"—I rise to lend support to the timetable for an Australian republic outlined by the Leader of the Opposition last weekend. As a direct electionist I feel this is the best way to proceed. The republic debate needs to be turned over to the Australian people, and this is what the Leader of the Opposition is putting forward. I am confident that at the first stage the Australian people will vote in principle for an Australian republic. I am confident that at the second stage they will opt for the direct election model. People want to take more political power into their own hands. They want to bypass this parliament and directly decide themselves on the election of an Australian President. I am confident that at the third stage the Australian people will endorse a constitutional referendum along those lines.
I call on all direct electionists to support Mr Beazley's model. In particular, there is a notable direct electionist on the front bench of the government, the member for Flinders, Mr Reith. He has said that this is a strong matter of principle for him to support direct election. Here is his big chance to put his principles into action, his big chance to put his principles on the line and support the schedule for an Australian republic put forward by the Leader of the Opposition. If Mr Reith is truly a direct electionist he will realise that this three-stage program is the best way—perhaps the only way—in which a direct election republic will ever be carried in this country. It is a proposition to put the whole republican issue over to the Australian people—not one vote, not a sham constitutional convention, but three votes and a direct election President.

"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,2000-10-09,"—I move:  
That this House calls on the Government of Burma to cease infringing the right of Aung San Suu Kyi to conduct her democratic activities with freedom and in safety and further calls on the Burmese Government to involve itself in a substantive political dialogue with her National League for Democracy.
I would like to start with this observation: 
A hundred years ago, Burma exported more than two million tons of rice in a year. It was called the rice basket of India. Forty years ago, it still exported one million tons. In 1999, the figure was less than 70,000 tons. As the country's exports of rice have declined, its illicit export of drugs has soared. From being the rice basket of India, Burma has become the opium bowl of the world. 
This observation was made by Timothy Garton Ash in Beauty and the Beast in Burma. The beast, of course, is the junta that has ruled Burma with a clenched military fist since 1962. This military dictatorship rules under the Orwellian banners of SLORC, or State Law and Order Restoration Council, and SPDC, which stands for State Peace and Development Council. The `Beauty' Ash refers to is Aung San Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner and Leader of Burma's Democracy Party. 
Aung San Suu Kyi is the daughter of General Aung San, the hero of independence who was gunned down and murdered. He was shot down in cold blood in the Burmese parliament in 1947 because of his political beliefs. He became a martyr and, if the free world does not give voice and support to Aung San Suu Kyi, there is a danger that she too will become a martyr. I say that because the same thuggery which snuffed out the life of General Aung San is having a severe and detrimental impact and effect on the health and wellbeing of his daughter. 
She was two years of age when her father was murdered. Forty-three years later, in 1990, she led the National League for Democracy to a stunning victory in a general election that saw her party win 80 per cent of the vote. Prior to that election, particularly in 1988, hundreds of young pro-democracy supporters were killed in their peaceful push for democracy. SLORC refused to recognise the election victory and placed Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest. Despite this incarceration, continued intimidation and constant harassment, she has remained the symbol of peace and hope in Burma. Just as the Olympic torch burned as a symbol of the games in Sydney, her indomitable spirit and courage burns as the symbol of freedom and democracy in Burma.
I do not know many people from Burma, but their plight has been brought to my attention by a handful of people in my electorate who have fled the harsh and brutal regime in Burma—renamed Myanmar by SLORC. My constituents come from various parts of city and rural Burma and represent some of the many indigenous groups that make up Burma, including the Chin and Karen peoples. My constituents are very quietly spoken, courteous, proud, peace loving people who have a grave concern for the wellbeing of those who remain in Burma, many of them family members. They have asked me to do what I can to help them and to help the people of Burma in their struggle against what is now seen as one of the harshest government regimes anywhere in the world. Indeed, Burma's military regime is now recognised as one of the world's worst violators of human rights. Even the United Nations—that sometimes timid, often self-interested, always conservative body—has repeatedly and publicly condemned the military powers of Burma for their human rights abuses.  
Torture, rape, murder, forced labour, forced resettlement and imprisonment for political beliefs are just some of the abuses visited on the people of Burma by this regime. It is in this environment of repression that Aung San Suu Kyi stands defiant as a non-violent defender of the political and human rights of her people. It is her profile and her courage that give the Burmese people hope and strength to endure this regime and to work for the democracy and freedom which they believe will one day be theirs.
Burma is a close neighbour of Australia. It has a population of some 45 million people. In my view, we should be loud in our condemnation of the military junta in Burma and we should be joining President Clinton, Kofi Annan, Prime Minister Blair, Madeleine Albright, the Nordic foreign ministers and others—all of whom come from countries much more distant from Burma than Australia—in their condemnation of Burma's military government. The voice of the Australian parliament should be heard in support of Aung San Suu Kyi and the people of Burma.
Why is it that we react to the atrocities we see via the media in places like Palestine, Jerusalem, East Timor and Yugoslavia? I understand why we react to them, but you can bet that when we see these atrocities reported on TV and in the papers there will be statements from the minister or dorothy dixers in parliament. Yet we hear nothing similar in relation to Burma, a country about which we are strangely quiet. I pose the question: why? Is it a question of out of sight out of mind? Is it because Burmese authorities treat the foreign press so harshly and, because of that, the many human rights violations and violence are not reported in Australia? Is it that we do not see or hear so we do not care? Is it that our foreign policy is largely driven by the media? Indeed, is Australia's foreign care and compassion measured by the amount of media coverage to which we are exposed in this country?
All freedom loving Australians should take the plight of Aung San Suu Kyi to heart. Her courage, her defiance, her resolve and her spirit are all qualities that Australians admire and respect. Admiration and respect, however, are not enough. This parliament should do all in its power, all in its resolve, to assist Aung San Suu Kyi in her peaceful battle to achieve freedom and democracy for her people in Burma. At a time when United Nations conventions are much in the news, it is interesting to recall what SLORC foreign minister Ohn Gway had to say on this subject. He said:
There are no compulsions or obligations for any country to sign the UN convention on human rights. Like some other countries in Asia, we have to take into consideration our culture, ethos and the standards of development before accepting their declarations. 
Ohn Gway would be encouraged to know that he has an ally in the Prime Minister of Australia who supports similar views about some United Nations conventions. Contrast that statement of the Burmese foreign minister to that which Aung San Suu Kyi had to say when she said:
I would like the west to see us not as a country rather far away whose sufferings do not matter, but as fellow human beings in need of human rights and who could do much for the world, if we were allowed. 
The people of Burma are human beings and their suffering does matter. That is why I have moved this motion in the House today, and I must say I am particularly pleased by the number of quality speakers who are listed to contribute to the debate. I am also particularly pleased that Tim Fischer has agreed to second this motion.
I am not one who is keen to support economic sanctions, because the chances are that the only people hurt by that tactic are the ordinary people of Burma who are already suffering an immense burden. But I do believe that Australia should review its relationship with the Burmese military. We should send them a strong message that we do not and will not in any way support their regime. We do not support their intrusion on the democratic right of the democratically elected Aung San Suu Kyi or her supporters as they go about their pursuit of democracy and freedom, which is something they should be able to do in safety and without fear of incarceration, intimidation, persecution or death. Australia should also urge the Burmese military junta to enter into a realistic dialogue with the National League for Democracy. The Burmese government must learn that, as long as they persist with the human rights abuse, they will stand condemned by all freedom loving nations and peoples of the world. I commend this motion to the House.

"Fischer, Tim, MP",NP,2000-10-09,"—I second the motion. On the evening of 15 September in Sydney, there was a magic moment when the two teams of North Korea and South Korea joined together to enter Stadium Australia as part of the opening of the magnificent and sensational Sydney Olympic Games. In one sense, that broadcast a message right around the world and back to the respective administrations of North Korea and South Korea, via television and other means, of how welcoming the Australian people were and how welcoming the world was of this supreme gesture. It was an emotional moment. It was a magnificent moment. It reflected a lot of progress being made, even to get to that stage, to get two hostile nations joining together at the opening of the Sydney Olympics. Sadly, since then and since the end of the Olympics, we have had mayhem in the Middle East, a great deal of slaughter of human life and injury of human life and the continuing saga in Myanmar, otherwise known as Burma. The motion before the House, very adequately moved by the member for Cowan—whom I look forward to joining at the Paralympics in a few days time—states: 
That this House calls on the Government of Burma to cease infringing the right of Aung San Suu Kyi to conduct her democratic activities with freedom and in safety and further calls on the Burmese Government to involve itself in a substantive political dialogue with her National League for Democracy.
The world would like to see the NLD forces and the SLORC administration come together for decent dialogue to advance the agenda in Myanmar, just as we saw on another stage at another level the North Korean and South Korean athletes joining hands and, in a sense, saying hello to each other, but, more particularly, congratulating each other as they deserved to at that moment at the Sydney Olympics. I agree with the member for Cowan that Myanmar has so much to offer its people by way of potential. Years ago you used to bypass Singapore and Bangkok to go to Rangoon, Burma, because the shopping was better there. There was so much colour, life and movement in the magnificent city of Rangoon, which is dominated by the great Shwe Dagon Pagoda. The Shwe Dagon Pagoda is some sight to behold, especially in the early evening when it is floodlit and showing off its gold in many fine ways.
The 47.3 million people of Burma have done it very hard in recent years. Their economy has been contracting. Their infrastructure has been deteriorating, manifested by the fact that it now takes several hours more to go by train from Rangoon to Mandalay in the north than it did 10 years ago. A magnificent train journey as it might be, the deterioration of transport infrastructure in Burma means that it has become slower and slower and indeed slightly more dangerous in the process. 
The real suffering though is perhaps not on the infrastructure front. It is perhaps not with regard to buildings and other manifest ways of measuring progress. Indeed, the tourism industry in Burma has endeavoured to provide more resources and to upgrade hotels, river boats and the like. The real suffering is the loss of education for a whole generation of Myanmar people—the loss of educational opportunity, especially at the tertiary education level. I am grateful to the Chancellor of Canberra University, Wendy McCarthy, who has recently returned from Myanmar, for reminding me how bad things have got on that front—how long universities have been closed, how limited the resources are for students to learn in Myanmar. In the year 2000 that is very hard to swallow, very hard to understand and certainly totally unacceptable in a country which does have so much potential, not the least of which is its 47 million people who are suffering so much on the health front and especially on the education front. 
Some years ago before I became Deputy Prime Minister I had the pleasure of walking along University Avenue in Rangoon and turning into the gateway of No. 54 University Avenue, Rangoon. That is of course the residence—to some extent the prison—of Aung San Suu Kyi. In its better years it was a very pretty place, double storey. It is a bit run down now. It is a former compound, sitting on the edge of the Inle Lake in the middle of Rangoon. My wife and I had the pleasure of meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi at her residence and discussing all aspects of the impasse that existed then and continues to exist today. I must say that I was overawed by this diminutive lady, with her dynamic spirit, her clarity of thought, her determination, and her capacity, notwithstanding a not particularly strong physique, to battle on against impossible odds. She and I recorded our interest in Bhutan—her sons had been to Bhutan with their late father. Then we moved to discuss in a lot more detail various aspects of the impasse that has existed since the NLD topped the poll, now a decade ago, in the election held in Myanmar at that particular time. 
The world ought to salute Aung San Suu Kyi for her decision not to give up. It could have been so much easier for her to depart her home country, to go back to the UK where she studied and worked for a period, to vanish into the good life of the Western world. But she has bravely decided to fight on against the odds, to make the point that the original election result has not been observed and that SLORC, in all its manifestations, continues to rule with an iron fist and at the end of the day gives no ultimate joy because the economy continues to collapse and the standard of living continues to decline, when there would be a whole lot different way for the Burma people and the Burma nation. 
I happily second the motion presented today. I point out that the Australian government deplores the actions of the Burmese government in again denying the rights of freedom of movement to Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, has had much to say in that regard. I point out that on 9 October, this day, a scheduled visit is to take place by the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Burma, Mr Razali. We hope that the Burmese government will cooperate fully with Special Representative Razali, including in his efforts to contribute towards meaningful dialogue between the government and the opposition. It is not an impossible ask; it is a perfectly reasonable ask in the year 2000. It can contribute so much to removing the impasse, to allow progress, to go forward. 
I know there are deep-seated fears that there will be a form of splitism in Burma, as various minority groups would move down different pathways if there was to be the introduction of the NLD in a substantial way to the process of government. I actually think that those fears are incorrectly held, and that there is a way forward for Myanmar or Burma which is a whole lot better and would not see the incarceration in particular of elements associated with the current administration but would see their own children, let alone the children of so many others, get a chance—before it is too late and before they are denied it— to receive any form of education and substantial health support, as is so necessary in this great country of Burma. It is with pleasure that I second the motion before the House.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Burma</title>,Private Members' Business,10,1
"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,2000-10-09,"—I support the motion moved by the honourable member for Cowan and seconded by the honourable member for Farrer. Unlike the honourable member for Farrer, I have not had the pleasure of meeting Aung San Suu Kyi. My interest in matters to do with Burma has been dictated by two visits to camps for displaced people from Burma. The first was on 30 November 1993 at a refugee camp out of Cox's Bazaar in Bangladesh, a refugee camp 200 metres from the Burmese border. In this camp were tens of thousands of Rohingya people—Muslims from Burma who had been forced to flee Burma because of their treatment by the military forces. 
At this time Aung San Suu Kyi was under house arrest. She had been under house arrest since 20 July 1989. Whilst under house arrest, her party had had success in May 1990 in the election, where they gained 80 per cent of the parliamentary seats. But of course we know, as history tells us, that the military junta did not accept the result of the election. If one reflects upon recent events in Yugoslavia, where we see finally the overthrow of another despot who, seemingly, was going to try to ignore the result of a democratic election, we wonder what might have happened if that election in Burma was being held now rather than 10 years ago.
The next time that I went to a camp that had Burmese people in it was to a displaced persons camp, the Wangka camp, near Mae Sot, which I visited on 14 September 1995. The people that were in this camp were Karen people. The camp was not far from the river Moei, which is the border between Burma and Thailand. The Karen, of course, are an ethnic minority of Burma, as mentioned by the honourable member for Cowan. As this time, 14 September 1995, Aung San Suu Kyi had been released from house arrest some two months earlier on 10 July. There was great optimism that perhaps there was to be a change in the attitude of SLORC towards Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy. Regrettably, history shows that we were mistaken in the belief that that was to happen.
When Aung San Suu Kyi was released in July 1995, the military junta indicated that she was to be released unconditionally, and we thought that that would mean that she could go about her business as the leader of the National League for Democracy. How wrong we were. Over the last five years, there have been several instances where she has been made to stay in Rangoon; for example, the famous instance when she was left in her car on the bridge, not being able to move and finally having to return to her house. When this motion was placed on the Notice Paper, Aung San Suu Kyi was trying to leave Rangoon. Some 10 days after the motion was placed on the Notice Paper, she was allowed to return to her house, and we thought that perhaps there was to be normalcy. On 21 September, she went to the railway station at Rangoon and tried to purchase a ticket to travel to Mandalay, where she wanted to check on the offices of the National League for Democracy. She was denied a ticket; she was told that there was not a ticket available, was forcibly returned to her house and, again, has been placed under house arrest with the phone lines cut and no allowance for visitors from ambassadors and the like.
This is the continuing struggle that faces Aung San Suu Kyi, the National League for Democracy and other ethnic minorities in Burma. It is appropriate that we have the full support for this simple motion that is being proposed, because I believe the wording of this motion is something that we could all embrace, even if we might disagree about the action that needs to be taken.

"Gash, Joanna, MP",LP,2000-10-09,"—I speak in support of the motion before the House, and in doing so remind members of my previous speeches in this chamber in support of Aung San Suu Kyi, her party and the 90 per cent of the Burmese people who voted by referendum for the establishment of a democratic government in Burma. It is a sad indictment that, after four years, I stand here yet again on the same issue, uttering equal, if not stronger, condemnation of the current Burmese government for failing to recognise Aung San Suu Kyi.
Some 50 years ago, the people of this deeply religious yet fun loving country were granted independence by their colonial masters. It was the fulfilment of a dream of Burma's national hero, Aung San, a man who dedicated his live to the cause of freedom. However, his dream of a free and prosperous Burma was short lived. Aung San and his deputies were assassinated in the government chambers. Today, the daughter of Burma's national hero has sought to lead the people on the path laid by her father. Suu Kyi has, as her father did half a century ago, dedicated her life to the fight for human rights, freedom of choice and a truly representative government by peaceful means.
There have been times since I first spoke in condemnation of the human rights abuses in that country when I believed that the authorities in Burma were moving towards dialogue with the National League for Democracy and its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. Indeed, information I had received from my Burmese friends raised hopes of a movement to reconciliation of the parties. However, the latest reports out of Burma indicate a hardening of the ruling party's attitude to any persons who seek to oppose the policies of the military leaders. The crackdown on Suu Kyi and her party members continues, freedom of movement is denied to ordinary citizens and the cruel interrogation of National League members is a common occurrence. In calling on the government of Burma to involve itself in real dialogue with the National League, I urge both parties to address this question: why is a country once acknowledged as the jewel of the East, blessed with abundant natural resources, a country steeped in Buddhist tradition, now languishing in company with the poorer nations of the world? 
Many factors have contributed to the slow progress of the new independent nation. The early leaders in their search for new approaches and ideologies experimented with their own brand of socialism. They chose to shut out the influences of the outside world, but the greatest factor in bringing the country to a full stop was the takeover of government by the military, thus depriving the people of their basic freedom. The military leaders with their rule of law by the gun have strayed from the path of Buddhism, which for centuries had formed the foundations of traditional Burmese Buddhist culture, a culture which places the greatest value on human life, supreme happiness and personal freedom. In Burmese Buddhism, the distinction between good and bad is very simple: all actions that have their roots in greed and hatred are bad or unskilful and all actions that are rooted in virtue and wisdom are good.
In supporting the motion before us today, I urge the government of Burma to cease infringing the rights of Aung San Suu Kyi, to allow her to conduct her democratic activities with freedom, and, importantly, to involve itself in peaceful dialogue with the National League for Democracy with the aim of a spiritual and political reconciliation. I further urge the leaders of Burma to shift their focus from hatred to harmony, peace and the basic rights of the citizens. I should also remind the government of Burma that it was their country that voted for the adoption of the 30 articles contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. It is totally unacceptable that Aung San Suu Kyi is now once again being held under virtual house arrest and that members of the NLD are being detained in so-called `government guesthouses'.

Unfortunately, as the member for Gilmore has pointed out, the situation has changed little in recent years. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi was first elected in democratic elections in 1990, and those elections delivered a landslide victory to her National League for Democracy. Yet she has never been allowed to take her rightful position; nor has the National League for Democracy ever been able to exercise the rule of Burma. Since she returned to Burma in 1988, she has spent most of her time under house arrest. In 1991, Aung San Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize. At the time she was described by the Nobel Peace Prize Committee as:
... one of the most extraordinary examples of civil courage in Asia in recent decades ... an important symbol in the struggle against oppression. 
She describes her own philosophy in a book called Freedom from fear and other writings that was edited by her late husband, Michael Aris. The philosophy of freedom from fear is basically that we cannot, as human beings with consciences, allow fear to dictate our actions. I think in Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's life you can see the truth of that statement and that belief in the personal risks that she has taken and in the enormous personal sacrifices she has made. I am sure that other members in this chamber will recall, as I do, that a few years ago when her husband was terminally ill the Burmese military junta refused to allow him to visit his wife in Burma. They said that she could leave Burma to visit her husband in Britain, but of course we know, and it was widely known at the time, that most likely she would not have been allowed to return to Burma. That is the sort of sacrifice this brave woman has had to make all of her life, and indeed it is the sort of sacrifice that her family has had to endure as well. 
The recent crackdown that other members have referred to in which Aung San Suu Kyi has been confined once again to her residence prompted quite vocal and very immediate responses from Britain and the US. Unfortunately, the same could not be said of Australia. The Australian Embassy in Rangoon did not seek to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi when she was held at the roadside for nine days, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, made no public statement defending her right of movement. Again, when 140 supporters of Aung San Suu Kyi were rounded up when Aung San Suu Kyi wanted to travel from Rangoon to Mandalay there was, I think, a deafening silence followed by muted, equivocal criticism from this government, unfortunately. Instead, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been justifying Australia's `fresh and innovative approach to relations with the Burmese regime'. What he is referring to of course is Australia's recent agreement to provide human rights workshops for middle ranked officials of the Burmese military. Australia is also apparently helping Burma set up a human rights commission. This information was not widely reported but certainly was reported as part of the proceedings of the fifth annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions which occurred in New Zealand not so long ago. It is very difficult to imagine how independent a human rights commission could possibly be in a country where there is a military dictatorship, where that dictatorship has refused for a decade to recognise the legitimately elected government, where arbitrary detention and arrest are common, where interrogation is violent and carried out in secret and where intimidation of political activists and ethnic minorities is common. Instead, Australia should be focusing our diplomatic efforts on increasing pressure on the State Peace and Development Council to recognise the legitimately elected government, on delivering aid and support directly to Burmese refugees and on restoring Radio Australia which the Burmese resistance depended upon for information about their own country. We should be concentrating on restoring Labor's special humanitarian programs for Burmese people and easing the recent tightening on Burmese people seeking political asylum or refugee status in this country.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Burma</title>,Private Members' Business,10,1
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2000-10-09,"—The member for Sydney fails to recognise that, despite its efforts, the approaches of the world community have failed over decades to improve the political and human rights situation in Burma, and that the Australian government is attempting another tack: human rights education, not for the military but for those in positions where attitudinal change may be possible, where hopefully it will lead to enlightenment. Education and enlightenment before further engagement may just be the key. I speak in support of this motion not only because all right-thinking people deplore the actions of the Burmese regime in again denying the right of freedom of movement to Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters, not only because the federal government has repeatedly called upon the Burmese regime to respect the right of freedom for all Burmese people including Suu Kyi; not only in the hope that a continuing focus on Burma will lead to an advancement in the cause of democracy in that country, but also because of a personal commitment that I made over five years ago to speak in support of Suu Kyi's quest to achieve rule of law, human rights, freedom and democracy for the people of Burma.
In October 1995 I travelled to Burma in the company of a friend who was a lawyer but who had media accreditation in Thailand. He had arranged to interview Suu Kyi, and I took that opportunity to meet her. It was a matter of just months after her release from house arrest in July of that year. I must say that, from our visit to her home in Rangoon, it was not readily apparent to me that six years of house arrest had ended: her house was surrounded by people sitting around the gates and perched up on the fence, and there were crowds milling around, just on an ordinary Monday morning; yet there was a strong military presence and we had to surrender our passports to guards at the gate just to visit her—and that is not a comfortable feeling. We had about an hour with her, just talking about her life, her hopes and her fears and, like the member for Farrer, I found myself in awe upon meeting her. Her courage, her determination, her sense of duty and her serenity were overpowering, and I believe I now know what is meant by a `charismatic' leader. 
Suu Kyi is a magnificent symbol for the people of Burma, the daughter of Burma's assassinated hero of independence who returned home amid the turmoil of the 1988 pro-democracy uprisings and was swept up in the struggle to wrest Burma from the clutches of dictatorship. But Suu Kyi is far more than a symbol. A student of politics and economics, fluently articulate in Burmese and English, a prolific writer, composed, serenely beautiful, she is a persuasive, compelling, inspiring leader in her own right. Her fight for democracy has been described as one of the most extraordinary examples of civil courage in Asia in recent years. The citation for her Nobel Peace Prize awarded in 1991 stated that the committee, in awarding the prize to Suu Kyi, wished to:
... honour this woman for her unflagging efforts and to show its support for the many people throughout the world who are striving to attain democracy, human rights and ethnic conciliation by peaceful means.
She was, and she remains, a worthy recipient of the award. She has spoken clearly and consistently against the ruling regime. She has refused to be bribed into silence and she has refused her own safety and the comforts of her family life to live—in truth—in Burma. She is one of the most potent examples of the power of the powerless. I recall that, on her release from the six years of house arrest which had prevented her from becoming the leader of her country after her National League for Democracy won a landslide victory in the 1990 elections—a result that the ruling regime still refuses to recognise—Suu Kyi emulated Nelson Mandela when she said she bore no malice, no grudges, no bitterness; she just wanted to work for the healing of her country after decades of repressive totalitarianism. She has continued to call for dialogue and reconciliation between the major players, yet five years after her release—12 years after taking up her fight against the tyranny in Burma—so little has changed. It is deplorable that she is still virtually under house arrest. It demonstrates yet again how much she is feared, how much her presence, her influence, is feared by those in power in Burma. In fact, her mere presence reflects and articulates the continuing movement for democracy in Burma.
As she has said and written, the people of Burma view democracy not merely as a form of government but as an integral social and ideological system based on respect for the individual. They want the basic human rights which would guarantee a tranquil, dignified existence, free from want and fee. What we see in Burma is the struggle of a people to live whole, meaningful lives as free and equal members of the world community. I commend the motion.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2000-10-09,"—I rise to support the motion moved by the member for Cowan. I think it is important that the Australian government acts to try to deal with the situation that Aung San Suu Kyi has had to endure for so many years now, and that is her house arrest and the human rights violations. Recent news reports about the restrictions of movement of the opposition leader have again brought to mind the intolerable human rights situation in Burma, where persecution of minorities and democratic parties opposed to the current government regime continues unabated.
A constituent of mine, David Cooper of Longford, reminded me of what the situation still was when he wrote to me last week, and I would like to put on the record what he wrote:
The Australian Government humanitarian aid to the Karen refugees is appreciated— 
he was talking about some aid money being sent—
but although they may be less prone to attack in their camps in Thailand, they are no nearer to being repatriated on just terms.
Although other governments have protested vigorously, the Australian Government's tardy expression of concern lacked conviction. What is more their offer of human rights training for middle ranking officials of the regime is hardly likely to achieve any change in their attitude. On the contrary, they are more blatant in their defiance of world opinion.
In recent times the Australian Government appears to be more interested in trade than in human rights. Alexander Downer's statement, that attempts to isolate Burma have been futile, shows that he has not learned from the lesson of South Africa. If the international boycott had been abandoned after ten years the Apartheid regime would still be in power.
The cynical appeasement of the brutal and oppressive regime in Burma tarnishes Australia's reputation as an upholder of freedom and democracy, and is contrary to Christian teaching on justice.
He finished by asking me if I would pass on his concerns to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Alexander Downer MP—which I have just done by putting that on to the record. But he is right: we are just not doing enough to try to sort out the situation where there should be no need for refugees between Thailand and Myanmar if a proper democratic situation existed—apart from the distressing human rights situation that exists, it is costing the Thai government a considerable amount of money to try to keep these people in camps on the borders. I know that some members of this House have been there—I think you have, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins. It also leads to an unstable situation right along that border. We have to remember that the Burmese people elected Suu Kyi's party to rule in the 1990 general elections. However, the Myanmar military junta has refused to hand over power. Suu Kyi was kept under formal house arrest from 1989 until 1995 and, even though she has some basic freedom, her movements have remained heavily restricted and hundreds of her followers have been jailed.
The history of Burma has been difficult and violent. First, Aung San Suu Kyi's father, and then she herself, attempted to find a peaceful settlement, but the military have been too strong. She has personally given up so much for her cause. Her husband died while she was under house arrest, and she has neither seen nor heard from her children for 10 years. She has had little happiness in those times, but still she struggles on to fight for the rights of her people. She could be compared to India's Gandhi and, indeed, Nelson Mandela. Yet this struggle is rarely on the front page of any newspaper, because she does not seek her people to be violent in her cause. She seeks to gain democracy by peaceful means. She has been stopped many times from taking a message to her countrypeople, sometimes waiting patiently at a bridge or a city exit for days at a time, only to be turned around and sent back by the military. We occasionally get snippets of news when one of these events occurs.
Change must occur. We have a responsibility to see democracy at least started in Burma, to see dialogue being established between the junta and the opposition, and to help them achieve what they will. After all, that will be better for the people of Burma. (Time expired)   ",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Burma</title>,Private Members' Business,10,1
"Thomson, Andrew, MP",LP,2000-10-09,"—The member for Cowan's motion on Burma presents an interesting topic. To me, it raises that contradiction in matters of international law and politics. It poses the question: how do you reconcile the principle of non-interference between nations with the reasonable desire on the part of people in one country to see the maltreatment of people in another country halted? When I talk about the `principle of non-interference', this is really the basic tenet of what was originally called the `law of nations'. That is that states are sovereign and, as such, they exercise supreme authority within their territory and over their nationals and that they are not to be interfered with in terms of those internal affairs by other states.
Some of the early American political leaders, especially after the War of Independence, were very strong on this point. They wanted to make sure that, having achieved independence, they were not unduly interfered with by European states or Great Britain, whom they had defeated. This goes to the question of sovereignty, which to my mind is no small thing. The dignity of a nation is something that should be protected, even at great political cost, because it matters that small nations not be pushed around by big nations. You can see under the WTO rules, which try to ensure that free trade takes place in the world, that those countries or governments with big markets are restrained from bullying small exporters. This is often the case with Australia's trade. It is for the benefit of all in the world that this principle, as far as possible, be maintained. 
Then, of course, you come to the postwar ideology of human rights. This is often seen, I think, a little too narrowly in the context of the human rights treaties, which are really aspirational documents; they are declarations of good intent—often hypocritical good intent—but at least they do not involve reciprocal obligations. That is, if one party to these conventions and declarations breaches one of the terms, other parties do not have the right to retaliate against them to enforce those standards of human rights—the reason being, of course, that sometimes the parties to such treaties included such paragons of virtue as the Soviet Union!
In the case of Burma and Aung San Suu Kyi, one of the strange things I find about these treaties is that they do not confer on people the right to elect their own governments—strange as that may seem. If you look, for example, at the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, they have the same provision in there: that everyone has the right to take part in the government of their country directly or through freely chosen representatives. But they do not say that they have the right to elect their own government. So where there are attempts to see these standards of human rights enshrined in a quasi legal regime, such as these treaties, I think they are really doomed to failure.
It seems to me, from observations, that the best or most powerful agent in fostering political freedom is the investment of a lot of financial capital in particular jurisdictions because, if that creates business opportunities, it creates demand for university graduates. Those university graduates generally have a sense of confidence that comes from a broader and better education. Of course, eventually that sense of confidence grows and it triumphs over primitive oppression from governments. In Aung San Suu Kyi's case, I hope that eventually that will be the case. For the time being, she should be left alone by the government to pursue her political aims.
But I do think it is the wrong approach to seek to isolate Burma. In fact, if you are to be logical about it and brave enough to say it, I think Australia could probably help more by fostering a closer relationship with Burma because, if the examples of some other countries are anything to rely on, that may eventually lead to real freedom for the people of Burma and an end to that poisonous opium trade that the member for Cowan referred to. That is the real threat to Australia's national interest here: the export of narcotics. I hope Aung San Suu Kyi does well—but more important to me is that something should happen in that country to stop people selling heroin to the children of some of my constituents.

"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,2000-10-09,"—I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this important motion today, and I commend my colleague the member for Cowan for proposing the motion to the House. The news that there were going to be democratic elections in Burma back in 1990 was greeted positively by the free world. In 1990, those elections were conducted with what can be described only as a predictable result. Nevertheless, it was a result that I and many others welcomed. The National League for Democracy, the NLD, won 392 or 80 per cent of the 485 seats contested. The junta-backed NUP won 10 seats, a mere two per cent. What has followed in Burma is a terrible story. The military junta have refused to acknowledge the result of those elections in any way. Many elected members have been murdered or tortured or have disappeared. The Prime Minister, subsequently elected by those successful members of parliament, has been in exile ever since. We have seen oppression the likes of which can be compared only with the worst days in South Africa or with the infamous Pol Pot. 
Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has led her people through these terrible years with dignity, with determination and with an absolute belief that at some time right will rule and we will see the legitimate government of Burma in office. She has done this at great personal cost after years of house arrest. `House arrest' is a feeble description when it actually means the personal torture of isolation and forced separation from her husband, the late Michael Aris, from her children, her friends and her colleagues. Five years ago, on 10 July, the military junta announced Suu Kyi's release from house arrest. They wished us in the free world to believe that with that release they would comply with the law and restore democracy to Burma. Sadly but predictably, the oppression continued at all levels following that gesture. More recently, of course, we have seen Suu Kyi isolated on the side of a road for days simply because she was attempting to travel from Rangoon to speak with some of her followers. Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, her people, the people of Burma, and all ethnic groups within Burma—the Mon, the Karen, the Shan, the Kachin and the many other groups—must get our support, the support of the free world, in their quest for democracy.
I question the wisdom of attempting pleasant dialogue with the perpetrators of evil rule in Burma. In our platform, discussed at our recent Hobart national conference, we say:
Labor reaffirms its longstanding condemnation of gross violations of human rights in Burma, including the draconian suppression of political freedoms, torture, rape, disappearances, extrajudicial killings, oppression of ethnic and religious minorities, and use of forced labour.
I can recall earlier this year that, when our eyes were all turning—and correctly so—to East Timor and the terrible scenes taking shape there, I was celebrating the Mon national day here in Canberra. The Mon, like other ethnic groups within Burma, have suffered through decades of oppression. However, while we look at the East Timor situation, Kosovo, the Middle East and other parts of the world, where we see on our televisions every night that atrocities are becoming the norm, we must never forget what has been and continues to go on in Burma. We have heard some interesting comments in this debate today. Can I say: thank God we never gave up on the inspiration and commitment of Nelson Mandela through the dark days of South African history. Now we must not give up on Aung San Suu Kyi or the people of Burma. I had the privilege, the pleasure and the delight of living in Burma for a year and a half nearly 20 years ago. I so much look forward to going back but feel in all conscience that that is never going to be possible while the current junta rule in Burma in the evil way they do.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Burma</title>,Private Members' Business,10,1
"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2000-10-09,"—I am happy to rise today to support the motion from the member for Cowan and to congratulate him on the motion. I think the developments in Burma are of grave concern to all members of this House and it is appropriate that all of us should align our support for Aung San Suu Kyi. It is of grave concern to us. We have in this country just been experiencing and celebrating our own democracy through the Olympic Games. Think of the paradox in Burma. We have in Burma one of the most beautiful countries in the world, with a rich and fascinating culture, but it is also the backdrop to serious restrictions of freedoms and ongoing human rights violations. The action of the Burmese government in again placing Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest is an unhealthy development in the political situation in Burma and a step backwards in its international reputation. As we are all now aware, the problem arose when Suu Kyi and her supporters were attempting to travel to Mandalay by train. They were detained against their wishes, and Suu Kyi was returned to house arrest in Rangoon.
I fully concur with the statements of the Minister for Foreign Affairs on these developments to date. His statement of 25 September clearly said the latest actions of the Burmese government are `unacceptable' and `to be deplored'. I also note the minister and our diplomatic representatives in Burma have made a series of representations to the Burmese government, pointing out Australia's position in strong terms and requesting that the rights of Suu Kyi and members of the National League for Democracy, the NLD, be respected. It is appropriate that we have this motion today, which brings together our concern as a nation and as a parliament in relation to the developments in Burma. 
We have seen the fall in recent days of Slobodan Milosevic. It is to be hoped that in time we will see a change in the environment in Burma. The continuing infringements of human rights that exist in Burma give us all cause for concern. However, it is important to note that the only way to resolve the Burmese internal conflict is through constructive dialogue and engagement. Confrontation will achieve nothing. In particular, the government is keen to maintain a useful and constructive dialogue with Suu Kyi and her supporters. This has long been the case. Our approach to Burma arose from the abject failure of other policy options. Sanctions or similar punitive actions do not work—they get no response from the regimes concerned. You have far more chance of exerting influence if you are dealing with them at a multilateral level.
Australia is not the only country that follows this policy. The ASEAN nations are closely involved in Burma due to its active membership of that organisation. Japan and major European nations provide scholarships and training for Burmese government officials. The European Union's official position has also changed to one of engagement. There will be an EU-ASEAN ministerial meeting in Vientiane at the end of this year. The EU previously has refused to be part of such meetings due to Burma's involvement in ASEAN. The Australian government funded two human rights workshops in Rangoon in July this year. These workshops aimed to educate Burmese officials on basic human rights. Dealings with the Burmese government will not have rapid results.
It will be a long and difficult process trying to make changes to a regime such as Burma's. The government recognises this difficulty and is prepared to deal with it. It is appropriate that we should support this motion before the House. We should recognise the steps the government has taken to have an ongoing dialogue with the Burmese government. All of us in the House would want to support Suu Kyi in the problems she is having with the existing Burmese government. We condemn the action of the Burmese government in placing her under house arrest and support the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his ongoing dialogue with Burma to ensure we have some changes in the general approach taken to the Burmese government in their dealings with Suu Kyi and with her political party. I commend this motion to the House.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2000-10-09,"—On Sunday, 1 October a 12-year-old Palestinian boy, Mohammed Al-Durrah, wanted to accompany his father to a used car auction in Gaza city. He never made it home to his family. To get from their home in the Bourij refugee camp to Gaza city, Mohammed and his father had to pass through Netzarim junction. The junction is home to an Israeli army post put there to defend the Jewish settlement of Netzarim—a contentious settlement, home to some 60 Jewish families. There is no way for Palestinians who live in the Bourij refugee camp to reach Gaza city other than via this junction. It was there that Mohammed and his father became trapped in fighting between Palestinian youths and the Israeli defence force. The world has graphically witnessed what happened next. His father and young Mohammed attempted to hide behind a concrete water butt about 15 metres east of the Palestinian post. His father shouted to the Israelis to alert them `the child, the child'. They were no threat to anyone. They were unarmed. They were defenceless. They were terrified. They were shot at. Fifteen bullets hit the wall around them. The cameraman who filmed the horrific incident told the Guardian, `They were aiming at the boy and that is what surprised me, yes, because they were shooting at him, not only one time but many times.' The evidence of where the bullets hit authenticate this chilling eyewitness account. The Guardian reported: 
Aside from the circle of bullet holes—most of them below waist level—the expanse of wall is largely unscarred. This appeared to suggest that the Israeli fire was targeted at the father and son.
The young boy was hit and died in his father's arms. After this, the shooting continued. The father was shot and is in hospital. The shooting still continued. The ambulance driver was also shot dead trying to reach them. Bassam Al-Bilbays, who was riding with the ambulance, described, `There was some breath left in him when we reached the ambulance, but when we opened the doors they started shooting again.' This is the human dimension of the Middle East conflict. There can be no defence for the killing of unarmed civilians and children.
Mohammad Al-Durrah's death is not isolated. More than 80 are dead, the youngest being just two years of age. This tragedy has followed the provocative action of the leader of the Israeli opposition, Mr Ariel Sharon, in visiting Al Haram Al Sharaf accompanied by a massive military contingent. Al Haram Al Sharaf contains Al Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock, which are holy places of worship for Moslems. Such a provocative visit is consistent with Mr Sharon's views as an opponent of peace. He is the man who led the invasion of Lebanon. He stood by while Israel's right-wing allies committed massacres of thousands of women and children in Sabra and Chatilla. After an inquiry, this resulted in his resignation as defence minister. He has continued to support an expansion of settlements in the occupied territories. Fortunately, at present, he is not part of the government. Indeed, Prime Minister Ehud Barak deserves commendation for implementing UN resolution 425 and withdrawing from southern Lebanon. However, recent events have sparked a change in Israeli foreign policy. The world has watched in horror as the violence has escalated, with both sides taking increasingly hardline negotiating positions, seriously threatening the ability for the Middle East peace talks to continue.
Wars are most often started and prolonged by extremists such as Mr Sharon, by those who cannot see the world for what it is—a place where every issue is not black and white, where land is a scarce commodity and where many versions of history dictate many differing claims of ownership. Disputes over land ownership and the wars that ensue are an awful part of human history. Yet, in the 21st century, it cannot be idealistic to assume that such conflicts can now be worked out through peaceful means—via negotiation, through the moderation of both sides' claims and through an understanding of the complexities and varying versions of human history.
What is most terrifying to me about what is happening in the Middle East at the moment is that the situation is fast escalating out of rational control. In a fight for political survival in a climate ruled by fanaticism, leaders who previously spoke the language of peace find themselves in a bidding war with other influential politicians, trying to prove to extremists that they are tougher, that they are more warlike. I read with great concern reports that Mr Barak has raised the option of a national unity government similar to that which was formed during the 1967 conflict. This government could well be formed once Barak's 48-hour deadline for the release of three Israeli soldiers captured by the Hezbollah—and the Palestinians' authority to control their people—runs out. At that point, according to the internal security and acting foreign minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, Palestinian Authority Chairman Yassar Arafat will no longer be considered a peace partner by Israel.
Any national unity government would spell the end for the peace process in the Middle East. It would include the leader of the Likud, Ariel Sharon. It would be very unlikely that Sharon and the Likud would agree to be a part of any national unity government that did not scrap all concessions made by the Israelis during the most recent round of peace talks at Camp David. That would spell the end for the peace process and would be a tragedy. What makes current events all the more tragic is that much progress had been made towards peace during the Camp David discussions convened by President Clinton. 
It is understandable that Israelis desire security; the question is how this security can be achieved. Given the geography of the Middle East it is absurd to believe that security can be imposed upon the region—it can only be agreed. The provocation and excessive use of force by the Israelis has been condemned by the United Nations by a vote of the Security Council of 14 to zero with one abstention, that being the United States. Palestinian teenagers should not be throwing rocks, but the fact that they are does not justify an army shooting at unarmed civilians, using snipers, bazookas, grenades, tanks and attack helicopters. Dialogue must replace provocation and response. The Palestinians must be given their homeland. The occupation of Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem by the Israelis has created generations of oppressed people.
The Palestinians' acceptance of the 4 June 1967 borders, which constitute only 22 per cent of that which existed prior to 1948, is an extraordinary compromise in the name of peace. I have visited the beach camp in Gaza and was distressed at the conditions in which families were living. These conditions have led many young Palestinians to believe that they have nothing to lose. Today's Sydney Morning Herald quotes a 12-year-old Palestinian boy, Muhammad Rayyan:
“I wait for God to choose me,” said the boy, who has been nicknamed the Lion because of his fearlessness. When I see another fall, I am jealous. I long to be like him. This is my only goal in life.”
The ultimatum made by Prime Minister Barak, giving the Palestinians 48 hours to discipline their civilians or face war, is undermined by the failure to acknowledge the excessive force used by Israel. A helicopter gun ship is not more moral than a boy with a stone. The above quote shows that it is impossible to threaten those who believe they have nothing to lose. Peace can only occur if there is respect for human life and human rights—by all sides. I watched the Sunday program yesterday, in which Ariel Sharon defended his visit to Al Haram Al Sharaf by saying:
It's a free country, with free access.
Anyone who has been to the region would be horrified by the inequity in that statement. This is a noble principle, but it is one which certainly does not apply to Palestine. Palestinians live with restrictions every day. Gaza and the West Bank are regularly closed, preventing Palestinians from going to work, and creating a subsequent resentment. Roadblocks occur at regular intervals. The hotel in Ramallah—the City Inn where I stayed with Peter Nugent, who is presently here in the House, and also Joe Hockey, Peter McGauran and Leo McLeay—has been occupied by the Israeli defence force and used by snipers on the West Bank. Palestinians do not have equal rights in the Middle East.
On Wednesday of last week the Australian Parliamentary Friends of Palestine, of which I am secretary, held an urgent meeting to consider our response to the conflict. The Parliamentary Friends of Palestine group comprises 27 federal members of parliament, from all political parties. It is chaired by the member for Parramatta, Mr Ross Cameron, with the member for Watson, Leo McLeay, as deputy. A statement was endorsed unanimously by those at the meeting condemning the killing of unarmed civilians and children and calling for a just settlement which satisfied the legitimate aspirations of both Palestinians and Israelis to live in peace. The alternative is a disaster for all in the Middle East.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Middle East: Conflict</title>,Grievance Debate,11,1
"Worth, Trish, MP",LP,2000-10-09,"—In summing up, I would like to thank members on both sides of the chamber for their contributions to this debate on the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Bill 2000, which is about providing funds for specific purposes relating to education to enable indigenous students to achieve better educational outcomes that will ultimately lead to their better health, greater employment opportunities and economic independence. There are many other initiatives that this government is undertaking through states grants funding and other mainstream education programs which cover schools, including those with high indigenous populations.
A number of speakers have strayed from what this bill is all about and have spoken about issues of importance to indigenous Australians in a broader context. I remind members that the government is taking a whole of government approach to indigenous issues. For instance, only last Thursday, the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business announced funding of over $800,000 for eight projects which will provide indigenous Australians with employment and training positions under the Structured Training and Employment Program. This program is one of a number of initiatives in the government's indigenous employment policy which aims to generate more job opportunities for indigenous Australians across the nation in the private sector. 
The shadow minister said that he wanted to see a cooperative approach to indigenous education but then unfortunately took a political rather than cooperative approach in his remarks in this chamber. The shadow minister questioned the source of funding for this bill. I remind the shadow minister that this funding replaces the lapsing funding from a lapsing program. I further remind him that his staff have been fully briefed on this legislation by the minister's office and the relevant branch head from DETYA. The National Indigenous English Literacy and Numeracy Strategy itself is crystal clear on the source of funding. On page 15 of the strategy, it states that the government is allocating some $1.5 billion to the improvement of outcomes for indigenous students in the coming quadrennium.
This bill provides total funding of $591 million for the next quadrennium under the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program. The $27 million that the shadow minister questioned is new money which was unpacked and explained in detail at the briefing by the minister's office. The shadow minister should not pretend to be ignorant on these issues. As the honourable member would be aware, this matter was raised in the 1999-2000 Senate legislation committee budget estimates hearing under question E12 from Senator Carr. The question was answered then in detail, and the facts remain the same. I have no doubt that the shadow minister examined the Hansard of the Senate estimates. I also have no doubt that he has discussed this issue with Senator Carr, and I believe there is some claim that Senator Carr actually pulls the strings.
On the question of accountability, the government is keen to ensure that Commonwealth funds are used to improve educational outcomes for all indigenous students. The accountability measures in this bill are not about withholding money from providers who have made genuine efforts to achieve the agreed outcomes. If the opposition is going to run the line about criticising the accountability measures in this bill, it should perhaps inform the member for the Northern Territory, who quite clearly called on the government to ensure that the Northern Territory government is held accountable for Commonwealth funds. I wish to thank the member for the Northern Territory for highlighting the need for the accountability measures, thus supporting the government's initiatives in this area.
I also acknowledge the member for the Northern Territory's remarks about drug and substance abuse in indigenous communities. He is quite correct when he says that it is a problem in some communities and not in others. It is also true to say that the level of alcohol and drug abuse in the indigenous community in the Northern Territory is no worse than it is in other communities. He also correctly identified health issues, in particular ear infections. I remind him that a key part of the National Indigenous English Literacy and Numeracy Strategy relates to overcoming hearing, health and nutritional problems. I further remind him that, since 1996, 38 new sites have been approved for additional primary health care services under the remote communities initiative. These sites are in areas that previously had little or no access to services. Importantly also, the relevant antibiotics to treat middle ear infections are now more readily available through remote areas of Australia—another good decision from this government.
The opposition's suggestion that it is the government's intention to unreasonably withhold funds is misleading. Where performance improvements for indigenous students cannot be demonstrated in the annual reporting of outcomes against the performance indicators of the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program, the Commonwealth will require more detailed plans to demonstrate how those goals will be attained. The accountability measures are not designed to be punitive measures; they are designed to ensure improved outcomes for indigenous students. Each breach of agreement will be treated on its merits. Let me reassure the shadow minister that there is a dispute resolution mechanism outlined in the administrative guidelines and that regular meetings are held between all providers and the Commonwealth. All of the processes are designed to secure the continuation of funding to education providers where this would be appropriate. Many of these providers would not be viable without the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program funding. 
Members on both sides of the House have spoken about the importance of linguistic and cultural heritage. The government agrees that this is an extremely important priority for indigenous Australians. For example, the performance targets agreed between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory Department of Education under the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program agreements include several that focus on expanding culturally inclusive curricula in preschools and schools. The Commonwealth has approved performance targets in past and present agreements that aim to increase the number of preschools and schools that offer indigenous languages and indigenous studies across the Northern Territory.
As I have already commented, the Commonwealth's supplementary recurrent assistance supports the inclusion of culturally appropriate curricula and teaching methods. We believe that all learning for indigenous students should be appropriate to their needs. This would therefore logically include teaching indigenous young people in their own languages, where they use them, and in their own culture. It has been put to me by indigenous people that they themselves must be the ones to teach indigenous language and culture, because Australia-wide more than 100 languages are spoken. For example, around Alice Springs, there are six main languages spoken but there are 18 different dialects spoken. It has been further put to me that the Pitjantjatjara people in South Australia were concerned where language was taught by outsiders because it was not the same language as the one traditionally spoken and grandparents, for instance, could not understand their grandchildren. As recently as last Saturday, the Kaurna people, on whose traditional lands Adelaide is built, told me that across Australia there are approximately 250 different cultures. So the emphasis must be on young people being taught their culture and their language within their own community.
In addition to this generally and broadly targeted approach, the Commonwealth does make a number of specific contributions to innovative attempts to introduce new ways of delivering these culturally appropriate and inclusive teaching strategies. For example, the Commonwealth has made a financial contribution to the highly successful Croc Eisteddfods for the past several years. At the Weipa North State School, a number of teaching units were developed to use the Croc Eisteddfod as a means of making key learning areas of the arts more relevant to students' needs. The same approaches were successfully utilised at the Jessica Point State School, also at Weipa. Many schools use the Croc Eisteddfod as a curriculum aid and to showcase indigenous culture. These approaches are reported to have led to increases in school attendance rates.
Questions have also been asked about the guidelines and, as Dr Kemp explained in a letter to the shadow minister, a copy of the guidelines will be provided as soon as they are available. The guidelines and indigenous education agreements are being finalised at the moment. The guidelines will provide the detailed requirements of the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program, including the away from home based component, in the same way as they currently do under the Commonwealth programs for schools quadrennium administrative guidelines. The shadow minister has claimed that the government is reducing information available to the public and raises concerns about transparency and accountability. This is simply not the case. There is no intention to reduce publicly available information. The guidelines will be sent to all providers and be made available to all interested parties once they are finalised. They will be both on the Internet and in published form. 
Questions have arisen about Abstudy changes. These changes incorporate many new entitlements which specifically assist students who are aged 21 or over. Up to 60 per cent may gain access for the first time to mainstream related entitlements such as rent assistance, remote area allowance and pharmaceutical allowance. In recognition of their particular circumstances, tertiary Abstudy students who are 21 years of age or older receive a higher rate of living allowance than Austudy recipients. They can access mainstream related benefits, which Austudy students cannot, and retain access to supplementary Abstudy benefits which address specific disadvantages.
Continuing students aged 21 years or more in receipt of Abstudy living allowance, who did not receive as high a level of overall benefit in 2000, will be maintained at the 1999 rate of living allowance until the completion of their current course. Similarly, pensioner education supplement recipients will be maintained at 1999 levels until the completion of their current course. Eligibility for travel assistance is less restrictive under Abstudy than it is for receipt of the youth allowance and Austudy. Abstudy recipients are eligible for income support for a longer time than under the youth allowance or Austudy. Under mainstream programs, courses are grouped in four tiers: certificate, associate diploma, undergraduate and postgraduate. Generally, students are only entitled to assistance to study one course in any tier. Abstudy recipients are eligible for assistance for an unlimited number of courses, except at the bachelor and higher degree levels. The independence criterion for students under 25 years of age under Abstudy is more generous than the youth allowance in terms of de facto relationships and lawful custody. Importantly, Abstudy takes cultural differences into account.
Some members mentioned the Collins report. The Commonwealth is maintaining its commitment to indigenous education in the Northern Territory, following release late last year of the Learning lessons report by former senator Bob Collins. Dr Kemp met with Denis Burke, Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, in November last year to discuss the Collins review. It was then agreed that a joint working group be established to ensure that the most effective strategies are put in place to bring about far better educational outcomes for indigenous Territorians.
The member for Dobell spoke at length about the lack of parliamentary scrutiny. I would like to inform the member that selected performance information collected through the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program for the school sector is already published annually in the national report on schooling. Also, aggregated performance for the VET sector is available through the National Centre for Vocational Education Research. In terms of financial accountability, the annual report, Senate estimates and questions on notice already provide a forum for public scrutiny and accountability. It is important to say what this bill does do. The bill is a vehicle for the government's indigenous education targeted funding program for the 2001-04 quadrennium. The bill will replace the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989.
While the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000, which has already been debated in this House, provides Commonwealth funding for the education of all Australian students, the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Bill 2000 provides additional funding for supplementary education programs designed to assist education providers to improve educational outcomes for indigenous students. The bill will operate on a quadrennial basis, in line with the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000, commencing 1 January 2001. It will provide some $591 million in grants to indigenous education providers in the states and territories over the quadrennium. This funding affirms the commitment of the Howard government to indigenous education in Australia.
Australia's indigenous population comprises about two per cent of the population. The indigenous population is comparatively young. The importance of this bill is highlighted when we consider that, according to the 1996 census, 70 per cent of indigenous Australians are under the age of 25 years. In 1999, there were some 107,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in school out of the total school population of about 3.2 million. The bill will implement the 1999-2000 budget initiatives for indigenous education, including the Commonwealth priorities to improve literacy, numeracy and attendance outcomes for indigenous students. The bill will provide for payments to be made under the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program during the period 1 January 2001 to 30 June 2005 to maintain Commonwealth effort in improving educational outcomes for indigenous Australians. The bill will also provide for the continuation for the 2001-2004 period of the away from base element of Abstudy for providers delivering Abstudy approved courses by mixed mode course delivery. 
Under the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program the bill will allow for supplementary recurrent funding and funding for specific projects. Specifically, this bill provides funds for the National Indigenous English Literacy and Numeracy Strategy, which was launched by the Prime Minister in March of this year. The objective of the strategy is to achieve English literacy and numeracy for indigenous students at a level comparable to those achieved by other young Australians. The strategy is a blueprint to lift school attendance rates, address health problems that undermine learning, attract and retain good teachers and use the most effective teaching methods to obtain successful results for indigenous students.
The strategy encompasses the involvement of local communities, schools, parents, teachers and students, cooperative action between the Commonwealth and the states and territories, and coordinated action with the Commonwealth government across relevant portfolios. The strategy is designed to implement national goals agreed to by the Commonwealth, state and territory education ministers in relation to literacy and schooling: that all children leaving primary school should be numerate, able to read, write and spell at an appropriate level and that every child commencing school from 1998 will achieve a minimum acceptable literacy and numeracy standard within four years.
The strategy objectives will be achieved by lifting school attendance rates of indigenous students to national levels, effectively addressing hearing, health and nutritional problems that undermine learning for a large proportion of indigenous students, providing preschooling opportunities wherever possible, training sufficient numbers of teachers to be effective in indigenous communities and schools and encouraging them to remain for reasonable periods of time, using teaching methods that are known to be the most effective and establishing transparent measures of success as a basis for accountability for schools and teachers. The National Indigenous English Literacy and Numeracy Strategy has the support of the indigenous community. Dr Evelyn Scott, Chairperson of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, said:
The strategy aims to overcome educational disadvantages suffered by Indigenous children in a culturally sensitive and respectful way.
Geoff Clark, Chairman of ATSIC, said:
The national Indigenous English and numeracy strategy is a major step towards achieving equality of education for indigenous and non-indigenous students. I therefore pledge ATSIC's full support for the strategy and hope that ATSIC and the government can work more closely together to achieve the common agenda of a better educated indigenous community.
The strategy is supported by 16 indigenous ambassadors, who are all achievers and role models in their respective fields—such as education, sport, medicine and the media—and have links with indigenous communities throughout the country. These ambassadors are spokespeople for the strategy throughout Australia. They include Nathan Blacklock, Jimmy Little and May O'Brien. All young people need good role models, and I am sure these ambassadors will help to influence indigenous people in a positive way. Only last week after winning a gold medal at the Olympics our latest heroine Cathy Freeman again visited Redfern to, as she said, do something positive by offering some inspiration to the young people there. Often we tend to talk about the things that indigenous people do not achieve, rather than focusing on what they have achieved. We need to change these negative perceptions. The example and leadership of these ambassadors will help to change the culture of the way that indigenous people see themselves. 
The strategy is being developed through implementation plans in each state and territory. There are some great news stories which I wish I had time to inform the House about and they are encouraging. Of course, there is still so much more to be done. But we now know what does work. Success is always characterised by culturally inclusive curriculum, the participation of the indigenous community in decision making and the employment of indigenous staff. Because this level of educational inequality has persisted for so long, there is a strong perception in some quarters of the Australian community that the issue of educational equality for indigenous people is too hard and not achievable. That is simply not true. (Extension of time granted) I thank the shadow minister. I was simply making the point that we need to take a more positive approach. We have worked together. Equality can be achieved. Over recent years there has been a considerable amount of work undertaken across Australia to identify the critical issues and actions required. We now know what that is. We have the tools available to markedly accelerate the achievement of educational equality over the next four years with this bill. It is with a great deal of national goodwill that we are now on a pathway of hope.

"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,2000-10-09,"—The Criminal Code Amendment (Theft, Fraud, Bribery and Related Offences) Bill 1999 is legislation long in the gestation but rewarding nonetheless for the way in which it ultimately has come before this House—with the support of both the government and the opposition. Its genesis was the decision of the former Labor government to move towards establishing a uniform criminal code to apply across all jurisdictions. The first stage, the general principles of criminal responsibility, was passed in 1995. It regrettably has not formed the basis thus far of a common approach between the Commonwealth and the states; rather, it has simply been a framework which has been adopted to simplify and codify the provisions of the criminal law with respect to Commonwealth matters. But it has continued within a framework of consultative arrangements for the states, and the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee has continued to work towards producing a body of criminal law which would not only serve as a suitable body of legislation to govern criminal law offences for the Commonwealth but also be a benchmark or a template for similar legislation to be passed in the states so that, ultimately, there could be a single criminal law applying in all jurisdictions with common principles of criminal responsibility and, as far as possible, common criminal offences.
As I have indicated, thus far that has not come to pass. Perhaps because of the fact that it has not been picked up as one hoped in the early stages, some of the impetus towards dealing with these matters in the most prompt of ways has perhaps slipped. Nonetheless, the work that has been done in producing this legislation is extremely important. It inserts new provisions of the Commonwealth criminal law with respect to theft, fraud, bribery and related offences, it inserts some new provisions in relation to general principles of criminal responsibility and it includes offences relating to infrastructure—postal and communications services. These provisions, which will now be contained in the criminal code, replace a plethora of offences that used to be scattered in some 250 different offence provisions in other pieces of Commonwealth legislation. So, whilst the legislation itself is not without its complexities, it is considerably more simple and more streamlined than the scheme that previously existed. Reading the legislation, you will find reference to a wide range of different pieces of legislation which are being amended. Essentially, those amendments are included because they take away from those specific pieces of legislation provisions that used to be in those particular pieces of legislation and bring them back under the general provisions in this criminal legislation which is now provided for in the code.
When the government received the report of the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee, they quite properly produced an exposure draft and then legislation, and the Minister for Justice and Customs, taking the request that I made of her, decided to refer the legislation to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. That was a good decision of the minister because it meant that the legislation had the opportunity of careful examination by this House's committee. The committee brought forward an advisory report in June this year, unanimously agreed by all its members. In turn, the government have responded to that report in a generous spirit by adopting almost all of the provisions that were recommended by way of the changes in that report. I understand the government are moving a series of amendments which will adopt and implement those recommendations.
The point we have reached essentially is that, from a decision of the previous Labor government to try to establish a criminal code that would apply uniformly across Australia, we have not made much progress but we have made continuing progress in simplifying and developing a criminal code which replaces the very scrappy arrangements that were in place with offences contained in myriad different pieces of legislation with a single Commonwealth criminal code which will provide general principles of criminal responsibility and will define clearly what is against the law so far as offences committed against the Commonwealth. It certainly does do some important things. For example, these provisions, which go to theft, fraud, bribery and related offences, provide additional protection for Commonwealth public officials from violence and harassment through new offences based on chapter 5 of the model criminal code, they introduce offences designed to protect postal and communications services, they repeal offences in existing legislation and insert more general provisions in relation to the code, they ensure that the geographical jurisdiction of the Commonwealth in relation to Commonwealth criminal law offences is clarified, they introduce comprehensive legislation covering theft, fraud, bribery, forgery and related offences based on chapter 3 of the model criminal code and they, in combination, simplify and reduce the size of the Commonwealth statute book in accordance with the 1990-91 recommendations of the review of Commonwealth criminal law. 
So I do want to say that the opposition is pleased that this has been an exercise which, although slow, has remained one where the government has been willing to work with the opposition in order to bring forward legislation which will pass this parliament with a minimum of controversy, and that is very important when we are actually dealing with criminal law provisions. From time to time there will be spirited disagreement in this House on matters of great importance, but it would be a real matter of regret if we were to have significant disagreements regarding principles and practices in relation to the criminal law—because that, after all, is one of the fundamental areas where the Australian community would expect us to strive to find common ground. It would not be an area where the community would be happy if we were taking partisan points in relation to those matters.
While I am making some remarks with respect to the cooperative approach of the minister in relation to this I should also mention Geoffrey McDonald, who is sitting on the advisers box. He has played a significant role from the very early days of the development of this code, in different roles at different times, and gave the substantive evidence that was received by the committee on behalf of the department. Without his work and without the substantial work of a number of other very dedicated public servants in the department and those from the other jurisdictions who have served in the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee we would not have had this constructive approach and substantive outcome. There is a willingness too often to denigrate the work of those in public employment, and those who have at different times worked on the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee really do deserve very substantial recognition. They come from not only the Commonwealth but also state jurisdictions across Australia.
My only criticism, I suppose—if one can make a criticism—is that thus far they have not been able to excite the imagination of their Attorneys to pick up some of the recommendations and to move towards a situation where we are actually able to have common approaches to the criminal law. It still strikes me as a matter of real regret that that agenda has really yet to be picked up in a substantive way. We have made some gains in the area of evidence, where the Commonwealth, New South Wales and the ACT have a common approach in relation to the evidence laws. Of course, there is substantial ground to be made up with the other jurisdictions, but at least a substantial component of the Australian jurisprudential entity adopts common evidential law approaches.
But we have not made up that ground with respect to the criminal law. That is a matter of real regret, because we now have, instead of a more uniform approach, perhaps an even more disparate approach, where we have the states that operate under the Griffith code and we have the common law jurisdictions, which operate without any regard to a statutory base, except in some particular areas, and where the principles of criminal responsibility differ from those applying in the Griffith code states, Tasmania, Western Australia and Queensland. Now we have the Commonwealth statutory approach, which was intended to be able to be picked up by both code and common law jurisdictions alike, where we have a codified system that is essentially picking up the principles that apply in the common law jurisdictions. 
One could only say the effort has been intense. The work has been laboured and long. The Commonwealth code is perhaps not an approach that everyone would wish if they started from scratch to adopt. People of good will can say that there are benefits with code approaches or common law approaches or what have you, but we should not be too precious about this. There is really no reason why a citizen of Australia in New South Wales should have totally different principles of criminal responsibility applied to him or her than a citizen residing in Queensland. It is perverse that a citizen who is charged in, for example, Tasmania—a Griffith code state—under a state law will be judged under completely different principles of criminal responsibility than the same citizen if charged under a Commonwealth offence, where essentially, although statutory, common law principles of criminal responsibility apply.
So there are real reasons why this government needs to get cracking with continuing the legislative reform program and bringing in more and more bills to eventually have a comprehensive and complete Commonwealth criminal code. I think we are substantially down that track now. There are a few areas that are yet to be addressed in this parliamentary way, but very substantial components of Commonwealth law are now codified and part of the criminal code. I think the task now for government is to really sit down and see whether they can revitalise the path towards more common approaches between the national and state jurisdictions. If we fail to do that, then not only will we have failed to move along a path which is in the national interest but we may have actually made the situation rather more complicated than it was before we started, which would be a terrible outcome for such a large amount of effort. There is really no reason why state jurisdictions should not pick this up. They have been engaged in this process right from the start in a cooperative way, and the work of their solicitors-general and officers who have been engaged in this process has been very valuable indeed.
I turn to the measures that are here before us and to the amendments. I referred previously to the report that went to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs because of the legal complexity of the bill and the seriousness of these matters. The committee made five recommendations for amendment to the bill, and the government has accepted four of those recommendations. I understand that in the consideration in detail stage the government will be moving amendments which will achieve the following. Firstly, they will remove the offence of organised fraud. That is consistent with the fact that it was not recommended by the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee. There are other fraud offences which exist and which can be utilised to trigger the operation of forfeiture provisions under the Proceeds of Crimes Act. The provision is not needed and has been removed consistent with the recommendations of the committee. There is now provided a defence for the offence of providing false or misleading information—the offences contained in section 137(1). That will cover situations where people would not consider that in providing false information they may be committing criminal offences. There will need to be proven an element of dishonesty in relation to the offence of giving information derived from false documents, and a technical provision that would have made it very difficult to prove the offence of burglary—that they be aware that a property that belongs to the Commonwealth—has been removed. After all, somebody who breaks into particular premises and steals something is not likely to direct their mind to who the legal owner of that property was. The mere fact that the property is stolen should activate the offence. You do not need to actually know that when you were stealing a computer it was the property of the Commonwealth as opposed to the property of a private corporation or some other individual. The government has agreed to those changes and will be moving a number of consequential and other amendments which the opposition has agreed to. 
The one area that therefore remains and on which the government is not moving amendments is the offence of general dishonesty. The Model Criminal Code Officers Committee recommended that there be no offence of general dishonesty chargeable under the criminal code. The government rejected that recommendation, and we heard evidence from Mr McDonald and others, including the DPP, going to the reasons the government had rejected that recommendation. Although you can argue this both ways, you can certainly see the merit of the original position taken by the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee. On balance, the opposition is persuaded that the government is correct to retain and to include in the code an offence of general dishonesty. However, we were very concerned that that offence of general dishonesty, which carries a substantial penalty—imprisonment for five years—as a consequence, might be misused if there were no clear guidelines established by the Director of Public Prosecutions as to when that offence could be utilised. Why is this important? It is because, unlike most situations, where the normal prosecution policy of the Commonwealth would provide that, all things being equal, the Commonwealth would charge the most serious of matters which are revealed by the evidence, it would not be appropriate in most situations to charge the general offence of dishonesty, which carries this very high penalty, if there were more appropriate specific offences available to it. So we were reluctant to agree as a committee to the government proceeding with a general dishonesty offence unless there was clarification as to the basis upon which the DPP would charge, and deal with the laying of charges, under that provision.
On 26 September, I received a letter from the minister which indicated that it would not be necessary for the opposition to move amendments in relation to this provision—we had foreshadowed that we would be moving amendments which would have meant that this provision would not come into effect until we had actually seen the guidelines that the DPP was going to apply. The letter said that the DPP had now directed its attention to this matter and had prepared draft guidelines that would be put in place when this legislation came into effect. To put the matter beyond all doubt, I seek leave of the minister to table the letter and the guidelines rather than read them into Hansard.
Leave granted.
—The key part of the guidelines is this:
Where the alleged conduct constitutes both an offence of obtaining property or a financial advantage by deception and an offence of general dishonesty ordinarily the appropriate course will be to charge the relevant “obtaining” offence rather than the offence of general dishonesty.
It goes on to say:
In some cases, however, it may be appropriate to proceed instead on a charge of general dishonesty notwithstanding that the available evidence would support charges of an obtaining offence. For example, a fraudulent scheme consists of numerous instances of obtaining property by deception each of which, when taken individually, may be relatively minor but when added together may amount to a serious fraud. In some cases it may not be possible to proceed, if the matter is to be defended, as to do so may overload the indictment. On the other hand, if the prosecution were to proceed on only representative charges the likely penalty in the event the convictions were secured may be quite inadequate. In such cases it may be appropriate to proceed on a single charge of general dishonesty provided the maximum penalty for that offence (5 years imprisonment) would provide the court with an appropriate basis for sentence.
There are a number of other instances which the DPP adverts to that may be exceptional, but I think that clarifies the way in which this will operate. I regard this as very important and see it as a matter of some regret that the DPP did not find it within its capacity to come back to the committee while the committee was in session with a draft that the committee could have had a look at. I appreciate that the DPP may be strongly anxious to secure its independence and not be subject to any perception that it is responding to a political agenda, but all I can say is that the parliament's responsibility to make sure that the legislative framework for the establishment, definition and administration of the criminal law is a proper one for it to exercise. It was not at all improper for the committee to insist on its entitlements to see how this matter would be administered. The DPP's task in that regard has now been properly addressed and I accept the minister's assurance in her letter of 26 September that these guidelines will address the concerns of the standing committee. 
Finally, I might indicate that, since the committee's consideration of this legislation, one other matter has come to our attention which we will be addressing through subsequent amendments. I will speak at more length when we get to the consideration in detail stage, but there are provisions in the code which deal with personation or impersonation of Commonwealth officials. It suddenly struck the opposition that we were about to make the kind of conduct engaged in by Campbell McComas and John Clarke, satirists and comedians, potentially liable to very substantial periods of imprisonment. So we will be proposing—
—and we understand that the government will be accepting—although the backbench revolt may be on, from what I see—that the impersonation offences do not cover conduct engaged in for satirical purposes. Of course this government's sensitivity to criticism is well known—and perhaps the backbench will somehow force a different outcome—but I understand from the minister's advisers that, however reluctantly, they will concede to the wisdom of that particular course.
Might I say in conclusion that in half an hour it is impossible to canvass all of the substantive provisions included in this legislation. I have spoken about the general objective of trying to obtain a code which simplifies Commonwealth criminal law and also which can ultimately provide a framework for consistency of criminal law across this country. I have also addressed some of the areas where there were disagreements in discussions in the committee and where we were the beneficiaries of evidence from the department. I suspect that, as a result of that, those who read this debate will not really pick up on the substantive significance of all the provisions that are actually in this legislation.
It is very comprehensive legislation and it provides a well thought through scheme for dealing with some of the more difficult issues the Commonwealth has to address in the criminal law area. Some of the jurisdictional questions are complex, interesting and technical but also very cleverly thought through, as this parliament should recognise. The provisions that go to theft, fraud and the other offences against the Commonwealth are well crafted. They replace provisions which were scattered throughout the legislation and which were not nearly as effective as these should be. The provisions that go towards protection of Commonwealth officers in the carriage of their responsibilities also warrant the support of this parliament.
So I am pleased, on behalf of the opposition, to be able to say that in the end this parliament operated as it should—that is, legislation or an approach put forward by a previous government was not overturned. If it was considered an appropriate course to follow by the succeeding government, they built on that base. When we became the opposition we also adopted a responsible approach to the measures that the government put forward. These measures have been examined critically but with good faith by a committee of this House. I think that is important because so often this House abdicates its responsibility for examination of legislation and says, `The Senate is going to have a look at this.'
On this occasion the House gave the legislation careful and thoughtful consideration and I think did the job competently and in a way which will facilitate its passage through the Senate with a minimum of disruption. I think it is a useful thing for this House and its committees to play their part properly. Everybody in this process has come out well. The only thing is that they have come out of it awfully slowly. I would like us to crank this up a few notches in terms of commitment to an objective of getting national legislation or a national approach because I think we are on the threshold of losing that agenda which was agreed upon. If we do not start to reinvigorate it soon, the chances of gaining that ultimate outcome seem to me to be in danger of slipping away entirely.

"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,2000-10-09,"—I am always pleased to join a debate which has at its heart a definite concern for the people of Australia to get a good outcome and I welcome the commitment from the member for Denison on behalf of Her Majesty's opposition to that cause. I note the comment and concern about impersonators and those engaging in satire and note there is always a deal of tongue in cheek exchanged on both sides of the House as each call the other all sorts of things in a satirical way. However, I genuinely concede that the member for Denison is quite right that both sides of parliament do knuckle down and get a lot of good work done at the committee level. I also welcome the fact that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has done some work on the Criminal Code Amendment (Theft, Fraud, Bribery and Related Offences) Bill 1999. The government amendments to this bill that have been foreshadowed show that there has been a great team spirit shown in getting a good result. 
I draw the line though at the question of national legislation being the absolute answer. I still firmly believe, as a federalist, that it is important that we promote the best ideas from each of the states but trying to get each of the other states to then adopt them is, of course, the difficulty. We still have three different railway gauges in this country. Unfortunately, each of the fiefdoms that have been established over the 100 years since Federation are maintained by the current crop of state governments. One of the major preoccupations of the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice in this country has been to sit down with their counterparts in the state jurisdictions and try to get some results and some sort of consistency. The fact that people can be tried, sentenced and receive different penalties for the same types of crimes in different jurisdictions is something that frustrates all of us law-abiding citizens. 
The effort demonstrated in this legislation of drawing together all the various elements from a variety of Commonwealth acts leads the way again and shows the states what they themselves should be trying to do; that is, simplifying and putting matters back in the hands of the courts and, through the courts, the people of Australia and not just leaving them in the hands of the criminal elements who have been using all the complexities and wizardries of the legal process to basically get away with murder—although the matters contained in this legislation deal with theft, fraud, bribery and related offences. I welcome this bill which is about focusing the resources of the federal government into various ways of tackling fraud, and that in itself would be welcomed and expected by the people of Australia.
I bring to this debate a non-lawyer's perspective; hence, my enunciated frustrations about the slowness of the process of getting some consistency across the various agencies of government and not just the various state governments and the federal government in themselves. Against that particular background, I am a bit frustrated that the Australian Securities and Investment Commission will not see fit to investigate an organisation in this nation over which there are some horrendous allegations still hanging, and that is the Australian Natural Therapists Association Ltd. The members of this association have had reason to contact me because they cannot, through the usual channels, get the sort of investigation they believe should be undertaken into that organisation. It is quite surprising to me that ASIC have adopted a view that the governance of the organisation is in the hands of elected representatives—read the board of that particular organisation—therefore, if the majority of members are happy to continue to run things the way they currently do, then there is no reason why ASIC should get involved.
The reason I draw this to the attention of the House tonight is that the allegations which overhang this particular organisation and a number of its elected officials certainly do involve potential theft and fraud; in fact, allegations of $600,000 worth of theft and fraud. ANTA began life back in the late 1970s as a result of a merger of a number of professional associations in this particular area. It was one of the few large enough to afford a full-time public officer. Its first executive director, Robert Zindler, set about making ANTA the most well-known and respected professional association in this particular industry. His aggressive but prudent administration ensured that ANTA traded with a profit each and every financial year. The net profit was then saved in a deposit account as an emergency fund.  
But now we have an organisation which is under a siege mentality and, as a consequence, any misdeeds, accidents and activity perceived as generating adverse publicity have been routinely swept under the carpet for fear that it may bring the entire natural medicine area into some sort of disrepute and provide ammunition for its detractors. But I think the time has come for this organisation to back up the professional natural health providers in this country and actually come clean on the matters I would like to detail to the House.  
In October 1992, Mr Zindler basically was fired. The executive council of ANTA dispensed with his services, and after nearly 15 years he was summarily dismissed. Within hours, the then president arrived at Zindler's home with a pantechnicon and team of removalists. The entire contents of the ANTA office were then packed up and speeded to Adelaide. According to the annual financial report covering July 1992 to June 1993, ANTA suffered an unprecedented financial turnaround. Saving the cost of an administrator and under the direct personal control of the then president, in barely eight months they spent all of that year's normal operating allocation, the accumulated past profits and a further $58,500, resulting in a net trading loss—after 15 years—for the year of just under $140,000. This situation was sustained with additional losses being incurred in subsequent years. 
In 1995, it was decided to separate the national office from the president's office, and the first national office was established in Sydney. But, with the appointment of a new administrator, the national office was moved to Caloundra on Queensland's wonderful Sunshine Coast. Caloundra may not be the commercial hub of Australia but it was within five minutes of the administrator's home so there was a deal of common sense with this particular move. With that move, the annual accounts were audited by somebody else. The auditing firm advised the then current board of directors that ANTA was technically insolvent and possibly in breach of national corporate law.
The then treasurer, who was a constituent of mine, invited a firm of accountants to address the directors. They advised that, with prudent administration, no loss of membership and a revision of expenses, it should be possible to trade back to a profitable position in two or three years. It was explained to the directors at the time that, if they elected to pursue this course, they were personally accepting financial responsibility beyond the guarantee provided with membership. The auditors also pointed out that since 1993 the audit of accounts had been conducted under instructions of the directors at the minimum requirement only. Trading accounts had not been audited since 1992, and each set of financial accounts had specifically contained a disclaimer by the auditors to this effect, although copies of trading accounts had been included with each annual report and supplied to members.
In 1997 the then treasurer raised embarrassing questions regarding all the previous years activities. He demanded details of expenditure from past presidents and refused to pay any additional claims until satisfactory answers had been received. The president of the day resigned and a new president was appointed pro tem and subsequently elected. The treasurer commenced legal action against the immediate past president for recovery of significant payments. During this time, the treasurer's position came up for re-election but he did not survive. ANTA then passed a resolution to drop the lawsuit and let bygones be bygones. In early 1999 the new president was provided summaries of both of the old presidents' expenses. Some of the items suggested that all was not well or accurate, and she attempted to reopen the issue of moneys believed to have been improperly paid. The national council's response was to launch a campaign against the president, ultimately providing a vote of no confidence. The federal secretary had previously resigned in frustration. 
In a last-ditch effort to draw the attention of the general membership of ANTA to what had appeared to be a series of serious crimes, mismanagement and cavalier disregard for general membership rights, the ex-secretary and the ex-treasurer called for an extraordinary general meeting, posing motions for the establishment of an arms-length independent investigation into the association's accounts between 1992 and 1998. In response, the national council called for a second extraordinary general meeting to express a vote of no confidence in the president and have her removed from office. The national council and the administrator decided to conduct these particular extraordinary general meetings back to back on an early August Friday evening at Caloundra. Caloundra is not exactly the easiest place to get to on a Friday night from all around Australia, so postal votes and proxies were the order of the day. Surprise, surprise, very few members attended these two extraordinary general meetings, and the few who did came armed with proxies. It should come as no surprise that the issues of the first meeting calling for an investigation were roundly defeated and `in the interests of harmony' a decision was taken that there would be no further investigations of past actions of presidents or any other office bearers. Likewise, it would come as no surprise that the motions of the second meeting were equally successful in passing a vote of no confidence and removing the president, who was trying to do something about what had happened, from her elected position. This organisation has had no president for some 12 months. It was due to have a scheduled meeting last month, but my informants are not really all that certain as to whether or not a new president has been elected.
What I am describing here are matters that have basically been swept way under the carpet. If I were a member of ANTA, I would want to know exactly where those hundreds of thousands of dollars went—not what they were allegedly spent on but who actually got the money. I would want to know exactly why the membership numbers increased by more than 34 per cent in less than six years but the revenue only increased by one per cent in the same period. I would want to know exactly why in 1998-99, with more members to support, a rented office to support and a full-time administrator, it costs so much less than it did in 1993 and in 1994, when there was no paid administrator, no national office and a smaller membership to service. For discussion at the first extraordinary meeting, the past treasurer and secretary put these and 18 other specific questions to the national council. If I were a member of ANTA, I would want real answers to them all, not the Yes, Minister whitewash provided. If I were a member of ANTA, I would demand a clear statement regarding its current financial position because there are now none of the original directors in place. Are the new directors actually prepared to accept the personal responsibility for trading out of the insolvency this organisation now finds itself in? This is a crucial question that needs to be answered.
I raise these issues in the context of the debate on this bill because I believe it actually shows the sorts of measures that we as a Commonwealth government and a parliament should be concerned about. It has been a mixture of apathy and little or no detail that has allowed these circumstances to unfold. I am told there are something like 1,500 members of this organisation around Australia. This organisation had a huge bank account which is now essentially gone and no-one, certainly not a majority of them, seems to be all that interested in pursuing the matter, hence the apathy reason. I think also there have been a number of deliberate attempts to try to excuse it, forget it and put it all behind us. But again, if I were a member of that organisation, I would be deliberately concerned that my membership fees to the organisation had been squandered by someone.
The questions lie with the president who existed in that organisation in the early 1990s. Rather than trying her here in this place, I think I have laid out rather well the matters which I believe should be investigated. But what I find extraordinary, as I said in my opening remarks, is that an organisation like ASIC is saying that, because of the multi jurisdictions involved—that is, the then president is from South Australia, the national office at the time of the offences was in Sydney and the new national office is in Queensland—there is some difficulty in fully investigating these matters. I find that in itself passing strange at the very least, because one would have thought in a Commonwealth sense, in a Federation sense, that crossing various borders should not have been a difficulty for ASIC or any other authority. 
It is a matter of grave concern to me that so much money could literally disappear and that so many people have allowed this to occur. I raise this issue because I know there are eight people who have been intimately involved with this organisation. Some are constituents of mine, others are associates of constituents of mine. I must say, based on meetings and discussions I have had with them and material that has been brought to my attention, I am well satisfied that there are sufficient questions which need to be answered and that this matter needed to be raised here this evening. I would be optimistic that, as a result of the credentials of these people and people in the industry in general—and they well understand the series of facts outlined here today—more of those questions that have failed to be answered so far will be asked in the future. So when one looks at the bill before us and considers the prevailing mood of bipartisan support for the effort to crack down on theft, bribery and related offences, I believe what has happened in the organisation of ANTA is a ready example of the timeliness and importance of these sorts of matters. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,"<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (THEFT, FRAUD, BRIBERY AND RELATED OFFENCES) BILL 1999</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2000-10-09,"—The Criminal Code Amendment (Theft, Fraud, Bribery and Related Offences) Bill 1999 is part of a process commenced by Lionel Bowen as Attorney-General in 1987 and aimed at creating a uniform criminal code for all Australian jurisdictions. This extensive process has included a number of reports being issued by a committee chaired by the former Chief Justice of Australia, Sir Harry Gibbs, and also a number of reports and discussion papers issued by the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. One chapter of the model criminal code arising from this process has already been enacted by the Commonwealth and additional chapters dealing with slavery and sexual servitude and the bribery of foreign public officials have also been enacted. It needs to be noted that as yet no state or territory has enacted companion legislation to the first chapter of the model criminal code that has already been passed into law.
This bill represents the next stage in the process and creates a model criminal code dealing with theft, fraud and bribery matters. It needs to be noted that this bill has gone for consideration to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and that the committee reported on this bill in June this year. On any view, the process so far has been extensive, starting as it does way back in 1987, but it needs to be noted that this is a difficult area of reform. After all, there is no more important question than defining by what laws we as a society will determine conduct is criminal. This area raises all of the fundamental questions about individual rights, collective rights and what norms and behaviours our society will insist on and enforce. Coupled with the complexity and importance of the area is the difficulty of getting and maintaining intergovernmental agreement and cooperation. Despite having all of these hurdles to clear, the goal of having a comprehensible and comprehensive criminal code which defines rights and obligations for all Australians is worth striving for. 
It is important to note at this point that even with a comprehensible and comprehensive criminal code our criminal law system can only really function if people get appropriate and timely legal advice. In the case of Dietrich v. The Queen, the High Court held that, unless exceptional circumstances exist, where a genuinely poverty-stricken person is tried for a serious offence, the trial will be considered unfair and should not proceed if the person is not represented by a lawyer. This is an eminently fair conclusion. Persons should not face the potential of being jailed without having access to legal advice, and a poor person should not be left standing without representation just because they lack the means to pay. Put another way: a rich accused person should not be in a fundamentally different position from a poor accused person—our justice system should be about guilt or innocence, not wealth or poverty.  
Yet the current situation with legal aid means that, increasingly, our justice system is about wealth, not guilt or innocence. In Victoria our legal system is labouring under a $5 million cut in legal aid funds which has occurred during the period of the Howard government. In addition to this savage cutback, the Howard government is responsible for causing continued uncertainty about the future of community legal aid centres. These centres are huge providers of legal assistance to those who cannot pay for private legal representation. As well as conducting actual legal matters on behalf of people who need assistance, these centres also conduct vital community education functions for those who are having some intersection with the legal system whether it be a family law matter or one of the more simple criminal law matters such as a traffic offence. 
I refer in that regard to my local legal service, the Werribee Legal Service, which is conducting its annual general meeting on Wednesday night. The work that this service performs with very limited funding and staffing is truly miraculous. The Werribee Legal Service has on staff the equivalent of 1.8 full-time staff. For the rest of the work that it does it requires the good will and the participation of volunteers. In a loaves and fishes trick, the service manages to convert the equivalent of 1.8 full-time staff hours into the following results: according to the mandatory performance indicators generated by the National Information Scheme, the Werribee Legal Service provided legal advice in the last financial year to at least 622 clients, involving 699 face-to-face advice sessions. The legal service opened 465 new cases, closed 449 cases and at the end of the financial year had 447 clients with cases opened. There were 709 problem types for cases opened. Over 12 cases involved court appearances. In addition, the centre is involved in eight community legal education projects and one law reform project. If one uses the National Processing Centre reports, then the activity level is recorded as even greater, with the number of clients assisted being 695, the number of advice activities being 710, the number of client contacts being 3,619 and the number of face-to-face advices being 707. I am sure everybody would agree that is a magnificent effort for a service that involves the equivalent of 1.8 legal staff. 
Lest there be any doubt about the need for the Werribee Legal Service, it has recorded that 56.5 per cent of the clients it assisted in the period were reliant on social security. So I think we can easily show that more than half of the clients of the service would have had no other way of accessing legal advice if it were not for the existence of this very good Werribee Legal Service. My congratulations go to each of the staff members, the community volunteers and the community members who participate on the board of management. But it is time that their efforts were met with a commitment from the Howard government, particularly the commitment of certainty that centres like the Werribee Legal Service will be able to continue and will not face any forced amalgamations or merges or any funding cutbacks to try to force the Victorian government into accepting the regionalisation of community legal centres, which has been pursued under this government.
Of course, as I have said, having access to legal aid and appropriate advice is one part of ensuring rights; having a comprehensive and comprehensible criminal code is another part. In developing such a code as this bill has, we have to meet the competing aims of not stifling legal innovation by stifling local legal developments or indeed crowding out any room for judicial innovation by codification, leaving no work for the courts to do and, at the same time, needing to get consistency, if not uniformity, and certainty into the system across Australia. We need to do all of this in a context where we are dealing with plain English drafting, so that a citizen can look at the legislation and be aware of what his or her rights or responsibilities are. Obviously, there is a competing tension with the use of plain English drafting, in that it can be quite difficult to reduce very complex matters to plain English. This bill has endeavoured to strike a balance between those competing tensions.  
However, in the area of theft and fraud particularly there will need to be continuing vigilance and review, given the impact of the rapid changes in new technology on the capacity for criminal conduct, its detection and its prosecution. While we do not have specific figures, we already know that fraud is a substantial problem for our community. In 1999, KPMG surveyed 367 large Australian businesses, including government organisations, on the issue of fraud. In response to that survey, the respondents disclosed $239 million as being lost to fraud in the previous two years; 57 per cent of respondents reported experiencing at least one incident of fraud in the previous two years. It should be noted that this is a considerable increase on a similar survey conducted in 1997, which reported a 48 per cent incident of fraud. While the disclosed level of fraud is high, the actual disclosed level is likely to be a very small proportion of the total, due to the failure to detect frauds or the reluctance to actually officially report fraud.
On the basis of these sorts of statistics, we can say that fraud is already a considerable problem, and one that can be compounded as we move to an e-commerce regime with much more of our financial transactions being conducted on the Internet. Obviously, on the Internet it is much easier to disguise your intent and to present fraudulent schemes in a positive light. Clearly the identity and location of the person committing the fraud can be easily disguised and law enforcement, monitoring and detection can be more difficult. The question of jurisdiction, where a fraud is committed and where it should be prosecuted, is infinitely more complex. This bill deals with some of the many questions raised by the Internet and e-commerce in this area, but obviously it does not answer all of them. There will be a need for continued legal innovation and reform within the framework established by this code. I think that that is a matter on which we will see further work and discussion and a matter on which, one would hope, we can proceed on a bipartisan basis. But obviously, until the nature of the new economy—in some senses, the volume and nature of e-commerce transactions—becomes clearer, some of these issues about dealing with fraud and its detection and prosecution cannot be addressed. Having said that, this bill does make some positive steps towards dealing with the use of computers in crime and towards a more sophisticated definition of jurisdiction for the offences dealt with.
As I have said, this example of the Internet, if you like, is one example which throws into stark relief the tension between certainty and consistency on the one hand, when one is developing model criminal codes, and the need for flexibility and legal innovation. The debate which has surrounded this bill, about whether or not to include a general dishonesty offence, is another example of the clash between these laudable aims and the tension between them. So these aims are all desirable but, if you like, for any specific matter can be seen to be pulling in different directions. The trick for policy makers who are engaged in the process that we are engaged in tonight is to try to balance up these competing aims and to strike a balance which meets the need for both consistency and certainty but does not prevent there being some form of flexibility and innovation. As I have said, the initial form of the bill included a general dishonesty offence. I think this offence was included in part because of the tensions between these public policy aims. I move:
That the debate be adjourned.

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2000-10-09,"—I indicate to the House that the government proposes that amendments Nos 3, 4, 8 to 16 and 21 be agreed to, that amendments Nos 1, 2, 5 to 7, 17 to 20, 22 and 23 be disagreed to and that amendment No. 24 be disagreed to but that an amendment be made in place thereof.

Question resolved in the affirmative.",REPS,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,16,1
"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2000-10-09,"—I move:
That Senate amendments Nos. 1, 2, 5 to 7, 17 to 20, 22 and 23 be disagreed to. 
I would like to now explain why the Senate's proposed amendments should not be agreed to in this House. I will deal with Senate amendments Nos. 1 and 2 to begin with. These amendments substantially alter the approval processes for renewable energy generation projects seeking to be eligible under the measure. The additional tests imposed by these amendments are not clearly defined and would make participation in the scheme difficult, increasing uncertainty for project proponents. This is counter to the intention of the legislation, which is to support the expansion of renewable energy generation capacity in Australia. Accordingly, the House of Representatives does not accept these amendments.
Senate amendments Nos. 5, 6, 17 and 20, which would require an additional register of applications for accreditation, would impose an unnecessary administrative burden on the renewable energy regulator. They would expand the regulator's responsibilities for maintaining public registers above the currently required register of registered parties, register of accredited power stations and register of renewable energy certificates. The additional register of applications for accreditation of power stations does not assist the public or the market to understand the scheme. Given the added cost and administrative burden these amendments impose, the House of Representatives does not accept these amendments. 
Senate amendment No. 7, which seeks to list eligible renewable energy sources, reduces flexibility in the administration of the scheme by reducing the range of renewable energy sources that would be eligible to contribute towards meeting the requirements of this legislation. A complex and time consuming process would be required to make minor amendments to the eligibility list—for example, adding a new renewable energy source to the eligibility list. This could reduce the level of support available to new technologies at the time when support is most required, for example, in particular, during the early days of the technology's development. This amendment would cause an unnecessary restriction in the achievement and complicated administration of this scheme. It could stymie innovation. Accordingly, the House of Representatives does not accept this amendment. 
Senate amendments Nos. 18 and 19 would have the effect of segmenting a market that is designed to offer a generic product, which is a megawatt hour of renewable energy. These amendments seem to propose that a certificate would identify whether the energy was created by, say, wind or solar power or some other source. Liable parties have made representations to the effect that they consider that disclosure of the fuel source used to create renewable energy certificates would complicate the operation of the market. It would complicate registry, trading and acquittal arrangements for what we want to be an easily understood renewable energy market. Given the impact of these amendments on the effective operation of the measure, the House of Representatives does not accept these amendments.
Senate amendment No. 22 for the insertion of a CPI indexation clause into the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Bill 2000 would bring the constitutionality of the scheme into question. Measures related to a rate of taxation must be incorporated into a separate bill. Therefore, an amendment of this nature can only be introduced into the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Bill 2000. Amendments moved to the original amendment proposed by the opposition in the Senate have also left this amendment indexing only a penalty charge, which would be rarely used—for example, a penalty charge payable under part 9. This amendment would need to be further amended if the rate of shortfall charged to be paid by parties not meeting their obligation was indexed annually. The indexation of the rate of shortfall charge, given a commitment to review the operation of the scheme, including a level of penalties provided under the act, is therefore not accepted by the House of Representatives. 
Senate amendment No. 23 would require that draft regulations be available for public comment for a period of not less than 30 days before the regulations are made. (Extension of time granted) This amendment would substantially delay the implementation of the measure and, as a result, the scheme would not be able to commence on 1 July 2001. Under this particular legislation, participants in the scheme will not be able to be accredited if the regulations have not been finalised by the proposed date. A 30-day consultation process would substantially reduce the likelihood that the regulations for this measure could be tabled in the 2000 sitting period. A delay in the commencement of the measure would impact substantially on those parties who have already made investments based on an expectation that the measure will commence on 1 January 2001. Accordingly, the House of Representatives does not accept this amendment.",REPS,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,16,1
"Evans, Martyn, MP",ALP,2000-10-09,"—Many of the detailed matters associated with many of these amendments that the government proposes to disagree with have been canvassed in depth in the Senate, and I do not propose to go through all of those arguments again here tonight, in view of the hour. I am sure that would not suit the convenience of the House. However, I do feel that it is very important to make a point about the CPI relating to that amendment, because that goes to the very core of the bill itself. The failure of the government to propose a suitable indexation mechanism for the charges under this bill means that over a period of time—and it is contemplated that this bill will act over a period of about the next decade—the CPI will progressively weaken the value of the alternative charge which people must pay and, therefore, will weaken the incentive for renewable energy projects. Of course, it cuts the other way as well because, by having a CPI indexation measure, you would ultimately increase the value of that charge to another, quite higher, figure over the period of the 10 years that this act is expected to operate over. Indeed, by the end of the 10 years, on any reasonable assumption of CPI measures over that period—and of course I understand it is not possible to accurately predict the CPI over the next 10 years—any reasonable statistical forecast of that would field quite a substantial difference, of the order of some $23, in the value of the penalty with or without indexation.
Of course, at the end of the day that will mean quite a significant difference in the incentive for a renewable energy project. So, while the opposition notes the fact that the government proposes not to have a CPI indexation clause in the bill, the reality is that over time that will significantly undermine the very basis of the bill, which is to encourage the formation of renewable energy projects. While the time is not available to canvass all of the matters before us here this evening, it is important to highlight that one particular amendment because of the way in which that will undermine the very purpose of the bill itself.

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2000-10-09,"—Let me just say, in reference to Senate amendment No. 22, the government has supported a review of this measure after three years. This will provide an opportunity to determine whether a change in the rate of the charge is warranted; and the renewable energy industry has indicated that there is at this time considerable uncertainty as to the future value of renewable energy certificates. Hence review, rather than automatic indexation, will be appropriate. I present the reasons for the House of Representatives' disagreement with certain proposed amendments that have been put. I now table that document. I move:
That the reasons be adopted.

"Evans, Martyn, MP",ALP,2000-10-09,"—Of course the opposition prefers the formulation of words which it adopted in the Senate amendment and which it was able to successfully carry in the Senate. That the government is now choosing to support a somewhat weaker form of words is, I think, unfortunate; but the House has noted that and I am sure the Senate will again consider the matter. So, while we do not support this particular amendment, as we did not support the last group of amendments, I do not propose to take the matter further than that.

"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2000-10-09,"—Prior to the debate being interrupted, members may recall that I had discussed the genesis of the Criminal Code Amendment (Theft, Fraud, Bribery and Related Offences) Bill 1999, the magnitude of fraud in Australia, the public policy tensions in this area, the impact of the Internet on fraud monitoring and detection and the definition of jurisdiction; and I had of course raised the magnificent performance of the Werribee Legal Service in managing to assist the large number of people that it does assist with only 1.8 staff. I know that the members who were here in the House when I was making those remarks were truly amazed at the amount of work that the Werribee Legal Service gets done with such limited resourcing.
I turn back now to matters more directly on the bill. Prior to the debate being interrupted, I was discussing the question of the general dishonesty offence. In the original version of the bill, there had been a general dishonesty offence included in relation to obtaining a gain, causing a loss and influencing a Commonwealth public official. It should be noted that this offence was not based on an appropriation having taken place or a deception having occurred, or on there having been a conspiracy by a number of persons to do something. So there was not, if you like, a physical manifestation of an offence, in the sense that something had been unlawfully appropriated, a deception had occurred or even an allegation had been made that there was a conspiracy between a number of people to commit an unlawful act. Consequently, the offence could be said to arise because of one person's—that is, the defendant's—state of mind, and the proof would lie in showing that defendant's state of mind.
The debate around this general dishonesty offence basically fell down to the following elements. On the one side, the measure was seen as draconian and introducing a great element of uncertainty in relation to what conduct is being criminalised. As I said at the outset of my remarks, one of the aims of having a model criminal code is to enable citizens to ascertain from a comprehensive and comprehensible code what it is that the Australian law requires them to do or to not do, so that they can be certain about both their rights and their responsibilities. In that setting, the introduction of a general dishonesty offence, relying as it did on proof of state of mind rather than any physical act or manifestation or indeed any conspiracy process, was seen as being draconian. 
However, there was the counterdebate that introducing such an offence could give the code a necessary degree of flexibility and that a generalised offence could be used to criminalise inappropriate conduct, the specifics of which were not foreseen at the date of the bill being drafted or passed by this House. So in that discussion around the merits or otherwise of a general dishonesty offence we see played out very clearly the public policy tensions in this area between certainty and consistency on the one hand—consistency, if not uniformity, across Australia and certainty in the sense that a person can relatively easily work out from a piece of legislation what it is that the law requires them to do or not do—versus the competing but equally laudable aims of having some flexibility in legislation because, as we are aware, the class of criminal conduct is never closed. Whilst human vices might be fairly well known and capable of easy recitation from the 10 commandments onwards—or even before—we know that the way in which offences are committed is constantly changing and, as I have discussed in the course of this contribution, with the advent of the Internet and e-commerce, we can easily see that the manner in which the well-known offences of fraud, theft and deception may be committed in the future will be quite different from the way in which they were committed historically. So there was this tension around the general dishonesty offence between consistency and certainty and flexibility.
That debate was had fairly and squarely by the House of Representatives committee when it considered this bill, and it recommended that the general dishonesty offence not be proclaimed until the Attorney-General and the committee were satisfied by the DPP that prosecution guidelines which would be used for the proposed offence would be appropriate to the nature of the offence. So appropriate prosecution guidelines would be developed by the DPP, and that was seen as being adequate to satisfy the committee's concerns on the uncertainty and lack of consistency grounds.
I am pleased to see that the government has gone down that track. I noted at the outset of my speech that this course was first embarked upon in 1987, and to have a further stage might seem to be the very slow way home—and I am sure that extra delay was not something that was viewed as desirable by those who would follow the process over a large number of years, though I trust that there is nobody who has been on the job since 1987. I can see from a wry smile in the advisers box that there may well be one person who has been on the case since 1987, and they deserve this House's admiration for that degree of fortitude. But in this case, whilst it might be frustrating for those involved, the slow way home is the appropriate way home, and this very difficult issue can be resolved in this way by further dialogue and discussion.
All in all, this bill has the opposition's support, and I would commend to the House the remarks made by the shadow minister earlier. However, I would take this opportunity to urge upon the government a more generous approach in some related matters to this bill. Those related matters are legal aid—that is, giving people who are accused of offences in our society the appropriate legal resources to make sure that they are fully apprised of their rights and that they do not get a worse outcome than a more moneyed defendant would. So I would urge a more generous approach by the government to the question of legal aid. I would also urge a more certain approach by the government to the future of community legal centres in Victoria. They have lived with uncertainty for too long and, given the contribution they make to advising impecunious defendants who otherwise would be left unrepresented, I think they deserve that certainty. Finally, I would urge upon the government, this House and parliamentarians generally a vigilance in relation to the effect of new technology on our criminal law, given, as we have noted, that it will change the way in which offences are committed and the way in which they are monitored and detected. Ultimately, it will change legal prosecution systems, as we struggle to deal with complex jurisdictional questions. (Time expired)

"Gerick, Jane, MP",ALP,2000-10-09,"—On many occasions over the past two years since becoming the member for Canning, I have spoken in this place about the wonderful job that volunteers do. Not only in Canning, I recognise, but nationally, we have a wonderful army of people who work very hard to build a strong and solid community. Over the last 12 months, though, I have spoken about the increasing pressures that are being placed on our volunteers and the feeling that a number of them have that their work is not valued. I know that a number of the people in my electorate were very concerned about the introduction of the GST and felt that possible penalties that would be placed on them if they made a mistake would make the job not worth doing. These people felt very undervalued.
Another concern which has recently been raised with me in Western Australia is about the possible change to legislation which would mean that drivers would have to go through a range of tests and change their class of licence in order to be a volunteer driver. Volunteer drivers carry out a whole range of services, be it picking up people who are unable to drive and taking them to medical appointments or taking our senior citizens to do their shopping so that they can spend longer in their own homes before needing to move into care. In a number of cases—for example, that of Armadale Home Help—they take groups of senior citizens away on holidays. It is good for everybody to be able to get out and about for a while.
The proposed legislation is causing some confusion. When this was raised in state parliament in Western Australia, we had three different responses. When asked a question on notice, the Minister for Health said, `Yes, volunteer drivers will be required to get an F-class licence.' When the Minister for the Police was asked, he said, `No, volunteers will not be required to get an F-class drivers licence.' When asked, the state government department concerned said that it was not their problem. This is not an issue where people can just buck pass. We need our volunteers to be confident, and we need them to be able to go ahead and provide the service that we have all become accustomed to and that we like to think those in need are able to avail themselves of.
I will give you an example of some of the issues that people are being faced with. If the volunteers use their own cars, they are now going to need to register their vehicles as charity vehicles. That means a high insurance premium will be due. One of my charity workers told me that their car premium is going to increase by approximately $600 a year. Quite often you find that volunteers are retired people who are doing this to make their contribution, and I do not know many people who can afford an extra $600 a year because they want to go out and do good work. They have also been told that, if they receive any donations, 50 per cent will have to be paid to the government. When they are going through the process to get the F-class licence, they are going to be subject to medical examinations every five years until they reach 45 and annually after 65 years. There have been no provisions put in place to assist volunteers with any of the costs involved in this. There is going to be an application form where they have to produce character references, pass a written regulation test, do another questionnaire, have an eyesight test, submit the detailed application form and have medical examinations and a driving test.
At Hills Home Help, all the volunteer drivers have a disability of some sort. So far, they have lost five drivers who do not want to go through this process. We need each and every one of our volunteers to feel treasured and appreciated for the hard work they do. We do not want drivers who are going to put our seniors at risk. We all know that they must have a licence and that they must take due care. But, when I have asked each one of my charities, none of them have had any serious accidents with volunteer drivers. It is probably a record that a number of us would envy. You are going to take care when you have people in your car—you want to look after them. It is important that the government clarify these issues and make sure they put something in place so that our volunteers are not scared off or placed under a financial burden just because they have a good social conscience and they want to work hard to make Canning and every other area in Australia a much better place to live.
