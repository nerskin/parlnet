Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (10:07):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics, I present the committee's second report, entitled Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia annual report 2013, together with the minutes of the proceedings.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Ms O'DWYER:
  by leave—I am very pleased to be presenting the second report of the economics committee of the 44th Parliament as part of the committee's review of the Reserve Bank of Australia's annual report 2013. This report follows a hearing with the Governor and other officials of the Reserve Bank on 7 March 2014 in Sydney. The RBA noted in its May 2014 Statement on monetary policy that 'overall economic activity picked up over the past six months, with the economy looking like it grew at close to its long-run average pace over this period'. The RBA also commented:


The outlook for Australia's trading partner growth is little changed since the February Statement.


It went on:


… growth of Australia's trading partners in year-average terms is forecast to be around its long-run average in 2014 and 2015.


Currently, RBA forecasts indicate that GDP growth in Australia will be slightly below trend, 2.75 per cent, over 2014 to 2015. This is anticipated to pick up over 2015 to 2016. Although the outlook for inflation appears to be a little higher than six months ago, it remains consistent with the medium-term target. Underlying inflation is forecast at 2.5 to 3.5 per cent to June 2015.


It is clear that the decline in investment by mining companies is set to continue. Other areas of demand, such as non-mining capital expenditure, could partly offset this downturn, but other sources of growth will also be needed. The labour market is likely to remain soft for a while due to the current period of below-trend growth, but it is notable that the indicators in this regard have recently become more positive.


As noted by the RBA in its May 2014 statement, the exchange rate remains a 'significant source of uncertainty' for economic and inflation forecasting. The Australian dollar is currently trading at about 10 per cent below its 2013 peak, but the Governor has reiterated his view that the dollar remains overvalued based on costs and productivity in Australia relative to those of other countries.


Demand for new housing appears to have remained strong, including First Home Owner Grants and loan approvals for new dwellings. The Governor commented that construction of new dwellings will probably rise strongly in the year ahead. As Australia has been undersupplied in recent years in terms of new dwellings, increases in residential construction activity are to be welcomed. In recent years, productivity growth has been somewhat sluggish in Australia. However, the Governor suggested that this is likely to improve with the ramping up of output growth in the resources sector. Other drivers of productivity growth are likely to be needed. The RBA board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.5 per cent at its most recent meeting on 3 June. The Governor commented in relation to the board's decision that monetary policy was appropriately configured to foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation outcomes and that the most prudent course is likely to be a period of stability in interest rates.


Finally, on behalf of the committee, I would like to thank the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Glenn Stevens, and other representatives of the RBA for appearing before the committee on 7 March 2014. I commend the report to the House.

Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (10:11):  by leave—I am pleased to speak to the committee's second report reviewing the Reserve Bank of Australia Annual Report 2013. I extend my thanks to the chair, along with the committee secretariat, and commend them for their assistance and hard work. I note the presence of the member for Rankin, who is on the committee. Back in March, when the committee's first report was tabled, I remarked upon the challenges that still confronted the world economy. Concerns were also expressed about the potential impact of the federal government's decisions on our domestic economy and, while the recent national account figures are welcome news, it is clear that the mining sector is still relied upon as the main driver for growth. The challenge remains: getting the non-mining sector to contribute more. The task here has certainly not been helped by the release of the Abbott government's first budget, which has dented consumer and business confidence. During our hearing in March, the RBA reflected on the strength of dwelling approvals, which in the three months leading to the hearing lumbered almost 50,000. According to the RBA, this was the highest three-month total in the history of that series. Yet, just over two months later and two weeks after one of the most poorly received federal budgets in recent memory, the value of homes in some of our biggest markets slumped massively—some falling by margins considered the largest since the GFC. This prompted AMP Capital's Chief Economist Shane Oliver to conclude that there was no doubt about the effect of the budget. He said:


In May we saw a sharp almost 7 per cent decline in consumer confidence … If 150,000 people lose their family tax benefits and there's the fear factor for everyone else, no doubt it will have an impact.


Why is this serious? Because many economists underscore the value of housing construction as a platform for growth in the non-mining sector, especially against the backdrop of a continuing downward drift in mining investment, yet the budget has impacted on the purchasing power of low and middle Australia, slashing family payments and other benefits, increasing fuel taxes and, down the track, introducing medical co-payments—all this in an environment where wages growth, according to the testimony of the RBA, remains at its lowest in over a decade. In fact, the RBA stated that wages growth is the lowest it has been since 1997. Added to this are subdued prospects for employment growth, with the RBA noting that it is not until 2015 that there will be sufficient growth for that growth to make inroads into the unemployment rate.


If we are looking to the non-mining sector to help sustain and improve growth, the government's fiscal strategy is shaping up as an obvious threat to this serious task of rebalancing. When in opposition, the coalition regularly stated that our fiscal challenges were not due to a problem with revenue but, rather, that we were confronted with an expenditure problem. Upon securing office and releasing their first budget, the coalition government now sets about lifting taxes or introducing new ones. Surprisingly, it turned its back on around $700 million of revenue from previously announced measures designed in part to address multinational profit shifting. This overall issue has attracted British Prime Minister David Cameron's attention, who has urged multilateral effort in addressing profit shifting. Indeed, during the hearings, the RBA's Deputy Governor remarked:


International tax rules have not kept pace with the change in the globalisation of business, and governments, as a result, are getting less tax revenue …


He then stated:


Given the fiscal positions that many governments find themselves in, it is obviously an area that people want to fix.


Unless, of course, you are this government, which rejected nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars in revenue and then was forced to make this up elsewhere. Let us put this in perspective. The $700 million this government walked away from in MYEFO it made up for by cutting $500 million in healthcare investment in MYEFO. It is perverse. Efforts to tackle multinational profit shifting morph into shifting the revenue burden, heaving it onto low- and middle-income Australia.


One final area I want to record some concern about relates to the rise of shadow banking in China. Both the IMF and the RBA are keeping a close watch on this, so it is certainly prudent for this House to note their focus on this issue. During the hearings the RBA Governor expressed his belief that the asset quality in some of the shadow banking entities was likely to be poor. Further, reflecting on some of the loans made within that system, he stated:


In fact, it is virtually certain that some of those loans, if they have not gone bad yet, will go bad.


The question, according to Governor Stevens, is how quickly they can get on top of it and get ahead of it. I certainly believe that this is a matter that will need further examination within the scope of the existing work of the committee. I certainly welcome the chair's commitment to do this. I commend the report to the House.

That this House:

(b) accountability of charities is critical to maintaining public confidence, accountability and transparency in the not-for-profit sector; and

(3) calls on the Minister to:

(b) heed the wishes of sector players and experts in this field and keep the ACNC.



The SPEAKER:  Is the motion seconded?




Ms Brodtmann:
  I second the motion.




Dr LEIGH:
  In 2006 the House of Representatives Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs was asked by the then minister, the member for Berowra, to report on the harmonisation of legal systems. Recommendation 18 of that 2006 report brought down under the Howard government was:


The Committee recommends that the Australian Government, in consultation with the not-for-profit sector and the States and Territories:


Investigate the establishment of a single national regulator for the not-for-profit sector;


That was a unanimous report of the committee, a coalition dominated committee which included the shadow Prime Minister, I mean the Prime Minister's shadow, the member for Wentworth, Malcolm Turnbull. This was just one of five major inquiries over more than a decade that have recommended a charities commission—a charities commission which enjoys broad support across the sector.


More than a million people have viewed the ACNC's national charities register. The commission has registered almost a thousand charities, responded to more than 40,000 inquiries and resolved more than 200 complaints about charities. As Robert Fitzgerald, the Chair of the ACNC Advisory Board and the presiding commissioner on the Productivity Commission's 2010 inquiry, has noted, the choice for the Commonwealth parliament is about retaining well-developed, proportionate and appropriate regulation or returning to an ad hoc system of inefficient and non-transparent regulation. As he puts it:


Corporate Australia long ago rejected such a regime and begs the question as to why the not-for-profit sector should be burdened by such a cumbersome regime?


As Mr Fitzgerald has noted, the one-stop shop regulator at the Commonwealth level is an essential element in that strategy and has already demonstrated its effectiveness, including in negotiating outcomes with state authorities. It has been my pleasure to join Andrew Barr in the ACT and Gail Gago in South Australia, two jurisdictions which are working with the ACNC, to reduce the paperwork burden on Australian charities.


As Mr Fitzgerald has noted, many of the concerns that have been raised by critics have been dealt with by the ACNC itself. Religious institutions were concerned about the impact on small parishes. That has been addressed by providing for financial and governance exemptions for basic religious charities. Schools were concerned about duplicate reporting, and this has been addressed through an agreement that avoids such duplicate reporting. Charities incorporated as companies limited by guarantee wanted arrangements to ensure they did not have to annually report to both ASIC and the ACNC, and the arrangements to report once only have been put in place. Certain philanthropic funds did not want their details published, to avoid unsolicited requests, and the commissioner has exercised her discretion to ensure that non-disclosure of key information can occur. 


The result is that the key beneficiaries of the repeal of the ACNC are really only those organisations who do not want independent public accountability or transparency but which seek to continue to receive large benefits from the Australian community. As the Queensland Law Society's submission into the Senate ACNC inquiry has noted, the two-stage process generates uncertainty for the sector and makes good administration by the current ACNC extremely difficult. The Queensland Law Society is particularly concerned that the explanatory memorandum and regulation impact statement are less than rigorous and do not meet the usual high standards and disciplines of Commonwealth legislative processes. It also points to multiple examples of factual mistakes in both the EM and the RIS.


I commend to the House Andreas Ortmann's summary of the submissions to the Senate ACNC inquiry, which points out that about nine-tenths of those submissions support the ACNC. That is true, too, of Pro Bono Australia survey of the sector, which finds four out of five charities support the ACNC, and of an open letter that was signed by more than 40 charities across the board. The government claims it has consulted, but organisations listed by this government as having been consulted have said, in one example, 'Governance Institute has not at any time been consulted by the Department of Social Services.' Justice Connect said that they have been mistakenly listed as having been consulted: 'We note the brief interaction we had with DSS representatives at an event which they confirmed we would not be consulted is clear evidence of this.'



The SPEAKER:  Before I call the honourable member for Wannon, I would ask the seconder of the motion, the honourable member for Canberra, if she wishes to reserve her right to speak.




Ms Brodtmann:
  I reserve my right to speak.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2014-06-16,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (10:22):  The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission was established by the former Rudd-Gillard-Rudd Labor governments. I think I could end my speech there, really, because that just about says it all. Their record in producing regulatory burden for every sector of our economy knew no bounds. One of the jobs that the new Abbott government has is to clean up the regulatory nightmare that has been imposed on the Australian community over the last six years. Fixing up this regulatory mess is what this government is hell-bent on doing. We have started the process and started it well, but more needs to be done. When it came to the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments, it seemed that they wanted to have a purpose. The way they made a purpose was to find a problem where a problem did not exist and then place a solution upon it. That solution always involved asking: how can we regulate more? Is there any other area where we could regulate? Can we go to areas where there are no problems and can we place a regulation? That is exactly what occurred in this area.


The Abbott government, when we were in opposition, made it extremely clear. We opposed the legislation which set up this regulatory behemoth. We said we would get rid of it—and get rid of it we will. We have already started the process, in fact. It is being done in conjunction with a lot of other acts being repealed. We had regulation repeal day. I see my friend the member for Kooyong is in the chamber here today. He has led the charge to make sure that this red tape, which is slowly strangling every part of the Australian community, is reduced, that we stop this burden that we are placing on every aspect of our community.




Mr Ewen Jones:
  He's a good man.




Mr Tehan:
  He is a good man. This is part of the process. It was an election commitment that we will honour, and it will also bring benefits. What are we going to replace it with? I am a bit of an advocate and a bit of a keen follower of horse racing. One of the things that you say when you look at these types of policies is that what the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments were all about was just saddling weight on every part of the community so that it was carrying 61, 62, 63 kilograms. What do we want to do? We want to make sure that we reduce that burden. We want everyone to have just a jockey on their back, steering them in the right direction but not weighing them down with 60 kilograms. We want everyone to carry about 49 or 50 kilograms. Weight-for-age is what we are looking for, and that is what we will do with this legislation. We are going to take the heavy burden off this sector and apply a light touch. We are going to establish a commission, which we hope that, in time, the sector will take responsibility for and take charge of. We will leave it up to the not-for-profit sector to chart their own destination. We will not say to the sector: 'We as government know best. We as government will lay down the rules for you. We as government will dictate what file you will place in what drawer.' We are the ones who will say to the sector: 'No. You do it yourself.' 



Mr Ewen Jones interjecting—




Mr TEHAN:
  As a my good friend the member for Herbert just said, give them the whip, give them the jockey's helmet, let them ride their horse and let them go in the direction they want to go. We understand that these sectors in Australia are mature, are adult, and do not need someone else whipping them and telling them what they should do and where they should go. We understand that this sector in particular, which does so much good for our society, should be in control of its own destination.

Mr LAURIE FERGUSON
 (Werriwa) (10:27):  As the previous speaker noted, the not-for-profit sector is 'mature' and 'adult', and that is why it is vigorously opposed to the changes proposed by the government. In actual fact, last year, a Pro Bono survey found that 81 per cent of the 1,500 respondents were opposed to the government's suggestion for change to this sector. Recently, 54 major Australian charities signed a statement in regard to the attempt by this government to abolish the ACNC. They noted:



The launch of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission in 2012 was a major step forward in creating a regulatory environment that works for the not-for-profit sector rather than against it. 



They went on to say that they extensively support it. If I had any doubts about why the ACNC should be retained, the paucity of argument from the Minister for Social Services has added to my position. He has come back to say that that was signed by only 54 individuals. He should look through those charities, which are from across the spectrum in this country. Father Riley, in my own electorate, who does so much for the homeless, was a notable signatory. He noted problems with the UK regulation. The UK example has no connection with what happens in Australia. The most laughable reason that the minister gave for the legislation, given the recent budget, was that it was an election commitment. That is the major reason he gave for proposing his legislation. Quite frankly, that is questionable. A Choice survey of 2008—for those people who are interested in consumer affairs et cetera—indicated very strong support for an organisation like the ACNC. It was an endorsement of the 1995 Industry Commission report, the 2001 Howard government inquiry into charity definition and many other international surveys leading up to the 2010 Productivity Commission report. 


We should ask: why is the government trying to do this? I am very indebted to an article by Mike Seccombe in TheSaturday Paper of 29 March 2014, in which he indicated that the major people calling for this legislation are rather interesting—private administrators of charitable trusts—an industry with $3.2 billion in assets. He noted in the article that in 2009 these rather altruistic, kindly people managed to get legislative change in this country that meant that their fees were not to be on the percentage of capital but on income. That article further quoted Peter Winneke, who was responsible for the philanthropic services of the Myer Family Company. He surveyed these private companies that have come to control so many of these charitable trusts in this country. As I said, they are a major advocate for abolishing the ACNC. I wonder why. It is because they do not want oversight. They do not want the Australian people to know what is wrong with some charities. They do not want to give confidence to the broader non-profit sector.


Mr Winneke noted that in some cases they were getting up to 40 per cent of earnings of a trust siphoned off in fees. I notice that they are members of the Financial Services Council of Australia. Mr Seccombe looked up the 2011 to 2013 AEC donations and found that the Financial Services Council had a history of contributing to people on both sides of politics who just happen to be involved in this portfolio area and to members of relevant parliamentary committees in its field. The Financial Services Council, representing the body that wants the abolition of the ACNC, made an interesting donation in 2011-13 to the North Sydney Forum, which is run on behalf of the Treasurer of this country. While we are talking about charitable matters, that is the favourite charity of Australian Water Holdings.


We have seen significant support for this organisation. People who are supposedly regulated too much, people who are affected by this onerous red tape, are saying that they actually want this organisation to operate. We have seen two entities already—South Australia and the ACT—abolish their state alternatives to oversight this field because there is confidence in the recently established federal ACNC. It has been, as I said, at a very early stage able to give confidence to the sector. People do want to have confidence, because there are problems. I noticed as recently as 15 March this year the Australian Vaccination-skeptics Network, as covered by The Sydney Morning Herald— (Time expired)

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (10:32):  I love the Labor Party! There has never been a layer of new or added red tape that they do not adopt wholly, solely and fully and use as a new base to grow that sector of regulation. We have heard all the talk about support for the ACNC, all coming from other levels of regulation. When Kevin Andrews first took this thing, he went around Australia. He came to Townsville and spoke to the people doing the work on the ground, the people delivering the work, the people filling out the forms, and explained to them what we were trying to achieve by getting rid of the ACNC. He had three forums in Townsville in one 24-hour period and there was not one dissenting hand. He asked them to put up their hand if they loved doing the paperwork, and no-one put their hand up. He asked who felt that the paperwork they were filling out was actually being read. It was horrendous the amount of work that they had to do.


An organisation in Townsville—I will not embarrass them by naming them—had taken over two similar failing organisations: one in Ingham and one in Ayr, about an hour each side of Townsville. They sent in their return to the federal organisation and got a letter back saying that they had received only one return. They said: 'Yes, it is one return. We have three branches, but we are the one organisation.' They were told: 'No. You must produce a return for all three organisations.' They said, 'But the return would be exactly the same for the other two,' and they were told: 'That does not matter. You must supply them for all three.' So they had to photocopy it and send away another two copies with changes to the heading. This is what we have to deal with. The problem people on the ground have is that they know that these returns are not being read. They know all the information is going into a great big stockpile and they simply cannot get through all the detail.


When I was in credit collection there was a story about a US finance company that for one 12-month period just approved absolutely everything. At the end of that period their delinquency rates were exactly the same as if they had applied all their credit scoring methods. This goes to prove that the great majority of people in every sector want to do the right thing.


No matter what happens, no matter what level of security, no matter what level of red tape we apply, there are going to be people in every industry who will come in motivated to do the wrong thing. Should we penalise as the member for Wannon said? Should we put 63 kilograms in the saddlebags of absolutely every organisation, knowing that one in every thousand is going to do the wrong thing, or should we bring them all down to 49 kilograms, let them ride hands and heels all the way through to the winning post and do the best for their people? How best can our organisations deliver services to the people? Is it by providing to federal government departments information that is never going to be read, or is it going to be by serving the people on the ground, who deserve the support and the services.




Mr Frydenberg:
  It's got to be freed up.




Mr EWEN JONES:
  It has to be freed up. We have the member for Kooyong sitting right in front of me. He is working so hard to make sure that we get these things through and get rid of this red tape so that we can free people up to actually do what they want to do. No-one got into charity work, not-for-profit work, NGO work, supplying services to kids on the street or small business because they love red tape and want to fill out forms: 'I want to help some kids on the street by filling out a 47-page document! That's how I can best serve!'


You find that the people who are up against this are the people who are getting paid to help them comply. The people who want the ACNC and more red tape in this field are the people who are being paid or whose job description is to help people work out how this form complies, where this form goes, how to do it properly and all that sort of stuff. This is what we have to stop. What we have to do is make sure the money that these people raise gets to the customer, to the person on the ground. Filling out red tape is taking another person away from what they want to do, be it the P&F at your school, Queensland Youth Services, an aged-care facility or anywhere. If your audit process is good enough for the state government, it should be good enough for us. We can just push it through and make it easier for people to provide services on the street.

"Claydon, Sharon, MP",ALP,2014-06-16,"



Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (10:37):  I rise today in support of the motion of the member for Fraser regarding the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission and in particular for his call for the government to drop its ill-considered and unpopular plan to axe the commission. As the CEO of the Community Council for Australia, David Crosbie, put it:


Nobody wants to go back to the bad old days of having the Australian Tax Office regulating charities. It's a failed model from the past. It will not work.


Earlier this year a coalition of 40 of Australia's biggest and most respected charities along with legal experts, philanthropic organisations and arts communities joined together to warn the Abbott Liberal government that it would be a huge mistake to close down the newly formed Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. They argued that the commission was in fact doing exactly what it was set up to do: operate efficiently and effectively to help charities, donors and taxpayers alike.


The success of the commission should come as no surprise to those who have followed the extensive 15-year period of reviews and consultations to establish the independent national charities regulator. The charities and not-for-profits sector worked closely with government to get it right, so the Abbott government's plans to abolish the commission has understandably drawn strong reaction from the sector. According to a recent survey, four out of five charities support the work the commission is doing. In a separate survey, only six per cent of charities wanted responsibility for charities to be returned to the ATO. That is a massive 94 per cent endorsement of the current arrangements under the commission.


Indeed, some of Australia's most well established and respected charities felt so strongly about the issues that they took the very courageous step of publishing an open letter urging the Prime Minister to reconsider. Lifeline, ACOSS, Save the Children, the RSPCA, Youth Off The Streets, World Vision, St John's Ambulance Australia, the McGrath Foundation and Maroba Lodge, from my own electorate of Newcastle, are among those who signed the letter and called on the government to keep the commission. The organisations confirmed a number of points in their letter to the Prime Minister, including that they wanted to make it very clear to the Commonwealth government and wider Australian community that most charities across Australia valued the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission and wanted to see it continue its impressive work. Significantly, this coalition of Australian charities agreed that the ACNC 'has done what few new regulators could ever achieve: it had gained widespread support across the sector it was regulating'. These are strong words that should be taken heed of.


The charities and not-for-profits sector plays a vital role in our community, contributing both economically and socially. The sector employs more than one million Australians, turns over $100 billion, involves almost five million volunteers and nurtures and supports our communities, including my community of Newcastle. According to the commission's charity register, the Newcastle electorate is home to more than 450 registered charities. That is 450 organisations, large and small, doing great things to support our local community. None are more or less important than the others, from the Dixon Park Surf Life Saving Club supporting our young nippers, to our homelessness support organisations, like the Samaritans; our disability service providers, like ConnectAbility; our aged-care facilities, like Maroba Lodge; or our local school P&C groups. Charities support our entire community, not just the vulnerable. They need the support of a strong, dedicated regulator, a job the commission is doing aptly.


Another important role the commission plays is to help reduce and eliminate scammers. Today, we are unfortunately exposed to so many scams. We need the commission to help protect registered charities and members of the public who donate their hard-earned money to worthy causes. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's Little Black Book of Scams details the situation well. Scammers will do anything to get our money. In the same way that ASIC provides investors with the confidence they need to buy shares in companies, the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission provides donors with confidence that registered charities are actually performing charitable works.


Finally, this government is hiding behind an illusion of consultation in order to ram home an ideological agenda. The vital work of the ACNC must be maintained, for the benefits of charities, not-for-profits and the many, many communities they serve. (Time expired)

"Hawke, Alex, MP",LP,2014-06-16,"



Mr HAWKE
 (Mitchell) (10:42):  You really get the sense today that the Labor Party is going through the motions in this debate. The member for Fraser has left the chamber. He is not even interested enough in what is being said here today on his own motion. I suppose he is working on a revised edition of his book, Battlers and Billionaires. He is the doyen of university deregulation and Medicare co-payments. A copy of his book is now sitting on my shelf. Right next to Adam Smith, John Locke, Milton Friedman and von Mises is Dr Andrew Leigh, the doyen of Medicare co-payments, on the free marketeers shelf.


He is not interested enough in this motion, and I think it is understandable why. I understand why the member for Fraser wants to change the conversation and what people are talking about in relation to him, because his book certainly has got enough attention—it would be wrong of me not to mention it again. What an excellent work it is. We have not reached the chapter on charities yet. I am looking forward to reading what he says on charities in his book, because I am sure it is not what he said today.


The problem with what the Labor Party is saying here today is that the reality on the ground and the evidence that has been before the government for some time—when we were in opposition and now in government—are that this regulatory body is another example of overregulation that is impacting upon the sector. When you get charities like Anglicare and UnitingCare Australia—and UnitingCare Australia in particular gave a very insightful piece of evidence to the Senate committee—saying that they had problems with this regulator and that it was challenging their ability and the ability of many of their member charities to function, I think you have a serious problem. I quote from the UnitingCare report:


Based on the Commissioner's 45 minute estimate it will take the 57,500 organisations registered with the ACNC a total of 43,125 hours to complete the AIS. That is the equivalent of a year's work for nearly 25 full-time employees to meet this obligation.


That is the impact, according to UnitingCare. They go further and say:


Our analysis of the 2013 AIS is that the majority of the information it requests has already been provided to government—


that is the point made by the member for Herbert; once again there is more duplication from government—


by the majority of organisations registered with the ACNC.


The cost … of this duplication of effort is significant and critically many organisations can only meet the requirement by taking resources away from frontline service delivery.


A significant opportunity for the ACNC to reduce red tape from the beginning of its operations has been missed and the cost of doing so has fallen to the sector.


That was UnitingCare Australia.




Mr Ewen Jones:
  What would they know!




Mr HAWKE:
  'What would they know!' as the member for Herbert points out. This is our concern with this body. In the last parliament, the Labor Party, in its alliance with the Greens and the Independents of the time, rushed in pieces of legislation that were poorly thought out, without proper consultation with the sector. In this case we are talking about the best of our organisations in society: charities and institutions that help the most vulnerable. What was the Labor Party's plan for this vital sector and these institutions that do so much for so little? They do far more than government does, because they deliver services so efficiently. They take money from people and turn it into great outcomes for people in need. The Labor Party's solution was to put in a new regulatory body and to make the sector fill out more paperwork, to make it employ people to fill out paperwork for the federal government in Canberra—information that government already has at state and territory level. There is already plenty of regulation of charities and not-for-profit organisations, and there are plenty of requirements and burdens.


The member for Fraser got up in this House and said, 'Actually, this has been a recommendation of everybody. There has been a major report and everything else for years and years.' The idea was to bring in a regulatory body that would reduce regulation and reduce duplication, but the Labor Party just does not get it. Every time they try and do something they add regulation, they add a burden and they add duplication. Cost and time is taken out of a vital sector—



Mr Frydenberg interjecting—




Mr HAWKE:
  The parliamentary secretary reminds me that 21,000 new regulations were brought in under the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. We are talking about a vital sector: the charitable sector. This is a good approach from the new government to get rid of this burden on the most vital of charities and organisations doing the most and giving their best. I commend the legislation that the government is presenting through red-tape repeal day. It will ensure that the regulatory burden on our charities and the not-for-profit sector is reduced so that they can get on with the vital work that they do.

 (Boothby) (12:01):  by leave—on behalf of the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I wish to make a statement on the appointment of the Independent Auditor of the Australian National Audit Office. The Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts and Audit is required under the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951 to endorse the proposed appointment of any person to the office of Independent Auditor before that appointment can be recommended to the Governor-General. The committee is also obliged to report its decision to parliament. The Independent Auditor is a person appointed from the private sector on a part-time basis to serve as an external auditor to the Audit Office.

Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (12:02):  On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the committee's report, entitled Report 443: Review of Auditor-General's Reports Nos. 23 and 25 (2012-13) and 32 (2012-13) to 9 (2013-14).


In accordance with standing order 39(e) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Dr SOUTHCOTT:
  by leave—This report details the findings of the committee's examination of the following three Australian National Audit Office reports:


Audit report No. 25 (2012-13), Defence's Implementation of Audit Recommendations;


Audit report No. 53 (2012-13), Agencies' Implementation of Performance Audit Recommendations; and


Audit report No. 6 (2013-14), Capability Development Reform, Department of Defence.


The cross-cutting theme of the committee's review of these three reports is the extent to which audited agencies have institutionalised agreed reforms arising from internal and external audit and reviews.


Audit report No. 53 assessed the effectiveness of agencies' arrangements for monitoring and implementing ANAO performance audit recommendations. The audit included an assessment of the ability of agencies to respond to recommendations from ANAO reports that have general application to the Commonwealth public service.


The agencies selected for audit were:


the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations;


the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs;


the Department of Infrastructure and Transport; and


the Department of Finance and Deregulation.


Audit report No. 53 provides tangible examples of good practice.


Indeed, the committee commends DEEWR for the professionalism and diligence it has shown in establishing and maintaining a better practice model. The DEEWR system exhibits the features of a better practice model and all Commonwealth agencies are encouraged to review their own systems in light of both DEEWR's example and the ANAO's findings.


With the two reports examining the Department of Defence's activities, the outcomes were somewhat different and the committee has made a number of specific recommendations. In Audit report No. 25, the committee recommended that:


the Department of Defence investigate options for an improved database system for the monitoring and reporting of internal and external audit recommendations; and


adequate resources are allocated to an improved database system to ensure a higher level of assurance to senior levels of the department and the minister.


The committee is very concerned that Audit report No. 6 found significant delays in keeping government advised on the progress and/or difficulties in projects. This is unacceptable and not consistent with good public administration. The committee made recommendations to the Department of Defence to:


improve the staffing model of the Capability Development Group;


include whole-of-life costing in initial project approval at the project requirement phase of the capability development process; and


institute a gate review before a project is entered onto the Defence Capability Plan.


The reform of capability development has been a concern for successive governments, and, in the committee's view, the ANAO audit has provided a valuable contribution to the reform process. The committee supports the selective use of follow-up audits and the value of the audit in this context which took a wider and deeper view of the extent to which reform had been achieved.


I would like to sincerely thank the committee members and agency representatives who appeared at public hearings for their cooperative approach to the committee's important task of scrutinising the spending of public money.


I commend the report to the House.

"Butler, Mark, MP",ALP,2014-06-16,"



Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide) (12:13):  I rise to speak in opposition to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014. We oppose the bill because it does nothing either for environmental protection or for biodiversity conservation, a theme that people have come now to expect from this government—doing nothing for environmental protection or biodiversity conservation.


Over the weekend, or very late last week, the Prime Minister, during his whirlwind tour on climate change politics in Europe and North America, described himself as a conservationist. This was a tour on which I hope the Prime Minister received a reality check about where his policy stands, where it sits in the context of a very fast-moving set of international developments on climate change policy. While in Canada, the Prime Minister tried to verbal, frankly, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, countries with very highly developed carbon trading policies, as members of some new 'coalition of the unwilling' led by the Prime Minister and the Canadian Prime Minister to seek to stymie international efforts to develop a strong, ambitious agreement around climate change at next year's Paris agreement. The New Zealand Prime Minister was very clear that he had not been consulted by the Australian Prime Minister on this so-called coalition of the unwilling. He was caught completely unawares, apparently, by the Prime Minister's statement in Canada. And the United Kingdom's response was to reiterate its strong commitment to taking strong and sensible action on climate change both domestically and as part of a growing coalition for change in the lead-in to the Paris negotiations next year.


But the Australian people judge prime ministers and all of us in this House on their actions, not on their words. No matter how many times the Prime Minister might describe himself as a conservationist, anyone who pays even cursory attention to this government's policies and this Prime Minister's actions knows that the contrary is true. Indeed, the Independent newspaper in the United Kingdom got it much more closely right than did the Prime Minister in his self-description. That newspaper, on 4 February this year, posed the question that has been on so many Australians' lips when it asked:


Is Tony Abbott's Australian administration the most hostile to his nation's environment in history?


That is a question that is on so many lips in Australia, particularly the lips of those Australians who hold our natural environment so dear.


This is not something of which the Prime Minister seems particularly ashamed—this growing reputation, not only domestically but internationally, that his administration, his government, is the most hostile to Australia's extraordinary natural environment in Australian history. The only words this Prime Minister can conjure for his environment minister is to quote the number of mining developments the minister has approved. Now, that is indeed a role of the environment minister under the existing legislation, and Australia is a jurisdiction that is resources based. But the environment minister must be more than an assistant minister for resources. The environment minister must be more than a minister who simply ticks off on mining developments. Surely this many months into the environment minister's tenure the Prime Minister could think of something that this government has done that actually involved protecting the environment, that actually involved conserving Australia's extraordinary biodiversity. But there is not a single achievement.


The only record this government has is a long, long record of winding back environmental protections. I am just going to mention a few to give some shape to the debate on this legislation. Notwithstanding a very clear commitment before the election from the environment minister and I think also now the Minister for Agriculture, that Landcare funding and Caring for our Country funding would be maintained in full by an incoming coalition government, we found through the budget that Landcare funding had been slashed by one-third. That is around $500 million lost by natural resource management bodies and Landcare organisations who for years have been doing extraordinary, expert work revegetating, cleaning up our waterways and dealing with the damage that has been done to Australia's environment over past decades and centuries. It is yet another broken promise from a government that has broken so many promises.


Very early on in its tenure, the new government came into this place to delist with no notice, as I recall, the Murray-below-Darling area, an area that had been listed as a threatened ecological community following expert scientific advice from the Threatened Species Scientific Committee. An application had been before the committee for some years and had been the subject of public consultation, particularly in the basin communities. The government came into this place with no notice and simply delisted it, on the back of a pretty baseless scare campaign stoked by the coalition in the Murray-Darling Basin communities.


This followed a decision of the new government to roll back the management plans of the world's largest system of marine reserves. It is proper that the largest system of marine reserves in the world be in Australia, an island nation with extraordinary ocean environmental assets, from the Great Barrier Reef and the Coral Sea to the Southern Ocean and the Indian Ocean on the west and the Pacific Ocean on the east. This was an extraordinary piece of work that was, again, done over a very extended period of time with stakeholders, with communities. But, again, it elicited nothing more than a baseless scare campaign from the coalition. Communities on the coast of Queensland, for example, were told that their recreational fishing activities would be interrupted by these reserves, notwithstanding that the reserves in Queensland are hundreds of kilometres off the coast. But for this government it was yet another great notch on the belt for environmental protection.


This government has also been very clear about its views on clean energy. We saw the Prime Minister in his stetson over the weekend in Houston, talking about the importance of affordable and reliable energy. No-one can disagree with the importance of affordable and reliable energy for households and for businesses in Australia or frankly anywhere else in the world. But you will never hear this Prime Minister use the words 'clean energy'. You will never hear this Prime Minister have a third pillar to Australia's energy policy that Australia's energy should be not only reliable and affordable for households and for businesses but also, as far as possible, clean. Instead, all we have seen from this government in its short tenure so far is attack after attack on Australia's clean energy sector. It is nothing short of a series of broken promises.


The Prime Minister and the Minister for the Environment were not willing and did not have the courage to go to the Australian people before the election and say, 'We don't support clean energy. We don't support the development of renewable energy in Australia. We want to tear down the renewable energy target. We want to abolish Australia's renewable energy agency.' They were not courageous enough to say that before the election. What they did say, including in the election campaign, was that the renewable energy target—the large-scale generation target of 41,000 gigawatt hours by 2020—was a completely bipartisan position, extending the bipartisan nature of renewable energy policy in this country to four elections.


For four elections the two major parties in Australia have had the same policy on the renewable energy target. And so it was in September 2013 when, during the election campaign, this minister's parliamentary secretary reiterated the coalition's support for the renewable energy target at a Clean Energy Council conference during the actual campaign. What we have seen since is the Prime Minister and other ministers crab-walk away from that commitment—yet another broken promise by this government that has broken so many promises.


This morning, we see in the newspaper that the backbench is no longer feeling at all constrained about its attacks on the clean energy policies of Australia; no longer feeling at all constrained about talking down this environment minister. They are quite happy to go on the record and contradict the environment minister and his statements on clean energy, to contradict a clearly stated election policy of the coalition made in September 2013.


In addition to that, we have seen over the last couple of days—just to start to round out the debacle around clean energy policy under this government, the solar roofs debacle. Yet again, someone, presumably a cabinet minister or someone in the finance part of the government—has leaked to the newspapers over the weekend against the environment minister, saying that he had no authority to go out and talk to the Australian community about their solar roofs policy. The so-called 'one million solar roofs policy' was going to cost $500 million. People had puzzled for months over where that money was coming from, after MYEFO, after the Mid-year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. People wondered whether maybe ARENA, the Australian Rnewable Energy Agency, was going to have to stump up the half a billion dollars because the Minister for the Environment kept reiterating, time and time again, that the 'one million solar roof households policy' was still government policy.


Over the weekend we had someone apologising for doing the Minister for the Environment over in the ERC and in cabinet. They said, 'Well, the minister had no authority to go out and talk to the people about this,' that this was a 2010 election commitment that they were not bound to implement after the 2013 election. The problem is that that ignores the fact that this minister had talked incessantly about this policy between 2010 and 2013. Indeed, he had talked incessantly about it after the September 2013 election campaign. So instead of $600 million supporting Australian low-income households to get PV solar panels on their roofs; instead of supporting solar towns and solar schools, also to be able to put PV solar on their roofs; instead of that $600 million of commitments made time and time again by this minister, what do we get? We get $2 million; instead of $600 million we got $2 million.




Mr Bowen:
  Less than one per cent.




Mr BUTLER:
  I cannot work it out. I think it is about 0.3 per cent. So we lost 99.97 per cent of the election commitment that he made, hand on heart. This so-called supporter of clean energy lost 9.97 per cent of his election commitment in the Expenditure Review Committee.


Just to round this out: the government, when in opposition, assured the Australian community that the Renewable Energy Agency was a bipartisan supported body. The important work that this agency does in supporting emerging renewable energy technology—solar thermal technology, wave technology and geothermal technology—the important work that ARENA has done, was supported by the coalition, as it was by the Labor Party. It was something where they put their hands on the hearts and said to the Australian people that it would not change if there were a change of government. This is yet another broken promise, because what did we find out? In MYEFO in December—the midyear economic and fiscal outlook—the Treasurer cut more than $400 million from ARENA's budget.


We puzzled: how were they going to deliver their solar roofs commitment? The clear answer to that was that they were not going to deliver the solar roofs commitment. But then in the budget, not only did they take money from ARENA they announced that the promise they had made to the Australian people about ARENA was going to be broken, and they were simply going to abolish the body altogether.


Not happy just with changing all these policies and breaking all these promises this government has also started to shut down community voices. We have seen them shut down strong, independent voices in the climate policy area. They have abolished the Climate Commission, which I am happy to say is able to continue its important work supported by Australians putting in money to the new Climate Council. We have seen this government attempt to abolish the Climate Change Authority, thus far unsuccessfully, because this government would not want strong, independent and objective advice from a group of experts on climate policy when it can make up its own in its ministerial offices.


Perhaps most egregiously, they have shut down community voices. They have completely stripped funding from the Australian Network of Environmental Defenders Offices. This is an organisation that does not provide legal support to the very big environmental NGOs. They can afford their own lawyers. The EDOs are there to provide pro bono legal advice and legal representation to small community groups to communities who have decided that they want to have a voice about a development in their area—near their houses, near their children's schools and near their workplaces. The EDOs have been there for 20 years, supported by the Keating government, supported for the whole duration of the Howard government and supported through the Rudd and Gillard governments. But this government cannot support them because they have a fundamental integral problem with there being strong independent voices in the debate other than their own.


Before I come to the specific impacts of this bill, I want to highlight how this government has sought to delist, to remove, 74,000 hectares from the Tasmanian World Heritage area. This is a prominent issue right now given that the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO is meeting over the course of this fortnight. This places Australia in refined company indeed. In the more than 40-year history of the World Heritage system, there have been only two such applications—one by Oman and one by Tanzania. This is an extraordinary application for this government to make. Happily, it got short shrift from the World Heritage Committee secretariat, which has provided a draft report to the committee that rejects the government's application outright. 


It is an application built on a falsity. It is an application built on some notion that these 74,000 hectares are degraded and not worthy of World Heritage listing. I have been there—I have been to the Upper Florentine areas in particular—and they are pristine. They are typical of the extraordinary wilderness you see in Tasmania, particularly on the western side of the state. They were the subject of strong, independent, expert advice to this government and to the World Heritage Committee. While Senator Colbeck might have some happy snaps which he claims show otherwise, I know which side of the debate our party will fall on. We will defend the listing of those 74,000 hectares.


Against that background, this bill is the crowning glory for a government intent on winding back Commonwealth environmental protection. It effectively just hands it all over. They are seeking to make the biggest structural change to environmental protection in Australia for 30 years. In the Franklin dam case the High Court, after the decision of the Hawke government to protect the Gordon and Franklin areas, affirmed the Commonwealth's role in protecting matters of national environmental significance. The court affirmed that the national government, the Commonwealth government of Australia, had a role in protecting certain aspects of Australia's natural environment and its biodiversity. From that decision and what followed under that government, Australia's environment became a national and international issue. Under the legal framework that followed the Franklin dam case, we saw the listing of that part of Tasmania. Subsequently, that listing of Tasmania's wilderness area was expanded. In addition, we saw World Heritage listing of Kakadu in the Northern Territory, the Daintree Wet Tropics in Far North Queensland and other areas as well. 


Following that, it must be stated, the current legislation was put in place by a Liberal minister—a South Australian, Robert Hill, a longstanding senator for the coalition and a one-time leader of the coalition in the Senate. He was a coalition senator who genuinely cared deeply about the environment. There are many things that you can argue about in the EPBC Act framework. There are many things that people who love Australia's natural environment would like to improve or change about this legislation. But it has a number of very good characteristics—and it was put in place by the Howard government. This bill, though, seeks to just throw over that legacy of the last 30 years. Whether it is the legacy of the Hawke and Keating governments, which achieved World Heritage listing for parts of Tasmania, for the Daintree, for Kakadu and for other areas, or whether it is the coalition's own legacy—the legacy of its own environment minister, Robert Hill, who put this framework in place—this government cares not a jot. This government cares not a jot and is willing to throw the whole thing overboard. 


We thought that they were just going to hand over the Commonwealth's environmental protection powers under the act to the state and territory governments, but we find, having looked at the legislation, that they also intend to hand such powers over to local councils. I am a big supporter of the role of local government in Australia, as is everyone on this side of the House. But there are question marks over the capacity of some local councils—and, frankly, some state and territory governments—to handle the scale of application that comes before the Commonwealth under the EPBC Act. 


The scope of this handover is extraordinary. What this government is doing is handing over responsibility for Australia's World Heritage areas—the Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu, the Daintree, the Tasmanian wilderness area, Ningaloo and many others—to the state governments and to local councils. This could see local councils along the Queensland coast having legal responsibility for the protection of one of the seven natural wonders of the world. You could see World Heritage areas handed over. You could see nuclear matters handed over. You could see local councils having responsibility for considering applications for uranium mines or for other nuclear issues which are currently under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth government. You could see the handover of the water trigger for coal seam gas applications and large coalmine applications that might impact on Australia's water resources. 


This government has not—not that I have seen at least—even tried to pretend that this bill will advance in any way the protection of Australia's natural environment. I have not heard one comment from the Minister for the Environment, the Prime Minister or anyone else saying that this is about improving the protection of Australia's natural environment. The only thing they say is that this is a response to lobbying from the business community. The business community is completely entitled to have a view about this, but there must within this debate—even on the side of the government—surely be some consideration of whether or not this is actually good for Australia's natural environment. Frankly, it is not. 


The Labor Party is on the record from when we were in government under Prime Minister Gillard as having looked at these questions and been very concerned about the level of duplication in environmental approval processes at state and Commonwealth levels. That is quite clearly on the record. Our government had a very strong record under the Seamless National Economy reforms of removing duplication of regulation wherever possible—in the areas of health and safety, food regulation and so many others. I think it was 16 or 17 areas—the shadow Treasurer, who is here, will remember—but certainly 15 to 20 areas of very important regulation were streamlined under the Labor government, so our record is quite clear. But our view after working through a process—talking with state governments, the business community, the environmental NGOs and the Australian community more broadly—was that it was not appropriate to hand over approval powers to state and territory governments. Certainly that would have been our view if we were asked to hand them over to local councils.


We are still more than willing to look at ways in which state and territory governments, on the one hand, and the Commonwealth can look at removing duplication of assessment processes because, at the end of the day, it is the assessment process that takes the time and involves the expenditure of substantial sums of money by proponent companies seeking a development. It is the assessment, not the approval, that involves the time and money. 


There are opportunities in a sensible discussion to look at ways in which you could have one environmental impact assessment process, one EIS, agreed with terms of reference that reflect the Commonwealth requirements and the state and territory requirements. There are circumstances in which you could agree to having one public consultation process instead of two. These are the things that take the time; these are the things that take the money from proponent companies. We are more than willing to continue to look at that. But at the end of the day we take as a matter of principle the view that matters of national environmental significance—which is the scope of matters covered by this legislation—must remain the province of a national government. That is not a party-political perspective. Whether it is a national coalition or national Labor government and whether they are state Labor or state Liberal governments, our view is the same: the Commonwealth should have responsibility for matters of national environmental significance, for a whole range of reasons that I have tried to outline.


I will refer to one more illustration of the problem involved in this legislation, and that is the question of downstream impacts. Some applications will involve impacts that cross state boundaries. There can be downstream impacts particularly sometimes dealing with water resources. The Great Artesian Basin, for example, is not conveniently located in one jurisdiction and the Murray-Darling Basin is not conveniently located in one state or one territory. Under existing legislation the minister must have regard to downstream impacts—something which a state minister simply cannot do. This is just one illustration of the impracticality, from an environmental protection and biodiversity conservation point of view, of this legislation.


I will finish by referring to the timing of the debate on this bill in this parliament. As I have indicated before, the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO is meeting this fortnight and dealing with two very important matters that concern Australia. The first is the status of the Great Barrier Reef as a World Heritage property. The other, which I referred to earlier, is whether or not the 74,000 hectares in the Tasmanian wilderness area should be kept on the register or delisted. Draft reports for both matters have been provided by the secretariat of the World Heritage Committee to committee members. We do not know what the final decision will be, obviously, as they are independent members of that committee, but the draft reports give some indication at least of the thinking of UNESCO.


In relation to the Great Barrier Reef, this is a very serious matter. I think we can all agree that the Great Barrier Reef not only is one of the seven natural wonders of the world but underpins literally billions of dollars of economic activity in the Queensland area and the work of 60,000 employees, largely in the tourism industry. This is an incredibly important matter for Australia from an environmental, social and economic perspective. The possibility that the reef would be put on the 'in danger' list would have very serious ramifications for Queensland's tourism industry, as much as it would reflect the very serious state of crisis that the reef finds itself in environmentally. The draft report provided by the secretariat to World Heritage Committee members refers expressly to this bill, to the idea that the Commonwealth's environmental protection powers would simply be handed over to the Queensland government. The secretariat's report provides that the draft recommendation to the committee considers:


… the transfer of decision-making powers from the Federal Level to the State Level … premature—


and should be postponed to allow further consideration. This is a draft report and the committee may well take a view that is different from that. But what is concerning is that I have not heard a jot about this from the environment minister. I have not heard a single response from the government about the interaction between this parliamentary debate and what is happening at an international level at the UNESCO meeting, particularly in light of the very clear recommendation from the World Heritage Committee. For all the reasons I have outlined, the opposition will not be supporting this legislation.

"Goodenough, Ian, MP",LP,2014-06-16,"



Mr GOODENOUGH
 (Moore) (12:43):  In speaking to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014, may I say from the outset that this bill is part of the government's wider program of deregulation and red tape reduction. It seeks to amend the EPBC Act 1999 to allow states and territories to be accredited for approval decisions, where states and territories can demonstrate that they will maintain the high environmental standards required by the EPBC Act. Memoranda of understanding will be signed with states and territories establishing a single system for environmental approvals under the EPBC Act. No longer will a separate Commonwealth assessment and approval under the EPBC Act be required where an accredited state approval is in place.


This bill also introduces a range of technical amendments to ensure the process can operate effectively and efficiently, providing much-needed certainty to industry. Although this bill is specifically targeted at developments which are likely to have a significant impact on water resources, the broader principle of removing the two-tier approvals system applies. In effect, it will create a single point for environmental approvals. It is designed to remove the duplication of federal and state approvals processes, which currently involves multiple layers of bureaucracy, creating uncertainty and delays. Delays to large projects of economic significance are adversely impacting industry, diminishing Australia's international competitiveness and holding back economic growth.


In commercial terms, securing private sector investment in development projects is the sustainable way to create economic growth, rather than relying on government spending. It is typically the case that securing the necessary planning approvals for major development projects can take more than six years, at the very least, which represents more than two federal election cycles. By contrast, the approvals processes in many emerging nations in our region are considerably timelier, placing Australia at a competitive disadvantage in attracting private investment capital for major projects. In addition, there is the element of increased holding costs, planning consultants' costs and the opportunity cost of delays. Australia now faces increasing competition for investment capital from emerging economies in Asia, Africa and South America. Therefore, government must implement reforms to create a more efficient planning approvals system to enable Australian industry to maintain its strategic competitive advantage.


In the 15 years that the EPBC Act 1999 has been in operation, a number of multimillion dollar projects have been delayed, costing the Australian economy billions of dollars in lost opportunity. One such example is the Ocean Reef Marina development in my electorate of Moore, which has encountered several years of delays in negotiating the highly complex planning approvals process. Delays are costly in terms of the opportunity cost of forgone revenue and amenity, as well as holding costs. It is estimated that the project will generate $800 million of investment that includes a mix of residential, commercial and retail uses, as well as provision of moorings for 850 recreational boats. The local community is overwhelmingly supportive of the concept plan.


The marina proposal covers 91 hectares in total, with 57.8 hectares of land based development and 33.6 hectares of development off the coast or on reclaimed land. Unfortunately, the marina project is required to be assessed under a two-tier system of state and federal approvals processes, which has considerably delayed progress since 2004. The project was determined a controlled action under the EPBC Act on 13 July 2009 due to potential impacts on listed threatened species and communities and listed migratory species. While the project was a controlled action, it was not possible to determine the appropriate assessment approach under the EPBC Act until the Western Australian government had decided on its assessment approach under state legislation. Similarly, the complex and bureaucratic approvals process must deal with issues relating to the Marmion Marine Park, Bush Forever, and Carnaby's black cockatoo.


At the state level, in July 2013 the City of Joondalup submitted a Metropolitan Region Scheme amendment to the Western Australian Planning Commission, together with technical information, including detailed studies on the environment, water quality, landscape, traffic and transport. The amendment is required to rezone the area from parks and recreation purpose to urban, to create additional waterways zones and to create new parks and recreation reserved lands.


In May 2014 the City of Joondalup referred the marine based components of the development to the Environmental Protection Authority for assessment under the state Environmental Protection Act 1986. The referral is in line with the Western Australian Planning Commission's referral of the land based components to the EPA as part of the initiation of a Metropolitan Region Scheme amendment to enable the development. The city's referral, under section 38 of the Environmental Protection Act, is based on detailed environmental studies. It is difficult to accurately predict time frames for this complex project; however, the concurrent review of both the environmental components and the MRS amendment will allow for consideration of the social, economic and environmental factors via a holistic planning and environmental assessment process. 


The environmental and planning assessment processes are consistent with the memorandum of understanding that the City of Joondalup signed with the state government in 2012. The planning process is ongoing, and it would greatly streamline the Ocean Reef Marina project if the approvals process could be managed by the Western Australian state government with minimal federal involvement.


A second example of a major project within the Moore electorate affected by delays is the Neerabup Industrial Area. It is a 1,000-hectare site which represents the second largest industrial complex in the Perth metropolitan area, second only to the Kwinana Industrial Area. When fully developed the industrial area is expected to create 20,000 new direct jobs, which are forecast to add $7.9 billion to gross state product and generate a further 24,000 jobs off site, for a total economic impact of $13.3 billion. Although there has been some significant investment since 2008, including the $436 million Newgen gas-fired power station and the $110 million Wesbeam manufacturing plant, development in the industrial area has been delayed due to the same bureaucratic two-tiered environmental approvals process and the need to provide infrastructure such as road access, scheme water and telecommunications.


An application was lodged by the West Australian land authority, LandCorp, under the EPBC Act in June 2012. It was determined a controlled action on 10 July 2012 due to potential impacts on listed threatened species, namely the Carnaby's black cockatoo and the forest red-tailed black cockatoo. The clearing of 202 hectares of bushland is required to enable the construction. On 11 October 2012 the delegate of the minister determined that the proposed action would be assessed through preliminary documentation and requested further information, including how the proponent proposed to mitigate impacts prior to and during construction and proposed environmental offsets. The planning approvals process for the Neerabup Industrial Area is ongoing and progress has been very slow. The process has taken more than a decade, which has delayed economic development and impacted on the employment self-sufficiency of the wider region, which is one of the fastest growing areas in Australia. 


In both cases there is significant merit for the environmental approvals processes to occur at a more decentralised level, with the state government being accredited to issue the necessary approvals, as distinct from the case being determined centrally. Local decisions are best made locally with the benefit of specific local knowledge. Similarly, there is merit in removing the two-tiered system of both federal and state involvement in the assessment and determination process. One level of government is sufficient.


This bill is part of the government's wider commitment to deregulation and red-tape reduction. Currently, the cost of compliance with government legislation and regulation continues to be a major impediment for business across Australia. If our domestic industry is to be competitive then the administrative burden of excessive bureaucracy must be lifted. Business leaders have raised concerns that their operations are being restricted by an increasingly complex multitiered regulatory system that is often so complex and technical that it is necessary to engage specialist consultants to achieve compliance. Those affected range from small businesses to large corporations engaged in multimillion-dollar projects. The cost of compliance, coupled with additional holding costs imposed by delays, has a detrimental effect on the financial viability of both business operations and key economic development projects.


The coalition government has introduced legislation in this parliament to repeal approximately 10,000 items of legislation and regulations equating to some 50,000 pages of text removed from the statute books. The repeals are wide-ranging across all ministerial portfolios, including the departments of the Attorney-General, civil aviation, defence, education, employment, environment, finance, and foreign affairs and trade. The estimated cost saving to the economy is in the order of $719 million per annum.


An efficient system of planning approvals is required to maintain the productivity and competitiveness of the Australian economy in the face of intensifying competition from emerging economies in our region. Industry needs more certainty and clarity when submitting planning applications for development approval. Competition for project finance within the market can be intense. In order to attract investment capital, it is desirable to reduce the element of risk. The government is committed to reforming the planning and environmental approvals system to make our economy more competitive.


The issue of affordability of land for housing and commercial purposes is very topical on the national agenda. The available supply of land zoned for development is directly impacted by the efficiency of the planning and environmental approvals process. Therefore, it must be a priority for government to reform the current system to make it more responsive in the interests of promoting greater land affordability for all Australians.


In summary, this bill is designed to replace the current two-tiered system of duplication of federal and state approvals processes, which currently adds multiple layers of bureaucracy, creating uncertainty and delay. It seeks to amend the EPBC Act to allow states and territories to be accredited for approvals decisions, where states and territories can demonstrate that they will maintain the high environmental standards required by the EPBC Act. In effect, it creates a one-stop shop for environmental approvals, which in turn promotes productivity, competitiveness and economic development. I commend the bill to the House.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2014-06-16,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (12:57):  I rise to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014. Most people in this country want our precious environment protected. People look at icons such as the forests in Tasmania, the Great Barrier Reef and our waterways and they want them protected, not only for future generations but also for the livelihoods of the many people who depend on them. People also know that the federal government, with strong federal protections, is very often the best place to protect the environment, because you do not need to look very far to see that state governments can be very quickly captured by developers, by mining interests or by logging interests, with the environment coming a poor second. For example, if we did not have the federal government able to step in and protect the environment, then the Franklin would have been dammed. You do not have to look much further than the New South Wales state government and what is going on at the moment in ICAC with the current and previous governments to understand at a state level just how closely interconnected ministers and decision makers are with the interests of those who would threaten the environment. It is for that reason that most people would support the idea of there being strong national protections for the and would support decisions about enforcing those protections being made at a national level. Unfortunately, what we have seen under the previous Labor government and under this government is an attack on that principle. Towards the end of the last government, as the shadow minister suggested, the possibility was floated that some of the decisions about protecting iconic places should be shifted to state governments. The Greens stood side by side with the community to fight that proposal off, but it is now coming back again on steroids from this government. This government is perhaps the most hostile government towards the environment, and this Prime Minister is the most hostile prime minister towards the environment, that this country has ever seen. 


This bill would allow not just state governments but also, in some instances, even local governments to determine the level of protection afforded to some of the most precious places in this country, including places that are World Heritage listed. This bill puts the fox in charge of the hen house. It gives away the administration of, for example, federal protection for water from significant impacts of coal or coal seam gas—the water trigger. It gives away that protection to state governments who, as we have seen, cannot make coal seam gas roll out quickly enough. It allows state processes to be accredited to take the place of federal approvals, but also allows those processes to be in guidelines, plans or policies—that is, not even enshrined in laws. So the protections now will not just be devolved from the federal to the state governments, but the state governments will not even have to put those protections in legislation. In short, this bill makes former Prime Minister John Howard's environmental legislation even weaker and takes away the Minister for the Environment's main job, which is supposedly to protect the environment—not that we have seen a lot of evidence of that.


This government has launched itself down the environmentally reckless path of handing responsibility for these places to state and territory governments. They have already embarked on it, even before this bill, by signing draft approval bilateral agreements with the New South Wales and Queensland governments to see these critical national responsibilities palmed off to Premiers Newman and O'Farrell—and they are well known for their staunch protection of the environment! They hope to have agreements finalised with all states and territories by September 2014. If this plan proceeds, the federal government could not protect World Heritage areas from big mines nor threatened species from being sent to extinction by state governments approving major developments in key habitats. It would mean that the federal government could not have stopped the Franklin River being dammed; nor could it have stopped oil rigs in the Great Barrier Reef. This so-called one-stop shop for business sells out our environment and overturns 30 years of gradually increasing and greatly needed Commonwealth involvement in environmental protection. If it proceeds, it will put Premier Denis Napthine in my home state of Victoria in sole control of whether to put cattle in the Alpine National Park; it will put Premier Campbell Newman in Queensland in sole control of the world heritage great Barrier Reef; and it will put Premier Mike Baird in New South Wales in sole control of whether to send koalas to extinction.


The draft bilateral agreements say there will be a reserve call-in power for the federal government to step back in, but this test is higher than the current protections the act gives and, with staff being slashed from the department—and from assessment in particular—the likelihood of call-ins is remote. The EPBC Act, the main legislation that is being amended, already only applies to the worst proposals which have the biggest impact on the environment and already affects only a sliver of projects, and this bill proposes to lessen it further. 


As I have alluded to, this bill rolls back crucial federal water protections from coal and coal seam gas that were established in the last parliament, where the Greens worked together with rural Independents and the government to make sure that state and territory governments did not have the final say over the proposals which are potentially damaging to our water resources. This bill hands off that water trigger, which was designed to create federal protection for our water resources in response to legitimate and strong community concern, to state or territory governments to administer. But the federal government stepped in because the states had done such an atrocious job of letting coal seam gas run rampant. This now allows those very same state and territory governments to have the final say. As I have said, we are putting the fox in charge of the hen house, but we are now adding water to the long list of other nationally significant matters that the states will be in charge of—matters such as the World Heritage Tasmanian forests and the Great Barrier Reef and, crucially, nationally listed threatened species. In my home state of Victoria, we are on the verge of making our faunal emblem—the Leadbeater's Possum—extinct, because state governments of various stripes over many years have seen it as a greater priority to destroy forests in which these species live for short-term gain and for very little economic return—in fact it has to be subsidised—and in return we will wipe out our faunal emblem. The federal protections are the one last hope; we are going to see threatened species handed holus-bolus over to state governments. This will also apply to our Ramsar wetlands; we sign up to an international convention to protect our wetlands and then we allow not only state governments but also potentially even local governments to have the final say over them.


Crucially, nuclear actions are also covered by this legislation. I cannot believe that this government proposes that we should allow a local council to have the final say over whether protections enshrined in federal law relating to nuclear activity are going to be met! But when this government says the country is open for business, they mean it. You can have any kind of business, anywhere you like, and if there are any federal protections—just go and have a chat with the local council and you can sign yourself out of them. Deputy Speaker, these environmental protections that you see in our legislation—and people would think, 'well, good; we have got some protections there, protecting our World Heritage listed places'—will not be worth the paper they are written on—because all a developer has to do is go and sign up a local government or a state government, and they can contract out of those protections: everything from threatened species to nuclear actions.


In addition, we have seen the gutting of the national water project—on top of what is an environmental disaster of a budget. The water trigger question is crucial; there is a reason that so much time was spent in the last parliament debating it. People are, rightly, worried that we do not yet know what the impact of coal seam gas mining, or coalmining, or fracking, is on our water tables. But we are proceeding as if everything is going to be fine. What you are seeing, Deputy Speaker, is that right around the country, people—not just those in the inner city who might have voted for me but also people in rural areas who might otherwise have voted for another party—saying, 'Well, hang on: something is fundamentally wrong if we are allowing coal seam gas mining and fracking right next to, or in, our water tables, and we don't know the effect of it'. In the last parliament, we spent a lot of time working out how to deal with that, and we put in place the water trigger that I have referred to. That gives a minimum of protection to those communities, and to everyone who relies on our water tables and on our aquifers. It gives a minimum of protection before coal seam gas mining and coalmining can take place. The Greens would like to see it go a lot further; but we do not want to see it go backwards—and the community does not want the protections to go backwards. I think the community is increasingly horrified at the attacks that this government is perpetrating not just on people but also on the environment.


It is not just state and local governments; the bill allows the minister to accredit any agency to make a decision under this act. So decisions on impacts could be made by bodies which are wholly unqualified and under-resourced. It is very clear from this bill that the government does not care which agency makes the decision—state, local or any other. The government is washing their hands of their responsibility to protect internationally significant environmental icons.


These accredited processes can be enshrined in policy or in guidelines, rather than in legislation, which, potentially, makes them even unenforceable. If this bill passes and these processes are not even required to be in state laws, we can have absolutely no confidence that federal environmental standards will be maintained. It is no surprise when you think about who backs and who bankrolls the party sitting in government, but the government seemingly do not understand the concept of conflict of interest. They are ignoring 30 years of environmental reform, and the vast track records of states as environmental vandals—and all the while claiming that environmental standards will be maintained. Amazingly—because they do not understand the concept of conflict of interest—the government is proposing to hand off powers to approve development where the state government itself is the proponent. So, despite the statement by the minister, Greg Hunt, in an interview on 13 September 2013 on ABC Radio in which he reiterated that the government would keep powers where states were 'likely to have a significant conflict of interest', they have now gone back on that as well: another backflip from the Minister for the Environment, and from this government. The state government will say, 'we want to build this project'—and the state government will be in charge of determining whether that project does or does not meet the environmental protections in federal legislation. The state government will be able to write its own ticket to proceed. And there is nothing the federal government can do about it, because the state will be the only one determining whether or not that project is able to go ahead. Anyone who has watched what state governments do in their approach to development will shirk from this bill in horror.


We will not be supporting this bill. I am pleased it is going to be defeated, at least in this Senate, and I hope it will be defeated in the next Senate.

"Hawke, Alex, MP",LP,2014-06-16,"



Mr HAWKE
 (Mitchell) (13:13):  I rise to endorse the government's approach to creating one-stop shops for environmental approvals. I note that the member for Melbourne and the previous shadow minister seemed to miss the whole point of this bill; they could benefit from a close reading of it, because it was the Labor-Greens government who had already proposed that we go to one-stop shops and that we have bilateral agreements. If it was good enough for the previous government to come up with this idea and to work towards these goals, then it is certainly good enough for the government to follow through and ensure that the job gets done, that it gets done properly and that we reduce the duplication and unnecessary waste between layers of government in getting approvals.


Of course, if it was up to the member for Melbourne, there would not be any approvals. He would seek to stop all major economic activity, and that is the well stated and understood policy of the Australian Greens. The rest of us have to have a system where we have legislation that is strong in protecting the environment but allows for the proper conduct of economic activity and business. It is the case today that there is too much duplication between state and federal levels, in terms of environmental approvals, for no environmental benefit. The shadow minister in particular, who is a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment—of which I am the chair—would benefit from coming to our current hearing into green tape and one-stop shops. In fact we have a hearing on this Friday, which I would invite the shadow minister to attend, because when you hear from industry groups and other organisations—and we are still conducting our inquiry—it is good to hear the direct feedback and the experiences of people putting forward major economic activity at state and federal level and the duplication and the waste that they go through for what you have to say is very little environmental benefit at all.


In examining the provisions of this bill it is very significant that there will not be a weakening in environmental standards. The member for Melbourne seems to be very concerned about it and just says, ergo, any state government is an environmental vandal—just because he says so! Yet we know that that is not the case. State and territory regimes in relation to environmental protection have very strident protections—in some cases, too strident. In some cases they are appropriate and in many cases they are doing what the Commonwealth does as well. So it is not the case just to say that states will be bad for the environment and the Commonwealth will be good for the environment. It is not a logical argument and it does not make a lot of sense; it is quite a lot of hyperbole and hysteria from the member for Melbourne. In fact, by working very closely with the states and territories the Commonwealth can ensure that high standards under the EPBC Act are maintained. 


When you look at the provisions of this bill, particularly if we have concerns about the water trigger, the government is moving an amendment here to make sure that the latest science and independent science is examined. The amendment that is being proposed by the minister—to have an independent scientific committee on coal seam gas and large coalmining development—is a good one. It ensures that comprehensive environmental assessments can continue and they include that robust and independent science. That should allay the fears of the member for Melbourne if he is being genuine in the claim that he actually wants to see good environmental legislation. Having an independent scientific committee will ensure that the latest science is delivered through to the states to make sure that the best protections are maintained.


It simply is not the case that local councils can approve nuclear facilities under these proposed amendments. It is absolute hysteria again from the member for Melbourne to make that suggestion. We have seen a lot of scare campaigns on nuclear science. The member for Melbourne lectures us regularly in this House about listening to science. Even though he knows nothing about science himself, he is a self-appointed scientific expert when it comes to climate change. But we are not allowed to look at nuclear science, of course, and the great benefits of nuclear science, because he does not agree with it. Simply because he does not agree with the science he wants to be a nuclear sceptic. But he will lecture us at other junctures about climate science at his own leisure. The injection into this debate about councils having the ability to approve nuclear facilities is completely unwelcome. It is completely untrue. 


This bill is providing a series of technical amendments to facilitate the implementation of bilateral agreements and provide for the highest possible standards. It will give the certainty that proponents need about the practical operation of bilateral agreements. It removes the need for proponents to make referrals to the Commonwealth. But at the same time it can also then take into account changes in state jurisdictions' legislation and policy plans for the environment, recognising that they are regularly updated in accordance with the latest science, which is something member for Melbourne should welcome in relation to the flexibility that these technical amendments provide. That is, there will not need to be a stalling of the process between the Commonwealth and states when new science and environmental standards are incorporated by states. If they are consistent with the protections under the EPBC Act then that flexibility will allow for easier delivery of such standards and an improved policy and accreditation process through these technicalities rather than constant delay and uncertainty for business.


It is important to provide ongoing certainty to the community about the operation of these bilateral agreements. It is important that the minister in particular has gone out of his way to ensure that environmental protections are maintained under the EPBC Act and that the latest science is included in relation to decisions made under any bilateral agreements. The bill demonstrates the government's ongoing commitment to implementing genuine reform. It is good that the previous government started this. If you listened to the shadow minister's speech you would have thought that this was some crazy notion of the Abbott government. Of course we know that the previous Labor-Greens government was also looking at this very closely, improving one-stop shops and bilateral agreements with states to deliver environmental decision making. That is welcome. Their role in opposition is not to oppose just for the sake of it every single thing that comes through this chamber, and the shadow minister really gave a speech that was along those lines.


This is a good bill. It makes good improvements, allowing for the Commonwealth to facilitate bilateral agreements with the states which will enable better cooperation between the Commonwealth and states, and deliver better outcomes for the environment and for business. So I implore the Labor Party and the Greens to stop simply opposing for the sake of opposing and recognise that they had looked at this work as well; that this is good for relations between the Commonwealth and the states; that this will be good for business and economic activity and also environmental standards, delivering more flexibility in relation to her standards between the states and the Commonwealth; and that, with the latest science being incorporated into many things like the water trigger, this will produce a better outcome. 


The member for Melbourne also expressed his concerns about the water trigger, saying how much detailed work and what a long process he went through. Unfortunately for him, those of us who were here in the last parliament remember the process in relation to the water trigger amendment and the obscene haste with which the former government changed its position at one minute to midnight, after it had been against the water trigger. Let us be very clear: the former government knew the water trigger was not a good idea and they knew it would lead to duplicate processes for minimum environmental benefit. The last government was holding out against the Independents on this. There was a last-minute reversal where the water trigger was adopted at the very last second, even though the former government really did not want to accept the water trigger. Every one of us here in that parliament remembers that. I think the Australian community should remember that. 


It is important to note that this bill provides significant protection with its assessment and accreditation processes and the important referral to the independent scientific panel so the latest science and the independent advice about coal seam gas and the water science that is available will be available for decision makers. You cannot do better than that. As the member for Melbourne regularly implores us, we should listen to the science. This bill will make the necessary amendments to ensure that these bilateral agreements can be delivered between the states and the Commonwealth, and I strongly recommend the bill to the House.

Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (13:22):  It is a pleasure to rise to oppose the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014, which—as my colleague and namesake, the shadow minister has pointed out—has nothing to do with protecting the environment or conserving biodiversity. This bill does nothing for either of those things. It amends the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to facilitate the Australian government delegating environmental approval powers to state and local governments.


Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta, coming from Queensland, as do you, I strongly oppose this move. I do not want Campbell Newman, Jeff Seeney or the Queensland Coordinator-General having the power to approve developments in the Great Barrier Reef. This bill, along with the bilateral agreements being developed, will mean that World Heritage sites, nuclear activity—such as uranium mining—and species protected under international treaties will be put in the hands of state governments, including the Newman government.


Labor oppose this bill, because we believe the national government is responsible for matters of national environmental significance. The Australian government has the responsibility for protecting Australia's precious environment, and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, in particular, accounts for matters of national environmental significance. The Abbott government, unfortunately, has no interest in protecting Australia's environment for the future. I was as surprised as anyone to hear the Prime Minister refer to himself as a conservationist, in recent days, given that the track record appears to point to the opposite conclusion. Since coming to government, Mr Abbott and Mr Hunt have made bad decision upon bad decision that have hurt our environment. This bill is the furthest they have gone in terms of putting our environment at risk of irreparable damage by leaving decisions of national environmental significance to state premiers and their ministers and, in the case of Queensland, to unelected persons as well.


The Newman government is an example of why state governments should not be trusted with managing our environment. Last week, the Queensland parliament considered rushed changes to the environmental approvals laws of the state which are complementary to the changes in this bill. The Newman government has attached the changes to a bill about a much less controversial topic. As my state colleague the member for Mackay said in that debate:


There is no need for the legislative changes to give the Queensland government power to issue federal environmental approvals—


to be attached to that much less controversial bill. He continues:


These changes could have been in a stand-alone bill and scrutinised in its own committee inquiry. The attachment of the legislative changes to give effect to the Abbott-Newman deal to hand federal environmental approvals to the state is sneaky and underhanded. The rush to effect these legislative changes is unnecessary.


That was what he had to say in respect of the complementary legislation in the Queensland parliament last week. During the same debate, my colleague the state member for South Brisbane said:


The EPBC Act is the most important piece of environmental legislation in Australia. The matters of national environmental significance that the EPBC Act protects are: matters of World Heritage, national heritage, wetlands of international importance … threatened species and communities … migratory species, protection of the environment from nuclear actions, the marine environment, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the protection of water resources from CSG and mining.


It is particularly important to note what the member for South Brisbane said in relation to the Newman government's record when it comes to the environment:


We are privileged to live alongside some of the greatest natural wonders in the world … Sadly, the Newman government has proved it cannot be trusted to protect our natural environment. The Newman government has systematically stripped away vital environmental protections, leaving our precious natural heritage at risk.


She then went over the following list:


They overturned Labor's 23-year ban on uranium mining in Queensland. They ended the moratorium on shale oil mining and refinement … They extended sandmining on North Stradbroke Island up to 2035 … They introduced legislation … to repeal wild rivers declarations. They scrapped a world-class coastal management policy. They encouraged interstate companies to dump waste in South-East Queensland landfills. They stripped away statutory protection for native vegetation … They have made it harder for community groups to appeal environmental approvals.


As my colleague said:


The fact that the Abbott government has looked at this record and still decided to hand over its powers to the Newman government is a shocking indictment of its own environmental credentials.


As you can see from what the member for South Brisbane had to say, there is cause for concern about handing over powers to the Newman government when it comes to the environment. She is not the only person who is worried about their record. The Friends of the Earth in Brisbane wrote to me with particular concerns about handing over powers with respect to uranium, but with concerns also more generally about the bill and the handover of powers. The Newman government's record on the environment has been slammed by its own Auditor-General, who, in a report tabled in April, has said that the Department of Environment and Heritage Protection:


… is exposing the state to liability and the environment to harm unnecessarily.


We cannot trust the Newman government, given its track record. That is particularly so when it comes to the Great Barrier Reef. It is one of the great wonders of our natural world. Like lots of Queenslanders, as a child I visited the reef on a number of occasions. I want others to be able to have the same experience. I fear that with the Newman government in charge people will not be able to have that same experience. I am not alone in my concern. 


I congratulate WWF-Australia and the Australian Marine Conservation Society for their joint campaign Fight for the Reef. They and many of my constituents are greatly concerned about the way that developments are affecting the reef. The campaign is presently focused on the UNESCO World Heritage Committee's upcoming decision about the reef. The committee has commenced its meeting from 15 to 25 June, which is being held in Doha. It is considering a draft decision that explicitly warns Australia that the changes to be made by the bill that we are debating today are premature. It also states that the committee is concerned about dredging and dumping near the reef. The relevant provisions of the draft decision that the committee is considering are as follows:


The World Heritage Committee … Requests the State Party to ensure the full completion of the independent review of the institutional and management arrangements for the property, as recommended by the 2012 reactive monitoring mission, as a key input to the LTPSD—


Long Term Plan for Sustainable Development—


and considers that the transfer of decision-making power from Federal to State levels, before the vision, framework with desired outcomes and targets, and governance requirements to deliver the LTPSD have been adopted, is premature, and should be postponed to allow further consideration …


Those are not my words; they are those of the UNESCO World Heritage committee, and we ought to consider them. The committee also expressly recorded its concern about the government approval for dumping three million cubic metres of dredge material inside the property, which is very near the reef, prior to having undertaken a comprehensive assessment of alternative, potentially less impacting, development and disposal options.


The draft decision is crucial. The committee has put Australia on notice. We need to do better when it comes to the reef. Specifically, the committee has warned us that if there is not substantial progress on the key issues they have identified, they may include the reef on the List of World Heritage in Danger. The Newman government claims that tourism is one of the pillars of the Queensland economy. If the reef is listed as World Heritage in Danger that will be a blow to tourism. Just today TheCairns Post published an article that said:


TOURISM leaders say the Far North's reputation as a top holiday destination—

"Butler, Mark, MP",ALP,2014-06-16,"



Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide) (12:13):  I rise to speak in opposition to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014. We oppose the bill because it does nothing either for environmental protection or for biodiversity conservation, a theme that people have come now to expect from this government—doing nothing for environmental protection or biodiversity conservation.


Over the weekend, or very late last week, the Prime Minister, during his whirlwind tour on climate change politics in Europe and North America, described himself as a conservationist. This was a tour on which I hope the Prime Minister received a reality check about where his policy stands, where it sits in the context of a very fast-moving set of international developments on climate change policy. While in Canada, the Prime Minister tried to verbal, frankly, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, countries with very highly developed carbon trading policies, as members of some new 'coalition of the unwilling' led by the Prime Minister and the Canadian Prime Minister to seek to stymie international efforts to develop a strong, ambitious agreement around climate change at next year's Paris agreement. The New Zealand Prime Minister was very clear that he had not been consulted by the Australian Prime Minister on this so-called coalition of the unwilling. He was caught completely unawares, apparently, by the Prime Minister's statement in Canada. And the United Kingdom's response was to reiterate its strong commitment to taking strong and sensible action on climate change both domestically and as part of a growing coalition for change in the lead-in to the Paris negotiations next year.


But the Australian people judge prime ministers and all of us in this House on their actions, not on their words. No matter how many times the Prime Minister might describe himself as a conservationist, anyone who pays even cursory attention to this government's policies and this Prime Minister's actions knows that the contrary is true. Indeed, the Independent newspaper in the United Kingdom got it much more closely right than did the Prime Minister in his self-description. That newspaper, on 4 February this year, posed the question that has been on so many Australians' lips when it asked:


Is Tony Abbott's Australian administration the most hostile to his nation's environment in history?


That is a question that is on so many lips in Australia, particularly the lips of those Australians who hold our natural environment so dear.


This is not something of which the Prime Minister seems particularly ashamed—this growing reputation, not only domestically but internationally, that his administration, his government, is the most hostile to Australia's extraordinary natural environment in Australian history. The only words this Prime Minister can conjure for his environment minister is to quote the number of mining developments the minister has approved. Now, that is indeed a role of the environment minister under the existing legislation, and Australia is a jurisdiction that is resources based. But the environment minister must be more than an assistant minister for resources. The environment minister must be more than a minister who simply ticks off on mining developments. Surely this many months into the environment minister's tenure the Prime Minister could think of something that this government has done that actually involved protecting the environment, that actually involved conserving Australia's extraordinary biodiversity. But there is not a single achievement.


The only record this government has is a long, long record of winding back environmental protections. I am just going to mention a few to give some shape to the debate on this legislation. Notwithstanding a very clear commitment before the election from the environment minister and I think also now the Minister for Agriculture, that Landcare funding and Caring for our Country funding would be maintained in full by an incoming coalition government, we found through the budget that Landcare funding had been slashed by one-third. That is around $500 million lost by natural resource management bodies and Landcare organisations who for years have been doing extraordinary, expert work revegetating, cleaning up our waterways and dealing with the damage that has been done to Australia's environment over past decades and centuries. It is yet another broken promise from a government that has broken so many promises.


Very early on in its tenure, the new government came into this place to delist with no notice, as I recall, the Murray-below-Darling area, an area that had been listed as a threatened ecological community following expert scientific advice from the Threatened Species Scientific Committee. An application had been before the committee for some years and had been the subject of public consultation, particularly in the basin communities. The government came into this place with no notice and simply delisted it, on the back of a pretty baseless scare campaign stoked by the coalition in the Murray-Darling Basin communities.


This followed a decision of the new government to roll back the management plans of the world's largest system of marine reserves. It is proper that the largest system of marine reserves in the world be in Australia, an island nation with extraordinary ocean environmental assets, from the Great Barrier Reef and the Coral Sea to the Southern Ocean and the Indian Ocean on the west and the Pacific Ocean on the east. This was an extraordinary piece of work that was, again, done over a very extended period of time with stakeholders, with communities. But, again, it elicited nothing more than a baseless scare campaign from the coalition. Communities on the coast of Queensland, for example, were told that their recreational fishing activities would be interrupted by these reserves, notwithstanding that the reserves in Queensland are hundreds of kilometres off the coast. But for this government it was yet another great notch on the belt for environmental protection.


This government has also been very clear about its views on clean energy. We saw the Prime Minister in his stetson over the weekend in Houston, talking about the importance of affordable and reliable energy. No-one can disagree with the importance of affordable and reliable energy for households and for businesses in Australia or frankly anywhere else in the world. But you will never hear this Prime Minister use the words 'clean energy'. You will never hear this Prime Minister have a third pillar to Australia's energy policy that Australia's energy should be not only reliable and affordable for households and for businesses but also, as far as possible, clean. Instead, all we have seen from this government in its short tenure so far is attack after attack on Australia's clean energy sector. It is nothing short of a series of broken promises.


The Prime Minister and the Minister for the Environment were not willing and did not have the courage to go to the Australian people before the election and say, 'We don't support clean energy. We don't support the development of renewable energy in Australia. We want to tear down the renewable energy target. We want to abolish Australia's renewable energy agency.' They were not courageous enough to say that before the election. What they did say, including in the election campaign, was that the renewable energy target—the large-scale generation target of 41,000 gigawatt hours by 2020—was a completely bipartisan position, extending the bipartisan nature of renewable energy policy in this country to four elections.


For four elections the two major parties in Australia have had the same policy on the renewable energy target. And so it was in September 2013 when, during the election campaign, this minister's parliamentary secretary reiterated the coalition's support for the renewable energy target at a Clean Energy Council conference during the actual campaign. What we have seen since is the Prime Minister and other ministers crab-walk away from that commitment—yet another broken promise by this government that has broken so many promises.


This morning, we see in the newspaper that the backbench is no longer feeling at all constrained about its attacks on the clean energy policies of Australia; no longer feeling at all constrained about talking down this environment minister. They are quite happy to go on the record and contradict the environment minister and his statements on clean energy, to contradict a clearly stated election policy of the coalition made in September 2013.


In addition to that, we have seen over the last couple of days—just to start to round out the debacle around clean energy policy under this government, the solar roofs debacle. Yet again, someone, presumably a cabinet minister or someone in the finance part of the government—has leaked to the newspapers over the weekend against the environment minister, saying that he had no authority to go out and talk to the Australian community about their solar roofs policy. The so-called 'one million solar roofs policy' was going to cost $500 million. People had puzzled for months over where that money was coming from, after MYEFO, after the Mid-year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. People wondered whether maybe ARENA, the Australian Rnewable Energy Agency, was going to have to stump up the half a billion dollars because the Minister for the Environment kept reiterating, time and time again, that the 'one million solar roof households policy' was still government policy.


Over the weekend we had someone apologising for doing the Minister for the Environment over in the ERC and in cabinet. They said, 'Well, the minister had no authority to go out and talk to the people about this,' that this was a 2010 election commitment that they were not bound to implement after the 2013 election. The problem is that that ignores the fact that this minister had talked incessantly about this policy between 2010 and 2013. Indeed, he had talked incessantly about it after the September 2013 election campaign. So instead of $600 million supporting Australian low-income households to get PV solar panels on their roofs; instead of supporting solar towns and solar schools, also to be able to put PV solar on their roofs; instead of that $600 million of commitments made time and time again by this minister, what do we get? We get $2 million; instead of $600 million we got $2 million.




Mr Bowen:
  Less than one per cent.




Mr BUTLER:
  I cannot work it out. I think it is about 0.3 per cent. So we lost 99.97 per cent of the election commitment that he made, hand on heart. This so-called supporter of clean energy lost 9.97 per cent of his election commitment in the Expenditure Review Committee.


Just to round this out: the government, when in opposition, assured the Australian community that the Renewable Energy Agency was a bipartisan supported body. The important work that this agency does in supporting emerging renewable energy technology—solar thermal technology, wave technology and geothermal technology—the important work that ARENA has done, was supported by the coalition, as it was by the Labor Party. It was something where they put their hands on the hearts and said to the Australian people that it would not change if there were a change of government. This is yet another broken promise, because what did we find out? In MYEFO in December—the midyear economic and fiscal outlook—the Treasurer cut more than $400 million from ARENA's budget.


We puzzled: how were they going to deliver their solar roofs commitment? The clear answer to that was that they were not going to deliver the solar roofs commitment. But then in the budget, not only did they take money from ARENA they announced that the promise they had made to the Australian people about ARENA was going to be broken, and they were simply going to abolish the body altogether.


Not happy just with changing all these policies and breaking all these promises this government has also started to shut down community voices. We have seen them shut down strong, independent voices in the climate policy area. They have abolished the Climate Commission, which I am happy to say is able to continue its important work supported by Australians putting in money to the new Climate Council. We have seen this government attempt to abolish the Climate Change Authority, thus far unsuccessfully, because this government would not want strong, independent and objective advice from a group of experts on climate policy when it can make up its own in its ministerial offices.


Perhaps most egregiously, they have shut down community voices. They have completely stripped funding from the Australian Network of Environmental Defenders Offices. This is an organisation that does not provide legal support to the very big environmental NGOs. They can afford their own lawyers. The EDOs are there to provide pro bono legal advice and legal representation to small community groups to communities who have decided that they want to have a voice about a development in their area—near their houses, near their children's schools and near their workplaces. The EDOs have been there for 20 years, supported by the Keating government, supported for the whole duration of the Howard government and supported through the Rudd and Gillard governments. But this government cannot support them because they have a fundamental integral problem with there being strong independent voices in the debate other than their own.


Before I come to the specific impacts of this bill, I want to highlight how this government has sought to delist, to remove, 74,000 hectares from the Tasmanian World Heritage area. This is a prominent issue right now given that the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO is meeting over the course of this fortnight. This places Australia in refined company indeed. In the more than 40-year history of the World Heritage system, there have been only two such applications—one by Oman and one by Tanzania. This is an extraordinary application for this government to make. Happily, it got short shrift from the World Heritage Committee secretariat, which has provided a draft report to the committee that rejects the government's application outright. 


It is an application built on a falsity. It is an application built on some notion that these 74,000 hectares are degraded and not worthy of World Heritage listing. I have been there—I have been to the Upper Florentine areas in particular—and they are pristine. They are typical of the extraordinary wilderness you see in Tasmania, particularly on the western side of the state. They were the subject of strong, independent, expert advice to this government and to the World Heritage Committee. While Senator Colbeck might have some happy snaps which he claims show otherwise, I know which side of the debate our party will fall on. We will defend the listing of those 74,000 hectares.


Against that background, this bill is the crowning glory for a government intent on winding back Commonwealth environmental protection. It effectively just hands it all over. They are seeking to make the biggest structural change to environmental protection in Australia for 30 years. In the Franklin dam case the High Court, after the decision of the Hawke government to protect the Gordon and Franklin areas, affirmed the Commonwealth's role in protecting matters of national environmental significance. The court affirmed that the national government, the Commonwealth government of Australia, had a role in protecting certain aspects of Australia's natural environment and its biodiversity. From that decision and what followed under that government, Australia's environment became a national and international issue. Under the legal framework that followed the Franklin dam case, we saw the listing of that part of Tasmania. Subsequently, that listing of Tasmania's wilderness area was expanded. In addition, we saw World Heritage listing of Kakadu in the Northern Territory, the Daintree Wet Tropics in Far North Queensland and other areas as well. 


Following that, it must be stated, the current legislation was put in place by a Liberal minister—a South Australian, Robert Hill, a longstanding senator for the coalition and a one-time leader of the coalition in the Senate. He was a coalition senator who genuinely cared deeply about the environment. There are many things that you can argue about in the EPBC Act framework. There are many things that people who love Australia's natural environment would like to improve or change about this legislation. But it has a number of very good characteristics—and it was put in place by the Howard government. This bill, though, seeks to just throw over that legacy of the last 30 years. Whether it is the legacy of the Hawke and Keating governments, which achieved World Heritage listing for parts of Tasmania, for the Daintree, for Kakadu and for other areas, or whether it is the coalition's own legacy—the legacy of its own environment minister, Robert Hill, who put this framework in place—this government cares not a jot. This government cares not a jot and is willing to throw the whole thing overboard. 


We thought that they were just going to hand over the Commonwealth's environmental protection powers under the act to the state and territory governments, but we find, having looked at the legislation, that they also intend to hand such powers over to local councils. I am a big supporter of the role of local government in Australia, as is everyone on this side of the House. But there are question marks over the capacity of some local councils—and, frankly, some state and territory governments—to handle the scale of application that comes before the Commonwealth under the EPBC Act. 


The scope of this handover is extraordinary. What this government is doing is handing over responsibility for Australia's World Heritage areas—the Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu, the Daintree, the Tasmanian wilderness area, Ningaloo and many others—to the state governments and to local councils. This could see local councils along the Queensland coast having legal responsibility for the protection of one of the seven natural wonders of the world. You could see World Heritage areas handed over. You could see nuclear matters handed over. You could see local councils having responsibility for considering applications for uranium mines or for other nuclear issues which are currently under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth government. You could see the handover of the water trigger for coal seam gas applications and large coalmine applications that might impact on Australia's water resources. 


This government has not—not that I have seen at least—even tried to pretend that this bill will advance in any way the protection of Australia's natural environment. I have not heard one comment from the Minister for the Environment, the Prime Minister or anyone else saying that this is about improving the protection of Australia's natural environment. The only thing they say is that this is a response to lobbying from the business community. The business community is completely entitled to have a view about this, but there must within this debate—even on the side of the government—surely be some consideration of whether or not this is actually good for Australia's natural environment. Frankly, it is not. 


The Labor Party is on the record from when we were in government under Prime Minister Gillard as having looked at these questions and been very concerned about the level of duplication in environmental approval processes at state and Commonwealth levels. That is quite clearly on the record. Our government had a very strong record under the Seamless National Economy reforms of removing duplication of regulation wherever possible—in the areas of health and safety, food regulation and so many others. I think it was 16 or 17 areas—the shadow Treasurer, who is here, will remember—but certainly 15 to 20 areas of very important regulation were streamlined under the Labor government, so our record is quite clear. But our view after working through a process—talking with state governments, the business community, the environmental NGOs and the Australian community more broadly—was that it was not appropriate to hand over approval powers to state and territory governments. Certainly that would have been our view if we were asked to hand them over to local councils.


We are still more than willing to look at ways in which state and territory governments, on the one hand, and the Commonwealth can look at removing duplication of assessment processes because, at the end of the day, it is the assessment process that takes the time and involves the expenditure of substantial sums of money by proponent companies seeking a development. It is the assessment, not the approval, that involves the time and money. 


There are opportunities in a sensible discussion to look at ways in which you could have one environmental impact assessment process, one EIS, agreed with terms of reference that reflect the Commonwealth requirements and the state and territory requirements. There are circumstances in which you could agree to having one public consultation process instead of two. These are the things that take the time; these are the things that take the money from proponent companies. We are more than willing to continue to look at that. But at the end of the day we take as a matter of principle the view that matters of national environmental significance—which is the scope of matters covered by this legislation—must remain the province of a national government. That is not a party-political perspective. Whether it is a national coalition or national Labor government and whether they are state Labor or state Liberal governments, our view is the same: the Commonwealth should have responsibility for matters of national environmental significance, for a whole range of reasons that I have tried to outline.


I will refer to one more illustration of the problem involved in this legislation, and that is the question of downstream impacts. Some applications will involve impacts that cross state boundaries. There can be downstream impacts particularly sometimes dealing with water resources. The Great Artesian Basin, for example, is not conveniently located in one jurisdiction and the Murray-Darling Basin is not conveniently located in one state or one territory. Under existing legislation the minister must have regard to downstream impacts—something which a state minister simply cannot do. This is just one illustration of the impracticality, from an environmental protection and biodiversity conservation point of view, of this legislation.


I will finish by referring to the timing of the debate on this bill in this parliament. As I have indicated before, the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO is meeting this fortnight and dealing with two very important matters that concern Australia. The first is the status of the Great Barrier Reef as a World Heritage property. The other, which I referred to earlier, is whether or not the 74,000 hectares in the Tasmanian wilderness area should be kept on the register or delisted. Draft reports for both matters have been provided by the secretariat of the World Heritage Committee to committee members. We do not know what the final decision will be, obviously, as they are independent members of that committee, but the draft reports give some indication at least of the thinking of UNESCO.


In relation to the Great Barrier Reef, this is a very serious matter. I think we can all agree that the Great Barrier Reef not only is one of the seven natural wonders of the world but underpins literally billions of dollars of economic activity in the Queensland area and the work of 60,000 employees, largely in the tourism industry. This is an incredibly important matter for Australia from an environmental, social and economic perspective. The possibility that the reef would be put on the 'in danger' list would have very serious ramifications for Queensland's tourism industry, as much as it would reflect the very serious state of crisis that the reef finds itself in environmentally. The draft report provided by the secretariat to World Heritage Committee members refers expressly to this bill, to the idea that the Commonwealth's environmental protection powers would simply be handed over to the Queensland government. The secretariat's report provides that the draft recommendation to the committee considers:


… the transfer of decision-making powers from the Federal Level to the State Level … premature—


and should be postponed to allow further consideration. This is a draft report and the committee may well take a view that is different from that. But what is concerning is that I have not heard a jot about this from the environment minister. I have not heard a single response from the government about the interaction between this parliamentary debate and what is happening at an international level at the UNESCO meeting, particularly in light of the very clear recommendation from the World Heritage Committee. For all the reasons I have outlined, the opposition will not be supporting this legislation.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,5,2
"Goodenough, Ian, MP",LP,2014-06-16,"



Mr GOODENOUGH
 (Moore) (12:43):  In speaking to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014, may I say from the outset that this bill is part of the government's wider program of deregulation and red tape reduction. It seeks to amend the EPBC Act 1999 to allow states and territories to be accredited for approval decisions, where states and territories can demonstrate that they will maintain the high environmental standards required by the EPBC Act. Memoranda of understanding will be signed with states and territories establishing a single system for environmental approvals under the EPBC Act. No longer will a separate Commonwealth assessment and approval under the EPBC Act be required where an accredited state approval is in place.


This bill also introduces a range of technical amendments to ensure the process can operate effectively and efficiently, providing much-needed certainty to industry. Although this bill is specifically targeted at developments which are likely to have a significant impact on water resources, the broader principle of removing the two-tier approvals system applies. In effect, it will create a single point for environmental approvals. It is designed to remove the duplication of federal and state approvals processes, which currently involves multiple layers of bureaucracy, creating uncertainty and delays. Delays to large projects of economic significance are adversely impacting industry, diminishing Australia's international competitiveness and holding back economic growth.


In commercial terms, securing private sector investment in development projects is the sustainable way to create economic growth, rather than relying on government spending. It is typically the case that securing the necessary planning approvals for major development projects can take more than six years, at the very least, which represents more than two federal election cycles. By contrast, the approvals processes in many emerging nations in our region are considerably timelier, placing Australia at a competitive disadvantage in attracting private investment capital for major projects. In addition, there is the element of increased holding costs, planning consultants' costs and the opportunity cost of delays. Australia now faces increasing competition for investment capital from emerging economies in Asia, Africa and South America. Therefore, government must implement reforms to create a more efficient planning approvals system to enable Australian industry to maintain its strategic competitive advantage.


In the 15 years that the EPBC Act 1999 has been in operation, a number of multimillion dollar projects have been delayed, costing the Australian economy billions of dollars in lost opportunity. One such example is the Ocean Reef Marina development in my electorate of Moore, which has encountered several years of delays in negotiating the highly complex planning approvals process. Delays are costly in terms of the opportunity cost of forgone revenue and amenity, as well as holding costs. It is estimated that the project will generate $800 million of investment that includes a mix of residential, commercial and retail uses, as well as provision of moorings for 850 recreational boats. The local community is overwhelmingly supportive of the concept plan.


The marina proposal covers 91 hectares in total, with 57.8 hectares of land based development and 33.6 hectares of development off the coast or on reclaimed land. Unfortunately, the marina project is required to be assessed under a two-tier system of state and federal approvals processes, which has considerably delayed progress since 2004. The project was determined a controlled action under the EPBC Act on 13 July 2009 due to potential impacts on listed threatened species and communities and listed migratory species. While the project was a controlled action, it was not possible to determine the appropriate assessment approach under the EPBC Act until the Western Australian government had decided on its assessment approach under state legislation. Similarly, the complex and bureaucratic approvals process must deal with issues relating to the Marmion Marine Park, Bush Forever, and Carnaby's black cockatoo.


At the state level, in July 2013 the City of Joondalup submitted a Metropolitan Region Scheme amendment to the Western Australian Planning Commission, together with technical information, including detailed studies on the environment, water quality, landscape, traffic and transport. The amendment is required to rezone the area from parks and recreation purpose to urban, to create additional waterways zones and to create new parks and recreation reserved lands.


In May 2014 the City of Joondalup referred the marine based components of the development to the Environmental Protection Authority for assessment under the state Environmental Protection Act 1986. The referral is in line with the Western Australian Planning Commission's referral of the land based components to the EPA as part of the initiation of a Metropolitan Region Scheme amendment to enable the development. The city's referral, under section 38 of the Environmental Protection Act, is based on detailed environmental studies. It is difficult to accurately predict time frames for this complex project; however, the concurrent review of both the environmental components and the MRS amendment will allow for consideration of the social, economic and environmental factors via a holistic planning and environmental assessment process. 


The environmental and planning assessment processes are consistent with the memorandum of understanding that the City of Joondalup signed with the state government in 2012. The planning process is ongoing, and it would greatly streamline the Ocean Reef Marina project if the approvals process could be managed by the Western Australian state government with minimal federal involvement.


A second example of a major project within the Moore electorate affected by delays is the Neerabup Industrial Area. It is a 1,000-hectare site which represents the second largest industrial complex in the Perth metropolitan area, second only to the Kwinana Industrial Area. When fully developed the industrial area is expected to create 20,000 new direct jobs, which are forecast to add $7.9 billion to gross state product and generate a further 24,000 jobs off site, for a total economic impact of $13.3 billion. Although there has been some significant investment since 2008, including the $436 million Newgen gas-fired power station and the $110 million Wesbeam manufacturing plant, development in the industrial area has been delayed due to the same bureaucratic two-tiered environmental approvals process and the need to provide infrastructure such as road access, scheme water and telecommunications.


An application was lodged by the West Australian land authority, LandCorp, under the EPBC Act in June 2012. It was determined a controlled action on 10 July 2012 due to potential impacts on listed threatened species, namely the Carnaby's black cockatoo and the forest red-tailed black cockatoo. The clearing of 202 hectares of bushland is required to enable the construction. On 11 October 2012 the delegate of the minister determined that the proposed action would be assessed through preliminary documentation and requested further information, including how the proponent proposed to mitigate impacts prior to and during construction and proposed environmental offsets. The planning approvals process for the Neerabup Industrial Area is ongoing and progress has been very slow. The process has taken more than a decade, which has delayed economic development and impacted on the employment self-sufficiency of the wider region, which is one of the fastest growing areas in Australia. 


In both cases there is significant merit for the environmental approvals processes to occur at a more decentralised level, with the state government being accredited to issue the necessary approvals, as distinct from the case being determined centrally. Local decisions are best made locally with the benefit of specific local knowledge. Similarly, there is merit in removing the two-tiered system of both federal and state involvement in the assessment and determination process. One level of government is sufficient.


This bill is part of the government's wider commitment to deregulation and red-tape reduction. Currently, the cost of compliance with government legislation and regulation continues to be a major impediment for business across Australia. If our domestic industry is to be competitive then the administrative burden of excessive bureaucracy must be lifted. Business leaders have raised concerns that their operations are being restricted by an increasingly complex multitiered regulatory system that is often so complex and technical that it is necessary to engage specialist consultants to achieve compliance. Those affected range from small businesses to large corporations engaged in multimillion-dollar projects. The cost of compliance, coupled with additional holding costs imposed by delays, has a detrimental effect on the financial viability of both business operations and key economic development projects.


The coalition government has introduced legislation in this parliament to repeal approximately 10,000 items of legislation and regulations equating to some 50,000 pages of text removed from the statute books. The repeals are wide-ranging across all ministerial portfolios, including the departments of the Attorney-General, civil aviation, defence, education, employment, environment, finance, and foreign affairs and trade. The estimated cost saving to the economy is in the order of $719 million per annum.


An efficient system of planning approvals is required to maintain the productivity and competitiveness of the Australian economy in the face of intensifying competition from emerging economies in our region. Industry needs more certainty and clarity when submitting planning applications for development approval. Competition for project finance within the market can be intense. In order to attract investment capital, it is desirable to reduce the element of risk. The government is committed to reforming the planning and environmental approvals system to make our economy more competitive.


The issue of affordability of land for housing and commercial purposes is very topical on the national agenda. The available supply of land zoned for development is directly impacted by the efficiency of the planning and environmental approvals process. Therefore, it must be a priority for government to reform the current system to make it more responsive in the interests of promoting greater land affordability for all Australians.


In summary, this bill is designed to replace the current two-tiered system of duplication of federal and state approvals processes, which currently adds multiple layers of bureaucracy, creating uncertainty and delay. It seeks to amend the EPBC Act to allow states and territories to be accredited for approvals decisions, where states and territories can demonstrate that they will maintain the high environmental standards required by the EPBC Act. In effect, it creates a one-stop shop for environmental approvals, which in turn promotes productivity, competitiveness and economic development. I commend the bill to the House.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2014-06-16,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (12:57):  I rise to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014. Most people in this country want our precious environment protected. People look at icons such as the forests in Tasmania, the Great Barrier Reef and our waterways and they want them protected, not only for future generations but also for the livelihoods of the many people who depend on them. People also know that the federal government, with strong federal protections, is very often the best place to protect the environment, because you do not need to look very far to see that state governments can be very quickly captured by developers, by mining interests or by logging interests, with the environment coming a poor second. For example, if we did not have the federal government able to step in and protect the environment, then the Franklin would have been dammed. You do not have to look much further than the New South Wales state government and what is going on at the moment in ICAC with the current and previous governments to understand at a state level just how closely interconnected ministers and decision makers are with the interests of those who would threaten the environment. It is for that reason that most people would support the idea of there being strong national protections for the and would support decisions about enforcing those protections being made at a national level. Unfortunately, what we have seen under the previous Labor government and under this government is an attack on that principle. Towards the end of the last government, as the shadow minister suggested, the possibility was floated that some of the decisions about protecting iconic places should be shifted to state governments. The Greens stood side by side with the community to fight that proposal off, but it is now coming back again on steroids from this government. This government is perhaps the most hostile government towards the environment, and this Prime Minister is the most hostile prime minister towards the environment, that this country has ever seen. 


This bill would allow not just state governments but also, in some instances, even local governments to determine the level of protection afforded to some of the most precious places in this country, including places that are World Heritage listed. This bill puts the fox in charge of the hen house. It gives away the administration of, for example, federal protection for water from significant impacts of coal or coal seam gas—the water trigger. It gives away that protection to state governments who, as we have seen, cannot make coal seam gas roll out quickly enough. It allows state processes to be accredited to take the place of federal approvals, but also allows those processes to be in guidelines, plans or policies—that is, not even enshrined in laws. So the protections now will not just be devolved from the federal to the state governments, but the state governments will not even have to put those protections in legislation. In short, this bill makes former Prime Minister John Howard's environmental legislation even weaker and takes away the Minister for the Environment's main job, which is supposedly to protect the environment—not that we have seen a lot of evidence of that.


This government has launched itself down the environmentally reckless path of handing responsibility for these places to state and territory governments. They have already embarked on it, even before this bill, by signing draft approval bilateral agreements with the New South Wales and Queensland governments to see these critical national responsibilities palmed off to Premiers Newman and O'Farrell—and they are well known for their staunch protection of the environment! They hope to have agreements finalised with all states and territories by September 2014. If this plan proceeds, the federal government could not protect World Heritage areas from big mines nor threatened species from being sent to extinction by state governments approving major developments in key habitats. It would mean that the federal government could not have stopped the Franklin River being dammed; nor could it have stopped oil rigs in the Great Barrier Reef. This so-called one-stop shop for business sells out our environment and overturns 30 years of gradually increasing and greatly needed Commonwealth involvement in environmental protection. If it proceeds, it will put Premier Denis Napthine in my home state of Victoria in sole control of whether to put cattle in the Alpine National Park; it will put Premier Campbell Newman in Queensland in sole control of the world heritage great Barrier Reef; and it will put Premier Mike Baird in New South Wales in sole control of whether to send koalas to extinction.


The draft bilateral agreements say there will be a reserve call-in power for the federal government to step back in, but this test is higher than the current protections the act gives and, with staff being slashed from the department—and from assessment in particular—the likelihood of call-ins is remote. The EPBC Act, the main legislation that is being amended, already only applies to the worst proposals which have the biggest impact on the environment and already affects only a sliver of projects, and this bill proposes to lessen it further. 


As I have alluded to, this bill rolls back crucial federal water protections from coal and coal seam gas that were established in the last parliament, where the Greens worked together with rural Independents and the government to make sure that state and territory governments did not have the final say over the proposals which are potentially damaging to our water resources. This bill hands off that water trigger, which was designed to create federal protection for our water resources in response to legitimate and strong community concern, to state or territory governments to administer. But the federal government stepped in because the states had done such an atrocious job of letting coal seam gas run rampant. This now allows those very same state and territory governments to have the final say. As I have said, we are putting the fox in charge of the hen house, but we are now adding water to the long list of other nationally significant matters that the states will be in charge of—matters such as the World Heritage Tasmanian forests and the Great Barrier Reef and, crucially, nationally listed threatened species. In my home state of Victoria, we are on the verge of making our faunal emblem—the Leadbeater's Possum—extinct, because state governments of various stripes over many years have seen it as a greater priority to destroy forests in which these species live for short-term gain and for very little economic return—in fact it has to be subsidised—and in return we will wipe out our faunal emblem. The federal protections are the one last hope; we are going to see threatened species handed holus-bolus over to state governments. This will also apply to our Ramsar wetlands; we sign up to an international convention to protect our wetlands and then we allow not only state governments but also potentially even local governments to have the final say over them.


Crucially, nuclear actions are also covered by this legislation. I cannot believe that this government proposes that we should allow a local council to have the final say over whether protections enshrined in federal law relating to nuclear activity are going to be met! But when this government says the country is open for business, they mean it. You can have any kind of business, anywhere you like, and if there are any federal protections—just go and have a chat with the local council and you can sign yourself out of them. Deputy Speaker, these environmental protections that you see in our legislation—and people would think, 'well, good; we have got some protections there, protecting our World Heritage listed places'—will not be worth the paper they are written on—because all a developer has to do is go and sign up a local government or a state government, and they can contract out of those protections: everything from threatened species to nuclear actions.


In addition, we have seen the gutting of the national water project—on top of what is an environmental disaster of a budget. The water trigger question is crucial; there is a reason that so much time was spent in the last parliament debating it. People are, rightly, worried that we do not yet know what the impact of coal seam gas mining, or coalmining, or fracking, is on our water tables. But we are proceeding as if everything is going to be fine. What you are seeing, Deputy Speaker, is that right around the country, people—not just those in the inner city who might have voted for me but also people in rural areas who might otherwise have voted for another party—saying, 'Well, hang on: something is fundamentally wrong if we are allowing coal seam gas mining and fracking right next to, or in, our water tables, and we don't know the effect of it'. In the last parliament, we spent a lot of time working out how to deal with that, and we put in place the water trigger that I have referred to. That gives a minimum of protection to those communities, and to everyone who relies on our water tables and on our aquifers. It gives a minimum of protection before coal seam gas mining and coalmining can take place. The Greens would like to see it go a lot further; but we do not want to see it go backwards—and the community does not want the protections to go backwards. I think the community is increasingly horrified at the attacks that this government is perpetrating not just on people but also on the environment.


It is not just state and local governments; the bill allows the minister to accredit any agency to make a decision under this act. So decisions on impacts could be made by bodies which are wholly unqualified and under-resourced. It is very clear from this bill that the government does not care which agency makes the decision—state, local or any other. The government is washing their hands of their responsibility to protect internationally significant environmental icons.


These accredited processes can be enshrined in policy or in guidelines, rather than in legislation, which, potentially, makes them even unenforceable. If this bill passes and these processes are not even required to be in state laws, we can have absolutely no confidence that federal environmental standards will be maintained. It is no surprise when you think about who backs and who bankrolls the party sitting in government, but the government seemingly do not understand the concept of conflict of interest. They are ignoring 30 years of environmental reform, and the vast track records of states as environmental vandals—and all the while claiming that environmental standards will be maintained. Amazingly—because they do not understand the concept of conflict of interest—the government is proposing to hand off powers to approve development where the state government itself is the proponent. So, despite the statement by the minister, Greg Hunt, in an interview on 13 September 2013 on ABC Radio in which he reiterated that the government would keep powers where states were 'likely to have a significant conflict of interest', they have now gone back on that as well: another backflip from the Minister for the Environment, and from this government. The state government will say, 'we want to build this project'—and the state government will be in charge of determining whether that project does or does not meet the environmental protections in federal legislation. The state government will be able to write its own ticket to proceed. And there is nothing the federal government can do about it, because the state will be the only one determining whether or not that project is able to go ahead. Anyone who has watched what state governments do in their approach to development will shirk from this bill in horror.


We will not be supporting this bill. I am pleased it is going to be defeated, at least in this Senate, and I hope it will be defeated in the next Senate.

"Hawke, Alex, MP",LP,2014-06-16,"



Mr HAWKE
 (Mitchell) (13:13):  I rise to endorse the government's approach to creating one-stop shops for environmental approvals. I note that the member for Melbourne and the previous shadow minister seemed to miss the whole point of this bill; they could benefit from a close reading of it, because it was the Labor-Greens government who had already proposed that we go to one-stop shops and that we have bilateral agreements. If it was good enough for the previous government to come up with this idea and to work towards these goals, then it is certainly good enough for the government to follow through and ensure that the job gets done, that it gets done properly and that we reduce the duplication and unnecessary waste between layers of government in getting approvals.


Of course, if it was up to the member for Melbourne, there would not be any approvals. He would seek to stop all major economic activity, and that is the well stated and understood policy of the Australian Greens. The rest of us have to have a system where we have legislation that is strong in protecting the environment but allows for the proper conduct of economic activity and business. It is the case today that there is too much duplication between state and federal levels, in terms of environmental approvals, for no environmental benefit. The shadow minister in particular, who is a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment—of which I am the chair—would benefit from coming to our current hearing into green tape and one-stop shops. In fact we have a hearing on this Friday, which I would invite the shadow minister to attend, because when you hear from industry groups and other organisations—and we are still conducting our inquiry—it is good to hear the direct feedback and the experiences of people putting forward major economic activity at state and federal level and the duplication and the waste that they go through for what you have to say is very little environmental benefit at all.


In examining the provisions of this bill it is very significant that there will not be a weakening in environmental standards. The member for Melbourne seems to be very concerned about it and just says, ergo, any state government is an environmental vandal—just because he says so! Yet we know that that is not the case. State and territory regimes in relation to environmental protection have very strident protections—in some cases, too strident. In some cases they are appropriate and in many cases they are doing what the Commonwealth does as well. So it is not the case just to say that states will be bad for the environment and the Commonwealth will be good for the environment. It is not a logical argument and it does not make a lot of sense; it is quite a lot of hyperbole and hysteria from the member for Melbourne. In fact, by working very closely with the states and territories the Commonwealth can ensure that high standards under the EPBC Act are maintained. 


When you look at the provisions of this bill, particularly if we have concerns about the water trigger, the government is moving an amendment here to make sure that the latest science and independent science is examined. The amendment that is being proposed by the minister—to have an independent scientific committee on coal seam gas and large coalmining development—is a good one. It ensures that comprehensive environmental assessments can continue and they include that robust and independent science. That should allay the fears of the member for Melbourne if he is being genuine in the claim that he actually wants to see good environmental legislation. Having an independent scientific committee will ensure that the latest science is delivered through to the states to make sure that the best protections are maintained.


It simply is not the case that local councils can approve nuclear facilities under these proposed amendments. It is absolute hysteria again from the member for Melbourne to make that suggestion. We have seen a lot of scare campaigns on nuclear science. The member for Melbourne lectures us regularly in this House about listening to science. Even though he knows nothing about science himself, he is a self-appointed scientific expert when it comes to climate change. But we are not allowed to look at nuclear science, of course, and the great benefits of nuclear science, because he does not agree with it. Simply because he does not agree with the science he wants to be a nuclear sceptic. But he will lecture us at other junctures about climate science at his own leisure. The injection into this debate about councils having the ability to approve nuclear facilities is completely unwelcome. It is completely untrue. 


This bill is providing a series of technical amendments to facilitate the implementation of bilateral agreements and provide for the highest possible standards. It will give the certainty that proponents need about the practical operation of bilateral agreements. It removes the need for proponents to make referrals to the Commonwealth. But at the same time it can also then take into account changes in state jurisdictions' legislation and policy plans for the environment, recognising that they are regularly updated in accordance with the latest science, which is something member for Melbourne should welcome in relation to the flexibility that these technical amendments provide. That is, there will not need to be a stalling of the process between the Commonwealth and states when new science and environmental standards are incorporated by states. If they are consistent with the protections under the EPBC Act then that flexibility will allow for easier delivery of such standards and an improved policy and accreditation process through these technicalities rather than constant delay and uncertainty for business.


It is important to provide ongoing certainty to the community about the operation of these bilateral agreements. It is important that the minister in particular has gone out of his way to ensure that environmental protections are maintained under the EPBC Act and that the latest science is included in relation to decisions made under any bilateral agreements. The bill demonstrates the government's ongoing commitment to implementing genuine reform. It is good that the previous government started this. If you listened to the shadow minister's speech you would have thought that this was some crazy notion of the Abbott government. Of course we know that the previous Labor-Greens government was also looking at this very closely, improving one-stop shops and bilateral agreements with states to deliver environmental decision making. That is welcome. Their role in opposition is not to oppose just for the sake of it every single thing that comes through this chamber, and the shadow minister really gave a speech that was along those lines.


This is a good bill. It makes good improvements, allowing for the Commonwealth to facilitate bilateral agreements with the states which will enable better cooperation between the Commonwealth and states, and deliver better outcomes for the environment and for business. So I implore the Labor Party and the Greens to stop simply opposing for the sake of opposing and recognise that they had looked at this work as well; that this is good for relations between the Commonwealth and the states; that this will be good for business and economic activity and also environmental standards, delivering more flexibility in relation to her standards between the states and the Commonwealth; and that, with the latest science being incorporated into many things like the water trigger, this will produce a better outcome. 


The member for Melbourne also expressed his concerns about the water trigger, saying how much detailed work and what a long process he went through. Unfortunately for him, those of us who were here in the last parliament remember the process in relation to the water trigger amendment and the obscene haste with which the former government changed its position at one minute to midnight, after it had been against the water trigger. Let us be very clear: the former government knew the water trigger was not a good idea and they knew it would lead to duplicate processes for minimum environmental benefit. The last government was holding out against the Independents on this. There was a last-minute reversal where the water trigger was adopted at the very last second, even though the former government really did not want to accept the water trigger. Every one of us here in that parliament remembers that. I think the Australian community should remember that. 


It is important to note that this bill provides significant protection with its assessment and accreditation processes and the important referral to the independent scientific panel so the latest science and the independent advice about coal seam gas and the water science that is available will be available for decision makers. You cannot do better than that. As the member for Melbourne regularly implores us, we should listen to the science. This bill will make the necessary amendments to ensure that these bilateral agreements can be delivered between the states and the Commonwealth, and I strongly recommend the bill to the House.

Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (13:22):  It is a pleasure to rise to oppose the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014, which—as my colleague and namesake, the shadow minister has pointed out—has nothing to do with protecting the environment or conserving biodiversity. This bill does nothing for either of those things. It amends the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to facilitate the Australian government delegating environmental approval powers to state and local governments.


Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta, coming from Queensland, as do you, I strongly oppose this move. I do not want Campbell Newman, Jeff Seeney or the Queensland Coordinator-General having the power to approve developments in the Great Barrier Reef. This bill, along with the bilateral agreements being developed, will mean that World Heritage sites, nuclear activity—such as uranium mining—and species protected under international treaties will be put in the hands of state governments, including the Newman government.


Labor oppose this bill, because we believe the national government is responsible for matters of national environmental significance. The Australian government has the responsibility for protecting Australia's precious environment, and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, in particular, accounts for matters of national environmental significance. The Abbott government, unfortunately, has no interest in protecting Australia's environment for the future. I was as surprised as anyone to hear the Prime Minister refer to himself as a conservationist, in recent days, given that the track record appears to point to the opposite conclusion. Since coming to government, Mr Abbott and Mr Hunt have made bad decision upon bad decision that have hurt our environment. This bill is the furthest they have gone in terms of putting our environment at risk of irreparable damage by leaving decisions of national environmental significance to state premiers and their ministers and, in the case of Queensland, to unelected persons as well.


The Newman government is an example of why state governments should not be trusted with managing our environment. Last week, the Queensland parliament considered rushed changes to the environmental approvals laws of the state which are complementary to the changes in this bill. The Newman government has attached the changes to a bill about a much less controversial topic. As my state colleague the member for Mackay said in that debate:


There is no need for the legislative changes to give the Queensland government power to issue federal environmental approvals—


to be attached to that much less controversial bill. He continues:


These changes could have been in a stand-alone bill and scrutinised in its own committee inquiry. The attachment of the legislative changes to give effect to the Abbott-Newman deal to hand federal environmental approvals to the state is sneaky and underhanded. The rush to effect these legislative changes is unnecessary.


That was what he had to say in respect of the complementary legislation in the Queensland parliament last week. During the same debate, my colleague the state member for South Brisbane said:


The EPBC Act is the most important piece of environmental legislation in Australia. The matters of national environmental significance that the EPBC Act protects are: matters of World Heritage, national heritage, wetlands of international importance … threatened species and communities … migratory species, protection of the environment from nuclear actions, the marine environment, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the protection of water resources from CSG and mining.


It is particularly important to note what the member for South Brisbane said in relation to the Newman government's record when it comes to the environment:


We are privileged to live alongside some of the greatest natural wonders in the world … Sadly, the Newman government has proved it cannot be trusted to protect our natural environment. The Newman government has systematically stripped away vital environmental protections, leaving our precious natural heritage at risk.


She then went over the following list:


They overturned Labor's 23-year ban on uranium mining in Queensland. They ended the moratorium on shale oil mining and refinement … They extended sandmining on North Stradbroke Island up to 2035 … They introduced legislation … to repeal wild rivers declarations. They scrapped a world-class coastal management policy. They encouraged interstate companies to dump waste in South-East Queensland landfills. They stripped away statutory protection for native vegetation … They have made it harder for community groups to appeal environmental approvals.


As my colleague said:


The fact that the Abbott government has looked at this record and still decided to hand over its powers to the Newman government is a shocking indictment of its own environmental credentials.


As you can see from what the member for South Brisbane had to say, there is cause for concern about handing over powers to the Newman government when it comes to the environment. She is not the only person who is worried about their record. The Friends of the Earth in Brisbane wrote to me with particular concerns about handing over powers with respect to uranium, but with concerns also more generally about the bill and the handover of powers. The Newman government's record on the environment has been slammed by its own Auditor-General, who, in a report tabled in April, has said that the Department of Environment and Heritage Protection:


… is exposing the state to liability and the environment to harm unnecessarily.


We cannot trust the Newman government, given its track record. That is particularly so when it comes to the Great Barrier Reef. It is one of the great wonders of our natural world. Like lots of Queenslanders, as a child I visited the reef on a number of occasions. I want others to be able to have the same experience. I fear that with the Newman government in charge people will not be able to have that same experience. I am not alone in my concern. 


I congratulate WWF-Australia and the Australian Marine Conservation Society for their joint campaign Fight for the Reef. They and many of my constituents are greatly concerned about the way that developments are affecting the reef. The campaign is presently focused on the UNESCO World Heritage Committee's upcoming decision about the reef. The committee has commenced its meeting from 15 to 25 June, which is being held in Doha. It is considering a draft decision that explicitly warns Australia that the changes to be made by the bill that we are debating today are premature. It also states that the committee is concerned about dredging and dumping near the reef. The relevant provisions of the draft decision that the committee is considering are as follows:


The World Heritage Committee … Requests the State Party to ensure the full completion of the independent review of the institutional and management arrangements for the property, as recommended by the 2012 reactive monitoring mission, as a key input to the LTPSD—


Long Term Plan for Sustainable Development—


and considers that the transfer of decision-making power from Federal to State levels, before the vision, framework with desired outcomes and targets, and governance requirements to deliver the LTPSD have been adopted, is premature, and should be postponed to allow further consideration …


Those are not my words; they are those of the UNESCO World Heritage committee, and we ought to consider them. The committee also expressly recorded its concern about the government approval for dumping three million cubic metres of dredge material inside the property, which is very near the reef, prior to having undertaken a comprehensive assessment of alternative, potentially less impacting, development and disposal options.


The draft decision is crucial. The committee has put Australia on notice. We need to do better when it comes to the reef. Specifically, the committee has warned us that if there is not substantial progress on the key issues they have identified, they may include the reef on the List of World Heritage in Danger. The Newman government claims that tourism is one of the pillars of the Queensland economy. If the reef is listed as World Heritage in Danger that will be a blow to tourism. Just today TheCairns Post published an article that said:

Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (13:30):  Last week, we saw the most outlandish justification for the government's budget of broken promises yet. The latest justification for the government's swingeing cuts to health and education, their attack on the pension and the Americanisation of our higher education system is that they are necessary to restore fairness to Australian society. That is what the Treasurer recently told the Sydney Institute—that the budget of broken promises was necessary because we have too many 'leaners' and not enough 'lifters' and that:


This year the Australian government will spend on average over $6,000 on welfare for every man, woman and child in the country. 


He then asked a question you do not often hear from Liberal treasurers:


Is this fair?


Given they are new to this whole 'fairness' caper, it is no surprise that the Treasurer missed the point.


When you actually look at where the Treasurer's $6,000 in welfare goes, the largest recipients by far are our veterans, our seniors and our carers. That is right: the Treasurer seems to think that those who have worked until retirement age, people who look after those with disability and people who have served our country in war are 'leaners' and that it is not fair for society to support them. These are people who have worked harder than most for our way of life and deserve better than the Treasurer's cheap contempt.


The facts just do not support this government's fairness fantasy. Contrary to the Treasurer's insulting 'leaner' rhetoric, the Melbourne institute research shows that welfare dependency has decreased over the last 12 years. The number of households primarily dependent on welfare payments has decreased by almost 30 per cent since 2001. No matter how the Abbott government try to sell it, the Australian people just are not buying their budget of broken promises. They did not vote for it and they do not want it.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Prime Minister) (14:00):  Madam Speaker, I rise on indulgence to acknowledge the passing of Sir Jack Brabham AO OBE. Sir Jack was an Australian legend. He was indeed one of a kind. He served in the Royal Australian Air Force before becoming a giant of motor racing. He won the Formula One World Championship in 1959. He was first Australian to win that particular title, which he won again in 1960. In 1966 he won his third world championship, driving a car that he had built himself. Nobody had ever won a championship in their own car before and nobody has done it since. He also took out the constructors championship in 1966 and in 1967. 


Sir Jack was always willing to have a go and was named Australian of the Year in 1966 and a National Treasure in 2012 and was the first driver in history to be knighted for his services to motorsport. He was respected and admired for his spirit and for his great skill as an engineer and, at all times, he was the quintessential gentleman, charming and patient to a fault with his fans.


He was a champion driver, an engineer and, more recently, a champion for macular degeneration awareness. To his wife, Margaret, and to his sons the government extends its deepest sympathies.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (14:01):  I join with the Prime Minister in paying tribute to the life of Australian sporting hero Sir Jack Brabham. A flight mechanic in the RAAF, Jack retained a lifelong love of engine design, construction and repair, and once said that driving was the relaxing part of the world of Formula One. 


Jack began his career in racing purely as a designer and builder of so-called midget cars, because he believed drivers were all lunatics. But in 1948, as a fill-in driver—in only his third race—he won his first speedcar event, the beginning of his journey to the pinnacle of Formula One greatness. Jack won back-to-back world Formula One championships, in 1959 and again in 1960. However, his most remarkable victory came in 1966 when he won the championship in a car that he had built himself, a sporting feat that will never be repeated.


Jack Brabham's success became part of the collective Australian psyche. He was truly the Don Bradman of the racing circuit, with an iconic modesty and a wry sense of humour and none of the fist pumping and self-congratulation of modern sport. We will not see his like again. All of us in the Labor Party offer our heartfelt condolences to Lady Margaret, Jack's sons, Geoff, Gary and David, and his grandchildren. May he rest in peace.



The SPEAKER:  I ask members to rise in their places as a mark of respect.

The resolution read as follows—



That this Parliament acknowledges the opportunity to further lower the cost of living for all Queenslanders, especially seniors and pensioners by:


(1) calling on the Federal Government to immediately restore funding for concessions; and


(2) calling on the Australian Labor Party state and federal Members and Senators to pledge their support to repeal the carbon tax, renewable energy target and other green schemes, which would immediately reduce the cost of electricity.


Further, that the Speaker, on behalf of the Legislative Assembly, relay this request to both houses of the Commonwealth Parliament.

"Butler, Terri, MP",ALP,2014-06-16,"



Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (15:17):  Prior to the interruption of the debate, I was addressing the House about my opposition to the bill. From my perspective as a Queenslander, my primary concern is that I cannot imagine anybody in their right mind wanting to make it easier for the Newman government to have control over our natural resources. I could not imagine supporting a bill that facilitates delegating approvals for environmental matters to the Newman government. As I said before, matters of national environmental significance should remain matters for the Australian government and for the country as a whole to consider. I was particularly speaking about the Great Barrier Reef, one of the great natural wonders of the world and a place where I spent a lot of time as a child. I hope that many others have the same opportunity, but the Newman government's track record, when it comes to environmental protection, is very poor. 


A number of people have raised concerns about handing over environmental approval powers to the Newman government. Friends of the Earth Brisbane have written to me raising concerns about this issue, along with others. As I said earlier, the Cairns Post only today printed an article, beginning: 


Tourism leaders say the Far North's reputation as a top holiday destination will take a dive if the Great Barrier Reef loses its World Heritage status.


I am not sure if the pun was intended. The article went on to quote Tony Baker, the managing director of the Quicksilver Group—which is one of Cairns' long-established tourism operators—as saying the: 


… decision to list the Reef as ""in danger"" would harm the Far North's reputation.


Of course, he was speaking there of the risk that the UNESCO World Heritage Committee would proceed to list the reef as 'World Heritage in danger'. We know that the UNESCO World Heritage Committee is currently meeting and that it will consider a draft decision expressing concerns about the very subject matter of this bill—the transfer of delegation arrangements from the federal to the state government—being premature and about dumping and dredging, among other things. The Queensland environment minister has gone to Doha to try to argue a case against listing the World Heritage area of the Great Barrier Reef as 'World Heritage in danger'.


We are right to be concerned about that, because as Tony Baker told the Cairns Post:


""I think from our perspective it would be disappointing,"" he said. ""I certainly hope the state and federal governments have done enough to ensure this doesn't happen.


""As a company and an ­industry, we're working very hard to ensure the health of the reef is maintained as best as it can be.""


Given that the Queensland government asserts that the tourism industry is one of the four pillars of the Queensland economy, people are right to have grave concerns about the threat to tourism in the event that there is a listing of the Great Barrier Reef as a World Heritage in danger site. 


There is a lot of concern in the community about how the UNESCO World Heritage Committee is going to look upon the work that has been done in Australia, and particularly in Queensland, on the reef. The state and industry are hoping that a Queensland government report card on the reef will assist. The report card relates to the reef's water quality and protection plan. Queensland's environment minister is travelling to Doha in the hope of persuading the committee that a reduction in pesticide run-off meets their concerns. I do not intend to diminish or dismiss the work that has been done to reduce pesticide run-off—I congratulate everybody concerned—but that by itself is not enough. On Friday the Fight for the Reef campaign representatives released a new and independent score card that showed the Australian and Queensland governments had gone backwards in addressing the World Heritage Committee's major concerns about the Great Barrier Reef.


The scorecard analysed how the government's track record stacked up against recommendations that the UNESCO World Heritage Committee had made 12 months ago. Particularly of concern to UNESCO—and you can see it from the draft decision that has been published in respect of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee's considerations—is the government's decision to allow dredging and dumping in the vicinity of the Great Barrier Reef. That is of great concern for obvious reasons when you are talking about a beautiful pristine marine park and coral reefs. Accordingly, when the scorecard was released on Friday, WWF Australia CEO, Dermot O'Gorman, said:


The federal government's decision to allow the dumping of three million cubic metres of dredge spoil in the Reef's waters off Abbot Point means it has failed its international responsibility to protect the Reef.


He then went on to criticise the changes that are the subject of this bill, saying:


Since this decision—


and he was talking about the dredging and dumping decision—


the Australian Government has moved quickly to transfer environmental approval powers to the Queensland Government despite that Government's poor environmental track record.


And, of course, that is a reference to this bill, to the bill that was before the Queensland parliament last week and to the bilateral agreement. He said:


The World Heritage Committee wants a long term plan and concrete action to protect the Reef and instead the Australian Government is washing its hands of responsibility for this national icon. It's a huge concern in the lead up to Doha.


Of course, this statement was made last week He continued:


Our assessment shows the Australian and Queensland Governments have failed to make ""good progress or complete"" a single one of UNESCO's requests.


Great Barrier Reef Campaign Director with the Australian Marine Conservation Society, Felicity Wishart, said at the same time that the budget cuts announced since January also flew in the face of the World Heritage Committee's recommendations. She said:


At a time when UNESCO is advising Australia to increase investment to protect the Reef the Federal Government has cut funding to the Environment Department and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.


The Queensland and Australian Governments are risking the Reef's World Heritage status. The Reef provides 63,000 jobs and $6 billion to the Queensland economy. A decision to protect the Reef is a decision to protect our tourism industry and the Queensland economy.


As I have said, the Newman government has made a point of saying that the tourism industry is one of the four pillars of that economy. The campaign representatives are:


… calling on the Australian and Queensland governments to address the most serious concerns of the World Heritage Committee to avoid a possible listing as 'in danger' in 2015.


The state environment minister has said that the concerns about dredging and dumping are really coming from green groups, but that is obviously not the case, given that UNESCO itself has in its draft decision specifically raised the concern about dredging and dumping. It is crystal clear that the last thing this parliament should be doing is facilitating the delegation of power to state governments.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2014-06-16,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson—The Nationals Deputy Whip) (15:24):  We have gone a long way off the reservation, haven't we, with the Labor party coming in and making statements like that which we have just heard from the member for Griffith. It was not very long ago in this place when the member for Watson, as the then environment minister, was talking about exactly what we doing here today—that is, handing over the Commonwealth approval process and assessment process to state governments and allowing for the streamlining of green tape for major job-creating projects right around this nation. That was taken off the agenda as we neared the election—for the simple reason that Green preferences are needed by Labor around the nation, and they did not want to upset their mates.


I would like to point to another backflip. We have just heard—and I am sure we are going to continue to hear this throughout the course of this debate from Labor members; certainly from the Greens members—condemnation of the Abbot Point expansion project. I have to say that there was no condemnation by Labor of this project before the election; in fact, the local Labor candidate who ran in my seat—where Abbot Point is located—actually publicly supported the project, and came out and said that the Labor government would approve this, that it would go through the appropriate mechanisms and would then be approved. Now, after the election, we find out the truth: Labor would never have supported the Abbot Point expansion project—a project that is going to create thousands of new jobs and is going to be an economic boost for the town of Bowen and for the region of Mackay and the Whitsundays, which right now so desperately need access to new jobs. Other than the repeal of the carbon tax, there is no more important legislation that could be before the parliament to get things kick-started again throughout the economy than the legislation before us: the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014. This bill sets up a one-stop shop for all environmental assessment.


There is a lot of argy-bargy and a lot of point-scoring on this—and some stupid statements; for example, that we are relinquishing our responsibilities, and that we are somehow abdicating ourselves from the process of managing icons like the Great Barrier Reef. But the real criticism there is that somehow, state government bureaucrats are not able to do assessments properly. That is the implied criticism: that somehow we do not trust state government department of environment bureaucrats—the public servants who sit there and go through these assessments. They have all the same credentials as the federal environment department public servants—but somehow we do not trust the state government public servants to go through and do these assessments properly. That is a slight on those public servants in Queensland, and in all of the other states, who actually do a good job and who do those assessments properly. What the Labor Party is saying by not wanting us to go down this path is basically that it does not trust the judgement of those public servants in Queensland and elsewhere to do these assessments.


I am going to reflect on Abbot Point, which is a major project and which has come up against the green war-machine for a lot of criticism and a lot of bagging. But there have also been a lot of lies about it. One thing I can say that is absolute fact is that this project went through the wringer—completely—for months and months; in fact the assessment processes that it had to go through blew out to years. First it went through the state processes: all of the environmental impact statements they had to go through, and the back and forth with the department wanting them to make sure that all the questions were answered. Then there was the consultation process, where all of the green groups jumped on and said what they thought was wrong and tried to nitpick it to death. It then went back for further adjustment and finally, when it was right, they got the approval. That took a hell of a long time—months and months and months. Then it had to go through the federal process all over again, and the same thing happened: back and forth between the department until the department was happy with what was before it, then out for public submission and then all the green groups jumped on it again and again tried to nitpick it to death. There is a clear strategy about that, too. This is actual factual information—I am not gilding the lily by saying that there is actually an articulated campaign, a documented campaign, that radical environmental groups in Australia run against these sorts of job-creating projects like Abbot Point. It was set out in Stopping the Australian Coal Export Boom by a group calling for the ending of the Australian coal boom. The document was successful over the internet and it talks about the strategies they employ in delaying projects so that it nobbles investor confidence in them, drags out the costs of these projects and eventually kills them off.


We should as a government streamline the process to make sure there is only one assessment that goes through. Surely a state government public servant who is charged with assessing applications against state government environmental plans that are fairly complex documents would be able to do the same assessment at the same time against the federal government posture of his plans. It is not a very difficult task when you put it like that. The person who is responsible at the state level for assessments there could easily do the federal government's assessments. It would be streamlining it and it would be putting, I suppose, a handbrake on those attempts by the green movement to constantly delay job-creating projects, particularly in northern Australia. That is what we saw with Abbot Point and that is what we continue to see after the fact at Abbot Point even after it has had the tick-off from both the state and federal governments, even though there was such a delay. We had delay after delay after delay from the succession of environment ministers under the previous Labor government. I think approval was originally supposed to come down in early 2013. Actually, I think it was December 2012. Then it was going to be sometime in early 2013. Then it got shifted to July 2013. They could not make a decision before the election, because again that would have affected the green groups out there, so it was shifted until after the election. Finally we made the call when we came to government that, based on all of the sound advice that was provided to us, all of the expert advice, this project could go ahead.


But it could have happened a lot quicker if there had simply been a one-stop shop where all of these environmental assessments were done. After the fact, the environmental movement have not stopped. They have continued to try and nobble this application by taking it to court. I believe there are three different court cases being waged by people. I am not a lawyer, and thank God for that to a degree, but I do not understand how people like the Mackay Conservation Group—which has never done a conservation activity in its life, mind you; its sole boasting right is about how it has stopped developments from going ahead—can take job-creating projects like Abbot Point to court to try to have stopped. But what is their legal status? I do not understand how they have any legal status, and they should not have any legal status to be able to do that. Who do they speak on behalf of? Their membership base is very limited. There are a minority group in the Mackay community, even, let alone Australia, and yet they claim to stand up in court for the environment, for the Great Barrier Reef and for the Australian people! Who gave them that right? Who elected them? Who gave them that authority? It bewilders me. I think governments are going to have to look in the long-term at this continual legal appeal approach to disrupting and delaying job-creating projects right across this nation. We are going to have to get serious on that front.


I go back to the bill. It is the way forward. If we want new jobs, if we want new opportunities, we are going to have to have a streamlined approach. That is not just George Christensen saying that as the member for Dawson or as a member of the Liberal-National coalition government; that was actually the assessment of the Productivity Commission. They did two major reports, one into the non-financial impediments to the resource sector; and the other one on how to fast-track the approvals processes for major projects within Australia. Both of those reports highlighted the need for a streamlined assessment process—a one-stop shop—which is what this bill is delivering. And you know what? Both of those Productivity Commission reports were asked to be delivered by the former Labor government. So I asked the question of the Productivity Commission: 'What can we do to get the mining sector firing again? What can we do to help fast-track major projects that are being undertaken in this country?' The umpire, the Productivity Commission, came back and said that you must fast-track them. You must set up a single assessment point, and you can do that by getting state governments to assess against the federal regulations and rules. And yet today we have Labor member after Labor member disagreeing with the umpire's call. It is not the coalition's call; it is something that has come from the Productivity Commission—the agency charged in Australia with ensuring that our policy framework as a government and as a nation is conducive to the best economic outcomes for the nation. Yet, Labor is going to argue against it. That says a lot about the Australian Labor Party today, which is wedded to the Greens, as we saw under the last government, and which is still clinging on to the carbon tax—at least here in the parliament it is. It does not want us to remove the carbon tax. It is effectively blocking the removal of the carbon tax in the Senate.


At the same time, it is going out there now—and I see the shadow environment minister has gone out—saying that the Labor Party has turned a new leaf and is thinking of jettisoning its policy for an emissions trading scheme. That is a big shift. It is thankful. I congratulate the Labor Party on moving away from these punitive measures to try and change the temperature of the globe; but it could take some real action by voting with the government to get rid of the carbon tax and restoring confidence in the economy by supporting this bill and streamlining these processes.


If this system had been in place I am sure that right now we would not be dealing with court cases against the major job-creating project at Abbot Point that so many people in my community desperately want to see go ahead. The little town of Bowen is on its knees. It is nearly dead. There are so many businesses that have had to shut down. People have gone out the back door and are shifting, because there is no movement in the economy. They are all waiting for this Abbot Point expansion to go ahead. If this system had been in place a number of years ago, we would not be talking about it in court, the jobs would be created, the jobs would be there, that town would be pumping again and the economy would be restored. Abbot Point would be going ahead with all of the environmental safeguards in place, because it would have been through an assessment process that had looked at both the state guidelines and the federal guidelines and made sure that the project complied with both of them. That is what we are talking about. It is not something radical. It is not something that is going to harm the environment. It is something that is simply going to get rid of the useless green-tape and time-consuming approach that we currently have with environmental assessment in Australia. I would say to the opposition: listen to the Productivity Commission. You asked them for an answer. They gave you one. Support this bill.

"Elliot, Justine, MP",ALP,2014-06-16,"



Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (15:40):  I rise today to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014. This bill seeks to amend the EPBC Act to facilitate the delegation of environmental approval powers to state and local governments. The bill, along with the bilateral agreements being developed, means that particular activities relating to environmental consents could potentially be placed in the hands of state governments and on some occasions local governments. I have grave concerns about both of these issues and I will detail them throughout this speech. Potentially, it could include issues like World Heritage listed properties, activities like uranium mining or even approvals under the water trigger amendment. These could be given to the control of state governments. We have heard many speakers on this side talk about why that would be a concern.


This bill paves the way for the Prime Minister and his environment minister to irresponsibly hand over those environmental approvals to the states and local councils. The bill would allow the states and local councils to approve developments in some of Australia's most precious environmental ecosystems, which could undoubtedly have disastrous effects on local environments and important tourist attractions. It is a real concern. We looked at those state governments who have no regard for environmental protections. As it is, in my home state of New South Wales we have a state government that has no concern about environmental protections. In fact, it is an environmental vandal.


If we look to some of the changes that could happen, we could firstly look to Queensland, where we could have Premier Campbell Newman potentially approving dredging and dumping in the Great Barrier Reef. That is terrifying. We could have Western Australia Premier Colin Barnett in charge of the Ningaloo reef. Remember that this is the man responsible for the shark cull in Western Australia. That he may potentially have final oversight over some very important issues really is an issue of huge concern to people in my electorate. We could also look to Tasmania, where Premier Hodgman and his government could be in charge of Tasmania's iconic World Heritage listed forests. This is again a rather frightening idea. Most alarmingly for my electorate, in New South Wales, is that we could have Premier Mike Baird and the North Coast National Party having total and final control of approvals for all coal seam gas mining applications. I see this element of the legislation as the most terrifying. It is one that many people have raised with me. This legislation is very important to the constituents of Richmond in terms of the effects that it will have on the future approvals of coal seam gas mining developments.


The North Coast state National Party have demonstrated time and time again their pro-CSG agenda and a total disregard for the community and our opposition to harmful coal seam gas mining and unconventional gas mining on the North Coast. Time after time, state National Party MPs like Don Page, Thomas George, Geoff Provest have refused to listen to our community and to oppose the rollout of the unconventional gas industry on the North Coast. We are seeing the National Party ridiculing those who oppose coal seam gas mining. This past weekend, the New South Wales Nationals had their conference at Queanbeyan. One of the things that were brought up were comments made by the Deputy Premier and National's leader, Andrew Stoner, who is also the Minister for the North Coast—which is quite ironic—about the protesters at the recent blockade. Mr Stoner was reported as having said of those at the blockade:


It broke my heart that some of those professional bludgers thought they had a win.


How appalling is that! The comment was reported in a tweet by Jenna Cairney, Deputy Editor of The Land newspaper. In another tweet by Ms Cairney, Mr Stoner was reported to have said:


Mark my word we were prepared to go head to head with that protest group.


I think that is really a reflection of what we see from the New South Wales Nationals. There has been widespread condemnation of the Deputy Premier's comments. Of course, what he was referring to at Bentley is the site near Lismore, where exploration for unconventional mining was due to start last month; but, because of massive community opposition, they were forced into a backdown in relation to that. Today, we are hearing that a review of the suspension of Metgasco's licence is due by 25 June, so this is causing more concern on the North Coast. The community's view is very clear. We had thousands of people out at Bentley, protesting Metgasco's licence for that area. It really is quite offensive to have the Deputy Premier making these comments. As I say, it has been widely recognised.


The fact is that the New South Wales state government and the North Coast National Party cannot be trusted when it comes to significant environmental approvals. They cannot be trusted. They have demonstrated that they are not interested in protecting the unique environment of the North Coast from harmful CSG mining. That is one of the many reasons I do not support the handing of environmental powers to the states.


As I have said many times before in this House, Liberal-National governments at many levels tend to be environmental vandals, in contrast to us in the Labor Party. We have a strong history of protecting the environment. This was seen in our amendment to the EPBC Act in 2013 in relation to the water trigger. The water trigger as part of the amendment to the EPBC Act meant that for the first time water resources could be considered as a matter of national environmental significance in relation to environmental approvals. The intention of the amendment of the process relating to water was specifically in relation to coal seam gas and large coalmining developments of national significance. It has become known as the water trigger. It means that coal seam gas and large coalmining developments require federal assessment approval if they are likely to have a significant impact on a water resource. So to hand full approval power for large and potentially harmful coal seam gas mining projects back to a state government which is essentially an environmental vandal is, quite frankly, reprehensible.


Looking to the New South Wales government, I would like to respond to some of the comments of the member for Gippsland. He will be very interested in this. Remember that this is a government that after winning office in 2011 renewed all the current licences. That is right: they renewed all the current licences when it came to CSG mining projects. The Liberal-National Party own these licences, but the people of the North Coast are fully aware of the National Party spin and deception. The people of the North Coast know that handing over environmental approvals, including the water trigger, to the states is, indeed, irresponsible madness. That is what they are saying—that it is irresponsible madness.


Even worse, in some cases the federal government would be handing environmental approvals over to councils. I would like to refer to a local example. The majority of our councils on the North Coast—such as Tweed, Byron, Lismore, Ballina and Kyogle—are opposed to harmful coal seam gas mining. They have made that very clear and have stood with their communities. But if we turn to the Richmond Valley Council—where the town of Bentley is—they are very pro-CSG. So it would be really concerning if you had a councils like that and a National Party mayor such as they have in Ernie Bennett out there ticking off on coal seam gas mining. If Mayor Ernie Bennett was responsible for the licence in Bentley, there would be a big tick for that one. He is totally opposed to all the other councils on the North Coast and how they feel about that. I will get to more information about the councils later on.


The risk of contaminating our water resources is not the only concern involved in handing environmental approvals back to the New South Wales state government. A further example of risk is in the Kings Forest development in my electorate of Richmond. This development comprises 4,500 lots on 880 hectares on the Tweed Coast and runs right through known koala habitat. Upon its completion, Kings Forest will include housing for around 15,000 people and related public infrastructure. Many fantastic local conservation groups, such as Team Koala, have called for a dog ban, speed limits, corridors and overpasses in the housing development to protect koalas living there. This development has been referred to the federal environment minister for approval under the EPBC Act, having already been approved by the New South Wales state government. It goes without saying that for an important and endangered species like our precious koala an extra layer of approval and oversight is essential for their protection.


We are waiting for a decision on this. I have raised this in the House many times. The people in my electorate are very concerned about the outcome of the determination by the minister because they are concerned about having in place adequate protection for the koalas in Kings Forest. So I again call on the Liberal-National Party government and the environment minister to act to protect those koalas in their final development consent in relation to Kings Forest.


Federal oversight through the EPBC Act is also necessary as each state and local government surely has a different perspective on environmental issues. This is exactly why national oversight is required. This bill lacks clarity and it lacks cohesive structure to ensure adequate environmental protection at a national level. When it comes to the environment, some states simply do not have any priorities. As I said, when you look at the New South Wales state government's record on CSG mining in my community and their lack of regard for our precious environment, how can they be trusted on anything else of national environmental significance? The fact is that, of course, they cannot be trusted on matters of environmental significance. They just cannot.


This bill goes further than just handing approval powers over to the state governments. It provides the avenue to accredit local government and shire councils to undertake critical assessment and approval processes. This would effectively put local government in charge of the environmental responsibilities of some of Australia's major natural assets. It is simply quite unfair for the federal government to expect local government and shire councils to take on the environmental work of much larger departments that handle this work with often thousands of experts and scientists at their disposal. It is unreasonable to expect shire councils, who do not have at their disposal all of those adequate departmental resources, to make decisions of an environmental nature that are potentially of national significance. The environmental risks associated with this move are quite astounding. It should never be the burden of local government to take on the work that is essentially the responsibility of a state or federal government. That level of pressure would be unduly unfair on our local councils and the resources they have. As I said earlier, we have a perfect example in my electorate where having a pro-CSG mayor and council is just devastating. So I have grave concerns across a whole range of levels about these powers being delegated to local councils


In conclusion, since 2011 it has been abundantly clear to the people in my electorate of Richmond that the state government of New South Wales that we currently have, the Liberal-National Party government, is not the best custodian of our unique environment. In many cases they have been all too happy to sell off land, subdivide where they want and pollute whatever resources we have, whether that is koala habitats, water resources or precious forests. These are the people who have allowed shooting in our national parks as well. I have said many times that they are environmental vandals. We keep seeing examples of that time and time again. No doubt they will be held to account next March when we have our state election, because people have a lot of worries about the extent of that environmental vandalism. Indeed, for us, the issue of coal seam gas mining will be one of the major issues. That is why I do not believe these powers should be delegated to the state governments.


I would also like to take the opportunity to commend the many great groups in my electorate that work very hard to raise these environmental concerns. We have heard speakers from the other side of the House condemning those groups. I want to congratulate a lot of those groups. These people put a lot of time, effort and energy into making sure these concerns across a whole variety of different developments are raised. I have mentioned Kings Forest before and I have mentioned in the House before the community fight to preserve Lot 490 at Kingscliff, which is a pristine piece of coastal land. That is a major concern there. Also, I commend the people in relation to opposing the West Byron development, which again is a major over development within our area.


The people in my area really understand about getting the balance right. They understand how important it is to preserve our unique and beautiful natural environment. The reason people move to what is essentially the best address in Australia, the Far North Coast of New South Wales, is that they appreciate our beautiful diversity, our hinterland, our beaches and our remarkable villages and towns. It is an absolutely stunning part of Australia—the best indeed. People are working very hard to preserve that and preserve their beautiful surrounds and the quality of life in the area they have chosen to live in. That is why people are so passionate and concerned about this.


I would like to congratulate all of those groups that work incredibly hard to maintain their position across a whole range of different environmental issues. We have never seen such a strong example of that as the thousands who came together at Bentley to stop the exploration licence. At its peak we had thousands of people there and thousands more were prepared to come out. They were camping out the weekend just before the licence was suspended. I say that it is a real concern that in the coming two weeks we are going to have a review of that. I can assure the House you will see the same situation, with thousands of people out there defending our community's right to stop inappropriate and over scaled harmful exploration and coal seam gas mining.


I believe the federal government ultimately has a responsibility to protect Australia's precious environment, and the EPBC Act in particular accounts for this. By delegating all of these responsibilities, the Abbott government is showing that it has no interest in protecting Australia's environment for the future. I understand that there may be a need to look at streamlining; that is fine. In some ways streamlining may be effective, but complete delegation of all these powers to the states—who, as we have said, are environmental vandals—is very irresponsible and reprehensible. The end result of it could be potentially dire for some of our most environmentally significant areas right throughout the country. They could be devastated because of this decision.


It is for these reasons that I do not support this bill. I think the consequences could be dire. People in my electorate have certainly raised with me the fact that they do not want this to happen. They do not want those powers delegated, particularly to our state governments, but also to our councils. I think it is wrong that this government has taken this plan of action. I think it will be devastating for our environment, and the repercussions will be very widespread.

"Coulton, Mark, MP",Nats,2014-06-16,"



Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (15:55):  I too rise to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014. I might just make some comments about the speech of the previous speaker, the member for Richmond. What we have just heard is base political activity. The member for Richmond was not speaking for the people of her electorate. You might be interested to know that the member for Richmond has probably the lowest primary vote of any member in this place—33.5 per cent. The Greens in the seat of Richmond had a vote of 17.6 per cent. So the member for Richmond was actually appealing to the 17.6 per cent of people in her electorate who voted Greens, and not to the 50 per cent of people who did not.


In the last election she ran a vicious anti-CSG campaign, in an electorate that I might add has no CSG. There is CSG in adjoining electorates, but the member will not dispute the fact that there is no CSG in Richmond. She is appealing to 17 per cent of people. I agree with the member for Richmond that it is a beautiful part of the world. But she is appealing to the people who go up there, clear their half acre of rainforest and then make sure that absolutely no-one else can do the same thing. They want to be the last house built in Richmond. It is the greatest area of nimbyism in New South Wales. You only have to look to Tasmania to see what Greens preferences have done to the resource-rich state of Tasmania. It choked it. That matter needed to be addressed.


The fact is that those licences were given out willy-nilly by the Labor Party. I know there are people from my electorate listening today. I might say that there has been a lot in the news about the Leard State Forest and the Pilliga. The reason we have extractive industries in those areas goes back to Bob Carr and his relationship with the Greens. He was so hell-bent on shutting down the timber industry and taking out the sustainable industries of the Pilliga and closing down the sawmills at Gwabegar, Baradine and Gunnedah and places like that, he was so hell-bent on closing down the timber industry in order to get Greens preferences that he allowed extractive industries in there. If the people of the Pilliga now have an issue dealing with extractive industries, they can thank Bob Carr. In fact, my state colleagues have gone from having a policy-free zone on extractive industries, when they came to power 3½ years ago, to now having the strongest environmental laws anywhere in Australia, if not the world, to control these industries.


Turning to the bill, what we have here now is a one-stop shop. I say to the people from my electorate listening to this speech that this is not a dilution of the environmental laws. This is a simplification, a streamlining, a remove of green tape, so that processes can get underway. This is not just for extractive industries. This also concerns the land management laws in the state. At the moment we have a real issue in parts of my electorate with the federal environment laws, with the threatened species act, and with the state laws. It is very confusing for landholders to undertake proper management of their land. Indeed, in about a half an hour the mayor of Walgett will be in this building to meet with various ministers to talk about the fact that the Walgett Shire is only 20 per cent developed. Green tape has choked up the good farmers of the Walgett area with regard to developing their properties, which would not only maintain the environmental efficacy of the region but also maintain its productivity.


The assessment and approvals process will be simplified, but in no way are the standards of the physical assessments being diminished. The federal government will be entering into bilateral agreements with state and territory governments across the country under national environmental law. It may not be widely known but there have been provisions for a one-shop stop in the EPBC Act since its inception. The coalition is taking this opportunity to increase productivity while maintaining environmental approvals—contrary to the scaremongering we have heard in this chamber today from the member for Melbourne and other members, who rely on scaring and misinformation rather than dealing with the facts.


The Commonwealth government will remain accountable for its obligations under the EPBC Act and will have an ongoing role in ensuring that the commitments reached by other bodies under the bilateral agreements are met. As a part of the process for establishing the one-stop shop the state and territory governments must demonstrate their ability to meet the high standards set out by the EPBC Act. In some cases, if the existing assessment process has not been of a high enough standard, it will be strengthened. That is a key point. In some cases, this bill will actually strengthen the environmental legislation that protects our landscape, and that is a very, very important point. Those opposite and others who are on this bandwagon will try to play this as some sort of dilution of the environmental laws. It is actually a strengthening of the environmental laws, but it is also a streamlining.


I would now like to speak for a moment about the water trigger. Water resources will continue to be included as an item of national environmental significance under the one-stop shop. There are no changes to the environmental standards under the EPBC Act. Under this legislation the minister will be able to accredit state and territory processes for approving projects involving the water trigger. However, the important thing is that the minister will make this accreditation only if those high standards are maintained. I would like to point out that, unfortunately, as we are seeing now and have seen previously, this water trigger has been used in this place for political purposes. Very rarely have environmental laws been the friends of the farmers, and I would say that also to the people who are listening to this in my electorate at the moment. The environmental laws have the ability to be extremely detrimental to farming operations. So while we need to maintain the high standards, we need to maintain the water trigger and we need to make sure that farmers do not get caught up in the web of environmental green tape any more than they already are. As a former farmer I understand the importance of water in our regional communities; I absolutely do. However, I will not use water as a political football, as some people in this place choose to do. I believe that having the right assessments and high environmental standards are essential in a project that may affect water as a matter of national significance.


I have always supported the establishment of the Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development. I believe that this independent group of experts in the field is the one that should make the recommendations as to any project put forward. The coalition now seeks to make available to the states and territories the advice from the committee. This sharing of information and access to scientific advice is a useful step to help ensure that the right decisions are being made throughout the approvals process. Independent science is an essential part of this process.


Under this legislation there will be greater transparency about decisions being made and access to information. There will be greater community involvement, which I believe will be welcomed by my community. There will be state and territory audits and transitional and five-yearly reviews of the bilateral agreements and the reporting mechanism. The minister will be checking to ensure that the standards are maintained and that the high standards for environmental assessments remain. Under this legislation the minister still holds the power under the EPBC Act to cancel or suspend an agreement. That is a very important point. The minister has not abrogated his obligations as the final arbiter. But in cases where the streamlining of the state and federal processes can be done under the highest standards that will be the process. The minister still holds the power under the act to cancel or suspend an agreement.


I have said many times that further environmental legislation that interferes with agricultural practices is not in the best interests of the farmers in my region. And I will close on that point. There is information going around regional Australia at the moment that is designed to misinform and scare farmers with regard to their relationship with extractive industrie. It is important to note that, thanks to this legislation and the work of my colleagues in New South Wales, we now have strong environmental legislation that protects our environment. But the only result that the groups that are driving this will be happy with will be the complete removal of extractive industries. And you have to remember: in New South Wales, if you go back to the Hansard in New South Wales and look at speeches made by the Greens back in the late 1990s and early 2000s, it was the Greens who were advocating for coal seam gas industries as a clean alternative to coal. And Bob Carr complied, with the help of Bob Devis, to make those changes. That is history. We now have to deal with the situation that Labor has placed us in, and this legislation will strengthen our environmental oversights but also reduce the strangling green tape that many people in Australia deal with on a daily basis.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2014-06-16,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (16:07):  It is interesting that we are debating the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014 when simultaneously the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment is inquiring into this very issue under the reference 'Streamlining environmental regulation, 'green-tape', and one stop shops'. The committee has not concluded its inquiry or presented any recommendations or findings. One might have thought that it would be appropriate that, given that there is a standing committee of the House inquiring into this matter, we might await the committee's findings before we proceeded to change the rules relating to who carries out assessments.


In fact, why did the minister give the green light to the committee to proceed down the path of an inquiry if he was going to bring in legislation simultaneously that effectively makes the inquiry a waste of time? If nothing else, it is irresponsible of the government, which is being irresponsible with taxpayers' funds. Hopefully, this legislation will not get through the Senate right now and therefore it might have to come back either amended or to be debated at a later time when the committee has concluded its work and brought some recommendations back to the House. That would seem to me to be the logical time to debate these matters.


It is interesting that, this week, I understand, the World Heritage Committee is meeting in Doha as part of its 38th session. It, too, says that it believes that decisions in respect of referring assessment powers to other levels of government—I am using my own language here—are premature and should be postponed to allow further consideration.


The legislation clearly exposes the Abbott government's lack of commitment to the environment, contrary to what speakers on the government side have said. Neither has the minister shown any such commitment. Since coming to office, the Abbott government has sought to dismantle every environmental protection measure that was in place, including measures put in place by previous coalition governments. Its motive for doing so has been that it wants 'to eliminate green tape, streamline processes, avoid duplication and speed up the approval times'. The government claims that that, in turn, will make development projects costs much lower, will make projects become viable and will enable Australian developers to compete with their overseas counterparts.  If only those claims were true.


The government goes on to talk about how green tape is stifling investment and Australia's future. Can I just point members opposite to what has happened in this country over the last 20 years or so under both coalition and Labor governments? There was no lack of project developments across the country. Indeed, it has been claimed that this country has benefited from the boom in development projects—mainly mineral and gas projects and mining more broadly. If all the regulations that we have in place are so bad for this country, how did all of those projects come to be? The truth is that those regulations were all put in place for a good reason, and that is to ensure that we protect the natural environment whilst at the same time we allow projects to be developed responsibly in this country. In making them responsible, the proponents benefit from them and so does the broader community.


One might be persuaded by the government's arguments about the need to remove green tape if their environmental credentials were sound. But, unfortunately, that is not the case. This legislation is merely one of several measures the Abbott government is taking to relegate the environment to the point of making it irrelevant. The reality is that this government does not simply want to streamline decision making, avoid duplication and reduce development costs; it wants to eliminate environmental obligations altogether. And whilst environmental obligations may exist in law under this legislation, in reality they will be emasculated.


I will outline what is wrong with this legislation. Firstly, in delegating environmental assessment to the state governments the process is immediately flawed. State governments have a vested economic interest in every development in their state, so immediately their primary interest will be in approving developments. By cutting funding to the states, as the Abbott government has done in its 2014-15 budget, the states are now even more desperate to generate funds from developments and are even less likely not to back any developments that they are asked to assess. That is why the Commonwealth, which does not have a vested interest in the individual projects of the states and which would be seen as an independent assessing authority, should continue to provide the environmental assessments that are necessary.


Secondly, the states have made cuts to their own budgets with respect to environmental funding. Indeed, I understand that the cuts to environmental budgets by some state governments have been very severe. I understand why they are doing that; it is because they have had their own funds cut by the federal government, so they, too, have to make cuts. And yet, right now, at a time when they are making cuts to their own environmental departments, they are being asked to do more with much less funding.


The inevitable outcome is that short cuts will be taken in the assessment process, that mistakes will be made—not deliberately, but they will be made simply because short cuts will be taken and there will be fewer resources to carry out the processes—and, in turn, the assessment processes will become not only less reliable but, frankly, more open to challenge. I see them as being more open to challenge both by proponents who want to do things even more cheaply and by others who have an interest in the outcome of that development. It is only logical that if you have fewer staff employed in a department, they will have less time to do more work. That in turn means that their ability to carry out the job they have been asked to do will be put under pressure.


It is often said that developers ultimately have to bear the costs of environmental impact assessments. It may well be true that they will bear the cost one way or another. The states, however, still have the responsibility to scrutinise those assessments once they are in hand and to ensure that they comply with all requirements. That scrutiny also requires resources and time. Just as importantly, the states will inevitably still be held accountable, and possibly open to challenge, if they have not conducted the process thoroughly. So they are being asked to conduct the process thoroughly in order not to be held liable, perhaps, in a court, but at the same time they have fewer resources with which to do it. I am not sure that too many of the states would be jumping up and down about this transfer of responsibility.


It is inevitable, given all of these applications, that conditions will be applied. The problem with conditions is that unless they are monitored—and monitored properly—they become useless. Again, a scantly funded state environment department is unlikely to devote sufficient resources to the inspectorial work once an application has been approved. What makes it even more complicated and more difficult is that many environmental impacts do not arise, or are not detected, until many years later. The responsibility to assess and monitor projects is not just a one-off responsibility for these departments; it continues for many years. Because it happens over a period of years it is often difficult to pinpoint what the cause of a specific environmental problem was. Just as concerning is that poorly funded state environment departments are very unlikely to launch what they know are going to be difficult, complex and costly legal proceedings against well-resourced developers, often multinational, if a breach does arise. So there are a whole range of reasons why this legislation should be of concern.


I will go to the delegation of responsibility to local government. Again the question is: does local government have the necessary expertise and resources to thoroughly undertake the assessment processes required? Even if they do now, this year's budget freezes grants to local government for the next three years, costing local governments some $920 million. As with state governments, they will be making cuts. Where are those cuts likely to be made? They will probably make them in areas where they think they can do so without getting too much resistance from local communities. That means that if they have an environment department, that will probably be one of the first areas cut.


To take away environmental protections from the community, as the Abbott government has done by withdrawing funding from community environmental organisations, including environmental defenders offices, highlights how little regard this government has for the environment. Indeed, when you look at all of their decisions collectively you clearly see a clever, cynical attack on the environment. Who will be the major beneficiaries of this legislation? The winners will predominantly be big mining companies—85 per cent of whom, I understand, are foreign owned and most of whom are taking far more from Australia than they give back. Now they want to take even more. The government boasts about having approved some $400 billion of development investments in this country since it came to office. I do not know what the figures are, but I suspect most of that $400 billion is for mining developments.


The harder the government tries to shut down the voices of communities who want to raise environmental concerns, the more determined, I believe, those communities will become. That is what we are seeing with coal-seam gas objectors around Australia, particularly in New South Wales. It makes more sense to have open, transparent and inclusive processes. It makes more sense to bring affected communities into the discussions. These communities often include people with extensive expertise, whose opinions and knowledge should not be ignored. As a member of this House's committee on the environment, I have spoken to countless people with extensive environmental expertise, expertise that has been useful in the past and will be useful in the future. We should listen to these experts when they identify environmental problems, and their expertise should be utilised in finding solutions to those problems. But the Abbott government simply does not value the natural environment, the biodiversity within it or the expertise of the people within our communities.


I will close on this note: the environment, and the biodiversity within it, sustains our health and wellbeing. It underpins our economy, especially primary production. Australia and the rest of the world have experienced significant and unsustainable loss of biodiversity over the years. More than 50 species of Australian animals are believed to have become extinct in the past 200 years and many others are functionally extinct. The environment and its biodiversity are already under serious threat from climate change. The Australian government has an obligation to the people of Australia and it has an obligation to give effect to international conventions to which we are a signatory, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity.


The EPBC Act is the instrument by which the federal government exercises its environmental responsibilities. The EPBC Act is the Australian government's principal piece of environmental legislation. It is designed to protect the national environmental assets of this country. To delegate powers from within that act, when it was specifically designed to put those powers into the hands of the federal government, is irresponsible indeed.

"Varvaris, Nickolas, MP",LP,2014-06-16,"



Mr VARVARIS
 (Barton) (16:22):  I am pleased to have the opportunity today to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014. Firstly, the coalition is absolutely committed to environment protection and economic responsibility. We do this in a win-win scenario. I absolutely reject the premise used by the opposition that the coalition does not care about our environment and that this bill is a retrograde mechanism to harm the states and the environment. This bill is not about negatively affecting the promotion of conservation and ecologically sustainable use of natural resources. It will serve to ensure an efficient, timely and effective process for assessment and approval actions and, importantly, to minimise unnecessary duplication in bureaucracy at state and federal levels.


What the bill proposes is that states and territories commit to the agreement with the Commonwealth to ensure that objectives of the EPBC Act are met and environmental standards are fully and completely maintained, and in some instances further increased, whilst actively allowing faster approvals and a simpler process which will deliver benefits for all. Importantly, the coalition firmly believes that a single entry point at state level for approval can maintain environmental standards and allow businesses to get on with things.


The coalition is a staunch advocate, and rightly so, of a one-stop shop for environmental approvals so that only one environmental approval that covers both Commonwealth and state requirements is needed for an action. The Commonwealth, state and territory governments are committed to working together to achieve this. Crucially, the Commonwealth will maintain an important role and remain accountable for its obligations under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, including international treaties. The Commonwealth will retain an approval role for actions in Commonwealth waters, on Commonwealth land or by Commonwealth agencies and, lastly, the Commonwealth will have an ongoing role in ensuring that commitments under bilateral agreements are met.


Before I proceed, allow me to put some things into context. The current situation we find ourselves in is a direct result of the former government's hasty arrangements with the former Independent member for New England in a resulting minority government. These hasty arrangements of a supposed one-stop shop were permitted for all arrangements but strictly excluded what was known as 'water trigger' projects, those such as coal seam gas and coal mining believed to have adverse impacts on water resources. Consequently, organisations wanting to undertake such projects were subjected to lengthy assessment and approval processes at state, territory and Commonwealth levels. This meant businesses would grapple with a multitude of overlapping regulatory burdens which was immensely time consuming, involving jumping through hoops and processes which could go on for weeks and months, sometimes years. For a business that has no certainty and contracts with pending results for weeks and months on end, that can be disastrous.


The opposition's argument thus far has been the logic that regulatory burden enables better environmental control. No, it enables the control of businesses being buried with red tape and strangled with paperwork, but the impact on the environment is disputable. The coalition understands the need for scrutiny and accountability for environmental protection by ensuring all projects carried out by organisations meet environmental standards. Because the coalition has Australian businesses and jobs at the forefront of decision-making processes, the coalition absolutely understands the urgency for reducing red tape and having a streamlined regulatory and administrative process in a unified framework, whilst allowing all other stakeholders to get on with their role. State and territory governments have responsibility for land and water management in Australia. This is not new and has been in place for some time now. 


One of the key achievements of this bill is enabling the removal of the duplication across jurisdictions and creating an efficient, effective process. When fully implemented, this bill will allow for a true one-stop shop for environmental approvals that has a single entry point at the state level for approvals. This is achieved through three parts: (1) signing a memorandum of understanding on key principles and confirming cooperation; (2) updating on bilateral agreements for those already in place; and (3) agreement on bilateral approvals within 12 months. Eliminating duplication means Australian businesses can expedite their operations whilst the Commonwealth not only maintains but strengthens environmental standards. 


It will strengthen environmental standards because, prior to entering a bilateral agreement, states and territories must demonstrate that their environmental assessment and approval processes meet the high standards set up by the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The states and territories are accountable for matters that would produce adverse outcomes for the environment. Having a one-stop shop also means there is more transparency and access to information on the environment, and stakeholders can review it as necessary. Should there be any issues or disputes, an escalated resolution process will be on hand. Finally, the environment minister will retain the ability to further assess or approve a project.


The suggestion that this bill will give too much power back to states and territories is a woeful and even insulting premise. The state and territory governments are perfectly able to make informed environmental impact assessments for such projects and should have the autonomy to proceed as they see fit. This bill will abolish the metaphorical hand-holding by the Commonwealth which only serves to create a bloated bureaucracy and inefficiency. If we backtrack two years, the one-stop-shop reform was actually introduced by the Labor Party, devised by the Gillard government, in early 2012 with the mechanism in operation by March 2013. The idea was to allow key decision making to be the responsibility of the most appropriate level of government, through the states and territories. Unfortunately, by December 2012 the former government changed their minds. Now Labor still stand opposed to an agreement that was first devised by them and that their state counterparts had all signed up to. It is a little confusing.


The coalition understands that for major resource projects concerning coal seam gas and large coalmining it is crucial to have measures in place that would not minimise standards or lessen environmental sustainability. However, the overwhelming duplication in question has not actually produced quantifiable environmental benefits or outcomes. Again, the streamlining, the creation of a one-stop shop and the removal of the unnecessary deadweight regulatory burden are completely sensible—in fact, it would be illogical not to do so. It is possible to produce and allow robust environment assessments of these actions, delivered through a single assessment and approval process that benefits everyone. Importantly, this is good news and a relief for Australia's international investment reputation.


I understand environmental concerns surrounding coal seam gas mining and coalmining development projects, but it is important to highlight that this can be done without the purported disastrous consequences to the environment, while still creating jobs and economic benefits. The coalition is committed to ensuring that the states have access to the necessary information before making important decisions in relation to these water trigger projects so that environmental standards are upheld against high standards. To ensure state and territory bodies can seek the correct advice before approving projects, the coalition will increase the role of the Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development to provide their expert opinion.


The coalition absolutely notes the legitimate concerns of electorates with coal seam gas mining and coalmining, but there should be common sense when we are enforcing regulation. Again, it will allow the states and territories to make appropriate decisions in their respective areas, where they are across the issues on the suitability of such projects. This reinforces the coalition's commitment to streamlined processes, smaller governments and the reduction of unnecessary bureaucracy, which businesses and the community simply do not need.


Simplifying and streamlining approvals is the way forward that will end the unnecessary red tape, which does nothing except waste time and taxpayer money. Jumping the same hurdles over and over is counterproductive. Giving businesses certainty as to the requirements and time frames of prospective proposals prior to undertaking this process will streamline this important process and contribute enormously to employment and economic prosperity. 


This bill will recognise that states and territories have set up their processes in ways that work best for them in their respective state or territory. Furthermore, the new provision to provide ongoing certainty to the community about the operation of the agreement is important for businesses and governments alike. It is actually possible to have economic development alongside environmental protection. Members opposite would have you believe otherwise, because they honestly seem to think that regulatory burden, red tape and excessive statutory control will lead to cleaner air, greener grass and bluer skies. It does not. It will not. What it will do is strangle businesses and resources and prevent benefits from flowing on to important constituents and stakeholders.


Labor would have you think that their key achievement in environmental reform was the political masterminding of the abhorrent carbon tax with the Australian Greens, which has become the world's most notoriously expensive program, with no results. The only genuine impact is that consumers pay through the roof in utility bills, businesses lose market share and foreign investment withers away as Australia has reduced investor opportunities and loss of economic potential.


The coalition has taken an important major step in reform through the reduction of governmental red tape and multiple regulatory obstacles facing businesses. We are allowing the states and territories to have the autonomy to approve projects with stringent criteria set to a national regulatory framework. This framework will be enforced and will ensure that the environment will not only be protected but even strengthened and that businesses can also have a fair go. We are safeguarding both the environment and Australia's economic prosperity.


The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill will deliver better standards, faster processes and streamlined regulation, which are all part of the coalition's commitment to a wider environmental regulatory reform policy agenda and our key audit of existing environmental regulation.

"Claydon, Sharon, MP",ALP,2014-06-16,"



Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (16:33):  I rise today to oppose the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014, which is before the House. This bill amends the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to facilitate the delegation of environmental approval powers to state and local governments. The delegations allowed within this bill include World Heritage listed sites, nuclear activities and approvals under the water trigger amendment.


Divesting the Commonwealth government of its responsibility to protect environmental areas of national significance is not good policy. It is not good for the health and wellbeing of our planet and it is certainly not good for future generations. In practice, this bill will allow state and local governments to determine the level of protection we afford to nationally significant environmental and heritage sites across Australia. It hands over the power to approve developments in some of Australia's most iconic and sensitive natural areas—including the Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu National Park and Fraser Island—to the cash strapped states and local governments. Handing Commonwealth power to the states would endanger some of our most sensitive natural areas and threaten biodiversity protection across Australia.


Only the Commonwealth has the mandate and capacity to consider the needs of the whole of Australia when approving projects that could affect the environment. A state government has no motivation to put the national interest before its own state interest when approving development within its own state. This bill puts major environmental decisions in the hands of the current 'everything is for sale' state governments. We will have Campbell Newman, Premier of Queensland, waving in the ships to dredge and dump on the Great Barrier Reef. He will probably try and find a way to sell the reef while he is at it. Colin Barnett, Premier of Western Australia, a strong supporter of the controversial shark culls in WA, will now be in charge of the Ningaloo Reef. We will have Will Hodgman, Premier of Tasmania, axe and saw in hand, overseeing Tasmania's iconic World Heritage listed forests. These are premiers and state governments who have already proven that they do not have the capacity to make sound environmental conservation decisions. We most definitely should not be giving them more approval power to make decisions about our environment and sites of national significance.


These are state governments who are under significant budgetary pressure following the actions of this Abbott Liberal government. State governments have not held back from criticising this government for the cuts it has made to their own budgets—$80 billion of cuts to health and education, and many other cuts, including to concessional programs for seniors. New South Wales Premier Mike Baird, for example, has warned that New South Wales 'cannot absorb these cuts'.


With the federal government backing away from funding the states, governments across the country are looking for other ways to raise revenue and are selling our assets. In my electorate of Newcastle, the New South Wales Liberal government has recently sold our port, our greatest public asset, to the highest bidder as an immediate revenue-raising measure. And just last week the New South Wales Liberals opted to privatise New South Wales electricity networks. The Abbott Liberal government is actually encouraging them to sell more assets by offering financial incentives to do so. State governments—who have a selling, planning and development onus, rather than a conservation focus—should not be making development decisions that could affect areas of natural environmental significance. This responsibility should remain with the Commonwealth.


This bill goes to something beyond the current pro-development, 'for sale' state governments that view the environment as nothing more than a resource to be exploited. It provides the ability for these same state governments to accredit local government to undertake critical assessment and approval processes. Allowing the states to approve anything, anywhere, without limitation is worrying enough, without further diluting accountability by putting local government in charge of Australia's major natural assets. Do not get me wrong, the Cairns Regional Council should have input into any proposal to develop within their council boundaries; however, they have neither the resources nor the capability—nor should they—to be making major environmental decisions about the Great Barrier Reef. Similarly, the Shire of Exmouth council should have a say in what happens in and around Ningaloo Reef within their boundaries; but, again, they should not be the determining body. Shires and councils play an important role as stewards and custodians of our natural environmental treasures and areas of environmental significance; however, to suggest that they are the appropriate body for the management of major developmental approvals is misguided. It is the federal government's responsibility to oversee and protect areas of national significance. Major developments impacting on areas of national significance should go through a robust process at a federal level that is consistent, not through the inconsistency of town halls across the nation.


Another of Labor's concerns with the divestment of approval power is the lack of quality and consistency in processes between the different states and territories. It has been identified in the past as an issue. Without national oversight, the consistency and quality of processes would likely deteriorate further. Labor does support the streamlining of environmental assessment processes for major projects, but final approval on matters of national environmental significance absolutely should remain with the national government. As part of an investment into streamlining processes, in 2012, when in government, Labor did in fact start the process of negotiating with states and territories to establish agreements to reduce regulatory double up. However, throughout these negotiations and investigations, it became clear that some states could not be trusted with Australia's unique environment. It was clear that a national oversight—with national processes and approvals over the entire country, not just within state boundaries—would ensure the best environmental results.


This bill itself specifically mentions the current inconsistencies across states and territories but does not actually do anything to address these inconsistencies. It acknowledges different systems and standards in each state but ignores any issues that this might present. Rather than create simplicity and certainty for applicants through the cutting of so-called green tape, this bill will actually create additional levels of bureaucracy, more complexity and increased uncertainty for industries, which will ultimately undermine investor confidence. The stated intention of this policy is to reduce regulatory burden, where in fact the policy does the opposite: requiring business to now deal with up to eight separate state or territory jurisdictions, each with their own set of conditions. The conditions to be met for a development application in New South Wales may vary greatly to the conditions in Queensland or Victoria. Applications that involve cross-state boundaries may further confuse the process, and that is before you even start to deal with the intricacies of the 560 individual shire and council processes if this bill were to progress.


Australian environmental groups have banded together against this bill in record numbers. They believe that the threat to our nation's environmental heritage is so great that they have formed what is perhaps the biggest environmental alliance in our country's history. The Places You Love alliance is a group of organisations who are leading protectors and conservationists in Australia and, in some cases, the world. Representing more than 1.5 million Australians through their membership, the 41 groups within the alliance include the World Wildlife Fund, the Humane Society International, the Australian Marine Conservation Society, Greenpeace, the National Parks Australia Council, and the Climate and Health Alliance, as well as some smaller but no less dedicated groups such as the ACT Conservation Society, the Australasian Bat Society, BirdLife Australia, Environs Kimberley, Environment Tasmania and the Wilderness Society. Every state and territory is represented in the alliance and their view is clear: do not hand assessment and approval powers for matters of national environmental significance to state and territory governments. The alliance of environmental experts firmly believes that state and territory governments do not have the capacity to make approval decisions and would be severely conflicted in making any decisions due to their reliance on royalties and other income from large development projects.


Aside from headline sites like the Great Barrier Reef, there are a number of less known, but no less important, areas of environmental significance that would be affected if this bill were to go forward. My electorate of Newcastle is home to a site of international environmental significance, the Ramsar-listed Hunter wetlands. The Hunter wetlands is one of 65 Ramsar sites in Australia that cover more than 8.3 million hectares. The fact that the Hunter site exists today is itself an inspiring story of conservation. Until the mid-1980s the site had been used as a rubbish dumping ground, railways and even sporting grounds, leaving only fragmented patches of remnant wetlands of what was the massive Hunter Wetlands Estuary system, known as the Hexham Swamp. Through the determination and persistence of the local community and a number of far-sighted organisations, the former dump has been transformed into a vibrant wetland ecosystem that is today bursting with life. The site has been protected under the Ramsar convention on the protection of wise use of wetlands since 2002, and has received numerous national and international awards. A major highlight was in 2005 when they received the International Ramsar Convention Award for Education. Building on this award, Labor invested further in the Hunter wetlands and in 2011 funded and opened a new $2.5 million education facility at the centre. The Hunter wetlands and the 64 other Ramsar sites need environmental protection at the federal level, not a state or local government council level. Their collective futures are important to the nation's future. This argument is shared by conservation groups. 


Humane Society International are so concerned about the possible effects on Ramsar sites under this bill that they have written to the secretariat of the Ramsar convention at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, in Switzerland. Their major concern for the sites is that this bill weakens the capacity for Australia to fulfil its protection obligations under the Ramsar convention by moving the onus of conservation and wise use of wetlands from an agency focused on environmental conservation, that is, the environment minister, to state agencies who have a more localised planning and economy based approach to natural resource management and who also have less obligations to conservation through their state legislature. These Ramsar sites must continue to be protected at a federal level.


Labor opposes this bill because we believe the national government is responsible for matters of national environmental significance. We continue to support streamlining environmental assessment processes for major projects, but final approval on matters of national environmental significance should remain with the national government. The Australian government has a responsibility to protect Australia's precious environment, and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act in particular accounts for matters of national environmental significance.


The Abbott government has no interest in protecting Australia's environment for the future. We have seen this through the Prime Minister claiming, 'We have quite enough national parks' in relation to the Tasmanian forests and, when elected, one of the first things this government did was approve dredging in the Great Barrier Reef, a decision that I note is currently subject to much discussion at the UNESCO World Heritage committee that is meeting as we speak in Doha. I note that that committee took particular note of the decision about dredging in the Great Barrier Reef, suggesting that it was certainly very premature and should have waited for the outcomes and findings of their investigations. Since coming to government the Prime Minister and the Minister for Environment have made bad decision upon bad decision about our environment, but this is the furthest they have gone in terms of putting our environment at risk of irreparable damage by leaving decisions of national environmental significance to the state premiers.

"Wyatt, Ken, MP",LP,2014-06-16,"



Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (16:47):  I rise today to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014. Essentially, this bill will ensure that one of the government's key environmental commitments at the last election to create a one-stop shop for environmental approvals will be implemented efficiently. In reality, this bill is required to be passed because of Labor's addiction to red tape and bureaucracy.


We on this side of the House are committed to freeing local small businesses and economy-boosting organisations from red tape and bureaucracy. That is why we are creating the one-stop shop for environmental approvals. All too often I hear stories from businesspeople who are frustrated by the hoops they have to jump through, the hundreds of forms they have to fill out and the number of government bodies they have to speak to in order to get environmental approvals for development and business activities. Do not get me wrong, I want to place on the record that I think environmental approvals are essential and required to assist in the conservation of our great natural beauty. But when that effort to protect our environment is duplicated on a state and federal level, the compliance and administrative burden on our businesses and community are not only unnecessary it also delays and adds costs onto projects. The original EPBC Act was intended to streamline approval processes, and the coalition government is now delivering this for our community. This legislation will ensure that the high environmental standards under our existing national environmental law will be maintained while delivering benefits for business and the community.


I want to quote the Minister for the Environment from his second reading speech on this bill as I think it goes to the heart of what this issue is all about. He said:


When the policy is fully implemented, state and territory governments will, for the first time, be able to make a single approval decision that accounts for both state matters and matters of national environmental significance. This will dramatically simplify environmental approvals and remove unnecessary bureaucracy, while maintaining the high standards set out in the EPBC Act.


Our environmental credentials are strong, and in fact our environmental credentials will be strengthened by this legislation. The one-stop shop will promote greater sharing of environmental information between businesses, governments and community thus reducing the need to duplicate the provision and collation of information. Red tape is not this government's friend. We were not elected to tie up investment nor were we elected to reduce the effectiveness of our existing environmental standards. We were elected to make it easier to do business in our nation. As the Prime Minister has stated before, 'Australia is open for business.' 


One way we can encourage investment and development in our nation—hamstrung by the Rudd-Gillard governments over the past six years—is to open up our doors and make it more efficient and effective for businesses to deal with government. The role of government should not be to stifle those who want to provide jobs and investment but to make it as efficient as possible to do just that—provide jobs and stimulate the economy. We need to unlock the potential of this nation. Lower costs, faster approvals and more certainty for investors are all ways that businesses will benefit from the one-stop shop for environmental approvals. Faster approvals will be a real, measurable benefit from this legislation. Typically, delays for approvals are between 30 to 40 days or even longer! This is simply unacceptable. Progress should not have to wait for next month. 


Those on the other side have been talking about the so-called 'water trigger amendments' that this legislation proposes. I would advise those on the other side that they should take the time to read the bill and understand the EPBC Act. If they did this, they would know that with these amendments there will be no change to the environmental standards currently required under the act. All that will change is that, instead of businesses having to deal with state and federal governments, with separate approval processes for projects with the water trigger, they will now only have to deal with state and territory governments.


On that point, I want to respond to the member for Newcastle, who in her speech made comment about the capacity of states and territories and particularly the agencies that administer the relevant legislation within those jurisdictions, who in fact also have to take into account the Commonwealth legislation. All of the public servants that I have ever interacted with who have responsibility within this field of operation have been highly competent and highly considered in the decisions they make and in the processes they require those who are proponents to developments to go through. At no stage have I ever seen them relinquish their capacity nor diminish their responsibility in ensuring that the environment is a high priority in the consideration. And I think that we should never underestimate that at the state and territory levels we have people who are highly capable of making the same decisions that are required of any Commonwealth structure that addresses the requirements of the act.


In essence, the minister can accredit state and territory processes to approve projects that involve the water trigger, and I know my colleagues within my own jurisdiction would be very mindful of both the responsibility of the state minister for the environment and of course that of our federal minister. Currently, this is different from how all other matters of national environmental significance are treated; now, as a result of this legislation, it will be treated in the same way. This is a real example of how this government is committed to consistency, efficiency and effective environmental management.


Again, the difference between this government and the previous one is stark when it comes to consultation. Gone are the days when policies of national significance were designed on the back of napkins on the Prime Minister's plane. We have worked and continue to work collaboratively with states and territories to ensure that high environmental standards are maintained across the nation. This government believes that we should not overstep our bounds. Australia is a federation and, within this model, as framed in our Constitution, the state and territory governments will work with the Commonwealth to implement the one-stop-shop. Indeed, the responsibility of land and water management rests with the state and territory governments, and that is where it should stay. Those who have listened to me speak in the House before know of my commitment to preserving our natural environment as well as my strong dislike for red tape and unnecessary bureaucracy. I used to work in the bureaucracy; I know how it works. This legislation will rid the community of layers upon layers of red tape that clogs up the time of the public service. Why should we request information that has already been requested? Why should we duplicate the work that someone else is already doing on the state and territory level? It does not make any economic sense or time sense to replicate work that has already been done and should be available. It does make sense to enable those who have that process of ticking off and approving not to have to go back and seek a second process that requires additional work and additional resources.


However, that is exactly what the previous Labor governments have done time and time again. I say that this is symptomatic of Labor. However, I note that in April 2012 Prime Minister Gillard committed to fast-tracking the development of approval of bilateral agreements with the states and territories, with final agreements to be in place by March 2013. This arose out of the states and territories making a representation that there was a need to streamline the process to enable development to occur without impacting on the environment in a detrimental way. But surprise, surprise—the Gillard government backflipped on this commitment and abandoned the reforms. And now they are still opposed to the bilateral agreements. What happened? Did those opposite get a whiff of efficiency and sensible economic reform and get a little bit scared? This is even despite the fact that every state Labor government has signed up to achieve this important reform. We on this side of the house are doing what we said we would do through legislation: we are reducing the unnecessary red tape while maintaining environmental standards.


Overall, I have faith in the local community, faith that those people on the ground will continue to be equally vigilant and that government will ensure that our environment is protected for many years to come. The member for Newcastle referred to the Places You Love Alliance. I think they become an active voice in ensuring that those places that all Australians love are looked after and protected, and that the consideration that needs to be given in the tiers of government is enforced through the relevant legislation. But that does not prevent us from looking at efficiencies by having one-stop shops to which proponents of development can go, follow a process and seek the approvals required.


I am proud to support this bill and look forward to working with the Minister for the Environment to achieve real environmental outcomes while working efficiently and effectively for the local community and industry. And certainly I think that within our period of time as this bill takes effect we will see the gains made from that. We will certainly see that the protection that is accorded to many of our national iconic sites and those that are of importance to the communities in which they live continue to be protected and to be valued by those who live within those communities.


I would also say that there are another set of eyes that need to be focused on the environment, those of all of us in this chamber. We have a role as members of our electorates in representing constituents to ensure that we also are advocates within that process to protect those environmental areas that are important to the people who live within our electorates, who live within the state or, more importantly, who live within this nation. The environment is something that, once lost, cannot be regained in its pristine form, and certainly there is an impact when man does not follow a process that considers the interrelationship between development and that of the environment.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2014-06-16,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (16:59):  I rise to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014. I note that today is 16 June. I know, Deputy Speaker Kelly, you are aware of this date. I know also that you are a mad-keen literature fan and would know that today is Bloomsday. It is also my brother Simon's birthday, so happy birthday to my brother. 


It is also the day that the Queensland government officially declared the Galilee Basin State Development Area. The SDA is designed to facilitate rail corridors between proposed new mines in the Galilee Basin and the Abbot Point coal terminal, right on the Great Barrier Reef. This basically gives power to the state government to compulsorily acquire properties to build rail lines under the State Development and Public Works Organisation Act, irrespective of whether the farmers on that route object to that.


This point illustrates perfectly some of the problems that come with being a federation. When Australia's Constitution was drafted, the environment was not considered a significant national issue, so the government was not given any explicit power in the Constitution to make laws about environmental matters. The attitude of the time was, 'Conquer, clear and carve up into productive, economic farming units.' Even though we were an urban country at the time the Constitution was written, and are now, there has been a gradual progression when it comes to environmental law. 


As a result of this constitutional silence, there has been some confusion over the years about the division of responsibility for environmental protection between states, the federal government, local governments and local communities. Many of the ad hoc national laws in relation to the environment have been introduced to give effect to Australian obligations, triggered by over 90 international environmental agreements that the government has ratified. These agreements or treaties cover topics such as World Heritage areas, which are important for Queensland, because we have the Great Barrier Reef, but also for Tasmania and many other areas. 


I note the member for Franklin is sitting at the dispatch box. She would be very passionate and aware of the history, in terms of environmental protection afforded Tasmania under those treaties. I think she might have had an F111 fly over at one stage—just to work out what was going on—a few years back, under Prime Minister Hawke. Other topics are climate change, marine pollution, the recording of pollutants, the remediation of land and biodiversity management, particularly preventing the extinction of species.


In an attempt to clarify confusion between state and federal environmental powers and to make sure that Australia complies with its international obligations, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill was introduced to take on responsibility for developments that had the potential to impact upon matters of national environmental significance. It is very important that everyone in Australia understands that this parliament is concerned by the EPBC with the matters of national environmental significance.


The EPBC was introduced in 1999 as a piece of fundamental environmental legislation for Australia by the Howard government. I commend them for it. Australian state and territory governments undertook shared responsibility for protecting our natural resources. After more than 10 years with the current legislation, negotiations began about the readiness to negotiate the transfer of environmental approval powers. At COAG, in December 2012, Prime Minister Gillard made the right decision to delay that transfer, indicating that more work needed to be done to progress such bilateral agreements. Obviously we need to get it right. When we do not get it right, species disappear, habitats are destroyed and we breach our international treaty obligations. 


One reason cited by Prime Minister Gillard for the government's hesitation was the need to ensure that high environmental standards would be consistently maintained across all jurisdictions. We would hate to have nine applications and nine sets of red tape that only confuse businesses. Now, without proper consultation and recognition of the severe consequences that come with handing over the decision-making power to state and territory governments, the Abbott government will remove federal protection of our native flora, fauna, ecological communities and heritage places, such as the Great Barrier Reef, effectively taking a step back to the bad old days.


My major concern about this amendment is that the states and territories are overly dependent on royalty revenues from the extractive sector, the mining sector. So the proposed bilateral agreements could mean the business sector would face an even more complex regulatory environment, due to the significant variations in different states' environmental regulation frameworks. The one-stop shop model that was behind this legislation in the first place, that the Abbott government is putting forward, will harm the natural environment. It gives powers to states and territories that will see reduced protection for our nationally threatened species—our World Heritage regions, wetlands, migratory species and Commonwealth marine parks, including the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in my home state of Queensland.


Throughout the 1960s the Bjelke-Petersen government in Queensland advocated oil drilling on the Great Barrier Reef, the largest living structure on the planet and one of the most complex ecosystems. In 1973 the Whitlam government passed the Seas and Submerged Lands Act, which gave the Commonwealth authority over the states in matters concerning seas surrounding Australia. This legislation was used to block the Bjelke-Petersen government's plans to allow oil drilling on the Great Barrier Reef. Whilst the Queensland and New South Wales governments challenged this legislation in the High Court, the court found that the Commonwealth powers were constitutionally valid. In 1975 the Whitlam government created the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and created an authority to manage it for future generations. That organisation continues to perform this function today. By 1983 the marine park had been progressively expanded, becoming the largest marine park in the world. What a great legacy for a government—a Labor government, of course.


I am sad to say that the day after the LNP government was elected in Queensland—in March, two years ago—the Deputy Premier announced that he wanted to see the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park contract, become smaller. He did not mention it in the lead-up to the election, but it is part of that LNP tradition. I will quickly list some of the other things the LNP government has done—there are 21 items. They removed laws to protect urban areas from mining. They axed future conservation areas. They bulldozed tree-clearing laws and released millions of litres of contaminated mine water. They cancelled every renewable energy project. They limited rights in terms of appropriate development. They commenced logging in state reserves, expanded oil shale extraction and production, opened up national parks to grazing and partnered with the mining industry. They introduced pay-to-damage laws. They affected bats. They removed riparian vegetation protection and sacked hundreds of public servants, especially in the environment department. They defunded the Environmental Defenders Office. They axed wild-river protections, abolished the waste levy, cut funds to koala organisations, gutted the coastal protection laws, recommenced uranium mining and extended sand mining. They fired up dormant coal-fired power stations and removed the need for local councils to account for sea-level rises in their planning laws. That is just a snapshot of what the state government of Queensland has done.


Obviously handing approval powers to the states, like Queensland, will not lead to more efficient or effective processes. The already stretched resources of state governments, particularly where they have had public servants sacked—especially the more experienced ones with the corporate knowledge—will mean that the approval process will be convoluted, unpredictable and unreliable. Earlier this month the Newman government in Queensland announced that five so-called megaports would be allowed along the state's coast under its blueprint for dredging programs near the reef. Abbot Point, near Bowen in the state's north, one of the world's biggest coal terminals, was declared a Port Development Priority Area under the Queensland Ports Strategy, along with Gladstone, Hay Point, Mackay and Townsville.


A recent report by UNESCO found that the Newman government cannot be trusted with the protection and management of our greatest natural asset, the Great Barrier Reef—great consequences for tourism! The UNESCO report raised significant concerns with the health and management of the Great Barrier Reef and has recommended it be considered for listing as World Heritage in danger at its next session. UNESCO will make a ruling at the World Heritage Committee meeting in Doha, and I hope that this warning will be a wake-up call for the current governments at both a national and state level. The first thing the Newman government should do is take back responsibility for enforcing, monitoring and reporting on water quality in the Great Barrier Reef catchment, which it abandoned soon after coming to government—providing a licence to pollute, effectively.


Some environmental groups have noted that the changes to the EPBC Act would lead to a culture of litigation in the environmental movement, creating a situation in which developments are caught up in an increasing number of lawsuits as communities go through other avenues to protect their wildlife and land, whereas the EPBC Act was all about making it simpler.


The situation on the Great Barrier Reef is telling. According to the Australian Institute of Marine Science, 50 per cent of the coral on the Great Barrier Reef has been lost since 1960. We all know that state governments have a direct stake in major developments, particularly when it comes to the money they will receive from mining royalties—especially in a budget where the federal government has cut off much of their funding; $80 billion was cut overnight in the budget a few weeks back. Without federal intervention there would be oil rigs on the Great Barrier Reef and a dam on the Franklin River. With half of the Great Barrier Reef's coral lost already, we are on the cliff of an unprecedented and massive port and shipping expansion that could turn the reef into an industrial highway for supertankers. In fact, it could be an increase of 480 extra ships a year if the Carmichael mine reaches full production; not just a few more ships—we are talking about a projected 7,000 supertankers passing through the reef every year. As I said, the Newman government has just granted approval for the Galilee Basin coalmine despite serious environmental concerns raised by experts appointed by the Commonwealth. The $16.5 billion Carmichael project would add to that in terms of producing about 60 million tonnes of coal a year—a mine covering 200 square kilometres. It is incredible.


The EPBC Act was put in place to protect matters of environmental significance and the federal government should have oversight of this. They should protect matters of national interest so we can fulfil our World Heritage, Ramsar and other international obligations. When it comes to international obligations, the Australian public do not have confidence, sadly, in our state governments—be they Labor or Liberal or anything in between. One reason for this is that it should not be one state alone that decides whether a matter that is of national—or international—significance should be protected. This is why the EPBC Act was put in place in the first place, after the Tasmanian dam case.


Given the evidence of how state laws and state capacities are not adequate to fulfil national and international environmental obligations, environmental groups, environmental lawyers and the Australian public do not have confidence that this process should go ahead. In fact, in a recent Queensland Audit Office report—this is a Queensland government entity—regarding mining and waste-resource industries in Queensland and how effectively they are being managed by the department of environment in Queensland, there was the following statement:


EHP (Department of Environment and Heritage Protection) is not fully effective in its supervision, monitoring and enforcement of environmental conditions and is exposing the state to liability and the environment to harm unnecessarily.


That is from the Queensland government's own audit report into how effective it can be as the police officer on the beat. This is from the Queensland Audit Office. It actually reports to the Queensland government. This shows that the state government is unable to protect our national natural resources effectively.


I, like the rest of the Labor Party, oppose the bilateral agreement's implementation in its current form and the hand-down of powers to states through the EPBC Act amendments presented to the House. I would ask the LNP members who are able to, to vote according to their conscience—particularly the Queensland members of parliament with the Great Barrier Reef at their doorstep, such as the member for Herbert. I am sure he will be able to be a freethinking individual and make a decision that benefits his community, which is heavily reliant on tourism. He will know that we should be doing all we can to protect the Great Barrier Reef—to protect the reefs off Magnetic Island and the tourism connected with that. I would ask the LNP—all of the LNP, but particularly those Queensland LNP members—to consider their grandchildren and their great-grandchildren and do likewise. Just say no: you know it makes sense. LNP members are able to make an individual decision any time they want when it comes to a piece of policy. I have only seen two or three of them actually have the guts to cross the floor when it came to a piece of policy.




Mr Robert:
  How many Labor members have crossed the floor, big man? How many?




Mr PERRETT:
  The Labor Party is bound by caucus rules. You would have to be an idiot not to know that the Labor Party is bound by caucus rules, but Exhibit A speaks up.


The reality is the environmental protection legislation before the chamber does not protect the environment. It undermines the very piece of legislation that John Howard and other environment ministers were proud of. I can speak with some authority about what goes on in Queensland, and the reality is we do not have a state that is effective when it comes to policing its own environmental laws. It has no chance of making the right decision when it is bound to the profits from royalties from the mining industry.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2014-06-16,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Government Whip) (17:14):  There is no question at all that the lack of harmonisation and the duplication of federal, state and local environmental approvals processes adds complexity, cost, frustration and a lack of certainty right across the country. The intent of this legislation, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilaterial Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014, is to maintain the high environmental standards under national environmental law while delivering benefits for the community and business through a single approvals entry point at the state level. The provisions for a one-stop shop have actually existed since the EPBC Act was introduced. The Commonwealth will remain accountable for its obligations, including international treaties, under the EPBC Act and has an ongoing role with commitments under bilateral agreements. The Commonwealth will also retain an approval role for its actions in Commonwealth waters and Commonwealth land or by Commonwealth agencies.


I note that the states and territories have to demonstrate to the minister that their environmental assessment and approvals processes meet the high standards in the EPBC Act. When people think about the management of the Australian environment, they often underestimate the commitment of coalition governments. I have confidence in the state governments, particularly the Western Australia government. It was the Sir Charles Court-led Liberal government of Western Australia that from 1974 to 1983 took major steps towards the conservation of the natural heritage of the state, more than doubling the amount of land set aside in national parks to 4.5 million hectares.


Sir Charles was also the first to call a halt to the indiscriminate clearing of agricultural land, which until his time had actually been a requirement of landholders acquiring freehold or leasehold title. His Liberal government took the brave but necessary decision to enforce clearing bans in the Collie River catchment in my electorate because they had identified the growing and ominous threat of salinity. Salinity in the Collie catchment is still an area of grave concern. The Wellington Dam, a 156-gigalitre water asset held by the state government, remains stranded with a total dissolved salt level of over 1,000 parts per million. This is twice the potable drinking water standard, and some critical and possibly lateral thinking is required to achieve the best productive use of this water resource.


Sir Charles also identified the impending threat of Phytophthora dieback in WA's native forests. His government took the tough decision of quarantining three-quarters of a million hectares of jarrah forest from logging to protect this valuable and iconic natural asset. The history of environmental care and protection by the Liberal Party in Western Australia is a long and detailed one—which is why I have that level of confidence—and it is still going on. The current Liberal led government in Western Australia has invested in a range of conservation programs, significantly adding reservations created as part of the state's Kimberley Science and Conservation Strategy.


Another area of considerable focus has been in marine conservation. The WA state government created a new reserve in Camden Sound to protect the internationally renowned whale breeding area there and formalised the 124,000 hectare Ngari Capes Marine Park off the south west of Western Australia in the state marine zone within three nautical miles of the coast off the electorate of Forrest. The proclamation of the Ngari Capes Marine Park in 2012 was a highlight of marine conservation in the region. Unlike the Commonwealth marine planning process that was occurring concurrently under federal Labor, the state process was inclusive and scientifically valid.


The state of Western Australia has a great record in environmental conservation. Practices have evolved over the years. Having federal oversight in the 1930s to 1970s would not have stopped the overclearing that occurred throughout the WA Wheatbelt, leading to the salinity and acidity issues that exist today, because, in fact, both state and federal governments supported it. But, as our knowledge base grew and the consequences became known, both levels of government have supported action. I do note that where there was an active timber industry, especially in the South West and in the Forrest electorate, forests were valued and retained. Where they were not harvested and managed to retain a future resource, forests generally disappeared. Those who love the iconic jarrah and karri forests of the South West can in part thank the timber industry for their ongoing existence.


It is with this recognition of the history of the ecology in Western Australia that I support the bill before the House today. I also note that, at a federal level, it was a federal coalition who appointed the first minister for the environment and, of course, it was the Howard government who introduced the EPBC Act in 1999. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill recognises that the states and territories are actually the land managers defined in our Commonwealth Constitution. It also recognises that in those states and territories they have the knowledge, the skills and the on-ground experience to make good decisions for local ecosystems and local communities through this legislation, administering both state and federal acts in a one-stop shop process.


There remains an important role for the Commonwealth: that of oversight, but only where it is empowered by Commonwealth legislation to do so. There are times and conditions where circumstances will demand a federal response. Under the system proposed by the Minister for the Environment in this bill, there is ample opportunity for the Commonwealth to engage with state environment departments throughout the assessment process. This is an opportunity for improved interaction and communication between state and federal bodies, with a greater potential for an efficient, effective process and better outcomes. Of course, in areas of Commonwealth legislation jurisdiction the federal government retains the power and the right to intercede in a more direct manner. This is completely appropriate as well. There may be times ahead where the Commonwealth government needs to call in the assessment and/or the approval of a project. Working in concordance but with the power to disagree in individual cases will be the fallback that is needed to make this system work based on scientific evidence.


The minister has the power under the EPBC Act to suspend or cancel an agreement. This is part of the comprehensive assurance framework. The transparency around decisions and access to information ensure that the broader community can be part of the monitoring process for the one-stop shop. State and territory audits, transitional and five-yearly review of bilateral agreements and reporting mechanisms are further parts of this, as is an escalated dispute resolution process to resolve any issues.


This legislation is part of the answer to the issues of streamlined but safe approvals. I hope it will see an end to approvals taking five to seven years, as has happened in my electorate in the south-west of Western Australia to mineral sandminers. That is just one example, but it is repeated again and again. Having an outcome take so long, putting investments, jobs and the economy of the region at risk, clearly demonstrates why this legislation is a step in the right direction. The need for a complementary and more unified process is highlighted by the approvals process as it exists in my Forrest electorate. The process in my electorate can generally be described in most applications by using two words: 'possums' and 'cockatoos'. These two vulnerable species—the western ringtail possum and Carnaby's black cockatoo—are the focus for endangered species in my area. This is especially the case along the coastal plain leading to the edge of the scarp. These species are picked up by the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act federally, which can significantly slow down the approvals process.


However, the experts on the western ringtail possum and Carnaby's black cockatoo are in the state Department of Environment and Conservation. So it makes sense—it is common sense—that that department should lead both the research and the response to the ringtail possum and the Carnaby's black cockatoo. The one-stop shop will promote the sharing of environmental information and data between business, governments and, importantly, the community. I believe that the government and the minister are both to be commended on this initiative.


As I said, this is certainly a step in the right direction for harmonisation to reduce the levels of complexity, the cost, the frustration and the lack of certainty that exists across the country.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (17:25):  I would like to let the member for Richmond know that she owes me when she does get to the chamber! I would like to make a couple of points in relation to this. The first is that I support the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Biolateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014. I will tell you why. A couple of issues have arisen in Townsville. One is with respect to the delay of a major development of a residential estate. The cause for the delay has always been the black-throated finch. They spent about $5,000 getting the approvals from the local government. They spent about $50,000 getting approvals from the state government. They were up to about $1.6 million still trying to get approvals from the federal government during the last parliament, when we at last saw some movement on that. So when you look at what has to be done with the three levels of government you see the complications arise.


The other issue arose in relation to a sandmining lease down at Cungulla. Friends of mine have bought a sandmining lease between two operating sand mines, and with exactly the same purpose. Two small-business men bought this lease with their superannuation. The sandmining lease had on it a poplar gum. The poplar gum was the only known food source of the bare-rumped sheathtail bat. Yes, the bare-rumped sheathtail bat! No-one has ever seen one in north Queensland but they had to prove that this thing could not come back because it was the only known food source for it. It was like trying to disprove a potential alien landing site.


These guys were held up by the federal end of the legislation for over 12 years, even though they were between two existing businesses doing exactly the same thing. That is why we have to have this legislation. It is not about the federal government abnegating or moving away from imposing federal laws; it is about giving ordinary business people opportunities to have simple processes and a one-stop shop. You still have to pass federal legislation, and all the things that the federal legislation does, but you only have to do it in one place; you do not have to keep going back, finding things more and more complicated. That is why I support this legislation. I think the minister, Greg Hunt, has done a fantastic job in getting this thing done. 


We have cause for concern when we do not have the right people in the right jobs. A uranium mine is being discussed around Townsville. We have to make sure that it is still going to be looked at and that it is going to be taken very seriously. It still has to pass federal legislation; it is just that it is a one-stop shop. That is what members opposite seem not to understand. I was holding the fort, so I thank the House.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2014-06-16,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (17:28):  I thank the member for Herbert for getting up on his scrapers and doing his bit while we got our acts together. I am not sure I agree with everything he said, but that is beside the point. I am pleased that he was able to do the right thing.


This Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014 will, among other things, allow states and territories to be accredited for approval decisions on large coalmining and coal seam gas developments that are likely to have a significant impact on water resources; ensure that all states and territories are able to be declared, under the EPBC Act for the purpose of requesting advice from the independent expert scientific committee; clarify that proponents do not need to make referrals to the Commonwealth for actions that are covered by an approved bilateral agreement and, significantly—these are described by some as minor miscellaneous amendments—allow approved bilateral agreements to include approvals made by any person or organisation authorised by the state or territory, such as local governments, rather than only entities that meet the EPBC Act definition of the 'state' or an 'agency of the state'. The bill further clarifies that approval of bilateral agreements could apply to projects that had been approved before the minister accredits the state or territory process as long as the action was approved in accordance with the relevant accredited process, clarifies that the minister can take into account all matters that the minister considers relevant when deciding whether to accredit a management arrangement or authorisation process; and ensures that bilateral agreements can make reference to the most current version of the instruments and policy documents.


I will come back to those in a moment but I would like to say in summary that, while on the face of it allowing state and territory governments to be a one-stop shop and do the business sounds attractive, in its substance, when you examine it, it has real difficulties. I say this as someone who has had the luxury, in a way, of observing the interaction between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory government over a generation, of seeing how the former Northern Territory CPL governments have interacted with the Commonwealth on environmental issues, specifically in the first instance of the declaration of Uluru National Park. I remember very vividly the campaign that was waged by the then Chief Minister of the Northern Territory opposing the declaration of the national park, which subsequently became a World Heritage area. What drove him was not what was best for the community or best for the nation, but his own political self-interest. What worries me about these proposals is that the political self-interest of individuals may override the best interests of the nation. I said earlier that one of the more minor miscellaneous amendments was clarifying that the minister can take into account all matters that the minister considers relevant when deciding whether to accredit a management arrangement or authorisation process. 


There have been a couple of issues recently in the Northern Territory which raise serious concerns about the capacity of ministers to do the right thing by the community. I want to refer to a proposal around the Sherwin Creek iron ore project, where the Northern Territory minister, through either ministerial approval or delegation to the Department of Mines, authorised the bulk sampling of 200,000 tonnes of ore that was exported to China and 200,000 tonnes of ore stockpiled on Stylo Station, owned by the CLP candidate in the last federal election, Mrs Tina McFarlane. This was done without informing the NT Environment Protection Agency. When the EPA examined the Sherwin iron ore project, it said that it was inappropriate and in contravention of the principles of ecologically sustainable development. Further, it said that such a decision could create a precedent for the quality of environmental management on mine sites when the government continues to be challenged by legacy mines that require costly remediation. I am talking about the Mount Todd mine, just north of Katherine, and Redbank. It further said that the Roper Highway must be upgraded to an appropriate standard, preferably a dual-laned, fully sealed road to at least secondary highway standard, before approval by the Department of Transport to proceed beyond one million tonnes per annum ore transport and that the proponent must contribute proportionally to the upgrade. 


I ask you to consider what I have just said. The current Northern Territory minister—of a government we are proposing through this legislation be given an authority over environmental matters and to act on behalf of the Commonwealth—gave an approval to a mining company to extract 400,000 tonnes of ore without any environmental or transport approval. Let me talk about that transport approval for a moment: the Roper Highway is a single-lane public road, which now has multiple ore road trains travelling along it. There was a report on ABC television last week explaining how dreadfully dangerous it is. The mining company has not put one red cent into expanding or developing this road—nor has the Northern Territory government. They are putting people's lives in danger. On the one hand, we have the potential environmental disaster of allowing a mine like this to proceed without any environmental safeguards in place and, on the other hand, we have the real possibility of fatalities on that road—an important public road—because of the commercial interests of a mining company that has not invested one dollar in helping to mitigate the risk of transporting ore along this public road. The Northern Territory government irresponsibly has done absolutely nothing to ensure this public road is properly dealt with.


We know that when the EPBC Act was first passed in 1999, it was legislation to avoid the mistakes of past governments over the previous century. Here we have a current mistake. Just look at the history of the Northern Territory since the first overlanders—and may I say many of the carpetbaggers that followed in the footsteps of John McDouall Stuart and others—to see the environmental and cultural damage that has occurred in the name of investment and jobs without appropriate consideration of environmental standards or environmental management.


What is required is to have processes in place for evaluating the environmental impacts of development proposals, consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development. This legislation refers specifically to the idea of coalmining and to the use of water. I understand also that the Northern Territory government is currently receiving submissions into fracking across several regions of the Territory. I believe that the period for making submissions has been extended, given the large number of antifracking submissions that have been received. Only last weekend, I was at the Burunga Festival—a great festival—south of Katherine. The topics of fracking in the Katherine region and the processes for the Northern Territory government to approve drilling were raised by a number of community groups; by individuals—both from the pastoral industry, who have a very efficient beef cattle export industry, and also from the community; and by people who you would associate with the environmental movement. There was a broad cross-section of support. In Alice Springs, there is a similar community group beginning to activate to oppose fracking in the southern part of the Territory. The Arid Lands Environment Centre, a community based environmental group, is taking the lead on the issue. In spite of the fact that, as a result of both the Northern Territory government's budget and the Commonwealth government's budget, they will lose $100,000 of funding.


People are asking very basic questions of not only the Northern Territory government but also the Commonwealth government, in terms of this fracking process. How many millions of litres of water per frack? How many fracks per well? How many wells are proposed across the regions of the Territory? I have heard that it could be up to 60,000 wells. Where will the water come from? What chemicals will be blasted into the hole with the water to frack a well? What are the health risks? We obviously need to consider the toxic effects. What are the impacts on flora and fauna? Will there be waste-water ponds at the wells? What evaporation process will take place? What residue gases will end up in the atmosphere? What is the process for sealing the wells? When will all of this be done? These are questions that the community want answered. Yet, to date, they are not getting answers.


I mentioned attitudes of government and, potentially, considerations of ministers. We know that there has been a lot of speculation around issues to do with water in the Top End. During the lead-up to the last election, one large farm in the Northern Territory—again, owned by a CLP candidate; the then CLP candidate—was given a licence for 5,000 megalitres of water. When asked in a recent interview on the ABC what this water would be used for—what she intended to grow and how she intended to use it—her response was that she did not know. This is a supposedly responsible Northern Territory government making water allocations—based on what? Yet we are asked in this place to cede to the Northern Territory government the authority to make decisions on behalf of the Commonwealth when we know full well that the current Northern Territory government are acting irresponsibly, and in their own political interest, and appearing—at least from my perspective—to be rorting the system to help their mates. Most recently, a CLP fundraiser—someone who has never grown a thing in his life except perhaps his hair!—received 21,000 megalitres in the Daly region: eight times more than our serious farmers are using now. This is a person who has never grown anything. He is a CLP donor, who has subsequently resigned from the CLP because he is a magistrate. What does that tell you about the way in which the CLP is operating in the Northern Territory in terms of the allocation of water?


We in this place have a right to be concerned. If the current government wants to provide the capacity for state and territory governments to act on its behalf, we need to have the confidence that they will act responsibly. I have absolutely no doubt that the responsible departmental officials in the Northern Territory will operate as they should—very professionally—and provide appropriate advice. But it is clear that, in the context of the Northern Territory, advice does not matter, and science matters even less.


A number of people have been arguing that the Northern Territory government should have a dam on the Daly River. We know that when the Northern Territory Chief Minister was asked about such a dam, he did not have a response which was anywhere near appropriate. We need to understand that if we are to look after, in this case, the fragile environments of Northern Australia, we need to be very careful about the responsibilities we give to state and territory governments to act on our behalf. The current Northern Territory government and previous CLP governments have shown that they have acted irresponsibly—not in the best interests of the environment but in their own political interests; and not in the best interests of either the Northern Territory community and its people or the Australian nation. So I question very seriously the proposals that are now before us in this bill—particularly that element that, ostensibly, allows the Northern Territory minister to take political considerations into account in any decisions which are made.

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2014-06-16,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (17:43):  I rise to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014. This is a bill that cannot be supported by anyone who takes seriously the regulatory role of the national government in respect of the environment we all share and the environmental values and biodiversity which we have a responsibility to protect for future generations. This bill represents another instalment of this government's 'anything goes' approach to development and big business, and follows the pattern set in their capitulations to big polluters on the issue of climate change, and to big miners on the issue of a fair share for all Australians of the profits derived from the resources that belong to all Australians.


Essentially, this government wants to scuttle out of the way and let the brute and unequal forces of the market do as they will. It wants to take issues of the greatest environmental importance and sensitivity, and have them determined by state and local governments, removing some key protections when it comes to World Heritage, endangered species and water resources, and failing even to ensure that this devolution of environmental protection authority will result in consistent processes from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. That change, in particular, is not just bad for the environment but bad too for the certainty of development prospects and proposals.


This goes to the fundamental difference between Labor and the coalition. We understand that representative government derives its authority and owes its duty to the people, not to corporations, and we understand that representative government is obliged to act on the people's behalf in protecting community values, assets and resources against what can be the contrary interests of large companies. Those opposite believe that government simply needs to get out of the way, to vacate the field and hold open the gate in the onrush of market forces and profit motives. There should be little wonder whose interest that approach suits best.


In Western Australia we do not need to be too creative in imagining the kind of shortcuts and process failures that might be involved through the proposed derogation of the Commonwealth's environmental responsibility. We have seen the Western Australian EPA get itself into terrible knots over the environmental assessment of the proposed Kimberley gas hub at James Price Point, a situation where four of the five board members involved in that critical decision had to withdraw through conflicts of interest, having already participated in aspects of the determination, and where the chairperson nevertheless saw fit to deliver the final determination and approvals alone. Thankfully, in August last year the Supreme Court of Western Australia said the approvals were unlawful and invalid. 


Is that the kind of process we are now going to see for all manner of critical environmental assessments around this country—from the Kimberley to the Great Barrier Reef, from the Tasmanian forests to the Coral Sea? Is that the kind of process people in my electorate can expect in relation to the proposed bisection of the Beeliar wetlands by Roe Highway stage 8? Are we going to see WA's flawed environmental assessment process determine the fate of a rare and fragile wetland whose ecosystem is of great environmental, Indigenous and community significance and which supports migratory birds protected under treaty?


The Labor government introduced special protections in relation to coal seam gas development in recognition of the legitimate concerns that exist around the contamination of groundwater. We introduced a water trigger and we ensured that coal seam gas and large-scale coal extraction developments could not be the subject of an approval bilateral. That protection is taken away with this bill, and I know, having received a great deal of correspondence from my constituents and from people around Australia on this issue over the last year, that this is a step that will be widely condemned. It has to be recognised that there is a checks-and-balances aspect to the existing system that should not be weakened in the manner that is proposed. There is a place for approval bilaterals in certain circumstances and upon proper constraint, but the approach taken here is moving towards a blanket and dangerous abdication of federal responsibility. Common sense tells you that the precautionary principle should apply and that community expectation in the area of coal seam gas development, in particular, is that the highest standards of scrutiny and regulation be maintained.


I suspect that every member in this place would both acknowledge and be proud of the fact that Australia is a continent of environmental treasures. Most of us would have some kind of personal connection to a piece of coast, forest or a wetland in our home state, if not in our electorates. In WA for me personally there are many, many places like that, and I have spoken in this place about a range of natural wonders on land and in the ocean in remote parts of Western Australia and right in the heart of my electorate of Fremantle. It may be that some members are not aware that the entire south-west of Western Australia comprises an ancient granite slab known as the Yilgarn Shield, and that this dry continental plateau, with its poor soils and heat and low to moderate rainfall, is nevertheless home to an utterly remarkable range of diversity of life. Indeed, the south-west botanical province is one of only 34 recognised international biodiversity hotspots. More than half the region's 12,000 plant species are not found anywhere else in the world. Within the Fitzgerald River National Park, which includes 70 kilometres of unbroken coastal reserve and is classed as a UNESCO biosphere, there are 1,900 unique plant species, 300 more than exist in all of Britain.


The vast reaches of Western Australia, north and south, are not barren ground, even when they seem low and dry and lightly populated by humans. On the contrary, right across this continent are examples of natural beauty and biodiversity that can be put at risk by inappropriate development. That is not to say that economic activity or resource development is inherently damaging to our environment. Indeed, an effective system of environmental planning and regulation will generally provide outcomes that protect the environment, enable development and ensure a balance between economic activities like mining and tourism or fishing and other kinds of recreational ocean use. The EPBC Act properly constituted and administered with the appropriate resources has been the bedrock of a system in which the protection of critical environmental values are paramount but through which economic activity is enabled through a careful and consistent process Australia wide.


I would just like to say a couple of things on the topic of 'green tape'. In short, I would suggest that anyone who thinks 'green tape' is a clever way of reducing the issue of environmental protection to something trivial and annoying, something that people might want to get rid of, should think again. If you explain to someone that 'green tape' is a shorthand way of describing the high-quality and high-standard environmental assessment and protection of our oceans, forests, rivers, wetlands, reefs and endangered species, and then ask them if they believe the government should provide less of the stuff, they will ask you whether you have taken leave of your senses. If you had a box of 'green tape' with you at that point, they would ask you for some. They would probably suggest the tape should be wider. They would probably tell you to get bigger rolls of the tape and more of it, and that it should be as sticky and strong as 21st century tape technology allows. So if those opposite think that the weakening of environmental protection contained in this bill—or in other reforms—will be welcomed by the Australian community because it amounts to so-called 'green-tape' reduction, think again. 


On that point, I want to recognise the enormous community engagement in the Places You Love campaign, whose slogan says it all: 'Protect the laws that protect the places you love.' In addition to the 1.5 million Australians who have joined the campaign to protest against this government's dismantling of environmental protection, there is a cavalcade of groups who are similarly committed to arguing against the changes that this bill contains. For the record, and as an indication of the strength of the opposition to these measures, I will list those organisations: ACT Conservation Council, Arid Lands Environment Centre Australasian Bat Society, Australian Conservation Foundation, Australian Marine Conservation Society, Australian Rainforest Conservation Society, Bat Conservation and Rescue Queensland Inc., Birds SA, BirdLife Australia, Cairns and Far North Environment Centre, Climate and Health Alliance, Colong Foundation for Wilderness, Conservation Council of South Australia, Conservation Council of Western Australia, EDO Victoria, Environment Centre NT, Environs Kimberley, Environment Tasmania, Environment Victoria, Friends of the Earth Melbourne, Greenpeace Australia, Hope Australia, Humane Society International, International Fund for Animal Welfare, Invasive Species Council, National Parks Association of the ACT, National Parks Association of NSW, National Parks Australia Council, Nature Conservation Council of NSW, Queensland Conservation Council, Queensland National Parks Association, Rainforest Rescue, Sunshine Coast Environment Council, Tasmanian Conservation Trust, Tasmanian National Parks Association, The Nature Conservation Society of South Australia, Total Environment Centre, Victorian National Parks Association, The Wilderness Society, Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland, and WWF Australia. I thank all of these organisations for the fine work they do in protecting and advocating for Australia's unique environment.


The national government rightly has a specific role in assessing development proposals whose potential impacts include matters of national importance or relate to conservation outcomes that are guaranteed by international agreements. The national government is rightly placed to determine proposals which, in many cases, involve clear conflicts of interest for the states and territories, whose revenue is dependent on development royalties. The provision of consistent, high-level and high-standard environmental protection and biodiversity conservation is the responsibility of the Australian federal government, and the proposed slashing of the protections that have served such a valuable purpose is irresponsible and will likely have consequences that we, our children and their children may well seriously regret.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2014-06-16,"



Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (17:53):  The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014 is the latest instalment in a series of breathtaking and relentless attacks on a whole range of attempts to protect Australia's beautiful, unique and fragile environments—a progress which was achieved with the blood, sweat and tears of many who love this land we call Australia. The rollcall of Commonwealth regression in environmental matters by this government is a long one. There is the proposed repeal of the carbon price legislation and its proposed replacement by what is called a 'direct action program'. There was the designation 26 March as 'repeal day' for the purpose of repealing more than 1,000 'redundant' federal laws and some 9,500 regulations, including measures relating to the agricultural chemicals and veterinary medicines approval process, the regulation of ozone depleting substances and synthetic greenhouse gases, permit and levy processes for sea installations, the repealing of section 255A of the Water Act—which relates to the assessment of mining operations in the Murray Darling Basin—the review of the Renewable Energy Target and the proposed abolition of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.


There is also the attempt to have 70,000 hectares of Tasmanian World Heritage forest delisted by the World Heritage Committee. There is the refusal of the government to include climate change or the environment on the agenda for the G20 meeting in Brisbane, despite strong urgings from the USA and the EU. There was the recently announced review of the Howard government's Water Act in relation to the Murray Darling Basin, the approval of extensive dumping of sediments in the Great Barrier Reef in connection with a major expansion of port facilities at Abbot Point in Queensland to allow exploitation of the Galilee Basin coal deposits. There was the abandonment of the management plans for Commonwealth designated marine parks, thereby removing protections from fishing and sanctuary zones within these parks. There was the termination of the National Wildlife Corridors Plan and the termination of funding for the national system of the environmental defender's offices, which was established back in 1995. There was the termination of the grants funding scheme for environmental non-government organisations, which was established as far back as 1973, thereby threatening the continued existence of many small environmental organisations and a number of state conservation councils. 


Further, there is the proposed extinguishment of a number of national bodies addressing environmental matters, including the Climate Commission, the National Water Commission and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. There is the introduction of legislation to repeal the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Program. There is the reduction of funding for Landcare by $484 million, and there was the referral by the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, to the Australian Law Reform Commission of a reference to inquire into the incursion into freedoms—for example, property rights—by particular types of laws, including environmental laws.


This is the most sustained, concerted attack on the environment. But, in a field which is crowded with contenders, I think there is a case that this is the worst piece of environmental legislation that this government has introduced, because it turns back the clock on some 40 years of Commonwealth involvement in environmental protection. We should not mince words about this. Under the approach proposed by this bill, Fraser Island would have been mined, the Franklin River would have been dammed and the Daintree River would have been logged. We might have even seen the Great Barrier Reef explored for oil. In each case, state governments were prepared to see outstanding natural assets of national significance—arguably of global significance—trashed for economic advantage.


Rob Fowler, who is the adjunct professor at the law school at the University of South Australia, has set out something of the history of Commonwealth involvement in environmental matters. He says:


Since the dawning of environmental awareness in early 1970's, the Commonwealth government has steadily increased its involvement in environmental matters, through legislation, policies and programmes that have largely been developed on a cooperative basis with the states and territories.


He goes on to say:


…the recently elected Commonwealth government appears to be intent on dismantling much of this Commonwealth fabric, masking its apparently ideological retreat from involvement in environmental protection behind an oft-repeated mantra of ""red tape/green tape reduction"". The pinnacle of this assault is the government's ""one stop shop"" programme. I want to suggest to you that this seemingly technical exercise involving odd instruments called bilateral agreements, which might not be expected to attract the attention of the ordinary person in the street, is in fact a matter of the most profound importance and concern in terms of the future protection of the Australian environment.


I believe he is absolutely correct.


I point out that this is not some Rudd-Gillard government legacy which is being trampled over; it is a Howard government one. This is an act of 1999 which is being gutted by the most hostile national government to the environment in nearly 50 years of national government involvement in environmental questions.


I want to draw to the attention of the House the objects section of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, section 3A. Subsections (c) and (d) refer to:


(c) the principle of inter-generational equity—that the present generation should ensure that the health, diversity and productivity of the environment is maintained or enhanced for the benefit of future generations;


(d) the conservation of biological diversity and ecological integrity should be a fundamental consideration in decision-making …


When we look at that background, we can see that the present legislation is of real concern. The Places You Love alliance has pointed out that this is not so much a one-stop-shop proposal as an eight-stop-shop proposal. It is an approach that will create uncertainty for business and undermine investor confidence. It will result in eight separate and different outcomes. There will be bilateral agreements between the federal government and each individual state and territory, relying on their inadequate and completely different legislative and regulatory regimes. The accreditation of state or territory laws that do not meet minimum requirements will put at risk matters of national environmental significance and may well breach our international obligations. While the stated intention of this policy is to reduce regulatory burden, the policy does the opposite, increasing regulatory obligations for business and increasing risk for all.


The alliance also make the point that state and territory governments frequently do not assess development proposals with the national interest in mind and that conflicts of interest occur because states are reliant on royalties and other income from large development projects and, in some cases, are the actual proponents of those projects. They further point out that the states do not have the capacity to adequately assess projects that relate to matters of national environmental significance. The eight-stop-shop model is neither efficient nor effective. It creates unreasonable risk for government, business and, most importantly, the environment and the community. When they have spoken with MPs around the parliament they have made the point that you can talk about red tape but you need to look at things like the health benefits of environmental legislation and regulation. For example, the United States Clean Air Act amendments resulted in benefits which exceeded the compliance costs by a factor of 30 to one and the European Union has calculated that the annual benefit to the European Union of environmental regulation is some 50 million euros per annum.


The Places You Love alliance, comprising more than 35 environment groups, commissioned a report by the Australian Network of Environmental Defenders Offices. One of the things that report examined was the various state environmental legislation arrangements to look at and assess the adequacy of threatened species and planning laws in Australian jurisdictions. Their analysis found that no state or territory meets all the core requirements of best practice threatened species legislation, that while the laws in some jurisdictions look good on paper they are not effectively implemented, that a number of important legislative tools available for managing and protecting threatened species are simply not used—for example, interim conservation orders and management plans are not utilised in Victoria; no critical habitats have been listed and no interim protection orders have been declared in Tasmania; and no essential habitat declarations have been made in the Northern Territory—and that many of the provisions referred to are often discretionary. Critical tools such as recovery plans and threat abatement plans are not mandatory. Time frames for action and performance indicators are largely absent and effective implementation is hampered by a lack of data and knowledge about the range and status of biodiversity across Australia. Their conclusion is that the state laws are simply not up to the task of protecting matters of national environmental significance.


They also make important points about the state of biodiversity in Australia. With almost 1,200 plant species and 343 species of animals considered endangered or vulnerable, the rate of species extinction in Australia is amongst the worst on the planet. The Commonwealth State of the environment 2011 report showed that the highest numbers of threatened species occur in more densely populated areas, particularly the east coast and the south-west coast of Western Australia, and that this significant rate of decline is particularly noticeable with mammals. Since European settlement, 18 species of endemic mammals have become extinct and about 100 species of vascular plants have become extinct as well. When we look at this situation overall we can see that it is a grim one, and we certainly do not want to see legislation which will make it worse, which is what this legislation will do.


I will return to some comments from Rob Fowler concerning the campaign against the Commonwealth's involvement in environmental approvals by the resources sector. He said:


There is nothing new in the current campaign … The mining industry railed against the application of the EPIP Act to its activities constantly from the time of its adoption in 1974, especially after the Fraser Government took the unexpected step of using the Act to prohibit the export of mineral sands extracted from Fraser Island. It was joined in this opposition for many years by the forestry industry, culminating in proposals in the early 1990's to introduce so-called ""resource security"" legislation.


He said:


The current 'green tape' propaganda is simply the latest stanza in an enduring campaign against Commonwealth involvement in environmental approvals by the resources sector … Underlying this campaign is a far larger issue with respect to the future of those involved in the fossil fuel industry in Australia. The coal oil and gas industries have a great deal at stake in the face of the growing pressure to shift Australia's energy generation from fossil fuels to renewables in response to the challenge of climate change. They have found a willing ear in the current coalition government, and it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the question of what is an appropriate role for the Commonwealth in environmental approvals has been captured by a much larger contest involving the future choice between fossil fuels and renewable energy in Australia. In short, the coalition government has become the handmaiden of the fossil fuel industry and is vigorously promoting its cause.


I conclude with the words of Ross Garnaut, in his John Freebairn lecture delivered in Melbourne on 20 May:


Big business has never been so directly influential with government, and senses that it might be a winner which takes all on environmental matters.


I urge the House to reject this legislation.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2014-06-16,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Opposition Whip) (18:08):  I concur with every comment made by the member for Wills. I think the final quote he shared with the House really sums it up. This government is the handmaiden of big business. When it comes to the environment I believe it stands condemned for its lack of commitment to the protection of our environment to ensure that the most valuable asset we have is preserved.


Unfortunately, future generations of Australians are going to see that our environment is considerably diminished. The legislation that we have before us today, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014, is one of the vehicles that will lead to our environment being diminished, because this government is the handmaiden of big business, of the fossil fuel industry and of the development sector in this country. When we hand the planning powers to the states and local governments it is like giving control of the blood bank to Dracula.


I am a member who has been a councillor and a member of state parliament, and I know how those levels of government evaluate and consider various pieces of legislation and developments. When I was a member in the state government I was very fortunate because at that particular time Bob Carr was the Premier of New South Wales, and he had a real commitment to the environment. But, unfortunately, his commitment is not shared by the current government.


For the record, this legislation amends the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to facilitate the delegation of environmental approval powers to the states and local governments. That is what I was alluding to earlier—the simple fact that the states and local governments will be in a position where they can make decisions about developments they are involved in. I really feel this is the wrong way to go. It even includes World Heritage listed properties, nuclear activities and approvals under the water trigger amendment. It is not good enough. It is not ensuring that our environment will be protected into the future.


In the last parliament I, along with the member for Wills and many on the other side of this House, was on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts. We conducted an inquiry into Australia's biodiversity in a changing climate. We learnt of the many challenges that our environment faces. We learnt of the many challenges that come before government and the need for the federal government to have a strong voice. During the consultation period, when we were receiving evidence, we had groups come along to us and talk about his very aspect. They said that this is something the Commonwealth must not do. We must not hand responsibility over to the state governments. Mr Deputy Speaker Goodenough, I believe that your predecessor was a member of that committee, and he made an enormous contribution towards the report we handed down.


We cannot let the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Environment abrogate their responsibility and just hand decisions to the state governments about what should and should not be preserved. There is not a state that I would confidently trust to oversee decisions relating to our precious environment. The states do not have the same thorough processes for looking at the adequacy of assessments of threatened species. They do not have the same commitment to that issue.


Within Shortland electorate there are many pristine areas that have a number of threatened species. When I was a councillor we looked at issues around threatened species, and we looked at them under the Commonwealth legislation. I did a similar thing as a member of state parliament. The Commonwealth legislation was taken into account. If there is no overarching umbrella that details the way threatened species need to be protected and looked after, then it is really putting a threat to those species. The extinction rate is frightening, particularly on the east coast of Australia, which has the highest concentration of population.


I urge the government to rethink its action in relation to this legislation, because it is bad legislation. It is going down the wrong path. In Queensland it is quite frightening to think what Premier Newman has planned for the Great Barrier Reef. The draft strategic assessment underlines concerns expressed by the committee in relation to 'serious decline in the condition of the Great Barrier Reef, including in coral recruitment and reef building across extensive parts of the property' and states that 'a business-as-usual approach to managing the property is not an option'. One of our most valuable environmental assets within this country is the Great Barrier Reef. It is a great tourist attraction; it is a source of biodiversity; and it is a source of great pride to us as a nation. The actions of this legislation will be to hand the protection and the preservation of our reef over to the state government and, even more frightening, to some of the local councils within that area.


The report indicated that climate change remains the most significant threat to the long-term health of the reef, and that was highlighted very effectively when the committee was undertaking its inquiry. It concluded that the loss of resilience is not attributed to any one single cause but to the effect of cumulative impacts and of management not keeping pace with these. The proposed dumping of dredged materials from the Abbot Point development is also noted with concern. This is of particular concern because it was approved despite an indication that less impacting disposal alternatives may exist.




Mr Hunt:
  That is false. 




Ms HALL:
  We are handing the approval of such projects over to the state government.




Mr Hunt:
  Your government gave 33 preliminary approvals on Abbot Point.




Ms HALL:
  The minister should hang his head in shame. He should be ashamed of the fact that he has no commitment to the environment, that he has no commitment to protect the valuable resources that are placed in his hands. We all know that he constantly gets rolled in cabinet, and we also know that he speaks out of school without getting the permission of his Prime Minister. So he really is just a puppet of the Prime Minister, a puppet of the minerals and development industry and he has absolutely no commitment to the environment. I am constantly being contacted by constituents who tell me how disappointed they are in the Minister for the Environment. They thought he had a bit of backbone. They thought he would get in there and fight to preserve the environment. But unfortunately he does not seem to have the commitment to the environment that we as Australians expect from our Minister for the Environment. Instead, he is happy to abrogate his responsibility, to hand the decision making over to the states and to local government. In many cases they are the very bodies, the very organisations, that are putting forward the proposal for development. It is not good enough. As an Australian government, as a federal government, we should be ensuring that we protect our assets. We should not be handing over World Heritage listings to governments like the Newman government in Queensland, and we should not be allowing World Heritage listing to be wound back in Tasmania.


This Minister for the Environment should be standing up for the environment. Instead, he is abrogating his responsibility. The bill goes beyond pro-development state governments; it provides the ability for the same governments to accredit local governments to undertake critical assessment and approval processes. I hang my head. I am ashamed to be part of a parliament that is prepared to allow this to happen to our environment by allowing the states to approve anything, anywhere, without limitations. That is worrying enough without diluting further accountability by putting local government in charge of Australia's major national resources.


I would be quite happy for Lake Macquarie council to make decisions about my local environment area—at the moment. But there have been times when that council has made decisions that were not in the best interests of the environment, and there is nothing to say that in the future that will not continue to happen. This legislation creates a definite degree of uncertainty. This legislation, far from streamlining the approvals process, actually dilutes it, fragments it, makes it very convoluted. Giving each state the right to approve projects means that throughout the nation we are going to have different approval processes in different states. This is very worrying indeed. I am concerned with the whole process and the lack of quality and consistency of processes between the states. And it will not get any better. This bill is going to make things worse than they already are.


Going back to the Great Barrier Reef, increased attention is needed to complete the required work on reviewing governance of the property and the transfer of decision-making powers from the federal to the state level. It appears premature, until the governance requirements to implement their LTPSD have been considered. It is crucial that the mission recommendations regarding institutional management arrangements in R11 are completed and the eventual governance of the property carries the confidence of the stakeholders. Given the range of significant threats affecting property and conflicting information about the effectiveness of recent decisions and draft policies, the inscription of the Great Barrier Reef onto the list of world heritage endangered sites at the 39th session in 2015 seems imminent.


This government and this Minister for the Environment will go down in history as environmental vandals. They are abrogating any responsibility they have to preserve threatened species and they are abrogating any responsibilities that they have to our environment. They stand condemned and future generations of Australians will judge them accordingly.

"Giles, Andrew, MP",ALP,2014-06-16,"



Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (18:23):  I also rise to speak in opposition to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014. As previous speakers have noted, this bill amends the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to facilitate the delegation of environmental approval powers to state and local governments. This delegation would include World Heritage sites, wetlands of international importance, migratory species, endangered species in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, nuclear activities and approvals under the water trigger amendment.


I think it is worth highlighting for the record the initial purpose of the substantive act, which is aimed at assisting a cooperative implementation of Australia's international environmental responsibilities—responsibilities that, I note, this government does not seek to walk away from, formally—to provide for ecologically sustainable development through the protection of the environment. Such a focus is, regrettably, absent in the legislation before the House. This is focused on the Commonwealth interest in the nine matters of national environmental significance that are set out in the act.


The act provides that projects which are likely to have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance—a controlled action—are subject to an assessment and an approval process by the Commonwealth environment minister. Project proponents must refer their proposals to the minister, who will then decide whether the proposal is a controlled action within the terms of the act. Where this is the case, the minister must choose how the impacts of the proposed action are to be assessed. This is how the Commonwealth performs its vital role in ensuring that Australia's obligations under international environmental treaties are met.


In respect of this bill, the minister baldly asserted:


State and territory governments … have processes in place for evaluating the environmental impacts of development proposals consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development, …


The minister offered no evidence then, and no evidence has been offered subsequently in this debate, to substantiate this assertion. I suspect this is so because there is none.




Mr Hunt:
  Queensland has legislated changes!




Mr GILES:
  Queensland has, yes. There has been some work done in exploring this issue lately and, of course, there is the current reference to the House environment committee. Proponents are yet to offer much in the way of persuasive evidence about the costs of so-called green tape.


There is a pattern here. The Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee's March 2013 report found:


While the committee heard claims that the Commonwealth approval process was causing inefficiency, that processes between the Commonwealth and the states and territories were duplicated, and that project proponents were labouring underneath the weight of uncertainty, there was no substantive evidence presented to support these claims.


Admittedly, the minister is part of a government that has a curious relationship with evidence. Where there is evidence of climate change, it ignores it. Where there is no evidence of state and territory, and now local governments, of having appropriate processes in place—I have to state for the minister's benefit—it pretends that these exist.


I suspect that this minister, in his heart of hearts, knows this but, like the Minister for Industry, it seems that he is held hostage by others in the government. One need only note the untimely execution of the coalition's much vaunted 'one million solar panels policy' the subject of so much sad commentary this week.


There is some precedent for the coalition not wanting to debate ideas that contrast with its own. I note that when this present act was originally debated in this place in 1999, it was done so on the same day as the GST tax package. Debate for both was gagged and rammed through the parliament. There was, as was pointed out then, a deal with the Australian Democrats. This was done with undue haste then, and we are seeing a similar devil-may-care attitude by those opposite now.


The premise of this bill is that the Commonwealth should take a back seat on matters pertaining to the environment. This is an outdated view. There is a well-established precedent for the Commonwealth to take a leadership role when it comes to the environment. You could say that it is part of our 'knitting', in the terms of our Prime Minister. Since the Tasmanian dams case in 1983, Australians have expected, and continue to expect, the Commonwealth government to stand up for the environment against the behaviour of state and territory governments when actions are detrimental to our natural heritage. There has been a settlement with the Australian people about this. It is a settlement system that does allow for development and protects the environment.


This is always a tricky equation, especially as it is so hard to quantify environmental impacts and so to strike appropriate balances in every case. Since successive High Court decisions in the evolution of our system over the years—our system of federation—the nature of state and local governments today is that they have vastly reduced options for raising revenue independently. No doubt this is a matter being discussed at the Australian Local Government Association conference down the road as we speak. This makes these governments more readily inclined to approve projects for easy access to cash without taking the longer term view of the impact on the environment.


As then Prime Minister Paul Keating said at a premiers conference in 1990, 'Never stand between a state premier and a bucket of money.' It seems that the current government does not have the courage or the convictions of Keating to look such premiers in the eye and tell them 'no' or, at least, not without putting in place proper protections.




Mr Hunt:
  But this was your policy! Julia Gillard brought it in!




Mr GILES:
  I think it was a very different policy, and we will go to the history in a minute, Minister! I look forward to hearing that, and I wish the minister was as assertive around the cabinet table as he has been today in this debate!


The environment should, of course, be seen as more than just a blockage to accessing buckets of money. State and local governments and the community in general have an important role to play in the decision-making process when it comes to projects affecting the environment. But final decisions for matters of national significance—matters going to our international obligations—should rest with the Commonwealth government. We only have one Great Barrier Reef, one Daintree rainforest and one Kakadu. The list of such places goes on for now, but once they are gone they are gone forever.


These landmarks should not be subject to the budgetary whims of state and local governments—or indeed any vested interest. It is worth noting that state and, particularly, local governments do not always have the resources or, in the case of various coalition state governments, the will to conduct thorough assessments of environmental impacts. There are obvious conflicts of interests in the many instances where a state government is also a project proponent. We have seen evidence of that sort of conflict of interest with the Western Australian government's shark cull and with the Victorian government's cattle grazing in the Alpine National Park.


Of course state governments have their own environmental departments, but, when these same governments are advancing a certain position, their department's advice is often under question. So an uncompromised Commonwealth government taking a dispassionate decision—away from the instant concerns—is no bad thing. Under this government's changes Premier Newman will be able to approve dredging and dumping on the Great Barrier Reef; Premier Barnett, of shark cull fame, will have the final say over the Ningaloo Reef; and Premier Hodgman will be in charge of Tasmania's iconic World Heritage listed forests. Talk about putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank!


I note recent comments from UNESCO, in relation to the Great Barrier Reef, about these proposed changes:


The GBRMPA draft SA—


'SA' stands for 'strategic assessment'—


underlines concerns expressed by the Committee regarding serious decline in the condition of the GBR, including in coral recruitment and reef building across extensive parts of the property, and that a business as usual approach to managing the property is not an option.


It further indicates that climate change remains the most significant threat to the long-term health of the reef. The SA concludes that the loss of resilience is not attributable to any single cause but to the effect of cumulative impacts and that management is not keeping pace with these.


In relation to the Abbot Point expansion, also in Queensland, UNESCO stated:


The proposed dumping of dredged material from the proposed Abbot Point development is also noted with concern. Indeed, this was approved, despite an indication that less impacting disposal alternatives may exist … 


Increased attention is needed to complete the required work on reviewing governance of the property and the transfer of decision-making powers from the Federal Level to the State Level appears premature until the governance requirements to implement the LTPSD—


that is, the long-term plan for sustainable development—


have been considered.


UNESCO's concerns should be heeded. They should be treated with the utmost seriousness.


In government, Labor sought to work with state and territory governments to streamline this process while maintaining our commitment to meeting environmental safeguards. Throughout these negotiations it became clear that some states could not be trusted with Australia's unique environment. Labor remains in favour of streamlining environmental approval processes for major projects—but only where final approvals on matters of national environmental significance remain with the Commonwealth government. The Australian government has a responsibility to protect Australia's precious environment. The EPBC Act, in particular, accounts for matters of national environmental significance and our international obligations. But the Abbott government has no interest in protecting Australia's environment for the future.


Since coming to government, the minister and our recently self-described 'conservationist' Prime Minister have made bad decision upon bad decision, hurting our environment. These bad decisions have generally been based on no evidence. This is a government that does not mean what is says. On the one hand, the act binds the Australian government to various world treaties to protect the environment. On the other hand, this amendment bill installs a mechanism to effectively undermine these commitments. This amendment bill puts our environment at risk of irreparable damage by proposing to leave decisions of national environmental significance to state premiers.


I agree with the Australian Network of Environmental Defenders Offices that a real priority for an environment minister in the Australian government should be a mature examination of how environmental laws can respond to the pressing concerns of this century—challenges such as biodiversity loss, land use change and climate change responses—and fulfil our national and international obligations while getting the balance right and ensuring that we maintain Australia's high quality of life. As an aside, I note that the environmental defenders offices around Australia have had massive funding cuts—$10 million—another symbol of this government's threadbare environmental credentials.


Going back to the challenge that we should be facing, our environmental management challenge of the 21st century: streamlining can and should be a part of this where we are certain we have the balance right between removing barriers to economic growth and protecting our natural environment. I emphasise the words 'where we are certain', because all too often there will not be a second chance to get things right. Now is the time to carefully consider the evidence, not to reflexively lower environmental standards and roll back protections.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2014-06-16,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders—Minister for the Environment) (18:34):  I am delighted to respond to the comments of the various members of this House in relation to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014. Let me begin by addressing, front and centre, the claims made by many members of the opposition with regard to the very notion of one-stop shops. This was a proposal which we discussed publicly throughout the early part of 2012. The then government, led by then Prime Minister Gillard, responded in the April 2012 Council of Australian Governments meeting by making the creation of one-stop shops the central platform of that COAG meeting. The fundamental reform, trumpeted across the nation by the Labor Party when they were in government—led by Prime Minister Gillard, supported by the now Leader of the Opposition—was a one-stop shop process. 


Lest there be any doubt whatsoever, I will read from the communique of the 13 April 2012 meeting of the Council of Australian Governments. The communique said:


First Ministers reaffirmed COAG's commitment to high environmental standards, while reducing duplication and double-handling of assessment and approval processes.  To achieve these commitments, our governments will work together to … fast-track the development of bilateral arrangements for accreditation of state assessment and approval processes, with the frameworks to be agreed by December 2012 and agreements finalised by March 2013. 


Let me explain to the House what this means. It means that in the Council of Australian Governments, with unanimous support from state and territory governments of both persuasions, under the leadership of the then Labor Prime Minister, the Labor Party, at both federal level and at state level, committed themselves to one-stop shops. They demanded that these reforms be approved, both the reforms relating to state assessments and those relating to state approvals. In other words, precisely the reforms we are undertaking now were outlined as being fundamental—were outlined as being able to be done with higher environmental standards and were outlined as being absolutely necessary—by the then ALP government.


We hear today that this is in some way a derogation from the long history of bipartisan support for federal environmental laws. That is not just false; it is a blind eye to what has clearly and absolutely been ALP policy for some considerable time. There is a degree of passing hypocrisy which might just perhaps cause some on the other side to reflect about the course of events over the last two years, when they championed the one-stop shop, when they called for the one-stop shop, when they demanded the one-stop shop and when they denounced anybody who would oppose the one-stop shop. And now they pretend that that history never occurred. They have airbrushed the last two years of Australian parliamentary history. That, in short, is simply unacceptable—and it is not exactly especially mature for a political party to imagine that a Council of Australian Governments communique does not exist and that the history of support for one-stop shops does not exist.


Let me also deal with some of the other arguments made by the ALP during the course of this debate. The ALP also claimed that in some way this derogates from federal standards—wrong, false, untrue and incorrect. There is no change to federal standards. Indeed, agreements have been negotiated with a series of states and territories which will lift standards. Queensland, for example, is actually legislating better standards in response to these agreements. In addition to that, we also hear that the bill in some way changes the position in relation to local councils. Let me be absolutely clear: the act which Labor itself has championed already allows for that accreditation under certain circumstances. What we are doing is ensuring that no process will be accredited unless the highest environmental standards are achieved and maintained. In other words, we are establishing a standards based process.


Then there is a claim that matters of national environmental significance must remain the province of the national government regardless of which government is in place at the state or territory level. It is very interesting: each and every state has signed a memorandum of understanding. Each and every state has already signed an assessment agreement or is progressing an assessment agreement. That means that the Labor state of South Australia, the former Labor government in Tasmania, and the territory government here in the ACT have all committed to the one-stop shop process and have all actually signed it. When in government, the federal ALP supported it. Around the country, state ALPs support it. They are standing in the way of their own state and territory governments.


From there what we see is that state processes can be enshrined in policies and guidelines rather than legislation. They make a complaint. But what we are doing here is making it absolutely clear that those approaches must meet the national standards required under the EPBC Act. These are powers and provisions which have existed since the day the EPBC Act came into force. The ability to allow for state assessments and for state approvals has always been contained within the legislation. Indeed—guess what?—the ALP helped develop some of those in relation to individual states and territories. They ignore their own history of supporting this one-stop shop. They ignore their own history of enacting one-stop shops.


I also want to make this point: there has been a question in relation to the timing of the long-term plan for sustainable development with regard to the Reef 2050 Plan. I have committed, and I will recommit, that the final agreement with Queensland will not be signed until after the draft long-term plan for sustainable development has been released for public comment. That clearly fulfils our international obligations. There has been much said during the course of this debate which is neither fair, nor accurate, nor reflective of the history which has been the ALP's history for the last two years.


Against that background let me make these general comments. We are maintaining the water trigger in federal legislation. It was not there previously. It is there now. We are committed to maintaining it. We are maintaining it. But what we are doing is ensuring that there is not duplication. The same standards that apply to all matters of national environmental significance will apply here. To pretend otherwise is false, untrue and incorrect. The purpose of these amendments is to allow for full and complete one-stop shops. The water trigger will remain. It will simply be subject to the ordinary considerations of all of the other matters of national environmental significance. In order to do that we have been consulting with the community.


I want to note that the member for Page will be moving an amendment later on today, something which he has discussed with me, which we have discussed with the community. That is, the water trigger amendments which he proposes come from community consultation. They have my full support. Most particularly, they mandate that states will have to seek the advice of the independent expert scientific committee and that the federal minister will be able to seek advice on any matter under consideration by states over the course of the period between now and the completion of all bioregional assessments. The member for Page has been exceptionally active in raising the concerns of his community. We have worked together on these amendments. These amendments, I think, should bring additional comfort to rural communities. I would hope that all members in the House can support the amendments, which he will produce with the full support of the government.


Having said that, this bill is about ensuring that there is one standard for all matters of national environmental significance, that the task proposed and started by the previous government is completed and that there should be no situation where anybody in this House on the government or the opposition side can do other than support a process which all of the state Labor governments support and which the previous federal Labor government supported. For those reasons, I thank the speakers to this legislation and I commend the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014 to the House.

That the amendments be agreed to.


Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to comment on the material that we have received back from the Senate. I want to acknowledge the support the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Increased Employment Participation) Bill 2014 received this morning in the other place. 


Members and senators have shown their support for action to help arrest this country's unemployment and youth unemployment rates. This bill gives effect to the job commitment bonus, which will provide an incentive for young long-term unemployed people to take a job and keep that job, and by doing so escape the spiral of long-term unemployment. The job commitment bonus provides a bonus of $2½ thousand to young people who have kept a job and stayed off welfare for 12 months. An additional $4,000 will be payable if they remain employed and off welfare for a further 12 months—that is, 24 months in total. 


The bill also enables the Relocation Assistance to Take Up a Job program, which enables long-term unemployed to gain assistance to move to take up a job. Assistance of up to $6,000 is available for job seekers to move to a regional area or up to $3,000 to move to a metropolitan area. Families with dependent children will be provided with up to an extra $3,000. The government notes the opposition's amendments to the bill, which will retain the status quo in relation to non-payment periods. The government will agree to these amendments. 


Once again, I would like to thank members and senators for recognising the value of employment and the social, economic and health benefits that employment can bring. This bill will provide incentives to assist long-term unemployed people, young and old alike, to take up employment and stay in employment. I certainly commend this bill to the House.

I just wanted to say that when things of this nature happen it is obviously a free country and people have a right to bring whatever matters they wish to before the courts. But I just want to send a very clear message to all the members of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and all of those personnel of our Navy who serve as part of Border Protection Command, that those who served on that terrible day back on 15 December in that terrible incident, have our absolute respect and our absolute confidence. They have been rightly praised for their heroism and their bravery in what they did on that terrible morning, to save the number of lives that they did in that terrible, terrible incident.


These matters will go through the courts as they will in a free country. But I just want to tell every one of those men and women who serve in our Border Protection Command, whether that is at sea or in other places, that they have the respect of the government and, I am quite sure, the respect of the opposition as well.

The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014 amends the Migration Act 1958 and the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 to ensure that sections 48, 48A and 501E of the Migration Act can be correctly applied according to policy intention; to ensure that a bridging visa application is not an impediment to the exercise of the removal of a person under subsection 198(5) of the Migration Act; to apply the debt penalty liability provisions of the act to all convicted people smugglers and illegal foreign fishers; to clarify the obligation of the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal to give documents to an authorised recipient; to clarify the role of the authorised recipient and the extent of the obligation to notify an authorised recipient of direct communications made with the person who appointed them; to provide access to and use of material and information obtained under a search warrant issued under the Crimes Act 1914 for certain purposes of the Migration Act and the Australian Citizenship Act; to ensure that the procedural fairness requirements prescribed in the Migration Act will apply universally to all visa applications and to provide for greater consistency and decision making; and to repeal redundant provisions in the act—that is, the Migration Act—which contain references to section 14 of the Electronic Transactions Act 1999.


This bill deals with administrative matters, but as other speakers have ranged widely in this debate, touching on so many other matters, I think it is important to note that at least on these questions there is an agreement between the major parties represented in this House to these amendments, which will improve the efficiency of the administration of the matters that are regularly within my portfolio under both of these acts. I thank those of the House who have indicated their support for these measures. The other measures and the other matters that have been the subject of this debate will remain contentious. The comments on the government's position on border protection that have been injected into this debate by some clearly indicate that there is still great difference between the major parties on the issue of border protection. Those opposite continue not to support the government in its measures, which have so far proven so successful. That is a matter for those opposite to explain to the Australian people at the appropriate time. On the matters in this bill at least, however, there is agreement. I commend the bill to the House.

"Giles, Andrew, MP",ALP,2014-06-16,"



Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (20:59):  It is not often I find myself agreeing with Senator Cory Bernardi, but his recent comments attracted my attention. Senator Bernardi was reported as saying:


I see Australian politics at a crossroads.


The perception of politicians has never been lower and it is clear to me that people are looking for more from their political representatives.


I should probably say that, while we agree on this point, the agreement does not go much further.


Of course, it is not just Senator Bernardi who has observed the changing political tides here and abroad. In recent weeks there has been a renewed interest in the politics of protest. This is an important debate. I rise tonight because I am deeply concerned about the movement towards what I call anti-politics. This is not a concern about protest per se—far from it. I was proud to join tens of thousands in Melbourne in marching last week to protest and demonstrate concern about this budget's inequitable impacts. But I am concerned about the growing sense of alienation from formal politics and the increasing recourse to a populism that denies the possibility of meaningful democratic change. I take this opportunity to make a small contribution to making the case for politics of hope with purpose.


Elections in the world's second largest democracy, the European parliament, recently returned many representatives of populist, nationalist parties. The United Kingdom Independence Party topped the polls in the UK, as did the far-right Front National in France, while neo-Nazis have also been returned in Greece. The Golden Dawn party polled at almost 10 per cent of the vote. It was a good election for anti-politics. People are demonstrating their willingness to break with past allegiances, often in quite radical ways. I think of the industrial towns in northern France that have switched from Communist to Front National. It seems to me that many Europeans have not so much lost faith in the European ideal—I note that UKIP's electoral success sits rather uncomfortably with support for Europe in the UK never having been higher—as they have formed the view that the political system is broken and bereft of hope such that all options seem to be equally valid choices.


What does this mean for Australia and Australian Labor? My view is that a significant driver of the trend to anti-politics is a sense among ordinary working people that they lack power over their own lives and, more importantly, they do not see politics as it is as a means to changing that. In Europe, that lack of empowerment is most stark amongst those who have been punished by the economics of austerity. In Australia, while we may not face yet the horrible levels of unemployment that are destroying European communities, we are no stranger to a sense that economic power has drifted upwards at the expense of working people.


We must recognise now that a major challenge is to rebuild belief in formal politics and to instil a sense of hope that political choices, and political action, change lives for the better. I think it is hopelessness and alienation that push citizens far left or hard right or keep them from the ballot box altogether. It is a profound sense that things cannot change. The insider culture of politics is partly to blame. This we must acknowledge. But parties of protest simply exacerbate this. The point is that to turn it around we must re-imagine the role governments can play in people's lives.


Recently, the senator-elect for the Motoring Enthusiast Party, Ricky Muir, gave an interview that has been sneered at by some in the political class. The knowing insider commentary has been about how Mr Muir should not have been allowed to front the media without proper training. I suspect that I do not have much in common with Mr Muir, but I hope to have the opportunity, while we are both here, to seek to bridge our world views and experiences and to work together in this environment. The bullying, sneering political discourse confirms and reinforces the sense of alienation many people feel.


We see another parallel with the budget. The coalition have been patting themselves on the back for their extreme, neoliberal budget. Their self-congratulatory and self-satisfied reaction could not be more at odds with the response of the general public. When the Treasurer sighs his world-weary sigh before giving another contemptuous and dismissive lecture by way of response to budget criticism, he is not simply being dismissive of Labor concerns; it is directed at all of us. It is easy to understand, then, why people have lost faith with government and politics more generally when this government have so enthusiastically broken faith with them. 


Whatever else the budget does, it has done a good job of reminding us all of the powerful and enduring consequences of political decisions. Australians—protesting students, fearful pensioners and vulnerable young people—understand through this budget that, as Paul Keating said, when you change the government, you change the country.


The coalition has perversely made the case that government matters by demanding that those least able do the lifting. I am angry about this budget and the way it touches lives. I think especially of a young woman in my electorate from a refugee background. She kept connected to education and employment through a government program that has now been now cut. She is the embodiment of why government matters. What will happen to the next woman in her circumstances?


For young people who find themselves locked out of opportunities to build a good life by the coalition's cuts, the impact on their self-respect and dignity is an individual tragedy. But for government and those who believe there is a role for hope in politics and public life it is a calamity and a ticking time bomb that undermines the faith in democracy which we rely on. The Treasurer claims that equality does not matter and that the role of government is to bring people to the 'starting line', but this budget prevents people from even being in the running.

Mr CONROY
 (Charlton) (10:30):  I have received a petition from 155 residents of the suburbs of Mirrabooka, Brightwaters, Bonnells Bay, Windemere Park, Yarrawonga Park, Sunshine and Brighton. This petition has been found in order by the Standing Committee on Petitions and I hereby present the petition to the House.




The petition read as follows—





To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives





This petition of certain citizens of South Lake Macquarie draws to the attention of the House to the serious interference with television reception on the Morisset peninsular, namely but not restricted to, the suburbs of Mirrabooka, Brightwaters and Sunshine.





We therefore ask the House to review this situation and urgently undertake any necessary changes which are required for uninterrupted television reception.



from 155 citizens


Petition received.




Mr CONROY:
  The petition relates to the digital television reception issues affecting residents of the Morisset peninsula. These residents tell me they experience simultaneous interference to the digital signals of the ABC, SBS, NBN and Ten during some weather conditions. The signal from Prime is unaffected. I am told this happens frequently, sometimes daily. Understandably, these people are frustrated by the interruption to their television signal, so, in an effort to find a solution, I have already made contact with the Minister for Communications on this matter. The minister advises that the problem is caused by atmospheric ducting in the area, described as interference from signals travelling further than expected which cannot be differentiated from local signals. This affects those viewers who depend on the Mount Sugarloaf signal because they are co-channelled from the high-power transmission site that serves the Illawarra. Prime services are from Mount Sugarloaf and are not affected because they are not co-channelled in this way.


This certainly matches the experience of Mr Kevin Kirk of Mirrabooka, who described to me his frustration at investing time and money in several reception assessments and upgrades to his antenna system, all to no avail. To quote Mr Kirk:


This is the 21st Century and this is Australia, we feel we are entitled to the same uninterrupted television as any other family.


These residents are right to expect decent television reception. Television provides us access to news, current affairs and entertainment. For people who are elderly or isolated, it is particularly important, as free-to-air television remains the most accessible form of telecommunication. And, of course, in regions like the Hunter, we are well served by our regional media broadcasters and have affection for the local content they provide. I do not believe it is reasonable or fair that these residents are forced to invest in a satellite service simply to replace what has been delivered—for free—for nearly half a century.


I call on the minister to assist me in finding an adequate solution to this reception issue and restore the quality of television reception that residents of the Morisset peninsula enjoyed before the analog signal was switched off last year. I ask the minister to direct the Australian Communications and Media Authority to investigate the matter fully and make recommendations to remedy the situation. I congratulate everyone who signed the petition, in particular Mr Kirk, who was the principal petitioner. I note that the minister has worked closely with my colleague in the Hunter, the member for Paterson, on similar reception issues and I hope his enthusiasm to fix the problem in Morisset will be equally forthcoming.

Ms COLLINS
 (Franklin) (11:00):  I move:


That this House:


(1) recognises that the Government has turned its back on regional Australia in the budget;


(2) acknowledges that the Government's broken promises and wrong priorities in the budget will hurt those living in regional Australia and further increase the divide between the city and the bush;


(3) notes that this budget will hurt regional Australia by:


(a) slashing $1 billion in funding to local government by cutting into the Financial Assistance Grants;


(b) introducing co-payments to Medicare that will discourage doctors from bulk billing, meaning there will be less choice for people to access general practitioner services in regional areas;


(c) cutting health which will mean fewer services in regional Australia;


(d) cutting education which will impact on regional schools and students with less funding available;


(e) increasing the fuel excise which will hurt regional Australians the most who rely on being mobile and being able to travel to work;


(f) cutting the ABC that regional Australians rely on for information; and


(g) increasing university fees that will hurt regional students and regional universities; and


(4) calls on the Government to reconsider its broken promises and wrong priorities for regional Australia in the Budget.


This government has really turned its back on regional Australia with this latest federal budget. The budget devised by those opposite is full of broken promises and of twisted priorities that will hurt people living in regional Australia more. The things in this budget that particularly impact on people in regional Australia include the freezing of indexation for financial assistance grants. That is more than $925 million across four years that will no longer be going to local government. Introducing a $7 GP tax will discourage bulk-billing and there is less choice for people in regional and rural Australia to visit a GP, so it will impact on them. There are cuts to health. An $80 billion cut to health and education will mean less services in regional Australia. Cutting education will impact on those smaller regional schools and students, with less funding available.


The increase in the fuel excise will hurt regional Australians more because they are more mobile and they rely more on transport, particularly their own vehicle, to get to and from work and to pick the kids up from school. Cutting the ABC will affect regional Australia as well because of the services that they rely on the ABC for. Particularly concerning is the change in the deregulation of university fees and the HECS debt, which will hurt regional students and regional Australia. There is so much in this budget that will hurt and impact on regional Australia. There is so much to talk about. Where to start?


Interestingly, we have seen the National Party, the coalition partner, stay pretty silent on the impact of this budget on regional Australia. Indeed, the minister, in this chamber in consideration in detail on the budget, would not answer when I asked many questions about whether any government agency, anywhere in the whole of government, had done an assessment of the impact of these changes in this budget on regional Australia. Of course, he did not answer because the answer is no. Nobody anywhere in government—in the education department, in the health department, in the Treasury, in the Regional Development Australia portfolio—has assessed the impact of these changes in this budget on regional Australia. One of the reasons they have not done that is that the findings will come out and show that regional Australia would indeed be hardest hit by this budget should these measures get through.


The cuts are astounding. We have the Australian Local Government Association coming to Canberra this week for the local government assembly. The financial assistance grants cuts are expected to dominate debate. Indeed, local governments across the country are pretty angry that they received no consultation and no notice of this cut, to take effect from 1 July, when the budget was introduced. This is a $925 million cut over four years across the country. This will impact more on those smaller regional and rural councils that can least afford it. 


The President of Australian Local Government Association says councils are coming to Canberra 'somewhat shell-shocked'. Of course they are shell-shocked. They had prepared their budgets for the next few financial years. They had locked all that in, and suddenly they are getting a cut. As the Mayor of Geraldton said, there are 15 small councils outside of Geraldton and some of these councils depend on the grants to fund half of their budgets. This is a very substantial impact on smaller and regional councils.


What do people opposite actually think is going to happen? Councils are cutting services and staff because of this government's changes and/or increasing rates in regional and rural Australia, because of this budget and this financial assistance grant cut. It is very significant indeed and the impact on councils is very significant. We have 900 delegates coming to Canberra this week who are very, very concerned about these cuts to local government right across Australia. It will be interesting to see what those opposite are going to say to these councils en masse—900 of them—here, this week, lobbying for their councils, their regions and their cities, for funds from Canberra. They will be lobbying for the funds that they are actually entitled to under the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act—funds that they were relying on, that were cut in the budget with no notice and no consultation.


How on earth can those opposite sit there and say they care about regional Australia when they have allowed this to happen? And where are the Nationals? They are silent. Warren Truss, Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, has not been out there defending regional and rural councils; he has not been out there standing up to the government and Joe Hockey, the Treasurer, to say, 'These grants should not be cut.' This is almost a billion dollars that these councils will never get back. Services will be cut in regional Australia, and it comes on top of all of the other measures in the budget that will impact on regional Australia, as well as all of the public sector cuts that will impact on regional Australia.

"Sudmalis, Ann, MP",LP,2014-06-16,"



Ms SUDMALIS
 (Gilmore) (11:05): I simply cannot believe that the Labor Party has had the hide to bring forward a motion that attempts to shame the coalition over its record on regional Australia, when it is their debt in the first place. And if there is one record that regional and rural Australians are disgusted with, it is record of the past six years of Labor debt and Labor waste—the one we voted down at the last election.


The government, on the other hand, has already begun to breathe new life into regional Australia, with record investment in infrastructure and services—already more than $20 million has been committed in grants and infrastructure for Gilmore alone. More than $3 million has been made available to improve six local black spots, with the bulk of that funding put towards the Princes Highway and Turpentine Road. Programs like the $565 million Black Spot program, crucial to fixing dangerous and accident-prone sections of local roads and streets, or the $248 million Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity program, go directly to our commitment for rural and regional Australia. We have committed $100 million in this budget to fix up mobile phone black spots across the country, mainly for the benefit of rural and regional Australia. There is also $100 million extra for rural research, and more than $50 million to entice more doctors to work and train in rural and regional practices.


Gilmore is an electorate Labor abandoned, because they never understood our issues or how to address them, or even knew how to talk to us. Why is this? It is because they are fundamentally out of touch with regional Australia—predominantly small business people, families and farmers. The Labor Party has no link to these people, and does not understand the challenges that we in regional Australia face every day. Labor will never understand what it is like to be a single mother raising two kids in a regional or rural town, or how hard it really is to find employment when the only public transport into your town centre runs just once a day in each direction. This government cares about single parents, and that is why we are introducing a $750 payment to single mothers who receive the full rate of family tax benefit part A. 


When they introduced the carbon tax, the Labor Party simply had no idea of the impact they had on the 39 dairy farms in Gilmore. At a time when milk was retailing for $1.00 a litre, the increases to electricity and refrigerant gases were crippling. The electricity bill for one dairy farmer in my electorate, Tracey Russell from Brundee, has increased from $1,400 a month to more than $2,400 since the introduction of the carbon tax. Tracey estimates that at least half of that—more than $500 a month—is solely due to the carbon tax. Another example is the cost of refrigerating milk on farms. Prices for refrigerant gases have increased between 200 and 400 per cent for farmers in my electorate. This translates into an increase in costs of over $15,000 for some farmers in my electorate to re-gas their refrigeration systems.


Gilmore has a complexity of issues. Despite this, we work hard, always trying new solutions to give our community a hand-up, not just a handout. Programs like the revamped work for the dole, a program which is being piloted in the Shoalhaven from 1 July, help give regional communities like mine a sense of self-worth and opportunity, where before there was none. Labor does not understand work for the dole. Australians do not want to rely on welfare; they want to stand proud. Australians, especially rural and regional Australians in Gilmore, are a very proud people. That is why work for the dole is so important in Gilmore. Fundamentally, I believe that most people want to work for what they have—to get ahead in life—and will always value the skills that community work can bring. It is time to help our youths regain their sense of self, their can-do attitude and their desire to make their lives better. 


This motion before the House talks about the government's budget priorities. I cannot help but think that budget criticisms are a bit rich, coming from Labor, especially as they have left all Australians a legacy of $667 billion of debt and $1 billion of monthly interest—for years to come—and more than 200,000 extra people unemployed. That is an enormous debt, and there is not a lot to show for it. What an amazing testimony to financial mismanagement. There is not a single Australian who could not make a suggestion of where this money could have been better spent—unless they be from the opposition.


Those on the other side indicate cuts to education—but if there is a net increase each year, that is not a cut. With an extra 80,000 places at university, that is not a cut. With a chance to study for an associate diploma or diploma—not just a degree—that is enhancing our tertiary opportunities for regional students, not cutting them. Labor does not get it. Our youths, our regional people, do not want their grandchildren to be burdened with debt. This budget provides a vision for a debt-free future. I have yet to hear a whisper of a plan from those on the other side.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2014-06-16,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (11:10):  I start by congratulating the member for Franklin and the shadow minister for regional development and local government for bringing this motion before the House today. Its timing could not be better, because there are hundreds of delegates from local government organisations in Canberra today talking about the devastating impact of Commonwealth government cuts to the services they are delivering throughout regional Australia.


The member for Gilmore, who has just spoken, seems disappointed that I have not had some time to speak in reference to her contribution. I will do that. I would have thought a member representing regional Australia with one of the highest unemployment levels in the country would have had a bit more to say about their program for dealing with unemployment. It seems to me that the only thing they have to say to the poor unemployed people, in areas like the member for Gilmore's, is: 'For God's sake, don't lose your job, because if you do you're off benefits for six months!' That is the message they are sending to unemployed people. If you want to improve your skills do not look to TAFE, because they are cutting the hell out of funding for TAFE as well. 


She talks about areas where funding could be better spent. I will give you one example that puts a spotlight on the priorities of those opposite, particularly the Liberal members of those opposite. There is over $5 billion on a Paid Parental Leave scheme which is going to disadvantage those who live in regional Australia. Whether they are people on low incomes or no incomes, they will receive nothing out of it. 


We know that not all of those on the other side have got their priorities wrong. Some of them actually get it. I see the member for Dawson is going to speak in this debate and I hope that he has something to say about the misspent priorities of the government when it comes to regional Australia, paid parental leave and where they could be spending their money.


Having had a high-profile National Party candidate standing against me in the last election, I took particular interest in National Party policies. I was particularly keen on this document I have here:  Our plan for regional Australia. This is the National Party platform, the promises they took to their constituents in the last election. It is actually not a bad document, if you read it closely. They promised to ensure that regional Australia was represented when the big decisions in health were going to be made. The policy says:


Only The Nationals' Regional Health Rescue Plan can ensure that the one third of Australians living in the regions get a fair go from the health system and a fair share of health funding.


And I love this bit:



When health policy decisions are being made, regional concerns must be championed by a dedicated Minister with regional experience and a primary focus on the welfare of regional Australians.



Sounds pretty good. Unfortunately, we learnt that only two weeks ago that minister was not even in the room when the biggest decisions were going to be made in relation to regional and rural health. I know the member for Dawson would not have let that happen. He is a man who is not afraid to stand out—stand up, stand out and talk out—when the interests of his constituents are at risk. I am sure the member for Dawson would have ensured that he had been in the room when this horrible GP tax was being debated and when the cuts to health and hospital funding were being considered.


We know that the cuts to hospital funds are going to have a devastating impact on regional Australia. The Nationals had a bit to say about that in their plan for regional Australia. They said that the Nationals will not support policies that lead to the closure of regional hospitals. I can point to one policy that is going to lead to the closure of regional hospital beds and regional hospitals around this country and that is the decision to rip $55 billion out of hospital funding over the forward estimates. The National Party shadow minister was not even in the room when this decision was being made. It is a damn shame because maybe she could have done something to prevent the $1 billion worth of cuts to regional and other hospitals in New South Wales. It is said that this will lead to the loss of over 300 beds in New South Wales.


If the Nationals are going to stand up for regional Australia, they could start by speaking out on the devastating impact that the GP tax, the hospital cuts, the TAFE cuts and the cuts to local governments—the myriad devastating cuts—are going to have on people in regional Australia.

Mr PASIN
 (Barker) (11:16):  You learn a lot of things in this place and you are surprised by some of them. The thing that has surprised me most in this place is the level of misinformation that is deliberately promulgated. I was sitting here thinking that there is one solution to the debt crisis. If we levied the Labor Party $1 every time they used the word 'cut', we would manage our debt quite comfortably. And we could charge them $2 every time it was an act of misrepresentation because when you pay more into a fund, invest more, it is disingenuous to call them cuts.


In any event, I thought I would talk about something I am passionate about—regional South Australia. I am passionate about it because I have lived my whole life there. If I could have got my university degree in Mt Gambier—and I could now, by the way—then I would have lived my whole life there. Do you know what is hurting regional Australia and South Australia the most?



An opposition member:  The Abbott government.




Mr PASIN:
  No, it is $667 billion of your debt and it is $1 billion a month. I reflected on this and wondered what I could do in the electorate of Barker for $1 billion. I would be a hero, to start with. There has been a lot of discussion in South Australia—and my good friend the member for Hindmarsh would agree with me—about the Royal Adelaide Hospital. The Royal Adelaide Hospital is being built for $2 billion. I could build a Royal Adelaide Hospital in Mt Gambier after two months. I could build one in Renmark after two months. I could build one at Karoonda after two months. Those on the other side create the problem and then they whinge about us fixing the problem. The reality is that this problem is your problem and we are addressing it. Do you know what regional Australians and South Australians hate the most about this? It is not only that we are paying $1 billion a month but that we are sending $700 million of it offshore. It is time to wake up and smell the coffee, quite frankly. 


The member for Bendigo would like to see more union influence when it comes to decisions. I think the people in regional South Australia would like to see less union influence. Quite frankly, the member for Franklin can laugh all she likes, but the reality is this is serious. They laugh about this motion on the budget. When I go back to my community we cry because $1 billion a month is not able to be spent in regional Australia. I have just met with the CEO of the South Australian Local Government Association—and I will be meeting with mayors from my electorate tonight over dinner—and she told me, and this has been confirmed in meetings I have had throughout the electorate over the last week—



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr PASIN:
  on this topic. If you waited a minute and listened, you would get the answer. She came to me and said, 'We in local government in South Australia understand that we need to do our bit.' I asked her why she had that view and her answer was—wait for it—



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr PASIN:
  If you listen, her answer was, 'Because Labor got us in this mess.' That was her view in the discussion. I should have taped it and played it to you. I have served in local government for eight years and the one thing I learnt in local government that I have brought to this place is that you cannot spend more money than your raise. You can do it for a year or for two years, but we had six years of it and we spent and spent. The debt was $96 billion when John Howard and Peter Costello took the treasury bench. Our task—$667 billion—is close to seven times that task. Who put us in this position? The ALP did and they come into this place and say, 'We are worried about the effects this budget will have on regional Australia and South Australia in particular.' 


The reality is that we were forced to make these tough but fair calls because the Labor Party forced us to do it. Imagine if we had not wasted money on pink batts and overpriced school halls. We could have actually delivered the kind of infrastructure regional Australia needs to deliver its product to the market. In this Asian century it will be agriculture and regional Australia that drive us out of it. Quite thankfully, I am glad that it will not be the Labor Party leading this country over the next three years.

Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (11:21):  This budget smashes regional Australia. This budget is an absolute shocker when it comes to the families, the towns and the communities of regional Australia. There are so many examples of how this budget smashes regional Australia that it is hard to work out what to focus on in this short speech. Let us start with the $80 billion worth of education and health cuts. Everybody can see in the budget papers that these cuts will hit regional Australia hard. Because the government has walked away from the national health reform agreement, my own electorate of Bendigo will be $29 million worse off over the next five years. Bendigo Health will feel the brunt of it and have $25 million stripped away.


The former state Labor government put money aside to build a brand-new hospital. The doctors, nurses and hospital are now asking themselves whether they will have enough money to open their doors. That is now under question because this government ripped apart the agreement and has taken money out of the Bendigo hospital. The other four small hospitals in the area are now talking about mergers. They are not sure whether they will be able to keep their doors open because this funding agreement kept them open. This government is putting the health of regional Victorians at risk. 


It is not just the hospital cuts but the GP tax. Local rural GPs are speaking out. Unlike in the metro areas, a lot of doctors in the regions do not operate from nine to five. Those doctors are on-call for emergency care and aged care. They want to know whether they will need a cash register when they turn up at an aged-care facility. One aged-care facility is talking about having a 10-visit card that you pay in advance. It would be just like a coffee card, and every time you see the GP, when they pop in, you cross one off. That is what they are talking about. This is what this government is now creating through the GP tax. Talk about creating red tape. The $7 GP co-payment, the tax, is creating more red tape.


It is not just health that is being hit hard; universities and regional campuses will also be hit hard. The students in central Victoria—for example, Bendigo senior secondary students—who are thinking about going to university talk about not where they will go to university but if they will go to university. Over 25 per cent of the students at the Bendigo campus of the La Trobe University are the first in their family to go to university. Those from low-socioeconomic backgrounds are now questioning whether they will go to university. If they do not go to university, what are their options? There are a lack of jobs in the regions. The jobs crisis is deepening because this government has no plan for jobs in the region. This budget does little to address the growing jobs crisis in regional Australia.


As we have heard, the regional councils are here this week in Canberra and they are demanding answers from this government. Why is it that they have to suffer the cuts when it comes to the financial assistance grants?


I met with the Greater Bendigo City Council last week, and they do not know where they are going to find the $1.8 million that this government has cut from their budget. They have already increased rates by six per cent this year and six per cent last year. Some of the council areas in regional Victoria over the last three years have already increased their rates by 20 per cent. They cannot keep hitting ratepayers, yet they might have to because this government has taken the cruel decision to freeze their financial assistance grants.


Federal government should do its bit to support regional councils and they have failed. This government in their first budget have failed—failed to support local governments that work really hard. The ratepayers in my part of the world are saying, 'We cannot afford an extra per cent. If only our wages went up by 18 per cent over three years.' They do not; yet, their rates are.



Fuel excise: nobody on the other side has even touched the fuel excise issue. Forty cents in every litre is to go to the government. If only 40 per cent in every litre in Bendigo went into Bendigo roads, maybe then we would not be so upset about the fuel excise increasing. They say that this is important because this is what is needed to fix our roads, but if only every cent went into regional roads. Where are the Nats when it comes to regional Australia? Where is the impact statement? Why did they tear it up and why are they hiding it? Why are they so afraid to tell regional Australia how bad this budget is for regional Victoria? (Time expired)

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2014-06-16,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson—The Nationals Deputy Whip) (11:26):  Hearing the statements of those opposite, I am reminded of the time that they were in government. It reminds me of an old story about the farmer speaking to his city cousin. They had a conversation about politics. The farmer referred to the former Labor government as fence post turtles. When the city cousin said, 'What is a fence post turtle?', the farmer said, 'Well, he didn't get there by himself, he doesn't belong there, he doesn't know what to do up there and you just want to get the poor dumb creature down to where he belongs.' And that is exactly what the last Labor government was when it came to regional Australia.


They were put in there by these supposedly country independents—they did not get there by themselves—and when they were there they did not know what to do. There was so much mismanagement that went on and so much debt that went out of control. In fact, it was a little bit worse than that because the joke goes that they do not know what to do while they are up there. Perhaps they did not exactly know what they were doing but I suspect that some of them did when they put in a carbon tax, because there were alarm bells ringing left, right and centre about the impact that would have on regional Australia.


It has hit places like the Mackay region, which I represent—a regional town—perhaps the worst. In the Deloitte Access Economics report that was done into carbon pricing, they clearly flagged with the previous government that Queensland would be worse off and that regions in Queensland would be worse off. They were intent—these guys who are talking now about how concerned they are about regional Australia—on bringing in a carbon tax on diesel fuel, putting diesel fuel costs up through the roof. And who would be paying? Regional Australia, where freight is so important.


This is something that we have had from the Labor Party, who now come in here with this hypocritical stance that they are somehow concerned about regional Australia. There was no sign of that when they were in government. In fact, the regional ministers were all city based. Why did they not give it to a country based MP? Why was it Sydney members who had it? Why was the member for Grayndler the minister for the regions? He probably would not know a cow from a horse if you took him out west. This is the ridiculous situation that the Labor Party had us in. In fact, a while ago, he was in the other chamber denying that he was the regional minister, so I wonder what he was doing for three or four months while he was there?


But if we want to talk about what the government is doing for regional Australia, it is actually quite positive. We have a number of programs that we are rolling out which were announced in this budget and that are going to pay huge dividends for regional Australia. The building stronger regional communications fund is something that is extremely important: mobile phone funding, for the first time in a long time, helping communities get that communication that they vitally need. The National Stronger Regions Fund: $1 billion. This fund will be up and running by next year, targeting infrastructure projects supporting local and regional development. Organisations, including councils, can apply for grants from $20,000 through to $10 million for key community infrastructure—infrastructure that was neglected under Labor. Right now we are spending $314 million on the Community Development Grants program, delivering things such as an upgrade to the gymnastics centre in Mackay. We have $2½ billion that we have put forward for something that country people realise is vitally important—local roads—through a boost to the Roads to Recovery program. This includes $350 million extra, doubling funding in 2015-16 for local councils. I have to say I know the Deputy Prime Minister addressed local councils this morning. There was applause and much nodding of the heads when he told them about that $350 million extra that is going in for 2015-16. If the members opposite wanted to support something, they would get behind that because that is going to be a big win for all of their councils, not just city based ones.

Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (12:52):  I move:


This House:


(1) recognises the tragedy of the floods in May that afflicted Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia and Croatia, which killed more than 40 people;


(2) notes the:


(a) need for evacuation of large populations from both countries; and


(b) risk of undiscovered land mines from the war in the 1990s, being moved by flood waters and mudslides, increasing the risk to civilian populations; and


(3) commends the Australian Government for pre-positioning funds with the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies through the Disaster Relief Emergency Funds to assist national Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to respond quickly to situations such as this.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs Griggs
):  Is the motion seconded?




Mr HAYES:
  I second the motion.




Mr SIMPKINS:
  I rise to speak on the tragedy of the May floods in Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia. I know that in Cowan there are many of Serbian and Bosnian descent. While in fairly recent history they have been plagued by war, Serbia and Bosnia are now both victims of the natural disaster of floods. These floods have been the worst in centuries. Although the waters have now receded, more than 60 people lost their lives. In Bosnia, it was stated that one million had been impacted by the floods. In Serbia, hundreds of thousands were also affected because of the large rises in the Sava River, which runs through Belgrade.


I understand that the floods have caused more than 2,000 landslides. Villages have been wiped out and it is also known that landmines left over from the war have been found, and pose yet another risk. These events have happened far from Australia but the impact is also felt here. There are many Australians of Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian heritage. I know of their great sorrow over this calamity.


Yet from such heartache there comes great resolve, and I know that hundreds of thousands of dollars have been raised by the communities in Australia to support those in need. In Perth, this is the case. On Saturday, 7 June, in one night the Serbian community collected $60,000. As of 9 June just the Perth Serbian community collected $145,000 for Serbian flood relief. I congratulate the community president Father Sasa Stojanovic and the acting President, Mr Milan Jelesic, and their community for their great work.


I would also like to acknowledge and thank the Bosnian community in Perth. They, too, have been hard at work raising money for flood victims. The community president is Mr Muhamed Merdjanic. Together with his committee and the community as a whole, he has raised $13,405.


On the government side, I know I got a very quick response from the Minister for Foreign Affairs when I contacted her about the situation. I am grateful that, later, on 26 May, Minister Bishop issued a press release expressing the condolences of the Australian government to those impacted, especially to the families who had suffered a loss of family members. The minister contacted the Serbian and Bosnian governments as well.


Although we are on the other side of the world, Australia provides core funding to key international organisations involved in the flood response. Australia helps to finance the Red Cross and Red Crescent societies, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the World Food Program. Our core support enables these agencies to deploy experts and resources quickly to assist with responses such as these. That includes core funding for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which is $9 million in 2013-14. That has helped to allow the deployment to Serbia of the UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination team. Also, Australia is a top 10 donor to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, which releases humanitarian assistance quickly in disasters such as these.


Australia is providing the World Food Program with $46 million in core funding in 2013-14 to assist their operations of deploying boats and generators to the floods. This government is increasing humanitarian funding from $264 million this year to more than $338 million in 2014-15. I understand the Australian embassy is donating thousands of dollars worth of medical supplies locally.


I know that the EU is providing coordinated assistance through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, which has been activated upon the request of Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina due to the severe flooding in the two countries. Over 20 EU member states offered assistance, such as motorboats, helicopters, pumps and humanitarian kits, and they deployed over 400 relief workers to the two countries. In addition, Australia's representatives to Bosnia have visited the site and will identify if there are further local needs that could be addressed by the Australian Direct Aid Program.


To conclude, I express my condolences to the families and friends of those who have suffered greatly in these floods. I also express my gratitude for the great efforts of the diasporas in Australia and the ongoing support of the Australian government. Just to conclude, I have had the good fortune to have visited Serbia twice, in 1985 and also last year. Also, I visited Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia, last year. These countries have suffered greatly through the wars that have afflicted them in recent decades. It is such a tragedy to see the heartache that the natural disaster, on this occasion, revisited on those countries. It is good that they are well supported by their diasporas in Australia. I congratulate them on those efforts.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2014-06-16,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (12:57):  I thank the member for Cowan for bringing this motion forward today. I also welcome in the gallery Mr Dinko Tomac, from the Embassy of Bosnia and Herzegovina.


The floods that struck the Balkans last month were truly devastating. At least 49 people lost their lives, while thousands were evacuated from their homes. Some were temporarily evacuated, while others are yet to return even to this day. The economic cost of recovery is estimated to be well into the billions of dollars. After talking to Mr Tomac a little earlier about Bosnia-Herzegovina, the price tag is about $1.5 billion. I know from the Serbian ambassador that the estimation is that $2.5 billion of reconstruction is necessary there. They have seen much of their infrastructure—their  roads, rail, electricity, water supply and sewerage reticulation—damaged, some beyond repair, as well as the devastation to the vital agricultural lands of those countries in the Balkans.


Large parts of Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia are facing a very long road to recovery. During my visit last year to Serbia, it was clear to me that the country and, as a matter of fact, the region were very much in the process of rebuilding after years of civil conflict and economic uncertainty. The floods have now made this road a very long and arduous one.


As a First World nation, we know the difficulty of rebuilding following extensive national disasters—for instance, the Queensland floods. We know the pain that is borne by the people and the economic cost that is borne by a nation. Therefore, we know that recovery tasks, in relation to the Balkans, are almost impossible for a small nation to bear by themselves.


Much of the world has lent support during and following the Balkans disaster. Many people with heritage from the region live in my electorate. Fowler has a very large enclave of people from Bosnia, from Serbia and also from Croatia. I have attended a number of fundraising functions recently. The Serbian community in Australia has now raised about $1.5 million over the last month. I attended the Serbian flood appeal at Bonnyrigg Sports Club last Monday. The rain did not deter the hundreds of people who turned up and they raised over $200,000 on that day. Bonnyrigg Sports Club has been a primary meeting place for the local Serb community and it is no surprise that it is taking a leading role in the fundraising efforts. Club president, Ned Bogicevic, and general manager, Jason Woods, together with hardworking board members such as John Pavasovich, have all taken a leading role in the relief for flood victims. I also took part in the humanitarian concert organised by the leaders of the Serbian community, including Stan Jankovic. The concert was held in the Serbian culture club in Middleton Grange and was a great success.  


While individuals and communities across Australia and around the world have come together to provide assistance during these devastating floods, Australia's reputation as a generous and compassionate nation is under question at the moment. This government's decision to cut $7.6 billion from our foreign aid budget is preventing Australia from contributing to the aid effort in relation to this situation. While countries much less fortunate are lending a supporting hand, Australia has failed to contribute one cent towards the flood relief efforts in Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia. Those opposite, clearly embarrassed by the lack of contribution and action, repeatedly draw our attention to Australia's contribution to global organisations such as the United Nations and the International Red Cross. Those contributions are the minimum for a First World nation like Australia. Once these donations trickle down through the large and wide-reaching international organisations, it is likely that no significant assistance will flow directly to the people of Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia.


Australia has had its fair share of natural disasters. We know how difficult it is to deal with natural disasters—both during them and in the aftermath. Australia is a wealthy country and, more importantly, we are a nation with considerable experience in disaster relief efforts, as well as engineering flood mitigation measures to protect affected communities. We should not be turning our backs on these countries affected by an unprecedented natural disaster. We are a wealthy country. We are a country that cares and we should always remember the roles that Serbians, Bosnians and the Croatians have played in contributing to the modern face of Australia.

Mr NIKOLIC
 (Bass) (13:02):  I thank the member for Cowan for bringing this most worthy motion to the House to acknowledge and reflect on the worst floods in a century that have hit Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia, following rainfall which started on 13 May. Thousands of people have been affected, particularly in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Serbia. 


Like the member for Cowan, I also received a quick response from the foreign minister, who has expressed the government's condolences at the unprecedented flooding, especially to the families who have lost loved ones. Minister Bishop has written directly to representatives of the Serbian and Bosnian governments. I note also that DFAT has met with officials from the affected countries to discuss the impact of the floods, the response to date and likely future needs. The thoughts of all Australians, including those of Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian heritage, are with the affected communities. 


As someone who was born in the former Yugoslavia, I know firsthand that family and friends in Australia will feel this disaster very deeply indeed. Villages have been wiped out by over 2,000 landslides. There have been over 60 deaths, and thousands of people have been evacuated from affected areas. Undiscovered landmines from the war in the 1990s are being moved by floodwaters and mudslides, increasing the risk to civilian populations. 


I am pleased to report that Australia's core funding to key international organisations involved in the flood response is being used to help those in need. That includes the Red Cross and Red Crescent societies the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs—UNOCHA—and the World Food Program. Australia supports and enables these agencies to deploy experts and resources quickly, to assist with responses such as these. We should not be making politics about this event; we should be reflecting on the fact that our contribution does indeed make a difference when it comes to humanitarian need and disaster in our near region and beyond. 


Australia's support to UNOCHA helps the rapid deployment of UNDAC teams—UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination teams. And I note that an UNDAC team has been sent to Serbia to assist with the coordination of the response and assessment of needs. Australia is also a top-10 donor to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, which releases humanitarian assistance quickly in disasters like these. Australia's core funding to the World Food Program has enabled the dispatch of boats, generators and logistic support. A number of other UN agencies that Australia provides core support to, such as the UN Children's Fund and the UN Development Program, are also involved in the response. This government does take humanitarian response and support to these global agencies very seriously. Humanitarian funding will increase from $264 million this year to more than $338 million in 2014-15. Like the member for Cowan, I note the good work of the Australian Embassy in Belgrade in donating thousands of dollars worth of medical supplies locally.


Other support has also been quickly initiated through the European Union's civil protection mechanism, which has been activated upon the request of Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Over 20 EU member states offered assistance like motorboats, helicopters, pumps and humanitarian kits and deployed over 400 relief workers to the two countries. The European Commission's Emergency Response Coordination Centre is in constant contact with Serbia and with the participating states in the EU civil protection mechanism, matching the incoming offers for assistance with needs on the ground.


Australia continues to monitor the situation closely through our partners, including the EU, the UN and the Red Cross societies. In addition, Australia's representatives to Bosnia have visited the site and held discussions with key responders on the ground and will identify if there are further local needs that could be addressed through Australia's direct aid program.


Let me conclude with a message for those in flood affected areas. U Srbiji I regionu Balkana, su od poplava stradali ljudi isti kao svi mi. Izgubili su u katastrofalnim poplavama sve sto su generacijama stvarali. Tim ljudima je potrebna nasa pomoc. Ja iskreno verujem u humanost i solidarnost. Zemlja u kojoj sam roden—neophodna je nasa pomoc.

"Byrne, Anthony, MP",ALP,2014-06-16,"



Mr BYRNE
 (Holt) (13:07):  I rise today to support the member for Cowan's motion that recognises the tragedy of the floods in May that affected Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. Obviously, we have heard how it has killed many people—over 40 people—and was due to a low-pressure system called Yvette, which brought the heaviest rain to Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina in 120 years of recorded weather conditions and measurements. We have also heard about the floodwaters that have caused over 2,000 landslides across this region and the many thousands of homes that have been toppled or submerged in the mud. I have been advised that this has affected some 1.6 million people in Serbia and Bosnia after a week of flooding, with many being evacuated from their homes in both countries.


My home state of Victoria is home to over 7,000 people who were born in Serbia. In my electorate there is a large and active Serbian community. I know that many have been deeply affected by these floods. Many have loved ones and families back home who have been affected. I would like to commend this community and other communities, like the Bosnian community, who have rallied together in response. Institutions like the Serbian Orthodox Church of St Stephen in Carrum Downs, Saint Stefan Serbian Orthodox Church in Keysborough and the Serbian Springvale White Eagles Football Club have organised events in recent weeks to raise money to provide urgent humanitarian aid to those who have been affected. As reported in the Dandenong Journal, parishioners from the Keysborough Serbian Orthodox Church have donated more than $230,000 to help victims. Father Chedomir Videkanic of the Keysborough Serbian Orthodox Church said in the paper that hundreds had pledged the extraordinary sum at an emotional meeting at the church last month in response to the continuing humanitarian disaster in Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. It was also reported—and this is to be commended—that the Dandenong council has contributed $10,000 to the aid effort. Father Chedomir said it may take five to 10 years and millions of dollars—probably billions of dollars—to rebuild so every donation will make a difference to reconstruction in this part of the world.


Local Serbian residents Radenko Mihalovic and Slobodan Todic have conveyed to me the vital need for financial aid for simple matters like assisting Serbian schoolchildren with uniforms and books for the start of the school year in September. Many school children have had their clothes and books washed away, so these children need books and they need clothing. That is why they need this targeted aid.


I would like to say that both Radenko and Slobodan have been running the Serbian Program on Casey Radio, 3SER, 97.7 FM—that is a bit of advertising there—from 8 am to 9 am each Wednesday for the last 11 years. They have kept the local Serbian community updated with the latest news and events about the floods. Radenko has also advised that his brother Dragan has had to relocate his family from Loznica to the capital, Belgrade, to seek refuge from the floods, while his friend Elena also fled Loznica as her house had been washed away with the floods. These are tangible examples of the local community being profoundly affected by the events that occurred.


Radenko has also advised that one of the biggest challenges facing the Serbian government is the need to repair vital roads and bridges that link key towns and cities so that relief can get to those people in need. According to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the record floods in Serbia and Bosnia could cost some three million euros, or $4.5 billion. Bosnian officials have said that the physical damage could exceed that of the Bosnian War of the 1990s.


Another significant issue arising from the flooding affecting those living in Bosnia is, as has been mentioned by previous speakers, the risk of undiscovered landmines from the war in the 1990s. These landmines could have been moved by floodwaters and mudslides, increasing the risk to civilian populations. According to various sources, up to 120,000 landmines remain in 9,416 marked minefields. The floods washed away riverbanks and fuelled landslides that have unearthed these minefield warning signs and, in many cases, the unexploded booby traps themselves. An official at Bosnia's Mine Action Centre, Sasa Obradovic, said his agency in light of the floods would deploy mine-hunting scouts. Since the war 601 people have been killed and 1,121 wounded as a consequence of these unearthed mines. That is quite substantial.


I would like to welcome the international attention, but obviously we need to keep an eye on this. There are substantial groups of people who have been affected. It affects the Serbian, Bosnian and Croatian diaspora who live in and make a wonderful contribution to this country. It has been an honour, on behalf of the Serbian community particularly, to be able to raise this matter in this place today.

Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (16:00):  There has been a lot of posturing about infrastructure spending in the Northern Territory and about how the Territory supposedly missed out in budget 2014-15. Let me say from the outset that I am not going to be lectured by has-been, former or serving Labor politicians about my record in securing money for the Northern Territory since winning government. The fact is that budget 2014-15 is a necessary budget and a good infrastructure budget for the Territory. The overall spend is just under $600 million, with most of that going to Territory roads. That is way more than what we would have received if there was a Labor government. In fact, it is a record infrastructure spend for the Northern Territory.


The budget also honours my election commitments, including $300,000 for CCTV cameras, $1.5 million for the Jingili BMX track, nearly $100,000 for Warren Park, and more money for other community projects. That is on top of $40 million for the Palmerston hospital. All up there is $110 million for the Palmerston hospital. The federal Labor government made lots of promises around the Palmerston hospital, but they never actually handed over any money. When Labor was in government, it spent money like it was going out of fashion. The truth is that the budget is in a mess and it needs to be fixed. Interest payments of a billion dollars a month is proof of that. (Time expired)

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling—Minister for Justice) (16:46):  I am very pleased to be able to make this opening statement. How nice it is to be doing this consideration-in-detail phase of the appropriation bills on this side of the chamber. I must say, when we were in opposition we used to actually turn up for this part of the appropriation bills proceedings. Perhaps we will get sensible questions from the member for Holt and the member for Griffith. But as a shadow minister I used to take these responsibilities very seriously. We would come here for the whole hour and we would arrive here on time. Clearly these are not things that the shadow minister takes that seriously. I would have thought that, with the opportunity to question a government about a budget that they were so excited about, they would take the opportunity to do that. But clearly they do not.


This budget will help build on a more prosperous nation. Fighting and preventing criminal activity is a key priority for the Abbott government, since only safe communities can become strong and prosperous. This budget delivers on a number of our key election commitments. We are ensuring that all proceeds of crime are used to fight crime. We are doing this by reversing the previous Labor government's decision to freeze the $61 million retained in the confiscated assets account. Under this government this money will now be released for community crime prevention initiatives. Under the previous government, of course, they used to use this money to prop up their dodgy budget bottom line. The member for Lilley, who was then Treasurer, used to literally take from criminals to prop up his budget bottom line—rather extraordinary. We will ensure that that money goes to fighting criminals.


Fifty million dollars will be invested to boost the efforts of local communities to address crime and antisocial behaviour through the government's Safer Streets Programme. Eighteen million dollars will be invested in the schools security program to ensure that our children can be educated in a safe and secure environment. For the first time, funding can be used for security guards as well as to install security infrastructure such as CCTV, lighting and fencing in schools. One million dollars will be provided in 2014-15 to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity to expand its oversight to Australia's new border force, and $10.2 million will be invested over three years to establish a Western Australian strike team within the National Anti-gang Squad.


Fifteen million dollars will be provided to states and territories through the National Bushfire Mitigation Programme to implement long-term mitigation strategies and better fuel-reduction programs. This measure will help to make sure Australia is better prepared and can withstand the impacts of natural disasters. Funding will also be provided to work with the United Kingdom government to have Captain Matthew Flinders's original 1804 chart of Australia transferred to Australia on long-term loan. The government has committed $193,000 over two years to fund this project. This chart is literally seen as the birth certificate of the nation and is a very significant part of our history.


This budget is also focused on ensuring that Australians are served by an efficient and effective civil justice framework. Notwithstanding the difficult financial circumstances that have been left to us by the previous government, the Abbott government has kept to a minimum savings sought from the arts sector. Across the forward estimates, total reductions in arts funding have been limited to only 3.1 per cent. Most of those savings come from uncommitted funds or from bringing forward the termination date of programs which were due to terminate during the life of the current parliament in any event. The government has decided to quarantine the 28 major performing arts companies—the great flagship companies which bring the best of classical music, opera, dance and drama to Australians audiences—from any reduction in funding at all. This reflects our commitment to the sector and in particular our commitment to giving audiences the maximum opportunity to enjoy the best of Australian performance art.


Because the government is committed to ensuring that those opportunities extend to Australians who live outside the capital cities, the government has decided to quarantine funding for regional arts from any reduction. As anyone with any knowledge or understanding of the sector is well aware, the arts have done particularly well in this budget, notwithstanding the very difficult choices that we face. 


In this budget we also announced two new arts funding initiatives. Importantly, these measures have also had a positive impact on the budget bottom line. The key measures that we are doing to contribute to budget stability are the amalgamation of key Commonwealth merits review tribunals. This will make it easier to navigate the merits review system by providing an accessible one-stop shop for external merits review. I am happy to go into that at a later stage.

Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (16:51):  It has been a pleasure to hear from the minister about the funding commitments that have been made and the cuts that have been made. There are a number of questions that arise but I would like to start with a very important issue—that is, the effect of the Abbott government funding cuts on access to justice in this country. 


Access to justice is a significant concern for this country. It has been the subject of a number of inquiries and considerations, including most recently a draft report from the Productivity Commission in respect of access to justice, in which the Productivity Commission noted that there are not incentives for lawyers in private practice to engage in systemic advocacy work but that lawyers in community legal centres are uniquely placed to undertake advocacy work in respect of systemic issues. 


Notwithstanding that the Productivity Commission has recognised the importance of policy reform advocacy work for the community as a whole—including in dealing with systemic issues and difficulties arising within the legal system—in MYEFO the Abbott government announced that it would be cutting $43.1 million from legal policy reform and advocacy funding over four years, including cuts to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services and community legal centres. 


The May budget continued that cut, and there has been a great deal of concern from the community and from community legal centres in respect of the effect that is going to have on community legal centres' abilities to engage in problem solving and in advocacy more generally. That then leads to concerns about access to justice, which in turn leads to concern about the administration of justice. 


Is the minister aware that the Human Rights Law Centre Executive Director, Hugh de Kretser, said that the cuts went against the recommendations of repeated parliamentary inquiries that highlighted the chronic underfunding of Aboriginal legal services? 


Is the minister aware that the Australian Council of Social Services urged the federal government to take a cool approach and avoid trying to restore the budget in one hit, saying that the cuts would have little impact on the budget bottom line but a devastating impact on those who need legal assistance? 


What percentage of work do community legal centres do that is defined as so-called legal policy reform and advocacy work? Can you give an example of the policy work that would be the subject of the cuts being made? The cuts to policy reform will practically mean that experts in the field will not provide information to the government; why does the Abbott government want to take away funding that would allow for policy consultation from experts? 


Is the minister aware of the wage disparity between private lawyers and community legal centre lawyers? Who has been consulted in respect of the impact of these cuts on Australians in need, taking into account the fact that community legal centres often provide—with a lot of expertise and on a very slender budget as it is—services to those people who cannot afford private lawyers' fees but equally do not qualify for legal aid assistance, such as people with debt issues, people with family law issues, people suffering family violence and people who are unable to access justice?


Is the minister aware of the concerns that have been raised by the courts in respect of the burden that self-represented litigants place on the courts? Does the minister consider that there will be an increase in the number of self-represented litigants that the courts are expected to handle as a consequence of these cuts to community legal centre funding and services?


Are you aware, Minister, of the comment from the community legal centres' national campaign, Community Law Australia, that as many as one in five people turning to community legal centres for assistance is already being turned away by those community legal centres because of a lack of resourcing? Are you aware as to whether any of the community legal centres whose funding is to be cut had been visited by or on behalf of the government and consulted before these cuts were decided upon? 


Is the minister aware that an independent economic cost-benefit analysis of community legal centres published by the NACLC found that, on average, community legal centres have a cost-benefit ratio of one to 18—that is, for every dollar spent by government on funding CLCs, these services return a benefit to society that is 18 times the cost. To express it in dollar terms, the $47 million spent on the CLC program nationally in 2010 would yield around $846 million in benefit to Australia. Why would the government cut services which provide such benefits to this country? Thank you.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling—Minister for Justice) (16:56):  Firstly, can I say that I appreciate that the member for Griffith has actually turned up. The shadow Attorney-General and the shadow minister for justice are both members of the House of Representatives, yet, astonishingly, they could not even be bothered to come in for this consideration-in-detail stage, which I think is just extraordinary. So I give you points for that at least. I also appreciate that you gave me some very detailed questions. I do not want to disrespect all those questions, so I will say something in a general sense, if you do not mind, and then we can have a look at some of the detail on notice, if you are happy for me to do that.


Can I say in the first instance that we are very committed to making sure that vulnerable Australians do have access to justice. This budget builds on the commitment that we had in previous years when we were in government. The government has renewed its commitment to the ongoing funding of legal aid commissions and will be negotiating with the states and territories to agree on a one-year extension of the National Partnership Agreement on Legal Assistance Services. The agreement provides ongoing Commonwealth funding for legal aid commissions and will be extended by one year, until 30 June 2015. Extending the agreement will have no impact on the budget bottom line, because ongoing funding for legal aid commissions was already published in the forward estimates. The government is considering options for future legal assistance arrangements from 1 July 2015. It will focus on holistic delivery of front-line services to the most vulnerable members of our community, and the Abbott government is strongly committed to that. Extending the agreement will allow time for the government to consider the findings of the Productivity Commission's inquiry into access-to-justice arrangements and the review of the National Partnership Agreement on Legal Assistance Services. This will also provide the government with the opportunity to develop a medium- to long-term approach to ensure equitable and sustainable service delivery.


I appreciate that there were a whole series of very detailed questions in the five minutes that the member for Griffith used. I will endeavour to get her the most sensible responses to some of those questions, if she could just accept my response in general terms for what we are doing in the future, pending the review that the Productivity Commission is undertaking.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2014-06-16,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (16:58):  I have a question to the minister. I first need to provide the minister with a little bit of background in order for him to be able to answer this question. On Friday, I had the opportunity to meet the new principal of the King David School, David Opat. King David is an independent Jewish school in my electorate of Higgins and is one of the many fine independent Jewish schools located in Melbourne. David Opat is taking over from another fine principal, Michele Bernshaw, who served the King David School for more than 14 years and served it so incredibly well. The reason I want to draw the attention of the minister to the King David School, and other independent Jewish schools in the Victorian community and right around Australia, is that, unfortunately, we have seen many acts of graffiti, many acts of violence against property and threatened acts of violence against the person of staff, students and parents of students that attend these schools.


I hate to say it, but even in a great country like Australia there are people who do propagate anti-Semitic thoughts. In fact, I have seen this in my own electorate of Higgins, where there have been unnamed individuals who have distributed brochures supporting the boycotts to business and sanction scheme. Again, I know that it is a scheme that is supported by some members of the trade union movement. I think it is a very anti-Semitic movement and it is one that propagates some pretty unhelpful and inflammatory thoughts against good members of our community and good members of the Jewish community.


The question I have for the minister is: obviously, students have the right to feel safe at school. Parents want to know that when they send their students to school that they are going to be safe, and teachers need to be safe in their workplace. Can the minister explain what the Australian government is doing to secure the safety of students at schools like King David—for example, I know that we made a commitment to the Secure Schools Program—the reasons behind that commitment and how that commitment has in fact extended beyond the previous commitment that we provided as a coalition government when we first got elected in 1996?

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling—Minister for Justice) (17:01):  I thank the member for Higgins for that question. I acknowledge that within her electorate she has a very significant Jewish school and also a lot of other significant independent schools, and that she takes the safety of students and the teaching staff there very seriously as does the Abbott government, which is why we have committed to allocate $18 million within this budget for the Secure Schools Program. I am sure the member for Higgins would be interested to note that I have literally just come from a meeting with the Australian Council of Jewish Schools who, obviously, have a very keen interest in making sure that the students who attend the schools that they represent are protected when they go to those places. They are right to believe that the government has a keen interest in ensuring that that is the case.


The security issues that Jewish schools and other independent schools are concerned about are real issues. Sadly, you only need look back at recent history to understand why members of the Jewish community in particular are concerned about the safety of educational institutions that are associated with their community. We have seen some very drastic and terrible examples of that, to a very limited extent in Australia, certainly, but in Europe and other parts of the world we have seen dreadful attacks on Jewish schools. We need to make sure that we in Australia are doing everything we can to make sure that educational institutions that might be targeted or at risk in this way are as difficult and hard to target as is possible. That is why we are allocating this $18 million. Funding will start in the 2014-15 budget to extend the Secure Schools Program, with $6 million available in each of the 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17 years.


For the first time, under this government, the funding, as well as being able to be used for hard capital security infrastructure, will be able to be used for security guards. Schools and students should not be distracted from their studies by the threat of violence because of their race or religion. This program seeks to extend their security infrastructure so that they can enjoy the same schooling experience as any other school.


I know that the member for Higgins is very concerned about the King David School in particular. I am very pleased to have Carmel School in my electorate, which is the Jewish school in Western Australia—and an exceptionally good school it is too, with excellent academic results year after year. I am aware from my contact with the school and with the Perth Hebrew congregation in general that they remain very concerned about their own security. Unfortunately, they have had incidents. They would not be as serious as some other security incidents that have appeared around the globe, but they have certainly given them pause for thought. The government stands with them in doing all that we can to make sure that we are securing Carmel School, the King David School and other independent schools around the country that might require that attention.


I am about to write to state and territory education ministers and the Independent Schools Association, seeking nominations from their jurisdictions for schools which may be eligible for funding. Once we have had these nominations, the candidates will be able to apply for funding grants before being assessed, and the successful applicants will be announced. Clearly, that is going to have to be a competitive program. We are going to make sure that we cover the risks as we assess them, and we will be making sure that that money goes as far as possible to secure the school environment for independent schools that are legitimately concerned about being at risk.


Because the member for Higgins was kind enough to ask that question, I will note that the King David School has already been a successful recipient of funding in previous rounds—almost $1 million under three grants went to the King David School—and I appreciate the contribution that that school does make to her electorate. I look forward to working with Jewish schools but also with other independent schools in being able to announce the successful recipients of the funding program in the 2014-15 financial year.

 (Holt) (17:05):  As far as details go, from the minister representing the Attorney-General's speech, first off I would like to ask him a question that relates to the Attorney-General's portfolio. I was chair of a committee that brought down a finding with respect to data retention. It was a component of the national security legislation. It was a reform that was countenanced in three tranches. We tabled this report in the last sitting week of the 43rd Parliament. I am led to understand that the Attorney-General's Department is looking at the various tranches of legislation as we speak. So my question is to the minister representing the Attorney-General. Could he please tell me whether or not they are going to introduce any legislation pertaining to data retention in the life of this parliament?

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling—Minister for Justice) (17:06):  I thank the member for Holt for that question, though I am not sure whether he started there with a barb about my un-inspirational delivery! But I will give him the benefit of the doubt, because that is a sensible question and one which the government is seriously considering. As you appreciate, I am representing the Attorney-General here today, and this matter would fall within his portfolio jurisdiction. But it is something that I take a keen interest in, obviously, as the minister with responsibility for the Australian Federal Police, and the police of course are very concerned about this and have been making representations to the government. He would understand the content of the representations because he would have seen their submissions to his committee. I must say that that committee does do very serious and sensible work, and when that committee makes recommendations to the government we take those recommendations seriously. I understand that the Attorney-General is looking at those recommendations at the moment.


It is very important that we have a regime in Australia which complements our national security and also helps our criminal justice agencies to do their job. I appreciate that, in the environment in which we live at the moment, there is a lot of myth and concern about this idea that somehow the state might be snooping on people. Everything we do in the law and order area and in the national security area when it comes to data retention and communications is to make the Australian people safer, and that is the absolute and primary objective that we will have in responding to his committee's recommendations. We need to look at these things sensibly. What we are doing is important for community safety. I will not pre-empt that response to the committee, and I am not actually privy to that response in totality yet, but we do take the committee's recommendations seriously and we do take the safety of the Australian people seriously.

Mr PASIN
 (Barker) (17:08):  Before I put my question to the minister, I will just give some context. As a representative for regional Australia and regional South Australia in particular, and as someone who represents a large swathe of regional South Australia, the reality is that bushfires are an ever-present danger. Indeed, during the 2014 bushfire season we had no less than six large-scale bushfires raging across Barker, at Eden Valley, Rockleigh, Calperum Station, Ngarkat Conservation Park, Billiat and Tintinara. They burnt out of control between 20 December and 23 January. They burnt 232,000 hectares. They destroyed many significant assets.


I will give some further detail. The Eden Valley fire ignited just after midday on Friday, 17 January. It burnt through almost 25,000 hectares and was not declared as contained until Monday, 20 January, much to the relief of those on the front line and the personnel involved in managing the incident in the fire-affected communities. Just after 5.30 on 17 January, a lightning strike ignited a fire within the Ngarkat Conservation Park, burning some 90,000 hectares. A fire also ignited near Rockleigh, on the Murraylands, just after 3 pm on 14 January. This is the third time communities in the area have been threatened by fire within 12 months. More than 80 CFS firefighters responded. Just after 6 pm, on 14 January, fires ignited in the Margaret Dowling camp site, at Billiat, Katarapko and Kringin, with additional lightning following in the next few days, sparking the Calperum fire, exposing the community of Cooltong to significant danger. My question to the minister is this: given, Minister, what you have just heard about how my local community was so seriously affected by bushfires between December last year and January this year, what budget measures will help us better prepare our communities for bushfire events in the future?

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2014-06-16,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling—Minister for Justice) (17:11):  I thank the member for Barker for that question. It is a very good question and I appreciate that he has had discussions with me in the past about the bushfires that affected his community in January this year. The government is very aware of the toll that bushfires and other natural disasters take on the Australian community. Unfortunately, as we all know too well, bushfires are a harsh reality in Australia, as are other natural disaster events. But every summer we continue to see communities that are devastated by bushfire. We know—and the member for Barker will know—that the impacts of bushfire last well beyond the event itself.


In the budget we announced the National Bushfire Mitigation Program, which will provide $15 million over three years, to help states and territories implement long-term bushfire mitigation strategies and better fuel reduction programs. I acknowledge that everything we do in this area is always done in conjunction with the states and territories, which actually have first responder responsibilities for natural disasters in Australia. As the minister with responsibility for emergency management within the government I have discovered that the Commonwealth in and of itself does not have an enormous amount of hardware to respond to bushfires. We always do what we can with the assistance of the Australian Defence Force but, essentially, it is the responsibility of the states and territories. They do a magnificent job in doing so and the same goes for the way the South Australian government responded to the bushfires in January this year. The National Bushfire Mitigation Program draws on a coalition election commitment. Through this initiative we can help to build stronger communities which are better prepared for when that bushfire threat becomes a reality.


The Abbott government recognises that we have to do something to address the increased toll that natural disasters are taking on Australian communities and businesses. That is why, with the support of all state and territory governments, we have commissioned a Productivity Commission inquiry into natural disaster funding. This inquiry will consider how we can best target our overall disaster funding in a way that better equips our nation for future disasters.


These are just two of the many investments we are making to better prepare the nation for future disasters. We are also providing over $52 million over two years to target natural disaster risk priorities in all states and territories and investing up to $12½ million to address the high cost of strata title insurance in North Queensland. As anyone who spends a little bit of time in the coalition party room will attest—we do not normally talk about party room discussions, but I suspect the member for Leichhardt will not mind—the member for Leichhardt has been talking about this issue ad nauseam for many years. When we were in opposition we were not in a position to do something about it, but the Abbott government has responded to those concerns, which are particularly acute in North Queensland, with this $12½ million, which addresses the high cost of strata title insurance in his area and other parts of Queensland in particular.


I thank the member for Barker for this question. The way the Commonwealth government responds to natural disaster is very important. It costs the Australian taxpayer hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars, depending on how bad any particular disaster season is. This Productivity Commission inquiry is very timely. We will take the recommendations, which I expect to receive by the end of the year, very seriously, and we will look to implement them to make sure the enormous investment the Australian taxpayer is making in making sure Australian communities respond to natural disaster is spent in the most effective possible way. We will take the recommendations that the Productivity Commission makes very seriously and respond appropriately as a government.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2014-06-16,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (17:15):  I want to address some questions to the Minister for Justice about section 18C, but first I want to mention the comments that have just been made by the member for Higgins and responded to by the minister in relation to the Secure Schools Program. What was missing from the minister's answer and, indeed, what was missing from what was said by the member for Higgins was any acknowledgement—and one was due—about the fact that there is bipartisan support for the Secure Schools Program and that there was $20 million in the 2008 budget for three years for the Secure Schools Program to fund security works not just in Jewish schools but in schools at risk from racially and religiously motivated violence, which we deplore, not just in Melbourne but throughout Australia. And there was a further $15 million in the 2011 budget over three years, which I had assumed had bipartisan support. The Minister for Justice in talking now is forgetting that for the last six years, supported by our Labor government, there have been works performed at Jewish schools throughout the country and, I might add, at some Muslim schools and, in one case, in a government school in south-west Sydney where security was needed to be enhanced because of religiously or racially motivated violence. Of course, both parties went to the last election very directly supporting an extension of the Secure Schools Program and both parties at the last election supported not just an extension of funding for the Secure Schools Program for capital works but also an extension of funding to cover some recurrent funding for security guards in Jewish schools. I am very pleased to see the program continuing and I would have thought that the minister or perhaps the member for Higgins might have found it in themselves to acknowledge the work done by the Labor government over both of the last terms.


But I wanted to raise with the minister the appalling conduct of both the Attorney-General and the government in general over its proposed repeal of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. It might be that the member for Higgins can speak in this place about her condemnation of anti-Semitism, but it is a pity that her colleagues at the ministerial level—



Mr Keenan interjecting—




Mr DREYFUS:
  I do not think it is a matter for heckling by the Minister for Justice; it is a much more serious matter than that. It is a pity that they have not been able to do anything about the Attorney-General, who thinks it is appropriate to stand up in the Australian Senate and say things like, 'People do have a right to be bigots, you know.'


I wanted particularly to refer to a letter by Moshe Gutnik, the President of the Organisation of Rabbis of Australasia; Yehoram Ulman, the President of the Rabbinical Council of New South Wales; and Meir Shlomo of the Rabbinical Council of Victoria, who thought it was necessary to write to The Australian newspaper last month, pointing out that Tim Wilson, the Human Rights Commissioner appointed by this government, was completely wrong when he suggested that there was any support from any rabbinical organisation in this country for the changes proposed to be made by this government to section 18C. They reminded the people of Australia—and I remind the people of Australia and every member of this parliament—that last month was the month in which Jewish people and others around the world marked Holocaust Remembrance Day. They ended their letter with these words:


None of us dares forget, and Wilson and the government would do well to remember that racist words have evil consequences.


What we are seeing from this government is a gutting of the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act, a removal of the protections that have served Australia well for almost 20 years and its replacement, it would seem, with something that it is now absolutely clear would permit, among other things, all kinds of vile, racist abuse in public and, in particular, Holocaust denial to occur. This government should be ashamed of itself for its conduct in proposing a gutting of these provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act, and the member for Higgins and the Minister for Justice need to be reflecting when they are so quick to say that they condemn anti-Semitism and that they want to do what they can to protect the Jewish schools in the electorate of the member for Higgins, because the two things go together. 


I have a couple of questions for the Minister for Justice: when is the government going to make public the 5,700 submissions that it has received, and when is the government going to announce what it is going to do, which should be to drop its proposal on the Racial Discrimination Act?

 (Stirling—Minister for Justice) (17:20):  I will deal with the issue of the Secure Schools Program that the shadow minister raised. How nice that the shadow minister has found time to join us during the Consideration in Detail stage. It only lasts for an hour, but obviously he has only found time in his busy schedule to join us for half of that. It is true that the Secure Schools Program—



Mr Dreyfus interjecting—




Mr KEENAN:
  And now we are joined by the shadow minister for Justice—how nice that he can join us. He will last 20 minutes of the consideration in detail proposal.



Mr Feeney interjecting—




Mr KEENAN:
  I am sure that when you get up and have your five minutes you can say your piece on this, but I have been in here for the whole hour and I can assure you that I have monitored the movements of both shadow ministers. I was terribly disappointed that they could not be bothered to come and attend consideration in detail up until this point. 


I will go to the point that the shadow Attorney-General has made on the Secure Schools Program. I appreciate that it is a program that also existed under the previous government, and I have no problem whatsoever with acknowledging that. Of course, it might have been nice if he had acknowledged that it was the Howard government that invented this program. Indeed, when I was a backbencher in the Howard government between 2004 and 2007, I worked very hard to make sure that the synagogue that exists within my electorate had appropriate protection, and the federal government joined with the Western Australian state government to ensure that that was the case. So I have got no problem acknowledging that the program existed under the previous government, and I am sure that he will join the love and acknowledge that the program existed under the Howard government also.


As to the references to 18C that the shadow minister has made, firstly I would note that there is no appropriation associated with 18C, and what we are doing here at the moment are the appropriation bills. Section 18C is not an issue that appears within the budget paper—it appears completely extraneously to that—but, because I like him so much, I am going to extend him some latitude to talk about the questions that he has asked me in relation to 18C.


As the member for Higgins has very sensibly reminded me—and the shadow minister is quite right to be passionate about anti-Semitism—I note that the BDS movement that is endorsed by some trade unions around the country is not condemned wholeheartedly by the trade union movement as it should be. Indeed, it is actively supported by some individual trade unions—trade unions which would be constituent members of the Labor Party. Where is the condemnation of those trade unions being associated with a movement that is blatantly anti-Semitic? I appreciate that the shadow minister is passionate about this—and it is right that he should be—but where is the condemnation of the trade union movement endorsing what is an anti-Semitic movement at its core? This feeds to the sort of prejudice that we were talking about, which the Secure Schools Program was designed to address.


On the specifics of the questions that he has asked me about 18C—

(

Mr KEENAN:
  At the moment, as the shadow minister would be aware, there has been a very considerable process of public consultation. We have received an enormous amount of submissions. The Attorney-General is currently working through those submissions and will be making some announcements about that in due course. We take the submissions that we have received very seriously—obviously we are interested in the views of the Australian community. I appreciate that the debate around this has been passionate, and there is no problem with people having a bit of passion when it comes to what are very serious issues. We will be methodically and sensibly working through the submissions that we have received, and the Attorney-General will obviously be making some announcements in due course about that.

As a result of several visits to the electorate of Forde over the last couple of years the minister would be aware of the wonderful work that Logan City Council has done in conjunction with Queensland Rail and the Queensland Police Service in putting together a CCTV network not only to help reduce the incidence of crime in our community but also provide safer streets on the whole for the local community. I thank the minister and the government for the investment of some $960,000 in CCTV cameras for the electorate of Forde. This has been greatly welcomed by the Logan City Council. It is complemented by an investment of over $1 million by Logan City Council in a new CCTV monitoring room and the upgrade of digital monitoring equipment to better link in with Queensland Police Service and Queensland Rail.


My question to the minister is: what decisions were made in the budget that have allowed the funding of this program through different uses of the proceeds of crime and how does this differ from decisions made by the previous Labor government?

I was very pleased to join him over the course of the last few weeks at Logan City Council for some announcements about the expansion of the CCTV network in his electorate of Forde. Logan has a very extensive CCTV network. In fact, it would be one of the most comprehensive networks anywhere in the country. Previous governments, including the Howard government, contributed extensively to that. The Abbott government is very pleased to join the member for Forde in announcing an expansion of that CCTV network. I note that the Mayor of Logan and councillors, from the interaction we had when I visited with the member for Forde, were very grateful for the assistance of the Abbott government under our Safer Streets program. 


In the budget we have delivered on our election commitment, ensuring that all proceeds of crime money is used to fight crime. When the former government was in office, they froze that proceeds of crime money. It had always been expended to the benefit of law enforcement agencies to stop future criminal activity. They froze the confiscated assets account and they used that money to prop up the budget for political reasons. Had this continued, had we not reversed that when we arrived in office, up to $112 million seized from criminals, which we would have collected from their criminal activities, would have been locked in that account by the 2017-18 financial year. We reversed that decision so that proceeds of crime will again be available to fund local crime prevention strategies such as the Safer Streets strategy, which funds the Logan City Council CCTV network in Forde. We are using these funds straight away to address the legacy of underinvestment in crime prevention by the previous government. The previous government has a dreadful record on this—they froze proceeds of crime and they significantly attacked all of our law enforcement agencies. The Australian Crime Commission, in particular, was savaged by the previous government over six years. A third of its personnel and a third of its budget was cut. 


We need to now move on and reinvigorate law enforcement agencies and make sure that proceeds of crime are being used to attack criminal activity—as they always were in the past, until the previous government got so desperate to pretend it had a surplus and subsequently froze that proceeds of crime money. Future decisions on proceeds of crime will be made at my discretion. This is an important step in reducing administrative red tape so that funding can easily flow for what is needed in our communities. We will be looking at making sure our law enforcement agencies are also getting a fair share of that funding to do their very important work, after six years of underinvestment and budget cuts from previous governments. It has always been the Abbott government's intention that proceeds of crime be returned to the community so that the crimes of yesterday will be used to prevent the crimes of tomorrow. Projects will be funded to support crime prevention and law enforcement initiatives, including Safer Streets, as the member for Forde alluded to.


How fortuitous, the member for Swan and the member for Lindsay are also getting funding under the Safer Streets program, as well as the member for Higgins. I have been to all of your electorates and I am looking forward to coming to the member for Higgins' electorate to make an announcement about the Safer Streets funding that we will be deploying in Higgins. This money has also been used to fund such things as the establishment of the national Anti-Gangs Squad team in Western Australia. We will be using over $10 million of the proceeds of crime funding so that a number of AFP officers and other federal law enforcement officers, including an officer from the Australian tax office, will be embedded in the Western Australia Police force, within their Anti-Gangs Squad, to work constructively to make sure that they are doing all they can in the national fight against organised crime and, in particular, of course, outlaw motorcycle gangs that have been the focus of the Western Australia Police attention until this point.


I thank the member for Forde for that question. I appreciate his ongoing interest in community safety within his electorate.

Mr FEENEY
 (Batman) (17:31):  Minister, my questions go to the selection process and eligibility for the Safer Streets program. As you would be aware, the target group for funding under the first funding round for the Safer Streets program were those organisations identified before October 2013. That is to say that some $19.3 million was set aside by you and allocated for projects, but only able to go to those organisations identified by you before October 2013. Those organisations identified by you have since been invited by you to apply for funding under the Safer Streets program by the Abbott government. As a consequence, organisations that were not hand-picked by you prior to October 2013, including those that had already been approved for funding under the former NCPF program, were barred from applying.


My question to you is: what did the selection process for identifying these organisations involve? What were the selection criteria used to identify successful and unsuitable organisations? Who identified the organisations to receive the funding? How did the selectors gain access to these organisations and determine they were suitable for the program? How were these organisations identified? Who identified them? Who reviewed these applications? When did the selection process commence? How long after the selection process began were successful organisations identified? When were the organisations informed that they had been chosen as funding recipients? Was there any consideration made for organisations that had been approved for funding under the previous NCPF? Given that successful organisations were hand-picked by you prior to the 2013 election, how did you assure that there was political neutrality? What processes were put in place to ensure an unbiased selection process?


Minister, I am very keen for you to enlighten us on these important issues. I note, with time being difficult, that on 16 June 2010, in proud, fine words in this place you said:


Surely for ministers of the Crown it is not that difficult to come in here and answer questions for 35 minutes on areas within their portfolio without going through this ludicrous parody of government members getting up and asking dorothy dixer questions and the minister then reading a prepared answer.


It is sad to see those fine sentiments turn to dust now that you are in office, but, having concluded your dorothy dixers—




Mr KEENAN:
  You weren't here.




Mr FEENEY:
  Mercifully, Hansard records your fine sentiments, Minister, and mercifully Hansard can shine a light on your hypocrisy. Having wandered your way through those time-wasting dorothy dixers, tell us about the selection process and tell us about how you selected those organisations before October 2013. Tell us how it is you assured that the government process would remain politically neutral?

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling—Minister for Justice) (17:34):  I must say, I do admire the shadow minister's front to roll in here after 40 minutes of consideration in detail, which only lasts for an hour, and complain that government members, who happened to be in the chamber, were asking questions. It is very difficult for me to respond to the opposition if they do not come into the chamber and ask me questions. One hour is allocated every year for budget consideration in detail, yet the shadow minister has come in here after 40 minutes has expired and asks me why it is that I had to respond to questions from members who actually were here in the chamber. Quite remarkable! But I do admire his sense of humour, if nothing else. 



Honourable members interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs Andrews
):  Order! The minister will be heard in silence.




Mr KEENAN:
  The shadow minister was very keen for me to enlighten him—and of course I am very keen to enlighten the shadow minister whenever I get the opportunity to do so. I would like to give him a bit of history about proceeds of crime in Australia and how it came to pass that we committed those proceeds of crime to the Safer Streets Program. Governments of all persuasions, up until the advent of the Gillard-Rudd era, had spent proceeds of crime money on fighting crime. It stands to reason that, if you are going to take money from criminals, you would subsequently reinvest those funds—




Mr Feeney:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I have a point of order on relevance. I did not ask for a history lesson. Can he please answer the questions that have been asked of him?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I ask the minister to be relevant to the questions.




Mr KEENAN:
  I very keen to be as helpful as I possibly can be for the shadow minister. I am not sure if he is aware of the background. This background is vitally important to understanding what has gone on in this process. It is important to understand because governments of all persuasions have spent proceeds of crime money on fighting crime. This happened under the previous Howard government and it happened for the first few years of the Rudd government until the government got so desperate with their out-of-control spending that they looked for any pockets of money they could use to prop up the budget and pretend that they were running a better budget bottom line than they were. They froze the proceeds of crime and said: 'This money we have taken from criminals is now going to be used against the member for Lilley's dodgy figures to pretend that the budget is in better shape than it is.' This is what happened and it was a shameful thing. 


Money that should have been used to fight criminal activity was actually used to prop up their dodgy bottom line. I think that is shameful. When we were in opposition we decided that that was a very bad decision. It was a bad decision for law enforcement and it was a bad decision for communities where that money could have been spent. So we said in 2012: 'We are not going to accept this. We will unfreeze proceeds of crime and will reinvest it in community projects all around Australia that make our streets safer.' Subsequent to that I spent a lot of time talking to communities about what their priorities might be. We spent a lot of time going around Australia talking to local members and community groups about what their priorities might be. We subsequently made a series of commitments at the election that we of course will keep. Like all of the Abbott government's commitments, we are going to make sure that they are kept. We made promises to communities, such as the communities in Swan, Lindsay and Higgins, and said that we would stand with them and fund community safety initiatives that they believe are going to be useful to combat crime within their local area. 


That is the right thing to do, as opposed to what the Labor government were proposing to do with the proceeds of crime. They were going to sit on the money and use it to prop up their dodgy budget so they could pretend their budget was in better shape than it was after their years of excessive spending. If we had not come in and made the very important decisions that we made to unfreeze the proceeds, then there would have been $112 million accumulated within that fund up until the 2017-18 financial year. 


The Labor Party spent outrageously in government. They went around looking for whatever pots of money they could use. They froze proceeds of crime money—money that would have been better spent within the community, money that would have been better spent on law enforcement all around Australia and money that we will reinvest in making sure that criminals all around the country find it harder to commit their foul deeds.

  The member for Batman might think that they are dorothy dixers, but the people in my electorate of Swan will be very interested to hear the background to this question. Anytime you want to come to Swan, Member for Batman, you can. You can talk to the people of my electorate about the crime issues that we face. But, as of yet, I have not seen anyone from the Labor Party come to Swan to talk about crime issues since the election.



Mr Feeney interjecting—




Mr IRONS:
  You had your turn. Just sit down now and listen. I would like to give the minister a bit of background on crime in my electorate. As you would understand, being a Western Australian, there is what is called the crime corridor in the south-eastern part of Perth, which takes in my electorate, Hasluck and parts of Canning. We have had issues with serious crime such as violence on our streets. I went out with a police patrol late at night and they were telling me about a situation where they arrived at the Burswood train station to find that one of the youths there had had half his face ripped off. That was typical of the crime in some of the areas in my electorate.


We conducted some local action campaigns through the community and one of them was at the Lynwood Village Shopping Centre, where they were experiencing a lot of issues with crime in the car parks and people being threatened. With support from the City of Canning and the support of the local shopkeepers, security improvements were made through extra security guards and some CCTV camera installations. This was funded not only by the City of Canning but also by the owners of the shopping centre. Also, in an area in east Lynwood, as a crime prevention measure there were improvements to street lighting. Again, the City of Canning came to the party. We met on site with Linton Reynolds, whom you may know, and also the CEO of the City of Canning. Further to that, there were improvements in street lighting in that particular area.


I was operating a mobile office at the Carousel shopping centre and, after complaints were made at the mobile electorate office, information was given to us and forwarded to the police, who, within seven days, managed to shut down a drug house that was operating within about 500 metres of the shopping centre. In another two instances, in South Perth and St James, we have managed to have two other drug houses shut down with the assistance of police and information provided by the local community. So there is a real willingness and appetite among the local community to get involved and support reducing the crime problems that we face in Swan. We also had some instances of crime at the Carson Street school in East Victoria Park. Again, through my efforts and those of the local community, we managed to get the school to have some extra security fencing put up, which has helped address their crime prevention issues down there.


Also, we have seen security improvements to the Red Castle hotel site in Lathlain, just near the Burswood station. There were some issues with drugs, some dealers and the Red Castle hotel, which had been left destitute and in isolation and experienced a fire. With help from the Victoria Park council and support from the police, we managed to have some hotel fencing put in and patrols for that area were stepped up as well.


As you previously mentioned, you came to my electorate recently, about 2½ weeks ago, to continue the good work that has been done with the CCTV rollout, particularly in the city of Belmont and in Rivervale and Kewdale. It was great that you could come that day, meet with the PCYC and with a shopkeeper who had just experienced a robbery attempt on his shop, and announce a $100,000 commitment to the rollout of further CCTV around the Belmont Forum Shopping Centre.


Based on that information, can you explain the difference between the former government's National Crime Prevention Fund and the coalition government's Safer Streets Program? Also, is it incorrect for Labor members to be saying that funding has been cut in crime prevention?

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (17:45): I have four questions, to begin with, for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance. First, I refer to the government's fiscal strategy as outlined on page 3-7 of Budget Paper No. 1. Can the parliamentary secretary explain how you would quantify (a) a strong surplus, (b) sound economic growth prospects and (c) low unemployment? Can the parliamentary secretary put a number on those three criteria? Second, does the parliamentary secretary agree with the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection when he told the House on 3 June 2014:


If I go back to the PEFO—as we know, the PEFO is where the officials tell the truth about what the budget really is from the previous government. From the previous Government, that's what it does.


Third, can the parliamentary secretary confirm that the government's own budget documents, page 7 of the budget overview, confirm that funding to schools and hospitals will be $80 billion less than under previous arrangements? Parliamentary Secretary, is this not an $80 billion cut? Fourth, can the parliamentary secretary confirm to the House that this government's $80 billion cuts to hospitals and schools have led to a $16 billion cut to hospitals and schools in Queensland? If not, is the parliamentary secretary saying that the Queensland budget papers are misleading?

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2014-06-16,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (17:47):  I might begin by talking about the Finance portfolio and the government's budget measures therein, and then I will answer the shadow minister's questions. Some of the answers are contained in this introduction. Without reining in spending now and in the future the budget would have remained in deficit for at least the next decade, and I am sure that the shadow minister would agree that that is the case. Leaving future generations to shoulder the burden of our spending decisions, as well as cope with the impact of an ageing population, is just not fair. It is not fair on current taxpayers and it is certainly not going to be fair on future generations. We need to start paying our way so that those future generations are able to enjoy the standard of living that we now take for granted. 


With this budget, the government has made significant steps towards reducing the huge deficit left to us by Labor. The budget represents an overall $43.8 billion improvement in the budget bottom line at the 2013-14 MYEFO in the four years to 2017-18. It places spending on a manageable trajectory and provides a credible path back to surplus—and we all want that. With this budget, by the end of the decade Commonwealth debt is projected to be $389 billion—still a large sum but a significantly reduced amount on the $667 billion debt which we were projected to reach had we not taken any action. In this budget, we have taken important steps towards improving the efficiency of the public sector by reducing duplication. The savings realised through more efficient government operations will be redirected to repair the budget and to fund policy priorities. For example, the government will achieve savings of $43.3 million, over four years, by moving to more efficient practices for public affairs and internal communications for Australian government agencies. To investigate where else we might be able to realise further efficiencies, the government is developing and implementing a contestability framework over a three-year program of work to review whether government functions should be open to competition and the appropriate means for this to occur. This work will complement the scoping study into future ownership options for four operations announced in the budget. The government will provide $11.7 million in 2014 for scoping studies into the future of Australian Hearing, Defence Housing Australia, the Royal Australian Mint and the registry function of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.


We are also getting our house in order by embarking on the progressive sale of non-defence Commonwealth properties surplus to requirements. The Commonwealth owns a number of properties which reflect historical rather than current or projected future needs. The first tranche of properties will include around 40 surplus non-defence Commonwealth properties, including vacant blocks and facilities which are no longer in use. The details of specific properties to be offered for sale will be released over time as part of a coordinated sale process. The first tranche is expected to deliver savings to the budget of $22½ million over the forward estimates. Finance has been provided with a modest amount of funding to meet the costs of engaging private sector experts to support the sale process.


In the digital age, information technology plays a pivotal central role in how agencies undertake analysis, collect information and deliver services. The budget provides a modest amount of funding for Finance to perform gateway reviews which will provide quality assurance for three significant major capital projects: for the Bureau of Meteorology's replacement of its existing supercomputer, which is used for the bureau's weather forecasts and warnings across Australia and will reach its expected end of life in mid-2016; for the Department of Social Services to develop a second-pass business case to further scope options to replace its grants management platform with a more flexible and integrated system; and for the Immigration and Border Protection portfolio to strengthen and enhance Australia's border protection services.


We inherited a mess, and the shadow minister asks about health and education spending going forward. We are certainly committed to the four years of the forward estimates and we are going to actually increase what Labor would have done for both health and education in those very important portfolio areas. We did not commit to anything further beyond that. Labor made promises they knew they would never have to keep. They made those promises for the out years, years five and six, knowing full well that we had a debt and deficit crisis. They knew full well that they would not have to deliver on those promises. They made agreements in the education sphere without Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory coming on board. We are a Commonwealth government; we make decisions based on good national priorities. When you do not have all states and territories signed up to a Commonwealth deal it just does not make sense.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2014-06-16,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (17:52):  In this appropriation discussion and debate, I think it is important to understand the context in which the government has made its decisions and my question does go to that. But, first, I want to remind the minister that when we came into government in 1996 we inherited a situation where we had to pay back $96 billion of Labor's debt, which we did over about a 10-year period. Not only did we do that during the previous coalition government period, but we also provided for the future by putting more than $45 billion into the Future Fund and also putting moneys into other such funds. More than $6 billion went into the Higher Education Endowment Fund, which I note was raided by the Labor Party when it came into government. That is why we need to make higher education reforms, which we are doing in the upcoming budget.


The situation we have inherited coming into government, as I understand it, is that we have significant debt, with gross debt heading up to more than $665 billion if we were to make no change in the current budget. We are paying interest bills of around $12 billion today, which is about how much we currently spend on schools—that is, the Commonwealth contribution right here, right now, to schools—and, again, if nothing were to be changed it would go up to more than $35 billion in interest alone. 


We saw under the Howard government multifactor productivity on average increase by about 0.7 per year during those years. We saw under the previous Labor government that multifactor productivity actually decreased by 0.7 per year on average. In this budget, because of the decisions that have been made in the appropriations, we are able to make investments in such things as productivity enhancing infrastructure. If we were to continue on a path of debt as a result of deficit after deficit being delivered, which is what the Labor Party delivered during their six years of government, we would have to pay interest bills that would mean we would not be able to make investments in productivity enhancing infrastructure.


Could the minister enlighten the House on the investments that we are going to be making in infrastructure as a result of the fact that we have made these appropriations measures? I am particularly interested in my home state of Victoria. I know that we have made a broader announcement of more than $50 billion of investment over a seven-year period, but, in Victoria, I understand that we are going to make investments of around $7.6 billion, $3 billion of which is going into the East West Link, which will have a huge impact on productivity in my home state of Victoria. I would like the minister, if he might, to also talk about the asset recycling program, which will be able leverage up the investment that we are making with the state governments so that we can ensure that we can be on a path to prosperity and growth in our country, rather than a path of ruin and debt.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (17:55):  The member for Higgins fully understands and appreciates the mess that we have inherited after six years of chaos. Labor left Australia with a broken budget, a damaged economy and a serious mess to fix, and I know that this was no more better demonstrated than in the state of Victoria, where we have got transport systems and infrastructure chaos needing to be repaired, and we are getting on with the job. 


When the Prime Minister was elected he said he wanted to be the infrastructure Prime Minister. I know that he also stated, quite clearly and quite categorically, that we were once again open for business. He and the trade minister have led important delegations and taken a lot of Victorian business people with them to open up preferential trade agreements with both Korea and Japan, which will mean considerable investments for Victoria into the future and getting on with the job of improving those key transport areas in Melbourne. Regional Victoria will follow, and, as the member for Higgins pointed out, it will lead to improved and bolstered productivity.


When Labor came to office, as we heard the member for Higgins say—and she would know, as she worked for Peter Costello, one of the great Treasurers of this nation—they inherited a surplus of $20 billion with no net debt and $45 billion in the bank. Between 2008-09 and 2012-13, Labor delivered deficits totalling $191 billion. Labor left additional project deficits of $123 billion over the next four years—so that is going up to 2016-17. As the member for Higgins pointed out, we are paying at the moment $12 billion of debt annually thanks to Labor's mess. That equates to $1 billion a month—you could build a lot of roads, rail infrastructure, schools or hospitals with that $1 billion each and every month that we are paying down. 


The Deputy Prime Minister—the Minister for Infrastructure—has correctly pointed out that, if left unchecked, that is going to be $3 billion per month of money that we will not have to invest in Melbourne or regional Victoria. We have got to pay down that debt so that we can then get on with the job of building the important infrastructure not just for Victoria, New South Wales or the ACT—which the shadow minister proudly represents—but indeed for all of Australia. We do need to have productivity-building infrastructure. The Abbott-Truss government has reduced Labor's deficits by $43.8 billion through to 2017-18. Gross government debt is also forecast to be $389 billion in 2023-24, compared with $667 billion that Labor left us. Certainly, if we do not do something, our future generations are going to inherit a far worse mess than what we have got now.


As the member for Higgins pointed out, the trouble is that Labor spent way beyond the hidden amounts in their budgets. They left us with budget booby traps in every cupboard door that we opened in Treasury and Finance. There was $1.2 billion secretly cut from schools. There were projects funded by non-existent mining tax revenue. Labor spent money that they had never earned to the tune of $16 billion—that is $16,000 million of mining tax revenue that never realised anywhere near the amount projected. A virtually broke Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, a really important agency, was left virtually penniless by the federal government. There was no funding for offshore processing, although we heard in question time today of the numbers of projected people who were supposed to come to Australia in the first six months—we have been in government nearly nine months now—but have not come, because our policies are working. They are policies ridiculed by the other side. 


The Minister for Immigration and Border Protection is getting on with the job of stopping the boats, which is also going to help pay down our debt, because we are not spending the amount of money on detention centres—nine of which we have closed—in processing people who arrive unauthorised on our shores. We fixed up depleted Reserve Bank reserves, another problem of Labor's. There are 96 non-enacted tax measures—more hidden costs left by Labor.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (18:00):  To hear the parliamentary secretary speak, you would think there had never been a global financial crisis. You would think that the government had not brought down a budget that increased the deficit relative to the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook. In fact, what we have heard today from the parliamentary secretary is a comparison of the government's budget update with the government's budget rather than the baseline Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook with the budget itself.


I did not hear an answer from the parliamentary secretary to any of my four questions. I know the parliamentary secretary has authored a book called Wild colonial boys: bushrangers in the Riverina—but he really is a bushranger of the Riverina when it comes to answering questions in here: all shooting through and no standing to deliver. 


He did not answer what a numerical forecast would be of a strong surplus, sound economic growth prospects or low unemployment. He also curiously did not attempt to differ from the minister for immigration on the notion that the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook is the baseline. I take it that he agrees with the minister for immigration. He did not disagree with the suggestion that the government has cut $80 billion from schools and education, and he certainly did not suggest that the Queensland budget papers were misleading when they reported a $16 billion cut to hospitals and schools in Queensland.


I want to ask four further questions, and see if the parliamentary secretary might this time turn his mind to answering some of them rather than presenting prepared speeches. Firstly, can the parliamentary secretary confirm that, without amendment,  an error in Appropriation Bill (No. 6) 2013-14 would lead to $972.4 million in funding to the states, territories and local governments in 2013-14 not being legally paid? When did the government find out about this error? Did Finance advise the government of the error? If so, when did it occur? Can the parliamentary secretary advise how the error came about and how a print-production error could cause the error to occur? Can the parliamentary secretary advise when amendments will be tabled to fix the error?


Secondly, can the parliamentary secretary explain why all of the savings in relation to the communications and public affairs functions targeted savings measure have been allocated to Finance in its portfolio budget statement page 20, when the measures in Budget Paper No. 2, page 113, state that the savings are from 'various agencies'? Can the parliamentary secretary advise the House of the split between portfolios of the savings amount, and can the parliamentary secretary advise the House how the savings amounts were calculated?


Thirdly, can the parliamentary secretary advise the House of how many public-office holders in the finance portfolio will be affected by the salary freeze? Can the parliamentary secretary advise who those public-office holders are? Can the parliamentary secretary advise what levels of savings are obtained from the freezing of salaries of public-office holders in the finance portfolio? 


Fourthly, can the parliamentary secretary advise the House the amount of savings obtained through ceasing the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation and winding up the Australian River Co. Limited? Given the proximity of this to the member's electorate, I hope he might turn his mind to answering these four very specific questions.

In the national debate, as in the debate we have in Queensland, you will often find the critics on the other side of the House offer no solutions as to how they would cut spending or, if they will not cut spending, what increases in tax they would burden the Australian public with. There is nothing of that magnitude; nothing of that noise. However, what we will hear is rhetoric and I rise to allay the Australian public's concerns when they hear misleading statements espoused by those from the ALP saying that there have been cuts to education when the reality is that in this budget, education spending will increase.


In Queensland, health spending will increase. Labor uses the opportunity to go into the outward years and say that is where the cuts will be. To understand their capacity to budget and forecast, you could go back and have a look at their track record in forecasting surpluses and deficits. I remind the House that the Labor government was, on average, out by $20 billion. It was not out by a million dollars; it was not out by $20 million; it was not out by $100 million. It was out by $1,000 million dollars multiplied by 20. They were continually out with their forward estimates, so it is a little bit of a long straw to be reaching out into the outward years to try to draw some soft analogy that we are cutting into health and education.


I say to the aged pensioners of Australia that there are absolutely no cuts. There will be two increases per year at the current rate of indexation and it is only after the out years, into 2017, when we will implement the lesser of the indexations.


We have to be the adults in the room. We have to come to this budget—to return to some type of normality—because, speaking as a businessman and as a representative of the people in my electorate, everyone knows what happens if you spend more money than you earn. Everyone knows what that situation looks like; everyone knows where you end up. The banks understand exactly where you end up. We should not drift too far away from those basic fundamentals that we apply in our own households and businesses, but Labor seem to distance themselves from that soft logic. We cannot sustain $1 billion of interest per month on borrowed money to service our debt. That is unsustainable. On the contrary, since we have come to office, we have put an extra 100,000 jobs on. You would hear from the other side of the House that we were the doom-and-gloom party, that everyone was going to lose their job. It is quite the contrary with 100,000 new jobs.


Labor's record of deficit and debt had us on a trajectory of no less than $667 billion dollars of debt. No-one will forget Labor's management of the fiscal economy when they wanted to introduce a mining tax—a mining tax that raised three per cent of its forecast revenue—and then went and spent the money they thought they were going to generate from it, leaving us in a terrible situation. They talk about trying to offer the Australian public some relief from the carbon tax. The instant relief in this budget would be for the ALP to go into the Senate and repeal the carbon tax.


My question to the minister is—



An honourable member interjecting—




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  I have 21 seconds left. Everyone has to do their little bit of heavy lifting. Can the minister explain to the House how as parliamentarians—senators and members in this place—we will play our role in doing the heavy lifting? What impact do gold pass benefits for members and senators have, if the minister could explain?

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (18:09):  I thank the member for Wright. I also thank the shadow minister at the table for his previous questions which I will get to in this answer. The government has made clear that in order to rebuild Australia and to build a strong and resilient economy everybody has to do, as the member for Wright indicated, their share of heavy lifting. The last budget was brought down on 13 May by the Treasurer, who, quite clearly indicated that it was a 'contribute and build budget' and that everybody has to share the burden of the savings which need to be done in order to get our country back on track.


As announced in the 2014-15 budget, there will be a one-year's pay freeze on members of parliament and senior public servants. The Life Gold Pass Scheme is now closed to new senators and members entering parliament and former members who did not previously qualify for a Life Gold Pass who re-entered parliament on or after 6 March 2012. The government announced as part of the budget that, for those who have qualified, the gold pass travel entitlements will be wound back for former and current members of parliament. As part of these reforms, spouses will no longer be eligible for travel and limits will be placed on eligibility and the class and number of trips per annum.


These changes are expected to deliver savings of $5 million over five years. It might not seem much in the context of $667 billion, but if left unchecked and let go and if we just do what Labor did for six years and bring in populist budgets, the costs will add up. But every cent counts and every dollar saved counts towards paying back some of the chaotic debt and deficit that we have inherited. It is a modest but important contribution to the repair task of the budget.


We are also removing the entitled members and senators use of private employment print agencies when recruiting personal and electorate staff. Under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984 parliamentarians can choose to access their printing and communications entitlement to advertise for staff through print media should they wish to do that. These changes build on the changes stated in the government's announcement on 9 November 2013 on a range of reforms to strengthen the rules governing parliamentarians' business expenses and to improve the integrity of the parliamentary entitlements framework. It is all about accountability. It is also worth noting that the base salary for senators and members as at 1 July 2013 is $195,130 per annum, so parliamentarians will also pay the debt levy that is currently in front of the Senate. 


The shadow minister asked me a series of questions earlier. I can tell him that Appropriation Bill (No. 6) provides for a total of just over $972 million in funding in 2013-14 and of this nearly $319 million relates to payments to states, territories and local government. The amendments will enable these payments. Quite correctly, he pointed out that there was an amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 6) 2013-14, circulated earlier today. A schedule was inadvertently omitted from the bill and the government will be moving an amendment at the appropriate point in proceedings to ensure that the schedule appears in the bill as intended. It is expected that that will go before the House this Thursday. The text of the amendment has been circulated and it will be formally moved at the appropriate point in proceedings. 


These things happen. Certainly the previous government inadvertently forgot to mention a whole lot of things, like the fact that they would be imposing a carbon tax, which means a $550 slug to every family. Certainly every business is paying for the carbon tax which the Prime Minister at the time, Julia Gillard, said she would never, ever impose. These things happen. They should not happen but they do. 


The member for Fraser talked about the Albury-Wodonga Corporation. That came in when Gough Whitlam was the Prime Minister and there was great hoopla and fanfare that it was going to end state and federal anomalies, and certainly border anomalies that exist between New South Wales and Victoria. At the time it was a great thing. It certainly boosted regional Australia. The amount the shadow minister asked about has not been quantified. 


But we are not just about building up Albury-Wodonga. We are about building up regional cities, towns and villages right throughout Australia. That is why the member for Mayo in conjunction with the Deputy Prime Minister are getting out there with an infrastructure fund looking at roads, primarily, but also inland rail and a whole host of other measures which are going to make regional Australia strong again. Regional Australia was ignored under six years of Labor, but we are getting on with the job of doing the sorts of things that are going to boost productivity in those areas which grow the food and the fibre for Australians.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (18:14):  The parliamentary secretary is the author of a book called Mud, Sweat and Cheers, and I feel as though we are getting today a little more mud and sweat than cheers. But I give him two cheers for answering two of the eight questions I have asked him so far. Through this process we have learnt that the government is fixing an error—a significant one, nearly a billion dollar error—made during the drafting process. We have also learnt that the government intends to cease the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation and wind up Australian River Co. Limited and yet cannot quantify the savings so gained. It is extraordinary to me that the parliamentary secretary who represents an electorate nearby Albury-Wodonga seems to regard this as an irrelevant matter. He seems to be unconcerned at the government's inability to quantify these savings.


Unfortunately, the first four questions I asked the minister remain unanswered, unaddressed, and as to two questions I asked earlier, it appears the parliamentary secretary does not know how many public office holders in the finance portfolio will be affected by the salary freeze. Extraordinarily, he is unable to advise the House of the split between portfolios of the savings amount relating to communications public affairs functions targeted savings. It is particularly unusual given an amount has been identified for defence.


Let me press on through the mud and the sweat with five additional questions. Can the parliamentary secretary advise the House whether the changes in average staffing levels to the Department of Finance between 2013-14 and 2014-15 as reported in the 2014-15 budget are attributable to machinery of government changes?


Second, can the parliamentary secretary advise the House whether the change in average staffing levels for the Australian Electoral Commission between 2013-14 and 2014-15 as reported in the budget are attributable to staff who had been hired for the 2013 federal election?


Third, can the parliamentary secretary advise the House the reasons for the change in average staffing levels for ComSuper between 2013-14 and 2014-15 as reported in the budget?


Fourth, can the parliamentary secretary advise the House of the proportion of departmental expenses for the Department of Finance that are attributable to staff? Can the parliamentary secretary explain why there is nearly $100 million decrease in departmental expenses for Finance between 2014-15 and 2015-16? 


Fifth, can the parliamentary secretary advise the House whether the Department of Finance is undertaking a spill and fill of all positions where staff could potentially be deemed as excess similar to what is being undertaken in the Department of Communications?

Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (18:17):  I would like to ask the parliamentary secretary a question: Australian taxpayers want to see their hard earned tax dollars used for public good. What is the government doing to promote a more efficient and dynamic public sector?

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015</title>,BILLS,23,1
"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2014-06-16,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (18:18):  Australian taxpayers do need to see that taxpayers' dollars are being spent wisely and that there is for government value for money in every tax dollar spent. In this budget, we made important steps towards improving the efficiency of the public sector by reducing duplication. 


I might just backtrack a little, because I was asked by the member for Higgins earlier about the Asset Recycling Fund. Indeed, it will start on 1 July 2014 as a dedicated vehicle to provide funding and financial incentives to states, territories and other bodies to invest in new productivity enhancing infrastructure, including through the Asset Recycling Initiative. It is getting on with the job of building that important state infrastructure that is so badly needed.


The member for Parkes and I were at Queanbeyan on the weekend and we saw a Queanbeyan bypass initiative announced by the Deputy Premier, Andrew Stoner, the member for Oxley, but in close conjunction with the Deputy Prime Minister and the good Nationals member there, the member for Monaro, John Barilaro. That is an example of federal-state cooperation—getting on with the job of building that infrastructure which is so sorely needed. It would not have happened under Labor, Member for Parkes, and we were there to witness first hand the delight of people in Queanbeyan to that announcement. It certainly would not have happened under the previous member, Steve Whan, but is happening under the current member, John Barilaro.


The Asset Recycling Fund will start from 1 July, with an initial size of about $5.9 billion and with contributions from uncommitted funds currently in the Building Australia Fund and around $2.4 billion in uncommitted funds currently in the Education Investment Fund, which is around $3.5 billion. As the member for Higgins alluded to earlier, that is going to see considerable investment in the states. She certainly wants to see Victoria through all of those important transport grid projects in Melbourne and, certainly, regional Victoria will benefit from the Asset Recycling Fund.


As I mentioned earlier, the government is achieving savings of $43.3 million over four years. The member for Parkes would like to know that we are also realising savings of $19.4 million over the forward estimates by abolishing and merging some small agencies to improve coordination and to increase efficiency. For example, we are merging ComSuper with Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation so that the administration of the Commonwealth superannuation schemes occurs through a single entity. We are also realising the synergies between the activities of the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman and the Commonwealth Ombudsman.


To investigate where else we might be able to realise further efficiencies, the government is developing and implementing a contestability framework over a three-year program of work to review whether government functions should be open to competition, and the appropriate means for this to occur. People who pay taxes want to make sure that their taxes are being used wisely, and want to make sure that they are getting value for money. This work will complement the scoping studies into future ownership operations for four operations announced in the budget, and that goes towards making the sorts of considerable savings that we need to fix up Labor's mess.


I need to answer the shadow minister's questions and, time permitting, I certainly will. For those questions I have not got the time for, I will get back to him on notice. For example, the staffing numbers you have asked for; I will certainly get back to you and provide written advice to that effect. He talked about Mud, sweat and cheers—a publication I indeed authored; and certainly, Australian taxpayers have had to endure more than their share of mud and sweat through the past six years with the previous Labor government. And they were cheering on 7 September when the coalition was returned to government. They were certainly cheering, because they knew that the sensible people were back in charge. They knew that the mature people were in charge: the member for North Sydney was in charge of Treasury; the member for Cook was in charge of immigration and border protection; the member for Wentworth was in charge of communications; and the member for Wide Bay was in charge of regional development, infrastructure, local government—all of those important things that have grassroots people of Australia making sure that their voices are being heard in Canberra, because they were not being heard over the past six years. They were not being delivered upon; like the NBN—with no cost-benefit analysis.


We have had to do some things that have not been widely accepted throughout the nation. One of them was a co-payment of $7 to visit your GP. I know the shadow minister was in favour of that, because—speaking of writing publications—he authored a publication which actually endorsed that view.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2014-06-16,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (18:23):  If the government were confident of its own policy on a Medicare co-payment, they would be focusing a little more on what they said last year, rather than what I said while I was at university. The fact is that every prominent health expert opposes the government's GP tax, as do I.


It has been disappointing to hear the parliamentary secretary, the author of a book called And the big boys fly, flying away from some of the key questions that I have been putting to him this evening. I appreciate the parliamentary secretary's willingness to take on notice a number of the specific questions about staffing, but I was disappointed that he was unable to reassure many of my constituents who work for the Department of Finance that the department is not presently undertaking a spill and fill of all positions. As parliamentary secretary, that is a piece of information that ought to be directly available to him. If he is unable to rule it out, then many of my constituents who work in the Department of Finance will be concerned that just such a spill and fill is taking place. Those of us in this place expect a spill and fill to take place every three years, but my constituents, hardworking public servants serving both sides of politics, should not be treated in such a way.


The parliamentary secretary was also unable to explain why there was a nearly $100 million decrease in departmental expenses for Finance, raising further concerns of a hit to Finance. The parliamentary secretary instead regaled us with tales of his visits to Queanbeyan, concerning me that he thought this was in fact consideration in retail, rather than consideration in detail. But I shall press on and put some further questions to him.


First, can the parliamentary secretary confirm that (a) the capital and earnings of the Asset Recycling Fund will be available for new projects and (b) only the earnings of the Medical Research Future Fund will be available for new projects? Can the parliamentary secretary advise what rate of return has been estimated for both the Asset Recycling Fund and the Medical Research Future Fund?


Second, can the parliamentary secretary advise the House of the amounts over the forward estimates that the Medical Research Future Fund is forecast to hold? Can the parliamentary secretary advise the House of the split between uncommitted funds in the Health and Hospitals Fund and savings from the health budget that make up the investment credits line for the Medical Research Future Fund?


Third, can the parliamentary secretary confirm that projects to be funded out of the Asset Recycling Fund have already been approved? Can the parliamentary secretary confirm that the amounts in earnings in the Asset Recycling Fund are greater than the amount in projects that have already been approved?


Fourth, can the parliamentary secretary advise the House whether the government is actively considering privatisations of the following entities: Snowy Hydro Ltd, the Australian Submarine Corp., Australia Post, Moorebank Intermodal Company Ltd, COMCAR and the Australian Rail Track Corporation Ltd? The potential privatisations of these entities are of great concern to Australians, who are entitled to know whether they are under active consideration by the government.

Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright—Government Whip) (18:27):  Border protection is an issue that is front and centre in the debate nationally. In asking a question on the issues of border protection, I pick up on one of the points that the previous speaker raised in an earlier line of questioning about how many Commonwealth employees and public servants would be affected by the wage freeze. I had the opportunity to read a paper recently, and one of the alarming statistics to come out of the Public Service concerned bracket creep and the number of incremental increases in the middle sector of the Public Service. I know this is not a forum to ask a question of you on this subject, but I want to ask if the member for Fraser has actually received any constituent calls, because I know he is a diligent member for the constituents of Fraser, a large percentage of whom would be public servants. In my electorate, I have a number of people earning over $180,000 and I have not received any calls from those people about having to pay the extra two per cent. I am genuinely interested to know—it is not a political slight or anything—if there is going to be perceived fiscal uncertainty as a result of the wage freeze for the Public Service. In the event that there is, I ask that the member enlighten them as to why these measures have to be taken in the manner that they are, to try and pull back some of the debt and deficit mess, to use the description of the Labor leader.


It is abundantly clear that, as a coalition, we went to the last election stating four key policies, including abolishing the carbon tax. We are in the process of doing that, but we are being hampered in the Senate and we trust that the dynamics of the Senate, as of 1 July, will move to a position where we will be able to fulfil that core commitment. Secondly, we said we would build the infrastructure of the 21st century. Evidence of that is that, in my home state of Queensland, we will be investing $13.4 billion in conjunction with state governments, who will be offered an inducement to sell assets and invest in productivity measures that provide a benefit to the state and, in turn, to the nation.


We gave a commitment to the nation that we would fix the budget. Part of tonight's proceedings is doing exactly that. We are making the tough decisions. They are not popular decisions, but we are making these tough decisions so that the next generation—and my daughter who is 18 is currently studying environmental science in Toowoomba at USQ—do not have to carry the burden of debt and deficit. If the hard decisions are not made by us today, she will inherit that legacy.


Most importantly, we said we would stop the boats, that we would address our border security. There are some enormous savings measures in this budget. This needs to be addressed. Scotty Morrison, the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, has done an outstanding job. There are some fiscal benefits that will flow through with reference to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. There are some provisions that will come to light for the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. Could the parliamentary secretary who is responsible enlighten us how those measures are helping the coalition provide a better future for the nation?

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (18:31):  I thank the member for Wright for his interest in matters pertaining to immigration and border protection and his interest in all matters pertaining to good government, which is what we getting on with the job of doing. Labor's failed border protection policies resulted in more than 55,000 unauthorised boat arrivals in more than 800 boats, causing a blow-out of over $11 billion. Tragically and sadly, they resulted also in the deaths of 1,100 people, who drowned at sea. We have not had a boat arrive for nearly six months now and we have not had a drowning at sea. Each person who came under Labor's watch cost $170,000 to process. That is a huge cost when you are trying to develop infrastructure in, for argument's sake, the electorate of Bendigo, in the electorate of the shadow minister who is at the table or in regional Queensland.


The shadow minister asked me earlier about health costs. Under the coalition, hospital funding for the ACT will increase from $266 million in 2014-15 to $311 million in 2017-18. That is under the coalition government. In 2015-16 funding to the states for hospital services will increase by nine per cent, or $1.4 billion more a year. It will go up by nine per cent the following year and the following financial year. It is a similar story with education. The amount of funding will go up and up.


He talked about Finance ASLs. It is all due to the machinery of government and the deregulation to PM&C. He talked earlier about the AEC. I am going back on some of the things he raised. I can cover in my letter to him the things I am unable to answer—and I will certainly get back to him. The change to the ASL was all due to the election. I am not aware—and this is in response to his previous question—of any plans to do a spill and fill, but difficult times do call for hard decisions. Difficult times call for difficult measures. As I said before and as the member for Wright indicated, we all have to contribute our share to building a better Australia. We all have to contribute our share to help restore confidence in government. We are doing that. We would like to think that Labor will get on board as well.


Investments in the Medical Research Future Fund, which the member for Fraser raised, will be managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians, in accordance with an investment mandate to be issued by the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance, Senator Mathias Cormann. The Medical Research Future Fund, which will build up to a $20 billion pot, will go to, hopefully, finding some answers to some of the questions that have thus far eluded medical researchers. It will provide valuable research and development in finding hopeful cures for many of the illnesses which plague and beset our nation. It will provide valuable medical research into cancer, into dementia and into all sorts of dreadful ailments which affect each and every family.


The establishment of the Medical Research Future Fund will be subject to the passage of health savings legislation, and we do hope that Labor gets on board because they have been so obstructive in so many things. Even their own savings identified before the previous election have been blocked in the Senate by Labor for whatever reason. Five billion dollars worth of their own savings have been blocked by an obstructionist Labor in the Senate. It beggars belief. The HHF—the Health and Hospitals Fund—will cease operation on 31 December 2014. Committed funds from that pool at 31 December this year will be transferred to consolidated revenue, from which the remaining commitments of the Health and Hospitals Fund will be met. I have to say that that Health and Hospitals Fund did provide funding for some valuable projects in the Riverina, and I was certainly appreciative at the time. Wagga Wagga Base Hospital, a new hospital at Griffith and the multipurpose development at Hillston in the west of my electorate certainly benefited from that HHF.


The Medical Research Future Fund is the biggest international future fund of its type, and I know that this needs bipartisan support, because Labor members know of the benefit of valuable medical research. I know the health minister and certainly the Assistant Minister for Health, Senator Fiona Nash, are behind this project because it will provide valuable research into many illnesses. (Time expired)

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (18:36):  I note that the parliamentary secretary has referred to uncommitted funds from the Health and Hospitals Fund being added to the Medical Research Future Fund. I wonder if he might advise the House whether, in the event that the government's $7 GP tax fails to pass the parliament, as appears likely, the entirety of the Medical Research Future Fund will be uncommitted HHF funds. In other words, is the government only prepared to create a Medical Research Future Fund if it can do so by taxing the sick, and is it actually true that the government is unwilling to use a single dollar of general revenue to put into the Medical Research Future Fund? If that is the case—if, indeed, the government's only commitment to medical research depends on taxing the sick—many Australians, I think, will doubt the true commitment of this government to a medical research future fund.


I note that the parliamentary secretary failed to respond to my question as to whether the government is considering privatisations of Snowy Hydro, the Submarine Corporation, Moorebank Intermodal, Australian Rail Track Corporation, COMCAR or Australia Post. I am sure that my constituents—like me—look forward to an answer for that question.


The member for Wright asked me a question. I have to say that if I had to choose two members of the government with whom to have a beer, the member for Wright and the member for Riverina would be high on my list. I have a great individual regard to each of them, albeit that I disagree with much of what they are defending in this budget. The member for Wright asks me whether I have had representations from members of my electorate concerned about the salary freeze. The simple answer is, member for Wright, we do not know enough from the government—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hawke
):  Order! The question is the Appropriations Bill consideration in detail. It is a function of the executive. Remain relevant to the question, please.




Dr LEIGH:
  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. Speaking directly to that expenditure item, my concern is the lack of information forthcoming from the government about the number of public office holders affected by the salary freeze. The parliamentary secretary has failed to demur from the minister for immigration's suggestion that PEFO is when officials tell the truth and that the government's budget should be measured not against its last budget update but against the state of the books when it took office. The parliamentary secretary's failure to differ from the minister for immigration on that suggests that he truly believes that the baseline is the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, and it must therefore follow that this is a government which has made the deficit worse, not better. For all the government's talk of 'debt and deficit disasters', this is really a government which does a great line in alliteration but a terrible line in deficit reduction, and it has in fact increased the deficit, not decreased it.


The income tax levy is just one example of that. Nearly half the revenue in the first year will be lost to a fringe benefits tax loophole. I ask the parliamentary secretary whether the government agrees with recent reports that around half the revenue from the income tax levy will be lost as high-income earners shift income into fringe benefits in order to avoid this tax.

Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright—Government Whip) (18:40):  My question goes to the parliamentary secretary regarding Budget Paper No. 2, page 233, on smaller government, surplus Commonwealth properties and divestiture of some non-defence surplus Commonwealth properties. In my electorate of Wright I am privileged to have the defence training facilities of the Canungra warfare training centre. I am often fortunate to meet ranking officers in the Australian military who at some stage of their illustrious career would have trained at that training centre. When I tell them I am from Beaudesert, they greet me with warmth, because they were hard days when officers were trained in intelligence and warfare in areas that are not that dissimilar to jungle-like warfare. To the northern end of my electorate I border up to Amberley air base and, just to the north-east, I have the Greenbank Army base facility, so I am surrounded by enormous assets in the defence portfolio area. I compliment Defence on the program they have had for divesting themselves of buildings that have asbestos in them to make the area safer for those who occupy the rooms.


I also take the opportunity to acknowledge and thank the minister for the return of the gap-year program, which was a program that was abandoned by the previous government. It was a program that the Defence Force used to offer to year 12 students for 12 months after school where they could do a try-before-you-buy 12 months, touching every part of the Defence Force, to see if a career in the military was for them. Thank you, minister, for returning such a valuable gap-year program.


In addition to that, could you touch on something in the public arena around the Lodge refurbishment. This is in Budget Paper No. 2, also on page 233. There is additional funding going to that. I acknowledge the humbleness of our Prime Minister and the dwellings that he takes up at the moment. It shows the character of the man and shows that what he advocates from a fiscal perspective he actually practices. I am sure he would be complimented by those opposite as well.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (18:44):  I thank the member for Wright for his strong advocacy for the military and certainly for veterans. Investment in defence fell to 1.56 per cent of gross domestic product in 2012-13—the lowest level of defence funding since 1938. We all know what happened in 1939. The 10½ per cent cut in the 2012-13 budget was the biggest since the Korean conflict. I do not think any Labor members could ever come in here and criticise our investment in defence, our commitment to defence, and certainly what we have done in the space of the DFRDB and DFRB indexation for our returned service men and women has certainly been warmly welcomed by those people.


I was asked about the Lodge. The Lodge has national symbolic status and is listed on the Commonwealth Heritage List. Essential work is required at the Lodge to prevent further deterioration of the building fabric and to undertake repairs to wiring and plumbing at the property. The property condition reports identified essential works were required to restore the property's condition to a compliant level to meet Building Code of Australia and work, health and safety obligations. That work is going on. We need to restore the Lodge to its former glory, to its original glory. As the work has progressed, Finance has had the opportunity to identify additional beneficial works which could be undertaken while the property remains vacant. As you say, the current occupier of the position of Prime Minister lives in very humble digs here in Canberra whilst the Lodge refurbishments are taking place. Those refurbishments include works on balcony balustrades to achieve building compliance, and internal and external painting.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr McCORMACK:
  None of the members over the other side calling out will probably ever occupy the Lodge, with any luck. We know that the member for Fraser has designs on the member for Maribyrnong's position at the moment. He could well do a better job but, unlike the member for Grayndler, he may well need the votes of both caucus and the people. He talked about some of the privatisation scuttlebutt that has been going around about Snowy Hydro and Australia Post. That is not on the drawing board at the moment. It has not been flagged by government. It is just media speculation. He also talked about the budget crisis being unreal. Parliament's independent budget adviser rejected claims by Labor and the Greens, and who would ever believe the Greens? The very worst Labor member, I have to say, is better than the best Greens member.



An opposition member interjecting—  




Mr McCORMACK:
  I am not saying the member for Fraser is the worst Labor member by any stretch of the imagination but, certainly, claims that there has been some sort of concocted budget crisis are unfounded. Remarks that effectively endorse government's warnings that, if left unchecked, gross debt would balloon to $667 billion are from no less than the Parliamentary Budget Officer, Phil Bowen, who said it was time to begin the return to surplus to protect the economy against future crises. Of course he is accurate. He told the Australian Financial Review:


It is time to start coming out [of debt and deficit], otherwise the longer you leave it the more exposed you become and the harder it is to wind it back.


It is good advice. Labor members need to get on board with the program that we have got in place, the infrastructure spend that we are doing, the commitment to our veterans and our defence and certainly the spending that we are going to be doing in health and education to get over the next four years, the forward estimates, and get this country back on track.


We need to make sure that this country's credibility is restored. We have to be competitive. We have to give our taxpayers value for their tax dollars. That applies whether you are in Pitt Street or Swanston Street or in regional Australia. I know that the people I represent, the people that the member for Wright and the member for Hughes represent and the people that you, Deputy Speaker Hawke, represent as the member for Mitchell want better value for money. They did not get it in six years of Labor, six years of racking up debt and deficit. But Tony Abbott, Warren Truss and the team are getting on with the job of restoring confidence and restoring respectability and accountability to government.


Proposed expenditure agreed to.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling—Minister for Justice) (16:46):  I am very pleased to be able to make this opening statement. How nice it is to be doing this consideration-in-detail phase of the appropriation bills on this side of the chamber. I must say, when we were in opposition we used to actually turn up for this part of the appropriation bills proceedings. Perhaps we will get sensible questions from the member for Holt and the member for Griffith. But as a shadow minister I used to take these responsibilities very seriously. We would come here for the whole hour and we would arrive here on time. Clearly these are not things that the shadow minister takes that seriously. I would have thought that, with the opportunity to question a government about a budget that they were so excited about, they would take the opportunity to do that. But clearly they do not.


This budget will help build on a more prosperous nation. Fighting and preventing criminal activity is a key priority for the Abbott government, since only safe communities can become strong and prosperous. This budget delivers on a number of our key election commitments. We are ensuring that all proceeds of crime are used to fight crime. We are doing this by reversing the previous Labor government's decision to freeze the $61 million retained in the confiscated assets account. Under this government this money will now be released for community crime prevention initiatives. Under the previous government, of course, they used to use this money to prop up their dodgy budget bottom line. The member for Lilley, who was then Treasurer, used to literally take from criminals to prop up his budget bottom line—rather extraordinary. We will ensure that that money goes to fighting criminals.


Fifty million dollars will be invested to boost the efforts of local communities to address crime and antisocial behaviour through the government's Safer Streets Programme. Eighteen million dollars will be invested in the schools security program to ensure that our children can be educated in a safe and secure environment. For the first time, funding can be used for security guards as well as to install security infrastructure such as CCTV, lighting and fencing in schools. One million dollars will be provided in 2014-15 to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity to expand its oversight to Australia's new border force, and $10.2 million will be invested over three years to establish a Western Australian strike team within the National Anti-gang Squad.


Fifteen million dollars will be provided to states and territories through the National Bushfire Mitigation Programme to implement long-term mitigation strategies and better fuel-reduction programs. This measure will help to make sure Australia is better prepared and can withstand the impacts of natural disasters. Funding will also be provided to work with the United Kingdom government to have Captain Matthew Flinders's original 1804 chart of Australia transferred to Australia on long-term loan. The government has committed $193,000 over two years to fund this project. This chart is literally seen as the birth certificate of the nation and is a very significant part of our history.


This budget is also focused on ensuring that Australians are served by an efficient and effective civil justice framework. Notwithstanding the difficult financial circumstances that have been left to us by the previous government, the Abbott government has kept to a minimum savings sought from the arts sector. Across the forward estimates, total reductions in arts funding have been limited to only 3.1 per cent. Most of those savings come from uncommitted funds or from bringing forward the termination date of programs which were due to terminate during the life of the current parliament in any event. The government has decided to quarantine the 28 major performing arts companies—the great flagship companies which bring the best of classical music, opera, dance and drama to Australians audiences—from any reduction in funding at all. This reflects our commitment to the sector and in particular our commitment to giving audiences the maximum opportunity to enjoy the best of Australian performance art.


Because the government is committed to ensuring that those opportunities extend to Australians who live outside the capital cities, the government has decided to quarantine funding for regional arts from any reduction. As anyone with any knowledge or understanding of the sector is well aware, the arts have done particularly well in this budget, notwithstanding the very difficult choices that we face. 


In this budget we also announced two new arts funding initiatives. Importantly, these measures have also had a positive impact on the budget bottom line. The key measures that we are doing to contribute to budget stability are the amalgamation of key Commonwealth merits review tribunals. This will make it easier to navigate the merits review system by providing an accessible one-stop shop for external merits review. I am happy to go into that at a later stage.

Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (16:51):  It has been a pleasure to hear from the minister about the funding commitments that have been made and the cuts that have been made. There are a number of questions that arise but I would like to start with a very important issue—that is, the effect of the Abbott government funding cuts on access to justice in this country. 


Access to justice is a significant concern for this country. It has been the subject of a number of inquiries and considerations, including most recently a draft report from the Productivity Commission in respect of access to justice, in which the Productivity Commission noted that there are not incentives for lawyers in private practice to engage in systemic advocacy work but that lawyers in community legal centres are uniquely placed to undertake advocacy work in respect of systemic issues. 


Notwithstanding that the Productivity Commission has recognised the importance of policy reform advocacy work for the community as a whole—including in dealing with systemic issues and difficulties arising within the legal system—in MYEFO the Abbott government announced that it would be cutting $43.1 million from legal policy reform and advocacy funding over four years, including cuts to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services and community legal centres. 


The May budget continued that cut, and there has been a great deal of concern from the community and from community legal centres in respect of the effect that is going to have on community legal centres' abilities to engage in problem solving and in advocacy more generally. That then leads to concerns about access to justice, which in turn leads to concern about the administration of justice. 


Is the minister aware that the Human Rights Law Centre Executive Director, Hugh de Kretser, said that the cuts went against the recommendations of repeated parliamentary inquiries that highlighted the chronic underfunding of Aboriginal legal services? 


Is the minister aware that the Australian Council of Social Services urged the federal government to take a cool approach and avoid trying to restore the budget in one hit, saying that the cuts would have little impact on the budget bottom line but a devastating impact on those who need legal assistance? 


What percentage of work do community legal centres do that is defined as so-called legal policy reform and advocacy work? Can you give an example of the policy work that would be the subject of the cuts being made? The cuts to policy reform will practically mean that experts in the field will not provide information to the government; why does the Abbott government want to take away funding that would allow for policy consultation from experts? 


Is the minister aware of the wage disparity between private lawyers and community legal centre lawyers? Who has been consulted in respect of the impact of these cuts on Australians in need, taking into account the fact that community legal centres often provide—with a lot of expertise and on a very slender budget as it is—services to those people who cannot afford private lawyers' fees but equally do not qualify for legal aid assistance, such as people with debt issues, people with family law issues, people suffering family violence and people who are unable to access justice?


Is the minister aware of the concerns that have been raised by the courts in respect of the burden that self-represented litigants place on the courts? Does the minister consider that there will be an increase in the number of self-represented litigants that the courts are expected to handle as a consequence of these cuts to community legal centre funding and services?


Are you aware, Minister, of the comment from the community legal centres' national campaign, Community Law Australia, that as many as one in five people turning to community legal centres for assistance is already being turned away by those community legal centres because of a lack of resourcing? Are you aware as to whether any of the community legal centres whose funding is to be cut had been visited by or on behalf of the government and consulted before these cuts were decided upon? 


Is the minister aware that an independent economic cost-benefit analysis of community legal centres published by the NACLC found that, on average, community legal centres have a cost-benefit ratio of one to 18—that is, for every dollar spent by government on funding CLCs, these services return a benefit to society that is 18 times the cost. To express it in dollar terms, the $47 million spent on the CLC program nationally in 2010 would yield around $846 million in benefit to Australia. Why would the government cut services which provide such benefits to this country? Thank you.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling—Minister for Justice) (16:56):  Firstly, can I say that I appreciate that the member for Griffith has actually turned up. The shadow Attorney-General and the shadow minister for justice are both members of the House of Representatives, yet, astonishingly, they could not even be bothered to come in for this consideration-in-detail stage, which I think is just extraordinary. So I give you points for that at least. I also appreciate that you gave me some very detailed questions. I do not want to disrespect all those questions, so I will say something in a general sense, if you do not mind, and then we can have a look at some of the detail on notice, if you are happy for me to do that.


Can I say in the first instance that we are very committed to making sure that vulnerable Australians do have access to justice. This budget builds on the commitment that we had in previous years when we were in government. The government has renewed its commitment to the ongoing funding of legal aid commissions and will be negotiating with the states and territories to agree on a one-year extension of the National Partnership Agreement on Legal Assistance Services. The agreement provides ongoing Commonwealth funding for legal aid commissions and will be extended by one year, until 30 June 2015. Extending the agreement will have no impact on the budget bottom line, because ongoing funding for legal aid commissions was already published in the forward estimates. The government is considering options for future legal assistance arrangements from 1 July 2015. It will focus on holistic delivery of front-line services to the most vulnerable members of our community, and the Abbott government is strongly committed to that. Extending the agreement will allow time for the government to consider the findings of the Productivity Commission's inquiry into access-to-justice arrangements and the review of the National Partnership Agreement on Legal Assistance Services. This will also provide the government with the opportunity to develop a medium- to long-term approach to ensure equitable and sustainable service delivery.


I appreciate that there were a whole series of very detailed questions in the five minutes that the member for Griffith used. I will endeavour to get her the most sensible responses to some of those questions, if she could just accept my response in general terms for what we are doing in the future, pending the review that the Productivity Commission is undertaking.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2014-06-16,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (16:58):  I have a question to the minister. I first need to provide the minister with a little bit of background in order for him to be able to answer this question. On Friday, I had the opportunity to meet the new principal of the King David School, David Opat. King David is an independent Jewish school in my electorate of Higgins and is one of the many fine independent Jewish schools located in Melbourne. David Opat is taking over from another fine principal, Michele Bernshaw, who served the King David School for more than 14 years and served it so incredibly well. The reason I want to draw the attention of the minister to the King David School, and other independent Jewish schools in the Victorian community and right around Australia, is that, unfortunately, we have seen many acts of graffiti, many acts of violence against property and threatened acts of violence against the person of staff, students and parents of students that attend these schools.


I hate to say it, but even in a great country like Australia there are people who do propagate anti-Semitic thoughts. In fact, I have seen this in my own electorate of Higgins, where there have been unnamed individuals who have distributed brochures supporting the boycotts to business and sanction scheme. Again, I know that it is a scheme that is supported by some members of the trade union movement. I think it is a very anti-Semitic movement and it is one that propagates some pretty unhelpful and inflammatory thoughts against good members of our community and good members of the Jewish community.


The question I have for the minister is: obviously, students have the right to feel safe at school. Parents want to know that when they send their students to school that they are going to be safe, and teachers need to be safe in their workplace. Can the minister explain what the Australian government is doing to secure the safety of students at schools like King David—for example, I know that we made a commitment to the Secure Schools Program—the reasons behind that commitment and how that commitment has in fact extended beyond the previous commitment that we provided as a coalition government when we first got elected in 1996?

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2014-06-16,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling—Minister for Justice) (17:01):  I thank the member for Higgins for that question. I acknowledge that within her electorate she has a very significant Jewish school and also a lot of other significant independent schools, and that she takes the safety of students and the teaching staff there very seriously as does the Abbott government, which is why we have committed to allocate $18 million within this budget for the Secure Schools Program. I am sure the member for Higgins would be interested to note that I have literally just come from a meeting with the Australian Council of Jewish Schools who, obviously, have a very keen interest in making sure that the students who attend the schools that they represent are protected when they go to those places. They are right to believe that the government has a keen interest in ensuring that that is the case.


The security issues that Jewish schools and other independent schools are concerned about are real issues. Sadly, you only need look back at recent history to understand why members of the Jewish community in particular are concerned about the safety of educational institutions that are associated with their community. We have seen some very drastic and terrible examples of that, to a very limited extent in Australia, certainly, but in Europe and other parts of the world we have seen dreadful attacks on Jewish schools. We need to make sure that we in Australia are doing everything we can to make sure that educational institutions that might be targeted or at risk in this way are as difficult and hard to target as is possible. That is why we are allocating this $18 million. Funding will start in the 2014-15 budget to extend the Secure Schools Program, with $6 million available in each of the 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17 years.


For the first time, under this government, the funding, as well as being able to be used for hard capital security infrastructure, will be able to be used for security guards. Schools and students should not be distracted from their studies by the threat of violence because of their race or religion. This program seeks to extend their security infrastructure so that they can enjoy the same schooling experience as any other school.


I know that the member for Higgins is very concerned about the King David School in particular. I am very pleased to have Carmel School in my electorate, which is the Jewish school in Western Australia—and an exceptionally good school it is too, with excellent academic results year after year. I am aware from my contact with the school and with the Perth Hebrew congregation in general that they remain very concerned about their own security. Unfortunately, they have had incidents. They would not be as serious as some other security incidents that have appeared around the globe, but they have certainly given them pause for thought. The government stands with them in doing all that we can to make sure that we are securing Carmel School, the King David School and other independent schools around the country that might require that attention.


I am about to write to state and territory education ministers and the Independent Schools Association, seeking nominations from their jurisdictions for schools which may be eligible for funding. Once we have had these nominations, the candidates will be able to apply for funding grants before being assessed, and the successful applicants will be announced. Clearly, that is going to have to be a competitive program. We are going to make sure that we cover the risks as we assess them, and we will be making sure that that money goes as far as possible to secure the school environment for independent schools that are legitimately concerned about being at risk.


Because the member for Higgins was kind enough to ask that question, I will note that the King David School has already been a successful recipient of funding in previous rounds—almost $1 million under three grants went to the King David School—and I appreciate the contribution that that school does make to her electorate. I look forward to working with Jewish schools but also with other independent schools in being able to announce the successful recipients of the funding program in the 2014-15 financial year.

I was chair of a committee that brought down a finding with respect to data retention. It was a component of the national security legislation. It was a reform that was countenanced in three tranches. We tabled this report in the last sitting week of the 43rd Parliament. I am led to understand that the Attorney-General's Department is looking at the various tranches of legislation as we speak. So my question is to the minister representing the Attorney-General.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling—Minister for Justice) (17:06):  I thank the member for Holt for that question, though I am not sure whether he started there with a barb about my un-inspirational delivery! But I will give him the benefit of the doubt, because that is a sensible question and one which the government is seriously considering. As you appreciate, I am representing the Attorney-General here today, and this matter would fall within his portfolio jurisdiction. But it is something that I take a keen interest in, obviously, as the minister with responsibility for the Australian Federal Police, and the police of course are very concerned about this and have been making representations to the government. He would understand the content of the representations because he would have seen their submissions to his committee. I must say that that committee does do very serious and sensible work, and when that committee makes recommendations to the government we take those recommendations seriously. I understand that the Attorney-General is looking at those recommendations at the moment.


It is very important that we have a regime in Australia which complements our national security and also helps our criminal justice agencies to do their job. I appreciate that, in the environment in which we live at the moment, there is a lot of myth and concern about this idea that somehow the state might be snooping on people. Everything we do in the law and order area and in the national security area when it comes to data retention and communications is to make the Australian people safer, and that is the absolute and primary objective that we will have in responding to his committee's recommendations. We need to look at these things sensibly. What we are doing is important for community safety. I will not pre-empt that response to the committee, and I am not actually privy to that response in totality yet, but we do take the committee's recommendations seriously and we do take the safety of the Australian people seriously.

Mr PASIN
 (Barker) (17:08):  Before I put my question to the minister, I will just give some context. As a representative for regional Australia and regional South Australia in particular, and as someone who represents a large swathe of regional South Australia, the reality is that bushfires are an ever-present danger. Indeed, during the 2014 bushfire season we had no less than six large-scale bushfires raging across Barker, at Eden Valley, Rockleigh, Calperum Station, Ngarkat Conservation Park, Billiat and Tintinara. They burnt out of control between 20 December and 23 January. They burnt 232,000 hectares. They destroyed many significant assets.


I will give some further detail. The Eden Valley fire ignited just after midday on Friday, 17 January. It burnt through almost 25,000 hectares and was not declared as contained until Monday, 20 January, much to the relief of those on the front line and the personnel involved in managing the incident in the fire-affected communities. Just after 5.30 on 17 January, a lightning strike ignited a fire within the Ngarkat Conservation Park, burning some 90,000 hectares. A fire also ignited near Rockleigh, on the Murraylands, just after 3 pm on 14 January. This is the third time communities in the area have been threatened by fire within 12 months. More than 80 CFS firefighters responded. Just after 6 pm, on 14 January, fires ignited in the Margaret Dowling camp site, at Billiat, Katarapko and Kringin, with additional lightning following in the next few days, sparking the Calperum fire, exposing the community of Cooltong to significant danger. My question to the minister is this: given, Minister, what you have just heard about how my local community was so seriously affected by bushfires between December last year and January this year, what budget measures will help us better prepare our communities for bushfire events in the future?

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2014-06-16,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling—Minister for Justice) (17:11):  I thank the member for Barker for that question. It is a very good question and I appreciate that he has had discussions with me in the past about the bushfires that affected his community in January this year. The government is very aware of the toll that bushfires and other natural disasters take on the Australian community. Unfortunately, as we all know too well, bushfires are a harsh reality in Australia, as are other natural disaster events. But every summer we continue to see communities that are devastated by bushfire. We know—and the member for Barker will know—that the impacts of bushfire last well beyond the event itself.


In the budget we announced the National Bushfire Mitigation Program, which will provide $15 million over three years, to help states and territories implement long-term bushfire mitigation strategies and better fuel reduction programs. I acknowledge that everything we do in this area is always done in conjunction with the states and territories, which actually have first responder responsibilities for natural disasters in Australia. As the minister with responsibility for emergency management within the government I have discovered that the Commonwealth in and of itself does not have an enormous amount of hardware to respond to bushfires. We always do what we can with the assistance of the Australian Defence Force but, essentially, it is the responsibility of the states and territories. They do a magnificent job in doing so and the same goes for the way the South Australian government responded to the bushfires in January this year. The National Bushfire Mitigation Program draws on a coalition election commitment. Through this initiative we can help to build stronger communities which are better prepared for when that bushfire threat becomes a reality.


The Abbott government recognises that we have to do something to address the increased toll that natural disasters are taking on Australian communities and businesses. That is why, with the support of all state and territory governments, we have commissioned a Productivity Commission inquiry into natural disaster funding. This inquiry will consider how we can best target our overall disaster funding in a way that better equips our nation for future disasters.


These are just two of the many investments we are making to better prepare the nation for future disasters. We are also providing over $52 million over two years to target natural disaster risk priorities in all states and territories and investing up to $12½ million to address the high cost of strata title insurance in North Queensland. As anyone who spends a little bit of time in the coalition party room will attest—we do not normally talk about party room discussions, but I suspect the member for Leichhardt will not mind—the member for Leichhardt has been talking about this issue ad nauseam for many years. When we were in opposition we were not in a position to do something about it, but the Abbott government has responded to those concerns, which are particularly acute in North Queensland, with this $12½ million, which addresses the high cost of strata title insurance in his area and other parts of Queensland in particular.


I thank the member for Barker for this question. The way the Commonwealth government responds to natural disaster is very important. It costs the Australian taxpayer hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars, depending on how bad any particular disaster season is. This Productivity Commission inquiry is very timely. We will take the recommendations, which I expect to receive by the end of the year, very seriously, and we will look to implement them to make sure the enormous investment the Australian taxpayer is making in making sure Australian communities respond to natural disaster is spent in the most effective possible way. We will take the recommendations that the Productivity Commission makes very seriously and respond appropriately as a government.

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (17:15):  I want to address some questions to the Minister for Justice about section 18C, but first I want to mention the comments that have just been made by the member for Higgins and responded to by the minister in relation to the Secure Schools Program. What was missing from the minister's answer and, indeed, what was missing from what was said by the member for Higgins was any acknowledgement—and one was due—about the fact that there is bipartisan support for the Secure Schools Program and that there was $20 million in the 2008 budget for three years for the Secure Schools Program to fund security works not just in Jewish schools but in schools at risk from racially and religiously motivated violence, which we deplore, not just in Melbourne but throughout Australia. And there was a further $15 million in the 2011 budget over three years, which I had assumed had bipartisan support. The Minister for Justice in talking now is forgetting that for the last six years, supported by our Labor government, there have been works performed at Jewish schools throughout the country and, I might add, at some Muslim schools and, in one case, in a government school in south-west Sydney where security was needed to be enhanced because of religiously or racially motivated violence. Of course, both parties went to the last election very directly supporting an extension of the Secure Schools Program and both parties at the last election supported not just an extension of funding for the Secure Schools Program for capital works but also an extension of funding to cover some recurrent funding for security guards in Jewish schools. I am very pleased to see the program continuing and I would have thought that the minister or perhaps the member for Higgins might have found it in themselves to acknowledge the work done by the Labor government over both of the last terms.


But I wanted to raise with the minister the appalling conduct of both the Attorney-General and the government in general over its proposed repeal of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. It might be that the member for Higgins can speak in this place about her condemnation of anti-Semitism, but it is a pity that her colleagues at the ministerial level—



Mr Keenan interjecting—




Mr DREYFUS:
  I do not think it is a matter for heckling by the Minister for Justice; it is a much more serious matter than that. It is a pity that they have not been able to do anything about the Attorney-General, who thinks it is appropriate to stand up in the Australian Senate and say things like, 'People do have a right to be bigots, you know.'


I wanted particularly to refer to a letter by Moshe Gutnik, the President of the Organisation of Rabbis of Australasia; Yehoram Ulman, the President of the Rabbinical Council of New South Wales; and Meir Shlomo of the Rabbinical Council of Victoria, who thought it was necessary to write to The Australian newspaper last month, pointing out that Tim Wilson, the Human Rights Commissioner appointed by this government, was completely wrong when he suggested that there was any support from any rabbinical organisation in this country for the changes proposed to be made by this government to section 18C. They reminded the people of Australia—and I remind the people of Australia and every member of this parliament—that last month was the month in which Jewish people and others around the world marked Holocaust Remembrance Day. They ended their letter with these words:


None of us dares forget, and Wilson and the government would do well to remember that racist words have evil consequences.


What we are seeing from this government is a gutting of the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act, a removal of the protections that have served Australia well for almost 20 years and its replacement, it would seem, with something that it is now absolutely clear would permit, among other things, all kinds of vile, racist abuse in public and, in particular, Holocaust denial to occur. This government should be ashamed of itself for its conduct in proposing a gutting of these provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act, and the member for Higgins and the Minister for Justice need to be reflecting when they are so quick to say that they condemn anti-Semitism and that they want to do what they can to protect the Jewish schools in the electorate of the member for Higgins, because the two things go together. 


I have a couple of questions for the Minister for Justice: when is the government going to make public the 5,700 submissions that it has received, and when is the government going to announce what it is going to do, which should be to drop its proposal on the Racial Discrimination Act?

It only lasts for an hour, but obviously he has only found time in his busy schedule to join us for half of that. It is true that the Secure Schools Program—



Mr Dreyfus interjecting—




Mr KEENAN:
  And now we are joined by the shadow minister for Justice—how nice that he can join us. He will last 20 minutes of the consideration in detail proposal.



Mr Feeney interjecting—




Mr KEENAN:
  I am sure that when you get up and have your five minutes you can say your piece on this, but I have been in here for the whole hour and I can assure you that I have monitored the movements of both shadow ministers. I was terribly disappointed that they could not be bothered to come and attend consideration in detail up until this point. 


I will go to the point that the shadow Attorney-General has made on the Secure Schools Program. I appreciate that it is a program that also existed under the previous government, and I have no problem whatsoever with acknowledging that. Of course, it might have been nice if he had acknowledged that it was the Howard government that invented this program. Indeed, when I was a backbencher in the Howard government between 2004 and 2007, I worked very hard to make sure that the synagogue that exists within my electorate had appropriate protection, and the federal government joined with the Western Australian state government to ensure that that was the case. So I have got no problem acknowledging that the program existed under the previous government, and I am sure that he will join the love and acknowledge that the program existed under the Howard government also.


As to the references to 18C that the shadow minister has made, firstly I would note that there is no appropriation associated with 18C, and what we are doing here at the moment are the appropriation bills. Section 18C is not an issue that appears within the budget paper—it appears completely extraneously to that—but, because I like him so much, I am going to extend him some latitude to talk about the questions that he has asked me in relation to 18C.


As the member for Higgins has very sensibly reminded me—and the shadow minister is quite right to be passionate about anti-Semitism—I note that the BDS movement that is endorsed by some trade unions around the country is not condemned wholeheartedly by the trade union movement as it should be. Indeed, it is actively supported by some individual trade unions—trade unions which would be constituent members of the Labor Party. Where is the condemnation of those trade unions being associated with a movement that is blatantly anti-Semitic? I appreciate that the shadow minister is passionate about this—and it is right that he should be—but where is the condemnation of the trade union movement endorsing what is an anti-Semitic movement at its core? This feeds to the sort of prejudice that we were talking about, which the Secure Schools Program was designed to address.


On the specifics of the questions that he has asked me about 18C—



Mr Dreyfus interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs Andrews
):  Order! The minister will be heard in silence.




Mr KEENAN:
  At the moment, as the shadow minister would be aware, there has been a very considerable process of public consultation. We have received an enormous amount of submissions. The Attorney-General is currently working through those submissions and will be making some announcements about that in due course. We take the submissions that we have received very seriously—obviously we are interested in the views of the Australian community. I appreciate that the debate around this has been passionate, and there is no problem with people having a bit of passion when it comes to what are very serious issues. We will be methodically and sensibly working through the submissions that we have received, and the Attorney-General will obviously be making some announcements in due course about that.

Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (17:24):  I have a question of the minister. I will preface it with some brief comments. As a result of several visits to the electorate of Forde over the last couple of years the minister would be aware of the wonderful work that Logan City Council has done in conjunction with Queensland Rail and the Queensland Police Service in putting together a CCTV network not only to help reduce the incidence of crime in our community but also provide safer streets on the whole for the local community. I thank the minister and the government for the investment of some $960,000 in CCTV cameras for the electorate of Forde. This has been greatly welcomed by the Logan City Council. It is complemented by an investment of over $1 million by Logan City Council in a new CCTV monitoring room and the upgrade of digital monitoring equipment to better link in with Queensland Police Service and Queensland Rail.


My question to the minister is: what decisions were made in the budget that have allowed the funding of this program through different uses of the proceeds of crime and how does this differ from decisions made by the previous Labor government?

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2014-06-16,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling—Minister for Justice) (17:26):  I thank the member for Forde for his question. I was very pleased to join him over the course of the last few weeks at Logan City Council for some announcements about the expansion of the CCTV network in his electorate of Forde. Logan has a very extensive CCTV network. In fact, it would be one of the most comprehensive networks anywhere in the country. Previous governments, including the Howard government, contributed extensively to that. The Abbott government is very pleased to join the member for Forde in announcing an expansion of that CCTV network. I note that the Mayor of Logan and councillors, from the interaction we had when I visited with the member for Forde, were very grateful for the assistance of the Abbott government under our Safer Streets program. 


In the budget we have delivered on our election commitment, ensuring that all proceeds of crime money is used to fight crime. When the former government was in office, they froze that proceeds of crime money. It had always been expended to the benefit of law enforcement agencies to stop future criminal activity. They froze the confiscated assets account and they used that money to prop up the budget for political reasons. Had this continued, had we not reversed that when we arrived in office, up to $112 million seized from criminals, which we would have collected from their criminal activities, would have been locked in that account by the 2017-18 financial year. We reversed that decision so that proceeds of crime will again be available to fund local crime prevention strategies such as the Safer Streets strategy, which funds the Logan City Council CCTV network in Forde. We are using these funds straight away to address the legacy of underinvestment in crime prevention by the previous government. The previous government has a dreadful record on this—they froze proceeds of crime and they significantly attacked all of our law enforcement agencies. The Australian Crime Commission, in particular, was savaged by the previous government over six years. A third of its personnel and a third of its budget was cut. 


We need to now move on and reinvigorate law enforcement agencies and make sure that proceeds of crime are being used to attack criminal activity—as they always were in the past, until the previous government got so desperate to pretend it had a surplus and subsequently froze that proceeds of crime money. Future decisions on proceeds of crime will be made at my discretion. This is an important step in reducing administrative red tape so that funding can easily flow for what is needed in our communities. We will be looking at making sure our law enforcement agencies are also getting a fair share of that funding to do their very important work, after six years of underinvestment and budget cuts from previous governments. It has always been the Abbott government's intention that proceeds of crime be returned to the community so that the crimes of yesterday will be used to prevent the crimes of tomorrow. Projects will be funded to support crime prevention and law enforcement initiatives, including Safer Streets, as the member for Forde alluded to.


How fortuitous, the member for Swan and the member for Lindsay are also getting funding under the Safer Streets program, as well as the member for Higgins. I have been to all of your electorates and I am looking forward to coming to the member for Higgins' electorate to make an announcement about the Safer Streets funding that we will be deploying in Higgins. This money has also been used to fund such things as the establishment of the national Anti-Gangs Squad team in Western Australia. We will be using over $10 million of the proceeds of crime funding so that a number of AFP officers and other federal law enforcement officers, including an officer from the Australian tax office, will be embedded in the Western Australia Police force, within their Anti-Gangs Squad, to work constructively to make sure that they are doing all they can in the national fight against organised crime and, in particular, of course, outlaw motorcycle gangs that have been the focus of the Western Australia Police attention until this point.


I thank the member for Forde for that question. I appreciate his ongoing interest in community safety within his electorate.

Mr FEENEY
 (Batman) (17:31):  Minister, my questions go to the selection process and eligibility for the Safer Streets program. As you would be aware, the target group for funding under the first funding round for the Safer Streets program were those organisations identified before October 2013. That is to say that some $19.3 million was set aside by you and allocated for projects, but only able to go to those organisations identified by you before October 2013. Those organisations identified by you have since been invited by you to apply for funding under the Safer Streets program by the Abbott government. As a consequence, organisations that were not hand-picked by you prior to October 2013, including those that had already been approved for funding under the former NCPF program, were barred from applying.


My question to you is: what did the selection process for identifying these organisations involve? What were the selection criteria used to identify successful and unsuitable organisations? Who identified the organisations to receive the funding? How did the selectors gain access to these organisations and determine they were suitable for the program? How were these organisations identified? Who identified them? Who reviewed these applications? When did the selection process commence? How long after the selection process began were successful organisations identified? When were the organisations informed that they had been chosen as funding recipients? Was there any consideration made for organisations that had been approved for funding under the previous NCPF? Given that successful organisations were hand-picked by you prior to the 2013 election, how did you assure that there was political neutrality? What processes were put in place to ensure an unbiased selection process?


Minister, I am very keen for you to enlighten us on these important issues. I note, with time being difficult, that on 16 June 2010, in proud, fine words in this place you said:


Surely for ministers of the Crown it is not that difficult to come in here and answer questions for 35 minutes on areas within their portfolio without going through this ludicrous parody of government members getting up and asking dorothy dixer questions and the minister then reading a prepared answer.


It is sad to see those fine sentiments turn to dust now that you are in office, but, having concluded your dorothy dixers—




Mr KEENAN:

Mr FEENEY:
  Mercifully, Hansard records your fine sentiments, Minister, and mercifully Hansard can shine a light on your hypocrisy. Having wandered your way through those time-wasting dorothy dixers, tell us about the selection process and tell us about how you selected those organisations before October 2013. Tell us how it is you assured that the government process would remain politically neutral?

It is very difficult for me to respond to the opposition if they do not come into the chamber and ask me questions. One hour is allocated every year for budget consideration in detail, yet the shadow minister has come in here after 40 minutes has expired and asks me why it is that I had to respond to questions from members who actually were here in the chamber. Quite remarkable! But I do admire his sense of humour, if nothing else. 



Honourable members interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs Andrews

Mr KEENAN:
  The shadow minister was very keen for me to enlighten him—and of course I am very keen to enlighten the shadow minister whenever I get the opportunity to do so. I would like to give him a bit of history about proceeds of crime in Australia and how it came to pass that we committed those proceeds of crime to the Safer Streets Program. Governments of all persuasions, up until the advent of the Gillard-Rudd era, had spent proceeds of crime money on fighting crime. It stands to reason that, if you are going to take money from criminals, you would subsequently reinvest those funds—




Mr Feeney:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I have a point of order on relevance. I did not ask for a history lesson. Can he please answer the questions that have been asked of him?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I ask the minister to be relevant to the questions.




Mr KEENAN:
  I very keen to be as helpful as I possibly can be for the shadow minister. I am not sure if he is aware of the background. This background is vitally important to understanding what has gone on in this process. It is important to understand because governments of all persuasions have spent proceeds of crime money on fighting crime. This happened under the previous Howard government and it happened for the first few years of the Rudd government until the government got so desperate with their out-of-control spending that they looked for any pockets of money they could use to prop up the budget and pretend that they were running a better budget bottom line than they were. They froze the proceeds of crime and said: 'This money we have taken from criminals is now going to be used against the member for Lilley's dodgy figures to pretend that the budget is in better shape than it is.' This is what happened and it was a shameful thing. 


Money that should have been used to fight criminal activity was actually used to prop up their dodgy bottom line. I think that is shameful. When we were in opposition we decided that that was a very bad decision. It was a bad decision for law enforcement and it was a bad decision for communities where that money could have been spent. So we said in 2012: 'We are not going to accept this. We will unfreeze proceeds of crime and will reinvest it in community projects all around Australia that make our streets safer.' Subsequent to that I spent a lot of time talking to communities about what their priorities might be. We spent a lot of time going around Australia talking to local members and community groups about what their priorities might be. We subsequently made a series of commitments at the election that we of course will keep. Like all of the Abbott government's commitments, we are going to make sure that they are kept. We made promises to communities, such as the communities in Swan, Lindsay and Higgins, and said that we would stand with them and fund community safety initiatives that they believe are going to be useful to combat crime within their local area. 


That is the right thing to do, as opposed to what the Labor government were proposing to do with the proceeds of crime. They were going to sit on the money and use it to prop up their dodgy budget so they could pretend their budget was in better shape than it was after their years of excessive spending. If we had not come in and made the very important decisions that we made to unfreeze the proceeds, then there would have been $112 million accumulated within that fund up until the 2017-18 financial year. 


The Labor Party spent outrageously in government. They went around looking for whatever pots of money they could use. They froze proceeds of crime money—money that would have been better spent within the community, money that would have been better spent on law enforcement all around Australia and money that we will reinvest in making sure that criminals all around the country find it harder to commit their foul deeds.

Anytime you want to come to Swan, Member for Batman, you can. You can talk to the people of my electorate about the crime issues that we face. But, as of yet, I have not seen anyone from the Labor Party come to Swan to talk about crime issues since the election.



Mr Feeney interjecting—




Mr IRONS:
  You had your turn. Just sit down now and listen. I would like to give the minister a bit of background on crime in my electorate. As you would understand, being a Western Australian, there is what is called the crime corridor in the south-eastern part of Perth, which takes in my electorate, Hasluck and parts of Canning. We have had issues with serious crime such as violence on our streets. I went out with a police patrol late at night and they were telling me about a situation where they arrived at the Burswood train station to find that one of the youths there had had half his face ripped off. That was typical of the crime in some of the areas in my electorate.


We conducted some local action campaigns through the community and one of them was at the Lynwood Village Shopping Centre, where they were experiencing a lot of issues with crime in the car parks and people being threatened. With support from the City of Canning and the support of the local shopkeepers, security improvements were made through extra security guards and some CCTV camera installations. This was funded not only by the City of Canning but also by the owners of the shopping centre. Also, in an area in east Lynwood, as a crime prevention measure there were improvements to street lighting. Again, the City of Canning came to the party. We met on site with Linton Reynolds, whom you may know, and also the CEO of the City of Canning. Further to that, there were improvements in street lighting in that particular area.


I was operating a mobile office at the Carousel shopping centre and, after complaints were made at the mobile electorate office, information was given to us and forwarded to the police, who, within seven days, managed to shut down a drug house that was operating within about 500 metres of the shopping centre. In another two instances, in South Perth and St James, we have managed to have two other drug houses shut down with the assistance of police and information provided by the local community. So there is a real willingness and appetite among the local community to get involved and support reducing the crime problems that we face in Swan. We also had some instances of crime at the Carson Street school in East Victoria Park. Again, through my efforts and those of the local community, we managed to get the school to have some extra security fencing put up, which has helped address their crime prevention issues down there.


Also, we have seen security improvements to the Red Castle hotel site in Lathlain, just near the Burswood station. There were some issues with drugs, some dealers and the Red Castle hotel, which had been left destitute and in isolation and experienced a fire. With help from the Victoria Park council and support from the police, we managed to have some hotel fencing put in and patrols for that area were stepped up as well.


As you previously mentioned, you came to my electorate recently, about 2½ weeks ago, to continue the good work that has been done with the CCTV rollout, particularly in the city of Belmont and in Rivervale and Kewdale. It was great that you could come that day, meet with the PCYC and with a shopkeeper who had just experienced a robbery attempt on his shop, and announce a $100,000 commitment to the rollout of further CCTV around the Belmont Forum Shopping Centre.


Based on that information, can you explain the difference between the former government's National Crime Prevention Fund and the coalition government's Safer Streets Program? Also, is it incorrect for Labor members to be saying that funding has been cut in crime prevention?

First, I refer to the government's fiscal strategy as outlined on page 3-7 of Budget Paper No. 1. Can the parliamentary secretary explain how you would quantify (a) a strong surplus, (b) sound economic growth prospects and (c) low unemployment? Can the parliamentary secretary put a number on those three criteria? Second, does the parliamentary secretary agree with the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection when he told the House on 3 June 2014:


If I go back to the PEFO—as we know, the PEFO is where the officials tell the truth about what the budget really is from the previous government. From the previous Government, that's what it does.


Third, can the parliamentary secretary confirm that the government's own budget documents, page 7 of the budget overview, confirm that funding to schools and hospitals will be $80 billion less than under previous arrangements? Parliamentary Secretary, is this not an $80 billion cut? Fourth, can the parliamentary secretary confirm to the House that this government's $80 billion cuts to hospitals and schools have led to a $16 billion cut to hospitals and schools in Queensland? If not, is the parliamentary secretary saying that the Queensland budget papers are misleading?

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (17:47):  I might begin by talking about the Finance portfolio and the government's budget measures therein, and then I will answer the shadow minister's questions. Some of the answers are contained in this introduction. Without reining in spending now and in the future the budget would have remained in deficit for at least the next decade, and I am sure that the shadow minister would agree that that is the case. Leaving future generations to shoulder the burden of our spending decisions, as well as cope with the impact of an ageing population, is just not fair. It is not fair on current taxpayers and it is certainly not going to be fair on future generations. We need to start paying our way so that those future generations are able to enjoy the standard of living that we now take for granted. 


With this budget, the government has made significant steps towards reducing the huge deficit left to us by Labor. The budget represents an overall $43.8 billion improvement in the budget bottom line at the 2013-14 MYEFO in the four years to 2017-18. It places spending on a manageable trajectory and provides a credible path back to surplus—and we all want that. With this budget, by the end of the decade Commonwealth debt is projected to be $389 billion—still a large sum but a significantly reduced amount on the $667 billion debt which we were projected to reach had we not taken any action. In this budget, we have taken important steps towards improving the efficiency of the public sector by reducing duplication. The savings realised through more efficient government operations will be redirected to repair the budget and to fund policy priorities. For example, the government will achieve savings of $43.3 million, over four years, by moving to more efficient practices for public affairs and internal communications for Australian government agencies. To investigate where else we might be able to realise further efficiencies, the government is developing and implementing a contestability framework over a three-year program of work to review whether government functions should be open to competition and the appropriate means for this to occur. This work will complement the scoping study into future ownership options for four operations announced in the budget. The government will provide $11.7 million in 2014 for scoping studies into the future of Australian Hearing, Defence Housing Australia, the Royal Australian Mint and the registry function of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.


We are also getting our house in order by embarking on the progressive sale of non-defence Commonwealth properties surplus to requirements. The Commonwealth owns a number of properties which reflect historical rather than current or projected future needs. The first tranche of properties will include around 40 surplus non-defence Commonwealth properties, including vacant blocks and facilities which are no longer in use. The details of specific properties to be offered for sale will be released over time as part of a coordinated sale process. The first tranche is expected to deliver savings to the budget of $22½ million over the forward estimates. Finance has been provided with a modest amount of funding to meet the costs of engaging private sector experts to support the sale process.


In the digital age, information technology plays a pivotal central role in how agencies undertake analysis, collect information and deliver services. The budget provides a modest amount of funding for Finance to perform gateway reviews which will provide quality assurance for three significant major capital projects: for the Bureau of Meteorology's replacement of its existing supercomputer, which is used for the bureau's weather forecasts and warnings across Australia and will reach its expected end of life in mid-2016; for the Department of Social Services to develop a second-pass business case to further scope options to replace its grants management platform with a more flexible and integrated system; and for the Immigration and Border Protection portfolio to strengthen and enhance Australia's border protection services.


We inherited a mess, and the shadow minister asks about health and education spending going forward. We are certainly committed to the four years of the forward estimates and we are going to actually increase what Labor would have done for both health and education in those very important portfolio areas. We did not commit to anything further beyond that. Labor made promises they knew they would never have to keep. They made those promises for the out years, years five and six, knowing full well that we had a debt and deficit crisis. They knew full well that they would not have to deliver on those promises. They made agreements in the education sphere without Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory coming on board. We are a Commonwealth government; we make decisions based on good national priorities. When you do not have all states and territories signed up to a Commonwealth deal it just does not make sense.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2014-06-16,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (17:52):  In this appropriation discussion and debate, I think it is important to understand the context in which the government has made its decisions and my question does go to that. But, first, I want to remind the minister that when we came into government in 1996 we inherited a situation where we had to pay back $96 billion of Labor's debt, which we did over about a 10-year period. Not only did we do that during the previous coalition government period, but we also provided for the future by putting more than $45 billion into the Future Fund and also putting moneys into other such funds. More than $6 billion went into the Higher Education Endowment Fund, which I note was raided by the Labor Party when it came into government. That is why we need to make higher education reforms, which we are doing in the upcoming budget.


The situation we have inherited coming into government, as I understand it, is that we have significant debt, with gross debt heading up to more than $665 billion if we were to make no change in the current budget. We are paying interest bills of around $12 billion today, which is about how much we currently spend on schools—that is, the Commonwealth contribution right here, right now, to schools—and, again, if nothing were to be changed it would go up to more than $35 billion in interest alone. 


We saw under the Howard government multifactor productivity on average increase by about 0.7 per year during those years. We saw under the previous Labor government that multifactor productivity actually decreased by 0.7 per year on average. In this budget, because of the decisions that have been made in the appropriations, we are able to make investments in such things as productivity enhancing infrastructure. If we were to continue on a path of debt as a result of deficit after deficit being delivered, which is what the Labor Party delivered during their six years of government, we would have to pay interest bills that would mean we would not be able to make investments in productivity enhancing infrastructure.


Could the minister enlighten the House on the investments that we are going to be making in infrastructure as a result of the fact that we have made these appropriations measures? I am particularly interested in my home state of Victoria. I know that we have made a broader announcement of more than $50 billion of investment over a seven-year period, but, in Victoria, I understand that we are going to make investments of around $7.6 billion, $3 billion of which is going into the East West Link, which will have a huge impact on productivity in my home state of Victoria. I would like the minister, if he might, to also talk about the asset recycling program, which will be able leverage up the investment that we are making with the state governments so that we can ensure that we can be on a path to prosperity and growth in our country, rather than a path of ruin and debt.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2014-06-16,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (17:55):  The member for Higgins fully understands and appreciates the mess that we have inherited after six years of chaos. Labor left Australia with a broken budget, a damaged economy and a serious mess to fix, and I know that this was no more better demonstrated than in the state of Victoria, where we have got transport systems and infrastructure chaos needing to be repaired, and we are getting on with the job. 


When the Prime Minister was elected he said he wanted to be the infrastructure Prime Minister. I know that he also stated, quite clearly and quite categorically, that we were once again open for business. He and the trade minister have led important delegations and taken a lot of Victorian business people with them to open up preferential trade agreements with both Korea and Japan, which will mean considerable investments for Victoria into the future and getting on with the job of improving those key transport areas in Melbourne. Regional Victoria will follow, and, as the member for Higgins pointed out, it will lead to improved and bolstered productivity.


When Labor came to office, as we heard the member for Higgins say—and she would know, as she worked for Peter Costello, one of the great Treasurers of this nation—they inherited a surplus of $20 billion with no net debt and $45 billion in the bank. Between 2008-09 and 2012-13, Labor delivered deficits totalling $191 billion. Labor left additional project deficits of $123 billion over the next four years—so that is going up to 2016-17. As the member for Higgins pointed out, we are paying at the moment $12 billion of debt annually thanks to Labor's mess. That equates to $1 billion a month—you could build a lot of roads, rail infrastructure, schools or hospitals with that $1 billion each and every month that we are paying down. 


The Deputy Prime Minister—the Minister for Infrastructure—has correctly pointed out that, if left unchecked, that is going to be $3 billion per month of money that we will not have to invest in Melbourne or regional Victoria. We have got to pay down that debt so that we can then get on with the job of building the important infrastructure not just for Victoria, New South Wales or the ACT—which the shadow minister proudly represents—but indeed for all of Australia. We do need to have productivity-building infrastructure. The Abbott-Truss government has reduced Labor's deficits by $43.8 billion through to 2017-18. Gross government debt is also forecast to be $389 billion in 2023-24, compared with $667 billion that Labor left us. Certainly, if we do not do something, our future generations are going to inherit a far worse mess than what we have got now.


As the member for Higgins pointed out, the trouble is that Labor spent way beyond the hidden amounts in their budgets. They left us with budget booby traps in every cupboard door that we opened in Treasury and Finance. There was $1.2 billion secretly cut from schools. There were projects funded by non-existent mining tax revenue. Labor spent money that they had never earned to the tune of $16 billion—that is $16,000 million of mining tax revenue that never realised anywhere near the amount projected. A virtually broke Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, a really important agency, was left virtually penniless by the federal government. There was no funding for offshore processing, although we heard in question time today of the numbers of projected people who were supposed to come to Australia in the first six months—we have been in government nearly nine months now—but have not come, because our policies are working. They are policies ridiculed by the other side. 


The Minister for Immigration and Border Protection is getting on with the job of stopping the boats, which is also going to help pay down our debt, because we are not spending the amount of money on detention centres—nine of which we have closed—in processing people who arrive unauthorised on our shores. We fixed up depleted Reserve Bank reserves, another problem of Labor's. There are 96 non-enacted tax measures—more hidden costs left by Labor.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (18:00):  To hear the parliamentary secretary speak, you would think there had never been a global financial crisis. You would think that the government had not brought down a budget that increased the deficit relative to the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook. In fact, what we have heard today from the parliamentary secretary is a comparison of the government's budget update with the government's budget rather than the baseline Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook with the budget itself.


I did not hear an answer from the parliamentary secretary to any of my four questions. I know the parliamentary secretary has authored a book called Wild colonial boys: bushrangers in the Riverina—but he really is a bushranger of the Riverina when it comes to answering questions in here: all shooting through and no standing to deliver. 


He did not answer what a numerical forecast would be of a strong surplus, sound economic growth prospects or low unemployment. He also curiously did not attempt to differ from the minister for immigration on the notion that the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook is the baseline. I take it that he agrees with the minister for immigration. He did not disagree with the suggestion that the government has cut $80 billion from schools and education, and he certainly did not suggest that the Queensland budget papers were misleading when they reported a $16 billion cut to hospitals and schools in Queensland.


I want to ask four further questions, and see if the parliamentary secretary might this time turn his mind to answering some of them rather than presenting prepared speeches. Firstly, can the parliamentary secretary confirm that, without amendment,  an error in Appropriation Bill (No. 6) 2013-14 would lead to $972.4 million in funding to the states, territories and local governments in 2013-14 not being legally paid? When did the government find out about this error? Did Finance advise the government of the error? If so, when did it occur? Can the parliamentary secretary advise how the error came about and how a print-production error could cause the error to occur? Can the parliamentary secretary advise when amendments will be tabled to fix the error?


Secondly, can the parliamentary secretary explain why all of the savings in relation to the communications and public affairs functions targeted savings measure have been allocated to Finance in its portfolio budget statement page 20, when the measures in Budget Paper No. 2, page 113, state that the savings are from 'various agencies'? Can the parliamentary secretary advise the House of the split between portfolios of the savings amount, and can the parliamentary secretary advise the House how the savings amounts were calculated?


Thirdly, can the parliamentary secretary advise the House of how many public-office holders in the finance portfolio will be affected by the salary freeze? Can the parliamentary secretary advise who those public-office holders are? Can the parliamentary secretary advise what levels of savings are obtained from the freezing of salaries of public-office holders in the finance portfolio? 


Fourthly, can the parliamentary secretary advise the House the amount of savings obtained through ceasing the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation and winding up the Australian River Co. Limited? Given the proximity of this to the member's electorate, I hope he might turn his mind to answering these four very specific questions.

Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright—Government Whip) (18:04):  I rise here to support the minister in this appropriation deliberation. I bring to everyone's attention the fact that, once again, we have inherited a Labor mess. Whether it be at a federal level or in my home state of Queensland, where the LNP inherited an $89 billion debt which was incurred by an outgoing Labor government, it is an atrocious record that we, as a coalition, inherit.


In the national debate, as in the debate we have in Queensland, you will often find the critics on the other side of the House offer no solutions as to how they would cut spending or, if they will not cut spending, what increases in tax they would burden the Australian public with. There is nothing of that magnitude; nothing of that noise. However, what we will hear is rhetoric and I rise to allay the Australian public's concerns when they hear misleading statements espoused by those from the ALP saying that there have been cuts to education when the reality is that in this budget, education spending will increase.


In Queensland, health spending will increase. Labor uses the opportunity to go into the outward years and say that is where the cuts will be. To understand their capacity to budget and forecast, you could go back and have a look at their track record in forecasting surpluses and deficits. I remind the House that the Labor government was, on average, out by $20 billion. It was not out by a million dollars; it was not out by $20 million; it was not out by $100 million. It was out by $1,000 million dollars multiplied by 20. They were continually out with their forward estimates, so it is a little bit of a long straw to be reaching out into the outward years to try to draw some soft analogy that we are cutting into health and education.


I say to the aged pensioners of Australia that there are absolutely no cuts. There will be two increases per year at the current rate of indexation and it is only after the out years, into 2017, when we will implement the lesser of the indexations.


We have to be the adults in the room. We have to come to this budget—to return to some type of normality—because, speaking as a businessman and as a representative of the people in my electorate, everyone knows what happens if you spend more money than you earn. Everyone knows what that situation looks like; everyone knows where you end up. The banks understand exactly where you end up. We should not drift too far away from those basic fundamentals that we apply in our own households and businesses, but Labor seem to distance themselves from that soft logic. We cannot sustain $1 billion of interest per month on borrowed money to service our debt. That is unsustainable. On the contrary, since we have come to office, we have put an extra 100,000 jobs on. You would hear from the other side of the House that we were the doom-and-gloom party, that everyone was going to lose their job. It is quite the contrary with 100,000 new jobs.


Labor's record of deficit and debt had us on a trajectory of no less than $667 billion dollars of debt. No-one will forget Labor's management of the fiscal economy when they wanted to introduce a mining tax—a mining tax that raised three per cent of its forecast revenue—and then went and spent the money they thought they were going to generate from it, leaving us in a terrible situation. They talk about trying to offer the Australian public some relief from the carbon tax. The instant relief in this budget would be for the ALP to go into the Senate and repeal the carbon tax.


My question to the minister is—



An honourable member interjecting—




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  I have 21 seconds left. Everyone has to do their little bit of heavy lifting. Can the minister explain to the House how as parliamentarians—senators and members in this place—we will play our role in doing the heavy lifting? What impact do gold pass benefits for members and senators have, if the minister could explain?

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2014-06-16,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (18:09):  I thank the member for Wright. I also thank the shadow minister at the table for his previous questions which I will get to in this answer. The government has made clear that in order to rebuild Australia and to build a strong and resilient economy everybody has to do, as the member for Wright indicated, their share of heavy lifting. The last budget was brought down on 13 May by the Treasurer, who, quite clearly indicated that it was a 'contribute and build budget' and that everybody has to share the burden of the savings which need to be done in order to get our country back on track.


As announced in the 2014-15 budget, there will be a one-year's pay freeze on members of parliament and senior public servants. The Life Gold Pass Scheme is now closed to new senators and members entering parliament and former members who did not previously qualify for a Life Gold Pass who re-entered parliament on or after 6 March 2012. The government announced as part of the budget that, for those who have qualified, the gold pass travel entitlements will be wound back for former and current members of parliament. As part of these reforms, spouses will no longer be eligible for travel and limits will be placed on eligibility and the class and number of trips per annum.


These changes are expected to deliver savings of $5 million over five years. It might not seem much in the context of $667 billion, but if left unchecked and let go and if we just do what Labor did for six years and bring in populist budgets, the costs will add up. But every cent counts and every dollar saved counts towards paying back some of the chaotic debt and deficit that we have inherited. It is a modest but important contribution to the repair task of the budget.


We are also removing the entitled members and senators use of private employment print agencies when recruiting personal and electorate staff. Under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984 parliamentarians can choose to access their printing and communications entitlement to advertise for staff through print media should they wish to do that. These changes build on the changes stated in the government's announcement on 9 November 2013 on a range of reforms to strengthen the rules governing parliamentarians' business expenses and to improve the integrity of the parliamentary entitlements framework. It is all about accountability. It is also worth noting that the base salary for senators and members as at 1 July 2013 is $195,130 per annum, so parliamentarians will also pay the debt levy that is currently in front of the Senate. 


The shadow minister asked me a series of questions earlier. I can tell him that Appropriation Bill (No. 6) provides for a total of just over $972 million in funding in 2013-14 and of this nearly $319 million relates to payments to states, territories and local government. The amendments will enable these payments. Quite correctly, he pointed out that there was an amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 6) 2013-14, circulated earlier today. A schedule was inadvertently omitted from the bill and the government will be moving an amendment at the appropriate point in proceedings to ensure that the schedule appears in the bill as intended. It is expected that that will go before the House this Thursday. The text of the amendment has been circulated and it will be formally moved at the appropriate point in proceedings. 


These things happen. Certainly the previous government inadvertently forgot to mention a whole lot of things, like the fact that they would be imposing a carbon tax, which means a $550 slug to every family. Certainly every business is paying for the carbon tax which the Prime Minister at the time, Julia Gillard, said she would never, ever impose. These things happen. They should not happen but they do. 


The member for Fraser talked about the Albury-Wodonga Corporation. That came in when Gough Whitlam was the Prime Minister and there was great hoopla and fanfare that it was going to end state and federal anomalies, and certainly border anomalies that exist between New South Wales and Victoria. At the time it was a great thing. It certainly boosted regional Australia. The amount the shadow minister asked about has not been quantified. 


But we are not just about building up Albury-Wodonga. We are about building up regional cities, towns and villages right throughout Australia. That is why the member for Mayo in conjunction with the Deputy Prime Minister are getting out there with an infrastructure fund looking at roads, primarily, but also inland rail and a whole host of other measures which are going to make regional Australia strong again. Regional Australia was ignored under six years of Labor, but we are getting on with the job of doing the sorts of things that are going to boost productivity in those areas which grow the food and the fibre for Australians.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (18:14):  The parliamentary secretary is the author of a book called Mud, Sweat and Cheers, and I feel as though we are getting today a little more mud and sweat than cheers. But I give him two cheers for answering two of the eight questions I have asked him so far. Through this process we have learnt that the government is fixing an error—a significant one, nearly a billion dollar error—made during the drafting process. We have also learnt that the government intends to cease the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation and wind up Australian River Co. Limited and yet cannot quantify the savings so gained. It is extraordinary to me that the parliamentary secretary who represents an electorate nearby Albury-Wodonga seems to regard this as an irrelevant matter. He seems to be unconcerned at the government's inability to quantify these savings.


Unfortunately, the first four questions I asked the minister remain unanswered, unaddressed, and as to two questions I asked earlier, it appears the parliamentary secretary does not know how many public office holders in the finance portfolio will be affected by the salary freeze. Extraordinarily, he is unable to advise the House of the split between portfolios of the savings amount relating to communications public affairs functions targeted savings. It is particularly unusual given an amount has been identified for defence.


Let me press on through the mud and the sweat with five additional questions. Can the parliamentary secretary advise the House whether the changes in average staffing levels to the Department of Finance between 2013-14 and 2014-15 as reported in the 2014-15 budget are attributable to machinery of government changes?


Second, can the parliamentary secretary advise the House whether the change in average staffing levels for the Australian Electoral Commission between 2013-14 and 2014-15 as reported in the budget are attributable to staff who had been hired for the 2013 federal election?


Third, can the parliamentary secretary advise the House the reasons for the change in average staffing levels for ComSuper between 2013-14 and 2014-15 as reported in the budget?


Fourth, can the parliamentary secretary advise the House of the proportion of departmental expenses for the Department of Finance that are attributable to staff? Can the parliamentary secretary explain why there is nearly $100 million decrease in departmental expenses for Finance between 2014-15 and 2015-16? 


Fifth, can the parliamentary secretary advise the House whether the Department of Finance is undertaking a spill and fill of all positions where staff could potentially be deemed as excess similar to what is being undertaken in the Department of Communications?

Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (18:17):  I would like to ask the parliamentary secretary a question: Australian taxpayers want to see their hard earned tax dollars used for public good. What is the government doing to promote a more efficient and dynamic public sector?

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,BILLS,23,2
"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2014-06-16,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (18:18):  Australian taxpayers do need to see that taxpayers' dollars are being spent wisely and that there is for government value for money in every tax dollar spent. In this budget, we made important steps towards improving the efficiency of the public sector by reducing duplication. 


I might just backtrack a little, because I was asked by the member for Higgins earlier about the Asset Recycling Fund. Indeed, it will start on 1 July 2014 as a dedicated vehicle to provide funding and financial incentives to states, territories and other bodies to invest in new productivity enhancing infrastructure, including through the Asset Recycling Initiative. It is getting on with the job of building that important state infrastructure that is so badly needed.


The member for Parkes and I were at Queanbeyan on the weekend and we saw a Queanbeyan bypass initiative announced by the Deputy Premier, Andrew Stoner, the member for Oxley, but in close conjunction with the Deputy Prime Minister and the good Nationals member there, the member for Monaro, John Barilaro. That is an example of federal-state cooperation—getting on with the job of building that infrastructure which is so sorely needed. It would not have happened under Labor, Member for Parkes, and we were there to witness first hand the delight of people in Queanbeyan to that announcement. It certainly would not have happened under the previous member, Steve Whan, but is happening under the current member, John Barilaro.


The Asset Recycling Fund will start from 1 July, with an initial size of about $5.9 billion and with contributions from uncommitted funds currently in the Building Australia Fund and around $2.4 billion in uncommitted funds currently in the Education Investment Fund, which is around $3.5 billion. As the member for Higgins alluded to earlier, that is going to see considerable investment in the states. She certainly wants to see Victoria through all of those important transport grid projects in Melbourne and, certainly, regional Victoria will benefit from the Asset Recycling Fund.


As I mentioned earlier, the government is achieving savings of $43.3 million over four years. The member for Parkes would like to know that we are also realising savings of $19.4 million over the forward estimates by abolishing and merging some small agencies to improve coordination and to increase efficiency. For example, we are merging ComSuper with Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation so that the administration of the Commonwealth superannuation schemes occurs through a single entity. We are also realising the synergies between the activities of the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman and the Commonwealth Ombudsman.


To investigate where else we might be able to realise further efficiencies, the government is developing and implementing a contestability framework over a three-year program of work to review whether government functions should be open to competition, and the appropriate means for this to occur. People who pay taxes want to make sure that their taxes are being used wisely, and want to make sure that they are getting value for money. This work will complement the scoping studies into future ownership operations for four operations announced in the budget, and that goes towards making the sorts of considerable savings that we need to fix up Labor's mess.


I need to answer the shadow minister's questions and, time permitting, I certainly will. For those questions I have not got the time for, I will get back to him on notice. For example, the staffing numbers you have asked for; I will certainly get back to you and provide written advice to that effect. He talked about Mud, sweat and cheers—a publication I indeed authored; and certainly, Australian taxpayers have had to endure more than their share of mud and sweat through the past six years with the previous Labor government. And they were cheering on 7 September when the coalition was returned to government. They were certainly cheering, because they knew that the sensible people were back in charge. They knew that the mature people were in charge: the member for North Sydney was in charge of Treasury; the member for Cook was in charge of immigration and border protection; the member for Wentworth was in charge of communications; and the member for Wide Bay was in charge of regional development, infrastructure, local government—all of those important things that have grassroots people of Australia making sure that their voices are being heard in Canberra, because they were not being heard over the past six years. They were not being delivered upon; like the NBN—with no cost-benefit analysis.


We have had to do some things that have not been widely accepted throughout the nation. One of them was a co-payment of $7 to visit your GP. I know the shadow minister was in favour of that, because—speaking of writing publications—he authored a publication which actually endorsed that view.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (18:23):  If the government were confident of its own policy on a Medicare co-payment, they would be focusing a little more on what they said last year, rather than what I said while I was at university. The fact is that every prominent health expert opposes the government's GP tax, as do I.


It has been disappointing to hear the parliamentary secretary, the author of a book called And the big boys fly, flying away from some of the key questions that I have been putting to him this evening. I appreciate the parliamentary secretary's willingness to take on notice a number of the specific questions about staffing, but I was disappointed that he was unable to reassure many of my constituents who work for the Department of Finance that the department is not presently undertaking a spill and fill of all positions. As parliamentary secretary, that is a piece of information that ought to be directly available to him. If he is unable to rule it out, then many of my constituents who work in the Department of Finance will be concerned that just such a spill and fill is taking place. Those of us in this place expect a spill and fill to take place every three years, but my constituents, hardworking public servants serving both sides of politics, should not be treated in such a way.


The parliamentary secretary was also unable to explain why there was a nearly $100 million decrease in departmental expenses for Finance, raising further concerns of a hit to Finance. The parliamentary secretary instead regaled us with tales of his visits to Queanbeyan, concerning me that he thought this was in fact consideration in retail, rather than consideration in detail. But I shall press on and put some further questions to him.


First, can the parliamentary secretary confirm that (a) the capital and earnings of the Asset Recycling Fund will be available for new projects and (b) only the earnings of the Medical Research Future Fund will be available for new projects? Can the parliamentary secretary advise what rate of return has been estimated for both the Asset Recycling Fund and the Medical Research Future Fund?


Second, can the parliamentary secretary advise the House of the amounts over the forward estimates that the Medical Research Future Fund is forecast to hold? Can the parliamentary secretary advise the House of the split between uncommitted funds in the Health and Hospitals Fund and savings from the health budget that make up the investment credits line for the Medical Research Future Fund?


Third, can the parliamentary secretary confirm that projects to be funded out of the Asset Recycling Fund have already been approved? Can the parliamentary secretary confirm that the amounts in earnings in the Asset Recycling Fund are greater than the amount in projects that have already been approved?


Fourth, can the parliamentary secretary advise the House whether the government is actively considering privatisations of the following entities: Snowy Hydro Ltd, the Australian Submarine Corp., Australia Post, Moorebank Intermodal Company Ltd, COMCAR and the Australian Rail Track Corporation Ltd? The potential privatisations of these entities are of great concern to Australians, who are entitled to know whether they are under active consideration by the government.

Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright—Government Whip) (18:27):  Border protection is an issue that is front and centre in the debate nationally. In asking a question on the issues of border protection, I pick up on one of the points that the previous speaker raised in an earlier line of questioning about how many Commonwealth employees and public servants would be affected by the wage freeze. I had the opportunity to read a paper recently, and one of the alarming statistics to come out of the Public Service concerned bracket creep and the number of incremental increases in the middle sector of the Public Service. I know this is not a forum to ask a question of you on this subject, but I want to ask if the member for Fraser has actually received any constituent calls, because I know he is a diligent member for the constituents of Fraser, a large percentage of whom would be public servants. In my electorate, I have a number of people earning over $180,000 and I have not received any calls from those people about having to pay the extra two per cent. I am genuinely interested to know—it is not a political slight or anything—if there is going to be perceived fiscal uncertainty as a result of the wage freeze for the Public Service. In the event that there is, I ask that the member enlighten them as to why these measures have to be taken in the manner that they are, to try and pull back some of the debt and deficit mess, to use the description of the Labor leader.


It is abundantly clear that, as a coalition, we went to the last election stating four key policies, including abolishing the carbon tax. We are in the process of doing that, but we are being hampered in the Senate and we trust that the dynamics of the Senate, as of 1 July, will move to a position where we will be able to fulfil that core commitment. Secondly, we said we would build the infrastructure of the 21st century. Evidence of that is that, in my home state of Queensland, we will be investing $13.4 billion in conjunction with state governments, who will be offered an inducement to sell assets and invest in productivity measures that provide a benefit to the state and, in turn, to the nation.


We gave a commitment to the nation that we would fix the budget. Part of tonight's proceedings is doing exactly that. We are making the tough decisions. They are not popular decisions, but we are making these tough decisions so that the next generation—and my daughter who is 18 is currently studying environmental science in Toowoomba at USQ—do not have to carry the burden of debt and deficit. If the hard decisions are not made by us today, she will inherit that legacy.


Most importantly, we said we would stop the boats, that we would address our border security. There are some enormous savings measures in this budget. This needs to be addressed. Scotty Morrison, the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, has done an outstanding job. There are some fiscal benefits that will flow through with reference to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. There are some provisions that will come to light for the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. Could the parliamentary secretary who is responsible enlighten us how those measures are helping the coalition provide a better future for the nation?

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (18:31):  I thank the member for Wright for his interest in matters pertaining to immigration and border protection and his interest in all matters pertaining to good government, which is what we getting on with the job of doing. Labor's failed border protection policies resulted in more than 55,000 unauthorised boat arrivals in more than 800 boats, causing a blow-out of over $11 billion. Tragically and sadly, they resulted also in the deaths of 1,100 people, who drowned at sea. We have not had a boat arrive for nearly six months now and we have not had a drowning at sea. Each person who came under Labor's watch cost $170,000 to process. That is a huge cost when you are trying to develop infrastructure in, for argument's sake, the electorate of Bendigo, in the electorate of the shadow minister who is at the table or in regional Queensland.


The shadow minister asked me earlier about health costs. Under the coalition, hospital funding for the ACT will increase from $266 million in 2014-15 to $311 million in 2017-18. That is under the coalition government. In 2015-16 funding to the states for hospital services will increase by nine per cent, or $1.4 billion more a year. It will go up by nine per cent the following year and the following financial year. It is a similar story with education. The amount of funding will go up and up.


He talked about Finance ASLs. It is all due to the machinery of government and the deregulation to PM&C. He talked earlier about the AEC. I am going back on some of the things he raised. I can cover in my letter to him the things I am unable to answer—and I will certainly get back to him. The change to the ASL was all due to the election. I am not aware—and this is in response to his previous question—of any plans to do a spill and fill, but difficult times do call for hard decisions. Difficult times call for difficult measures. As I said before and as the member for Wright indicated, we all have to contribute our share to building a better Australia. We all have to contribute our share to help restore confidence in government. We are doing that. We would like to think that Labor will get on board as well.


Investments in the Medical Research Future Fund, which the member for Fraser raised, will be managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians, in accordance with an investment mandate to be issued by the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance, Senator Mathias Cormann. The Medical Research Future Fund, which will build up to a $20 billion pot, will go to, hopefully, finding some answers to some of the questions that have thus far eluded medical researchers. It will provide valuable research and development in finding hopeful cures for many of the illnesses which plague and beset our nation. It will provide valuable medical research into cancer, into dementia and into all sorts of dreadful ailments which affect each and every family.


The establishment of the Medical Research Future Fund will be subject to the passage of health savings legislation, and we do hope that Labor gets on board because they have been so obstructive in so many things. Even their own savings identified before the previous election have been blocked in the Senate by Labor for whatever reason. Five billion dollars worth of their own savings have been blocked by an obstructionist Labor in the Senate. It beggars belief. The HHF—the Health and Hospitals Fund—will cease operation on 31 December 2014. Committed funds from that pool at 31 December this year will be transferred to consolidated revenue, from which the remaining commitments of the Health and Hospitals Fund will be met. I have to say that that Health and Hospitals Fund did provide funding for some valuable projects in the Riverina, and I was certainly appreciative at the time. Wagga Wagga Base Hospital, a new hospital at Griffith and the multipurpose development at Hillston in the west of my electorate certainly benefited from that HHF.


The Medical Research Future Fund is the biggest international future fund of its type, and I know that this needs bipartisan support, because Labor members know of the benefit of valuable medical research. I know the health minister and certainly the Assistant Minister for Health, Senator Fiona Nash, are behind this project because it will provide valuable research into many illnesses. (Time expired)

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (18:36):  I note that the parliamentary secretary has referred to uncommitted funds from the Health and Hospitals Fund being added to the Medical Research Future Fund. I wonder if he might advise the House whether, in the event that the government's $7 GP tax fails to pass the parliament, as appears likely, the entirety of the Medical Research Future Fund will be uncommitted HHF funds. In other words, is the government only prepared to create a Medical Research Future Fund if it can do so by taxing the sick, and is it actually true that the government is unwilling to use a single dollar of general revenue to put into the Medical Research Future Fund? If that is the case—if, indeed, the government's only commitment to medical research depends on taxing the sick—many Australians, I think, will doubt the true commitment of this government to a medical research future fund.


I note that the parliamentary secretary failed to respond to my question as to whether the government is considering privatisations of Snowy Hydro, the Submarine Corporation, Moorebank Intermodal, Australian Rail Track Corporation, COMCAR or Australia Post. I am sure that my constituents—like me—look forward to an answer for that question.


The member for Wright asked me a question. I have to say that if I had to choose two members of the government with whom to have a beer, the member for Wright and the member for Riverina would be high on my list. I have a great individual regard to each of them, albeit that I disagree with much of what they are defending in this budget. The member for Wright asks me whether I have had representations from members of my electorate concerned about the salary freeze. The simple answer is, member for Wright, we do not know enough from the government—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hawke

Dr LEIGH:
  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. Speaking directly to that expenditure item, my concern is the lack of information forthcoming from the government about the number of public office holders affected by the salary freeze. The parliamentary secretary has failed to demur from the minister for immigration's suggestion that PEFO is when officials tell the truth and that the government's budget should be measured not against its last budget update but against the state of the books when it took office. The parliamentary secretary's failure to differ from the minister for immigration on that suggests that he truly believes that the baseline is the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, and it must therefore follow that this is a government which has made the deficit worse, not better. For all the government's talk of 'debt and deficit disasters', this is really a government which does a great line in alliteration but a terrible line in deficit reduction, and it has in fact increased the deficit, not decreased it.


The income tax levy is just one example of that. Nearly half the revenue in the first year will be lost to a fringe benefits tax loophole. I ask the parliamentary secretary whether the government agrees with recent reports that around half the revenue from the income tax levy will be lost as high-income earners shift income into fringe benefits in order to avoid this tax.

Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright—Government Whip) (18:40):  My question goes to the parliamentary secretary regarding Budget Paper No. 2, page 233, on smaller government, surplus Commonwealth properties and divestiture of some non-defence surplus Commonwealth properties. In my electorate of Wright I am privileged to have the defence training facilities of the Canungra warfare training centre. I am often fortunate to meet ranking officers in the Australian military who at some stage of their illustrious career would have trained at that training centre. When I tell them I am from Beaudesert, they greet me with warmth, because they were hard days when officers were trained in intelligence and warfare in areas that are not that dissimilar to jungle-like warfare. To the northern end of my electorate I border up to Amberley air base and, just to the north-east, I have the Greenbank Army base facility, so I am surrounded by enormous assets in the defence portfolio area. I compliment Defence on the program they have had for divesting themselves of buildings that have asbestos in them to make the area safer for those who occupy the rooms.


I also take the opportunity to acknowledge and thank the minister for the return of the gap-year program, which was a program that was abandoned by the previous government. It was a program that the Defence Force used to offer to year 12 students for 12 months after school where they could do a try-before-you-buy 12 months, touching every part of the Defence Force, to see if a career in the military was for them. Thank you, minister, for returning such a valuable gap-year program.


In addition to that, could you touch on something in the public arena around the Lodge refurbishment. This is in Budget Paper No. 2, also on page 233. There is additional funding going to that. I acknowledge the humbleness of our Prime Minister and the dwellings that he takes up at the moment. It shows the character of the man and shows that what he advocates from a fiscal perspective he actually practices. I am sure he would be complimented by those opposite as well.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (18:44):  I thank the member for Wright for his strong advocacy for the military and certainly for veterans. Investment in defence fell to 1.56 per cent of gross domestic product in 2012-13—the lowest level of defence funding since 1938. We all know what happened in 1939. The 10½ per cent cut in the 2012-13 budget was the biggest since the Korean conflict. I do not think any Labor members could ever come in here and criticise our investment in defence, our commitment to defence, and certainly what we have done in the space of the DFRDB and DFRB indexation for our returned service men and women has certainly been warmly welcomed by those people.


I was asked about the Lodge. The Lodge has national symbolic status and is listed on the Commonwealth Heritage List. Essential work is required at the Lodge to prevent further deterioration of the building fabric and to undertake repairs to wiring and plumbing at the property. The property condition reports identified essential works were required to restore the property's condition to a compliant level to meet Building Code of Australia and work, health and safety obligations. That work is going on. We need to restore the Lodge to its former glory, to its original glory. As the work has progressed, Finance has had the opportunity to identify additional beneficial works which could be undertaken while the property remains vacant. As you say, the current occupier of the position of Prime Minister lives in very humble digs here in Canberra whilst the Lodge refurbishments are taking place. Those refurbishments include works on balcony balustrades to achieve building compliance, and internal and external painting.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr McCORMACK:
  None of the members over the other side calling out will probably ever occupy the Lodge, with any luck. We know that the member for Fraser has designs on the member for Maribyrnong's position at the moment. He could well do a better job but, unlike the member for Grayndler, he may well need the votes of both caucus and the people. He talked about some of the privatisation scuttlebutt that has been going around about Snowy Hydro and Australia Post. That is not on the drawing board at the moment. It has not been flagged by government. It is just media speculation. He also talked about the budget crisis being unreal. Parliament's independent budget adviser rejected claims by Labor and the Greens, and who would ever believe the Greens? The very worst Labor member, I have to say, is better than the best Greens member.



An opposition member interjecting—  




Mr McCORMACK:
  I am not saying the member for Fraser is the worst Labor member by any stretch of the imagination but, certainly, claims that there has been some sort of concocted budget crisis are unfounded. Remarks that effectively endorse government's warnings that, if left unchecked, gross debt would balloon to $667 billion are from no less than the Parliamentary Budget Officer, Phil Bowen, who said it was time to begin the return to surplus to protect the economy against future crises. Of course he is accurate. He told the Australian Financial Review:


It is time to start coming out [of debt and deficit], otherwise the longer you leave it the more exposed you become and the harder it is to wind it back.


It is good advice. Labor members need to get on board with the program that we have got in place, the infrastructure spend that we are doing, the commitment to our veterans and our defence and certainly the spending that we are going to be doing in health and education to get over the next four years, the forward estimates, and get this country back on track.


We need to make sure that this country's credibility is restored. We have to be competitive. We have to give our taxpayers value for their tax dollars. That applies whether you are in Pitt Street or Swanston Street or in regional Australia. I know that the people I represent, the people that the member for Wright and the member for Hughes represent and the people that you, Deputy Speaker Hawke, represent as the member for Mitchell want better value for money. They did not get it in six years of Labor, six years of racking up debt and deficit. But Tony Abbott, Warren Truss and the team are getting on with the job of restoring confidence and restoring respectability and accountability to government.


Proposed expenditure agreed to.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (18:50):  This is the sixth Major Projects Report, or MPR, to be produced by the Defence Materiel Organisation and the Australian National Audit Office. Indeed, it is the third in which I have taken part. This report is a valuable contribution to parliament satisfying itself on the use of public money in the Defence arena and a means of ensuring it is well spent. 


It is important to recognise that we do not undertake the process in the spirit of a trial or interrogation. Having been involved in three of these reports, I have been struck by the fact that this is an evolving process, which builds incrementally as we expand understanding of the complex financial budgetary and organisational issues involved. There is very much a spirit of cooperation and good faith in the discussions we have in the public hearings. This report, in particular, has I believe reached new heights in the interchange between the committee, the DMO and the ANAO. In my view it has contributed to a greater mutual understanding of what needs to be done to improve what the report describes as a 'line of sight' between the MPR and other important documents such as portfolio budget statements and budget papers, and also consistency of project names and groupings.


The information contained in these documents should, to the extent possible, be comparable. When put together it should provide an understanding of the issues. In our report we raise a number of issues and questions. The responses to these will be the basis, I hope, for further improvements in transparency and information. 


There is one area I would like to highlight tonight—and that is sustainment. I know I have an unusual fascination with sustainment, but given the fact that our sustainment spend in 2012-13 exceeded the acquisition spend in the Defence arena—the sustainment spend is about $5 billion and the acquisition spend is about $3.9 billion—I think my unusual fascination is warranted. The report notes that sustainment is currently outside the scope of the MPR. It goes on to make the case for improving financial reporting on sustainment expenditure which, as I said, amounts to $5 billion in 2012-13. The report also points out that full sight of sustainment activity is necessary to view a major project in its complete context.


It is, of course, crucial that public reporting on sustainment does not create risks by exposing operational information that would damage capability. I have been acutely aware of that. It is an issue that has been highlighted by the Defence representatives who have appeared before the committee. In seeking greater transparency, greater accountability and further information in the sustainment area I am not in any way wanting to give away government secrets or in any way compromise operational security.


In particular there is no quarrel with the department's express view in its executive minutes in response to the 2011-12 report that providing performance details of DMO sustainment activities consistent with the MPR would be potentially highly sensitive and of a classified nature. I understand the sensitivities around this. That said, the report also notes that DMO's provision of more information on sustainment in the PBS 2013-14 would be greatly appreciated. We would like more information than what has been provided to date.


As a case study—examined at length in the committee's report—makes clear, there can be uncertainty as to the distinction between capability acquisition and capability sustainment. This was particularly frustrating for a number of members of the committee in terms of trying to get that line of sight—that visibility—about where a project began and where it ended. There were a number of projects in the MPR that were well past the acquisition phase and would not necessarily be classified as project. One would have assumed that they would be classified as being in the sustainment phase but here they are in the MPR. 


As I said before, it is still very difficult to get a whole-of-life perspective on a financial and budgetary performance of a major project. Furthermore, it is important to keep in mind that reporting on financial performance is not the same as reporting on operational performance. This is clearly an area that will benefit from further analysis and discussion. 


Before I conclude, I would like to quote some elements of the report. I go back to the notion of sustainment and trying to improve visibility. As the report says:


However, the fact remains that there is little visibility surrounding $5 billion of public money spent on sustainment in 2012-13. Further, when a Major Project's acquisition budget is combined with the sustainment budget, only then does the scale of the overall, long-term financial commitment become apparent. The MPR and the budget papers do not presently disclose this information.


The report makes clear that we wish to continue those exchanges and examinations, and I do believe that there is a real will to enhance the transparency and accountability in this area. I note as the committee did that in future a separate inquiry into sustainment expenditure reporting may be necessary. Again I quote from the report—here recommendation 4:


The Committee recommends that the Defence Materiel Organisation prepares a suitable and separate methodology for reporting sustainment activity and expenditure, and that this methodology be reported to the Committee within six months of the tabling of this report.


I very much look forward to seeing that methodology in the next six months. As I said, it would greatly enhance the transparency and visibility of these projects to the parliament throughout their lives. I look forward to participating in these further discussions, particularly on how we can get greater transparency on sustainment.


I thank the Defence Materiel Organisation and the ANAO for their involvement in this and for their candour in discussions on the issues. I also thank my fellow committee members. There is an enduring interest in the major projects across the committee, and DMO and ANAO in particular have been helpful in enlightening us in many areas. I thank them.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2014-06-16,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (19:10):   In a curious speech last year, the Prime Minister's No. 1 business adviser, Maurice Newman said:


… Australian wage rates are very high by international standards and our system is dogged by rigidities. 


In a carefully crafted takedown, the noted economist Stephen Koukoulas observed that Mr Newman had kicked an own goal. He cited a number of nations with lower minimum wage rates than Australia but in each case the country he cited had a higher unemployment rate. The example was most extreme in the case of Canada—which Mr Newman curiously referred to as our closest competitor—which, in the 38 years since 1975, has never had an unemployment rate below 5.9 per cent, compared to Australia, where the unemployment had at the time not been above 5.9 per cent since 2003. So much for low wages helping labour market efficiency and driving unemployment lower. 


The facts fly in the face of the Prime Minister's No. 1 business adviser, in much the same pattern as we are seeing for government advisers on climate change. Like Maurice Newman, Dick Warburton is a climate change sceptic, and yet Australia is now seeing temperature records being broken across the board—the year of the highest temperatures on record, the summer of the highest temperatures on record and record hot spells dispelling the climate change deniers like Maurice Newman and Dick Warburton. 


Today, a speech by Christopher Kent, of the Reserve Bank of Australia, went further and dispelled the views of Mr Newman on wages. In a speech titled 'Cyclical and Structural Changes in the Labour Market', Christopher Kent noted a number of points about the labour market. He noted, in particular, that the NAB business survey showed that wage growth has slowed over the past year. Wage outcomes of more than four per cent have become far less common than was the case a few years ago, and outcomes of two to three per cent are more common than outcomes of three to four per cent. He went on to note:


The slowing in wage growth across all industries has meant that firms have experienced relatively slow growth in their labour costs. This is more striking after accounting for the growth in the productivity of labour, which as I've already noted has picked up somewhat compared with the pace we had become accustomed to over much of the 2000s. Over the past year and a half, the growth in nominal wages has been matched by growth in labour productivity. As a result, there has been no increase in the cost of labour required to produce a unit of output. 


In turn, slower growth in labour costs is having a beneficial effect on international competitiveness.


So the data gives the lie to the Prime Minister's No. 1 business adviser, who would have you believe that there is a wages break-out in Australia. The problem with the rhetoric about a wages break-out is that it distracts Australia from more pressing economic challenges. As Reserve Bank officials have noted many times when they have appeared before the House of Representatives Economics Committee, Australia does not have a deficit problem by comparison with other nations around the world. With debt levels peaking around a tenth of national income, Australia is extremely well placed compared to the typical developed country, whose debt is often nearly as large as, and in some cases larger than, their national income. Why does Australia have debt? We have it because we chose to step in and to support 200,000 jobs and tens of thousands of small businesses.



Opposition members interjecting—




Dr LEIGH:
  When those opposite interject and suggest that they would have had Australia take on no debt, effectively they are taking the position of the man who chooses when the floodwaters rise not to put a lifeboat on the credit card. They would have chosen loss of jobs and a recession ahead of taking on modest debt. What Australia bought for the modest debt that we took on during the global financial crisis was hundreds of thousands of lives not blighted by unemployment and small businesses that were able to survive. The best small business policy ever pursued by a government over the course of the last generation was fiscal stimulus in the teeth of the worst downturn since the global recession. When those opposite seek to airbrush out the global financial crisis from Australia's history they are doing a disservice to the bipartisan fiscal stimulus policy supported in its first tranche by the coalition but then backed off from by those who would have you believe that it is better to drown in floodwaters than to put a lifeboat on the credit card. Like the rhetoric on a 'wages break-out', the rhetoric on deficits is belied by the facts.


To the extent that anyone is concerned about deficit levels in Australia they should be concerned about a government that has increased the deficit compared to the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook. The yardstick when a government takes office—as Peter Costello taught us through the Charter of Budget Honesty, and as Scott Morrison, the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, admitted in question time—is the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook. As the minister for immigration put it, that is when officials tell the truth. Compared with that benchmark, the deficit is higher this year, it is higher next year and it is higher under the forward estimates. So those opposite can bleat all they like about deficits. They have increased deficits not decreased them.



Government members interjecting—




Dr LEIGH:
  Those opposite may laugh but these are simple numbers. You can laugh in the face of the budget papers all you like, but the only way those opposite are able to show that they have decreased deficits is if they compare Joe with Joe: if they compare the outcome in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook brought down by Joe Hockey with the outcome in the budget brought down by Joe Hockey. If we do the right thing, the fair thing, the only decent thing, the Charter of Budget Honesty thing, and compare this budget with the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, we see that it has a bigger deficit not a smaller one.


Globally, Australia does not have a debt and deficit problem, but this government is making the problem worse with its deal with the Greens for unlimited debt and with its increase in the deficit. Australia has serious economic challenges to focus on, but those challenges are being distracted from by a government more interested in trash talking the economy than talking it up. We have seen a collapse in consumer confidence, we have seen declining retail sales and we are seeing a fall in house prices. These things are being driven by a government that is fundamentally wanting to remain in opposition mode. We have a Treasurer who is a shadow Treasurer in drag: he is more interested in talking about the problems of the Australian economy than speaking about the great bipartisan success of two decades of uninterrupted economic growth. As Stephen Koukoulas has pointed out and as Matt Cowgill has articulately pointed out on many occasions, the data give the lie to Mr Hockey's attack on the Australian economy. But his attack on the Australian economy has real consequences. It is not just coalition voters who spend; it is Labor voters too and their consumer confidence is going through the floor. 


Australia's biggest challenges are around innovation, around increasing literacy and numeracy scores and around inequality, which has risen through a generation—a generation in which battlers have done worse than billionaires, in which earnings have risen three times as fast for the top 10 per cent as for the bottom 10 per cent, in which the top one per cent income share has doubled and the 0.1 per cent income share has tripled, and in which the richest three Australians have more wealth than the poorest one million Australians. But this budget is a redistributive one—a budget, as John Falzon told a rally for International Cleaners Day in Federation Mall at Parliament House, that takes away from the most vulnerable to give to the most affluent.


They have taken away from the most vulnerable to give to the most affluent. As independent NATSEM research has shown, having taken one-tenth of their income away from the poorest single parents to give to the most affluent Australians, those opposite have the gall to call it class warfare when low-income Australians complain. They do not think it is class warfare when they take money out of the pockets of the poorest single parents in order to give $50,000 to millionaires for a parental leave scheme. They do not think it is class warfare when they cut the pension in order to raise the non-concessional superannuation cap from $150,000 to $180,000. No—they only think it is class warfare when the most vulnerable Australians object to having money taken out of their pockets after a generation of rising inequality. (Time expired)

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2014-06-16,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (19:20):  I rise to speak on the Standing Committee on Economics' review of the Reserve Bank of Australia's annual report of 2013. I must admit I am a little confused about what issues in that report the shadow Assistant Treasurer and member for Fraser was actually talking about, but I do know that he is the author of some very informative books where he makes some very wise and insightful comments. But I am afraid, after some of the points he raised there, that his next book will be more likely to be a children's fiction novel than anything of economic significance.


I will address a couple of the points that the member for Fraser raised. He talked about unemployment. Let us be clear: the record of the previous Labor government saw the unemployment queues of this nation increase by 200,000 people. We can fill the MCG twice with the extra number of people who became unemployed under the policies of the previous Labor government. So the member for Fraser is in no position to stand up here and lecture us about unemployment. Already this year we have seen an extra 100,000 jobs and the majority of those are full-time jobs, as the member for Herbert correctly points out.


The member for Fraser also went on about small business—about the wonderful work that the previous Labor government did for small business. Let me remind the member for Fraser of the number of jobs lost. Does the member for Fraser know the number of jobs lost in the small business sector over the previous six years, when he was a member of the Labor government? It was 513,000. Over half a million jobs in small business were lost during the six years of the previous regime.



A government member interjecting—




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  That is right. There were six separate ministers—a revolving door of small business ministers—and the member for Fraser comes in here and tells us about the wonderful things the previous Labor government did for small business. Dear, oh dear, oh dear, Deputy Speaker. Then he talks about consumer confidence. Well, if you want to damage consumer confidence, you run around the nation engaging in misleading scare campaigns. That is exactly what we hear from the opposition since the budget was handed down: we hear them running out scaremongering, scaring pensioners and students. What they should be out doing is telling the truth.


Firstly, the truth when it comes to health care: there are no cuts; there is a nine per cent increase this year, a nine per cent increase next year and a nine per cent increase the year after that. In education, it is eight per cent this year, eight per cent next year and eight per cent the year after. But what upsets me most about the damage they are doing to consumer confidence is the way they are scaring young students, telling them these outrageous stories about how this coalition government is supposedly ruining their future. Let us get some facts right: in this country the coalition plan is to give the opportunity to give 80,000 more young Australians to get into higher education and learning. And you know what? They will be able to do so without spending one cent up-front. We know, also, that if you leave year 12 and go on to get a university education, throughout your life you will earn on average 75 per cent more than your peer who leaves school at year 12. Over a lifetime that is an additional million dollars.


That is the value of education. That is the message we should be out there telling our kids and our young people: get that education, because it will allow you to earn a much greater living in the future and to make a greater contribution to our nation. Yes, you will have a HECS debt, but the taxpayer will pick up at least 50 per cent of the cost of your education. You will only have to pay 50 per cent, and that is one of the best deals those young people could ever get. That is the message we should be out there telling the young of Australia, not the scare campaigns that we are hearing from the opposition.


Getting back to the report of the Reserve Bank, what this report actually shows is the dangerous denialism we are hearing about the debt and deficit crisis that we have in our nation. We all know that back in 2007 we had no net debt—zero. We actually had money in the bank. Then of course the Labor government was elected and we heard that we would have a temporary deficit. Well, we had six years of so-called 'temporary' deficits, the six largest deficits in our nation's history. The debt that this nation now has outstanding at the end of June, as per the budget papers, is expected to be $358 billion. 


What is the cost of that? The cost is the interest payments to service the debt. We must pay this back sometime in the future, but until we do that we have that interest cost, the cost of the debt. At the moment, that cost is $12 billion every year—a billion dollars every month, $33 million every single day. That is the cost. That has an opportunity cost. Instead of spending on the services that we need—the infrastructure, the aged care, the hospitals, our kids with disabilities, more money on education—we have to put that money aside and we have to use it to pay the interest bill on the debt that the previous Labor government ran up. And we have to do that forever until we start paying that debt back. We know that if nothing is done and we continue in the direction we are going, that debt will not be $300 billion. We are heading in a decade's time to a net debt of $666 billion. If we ever hit that day, the interest payments would not be $12 billion a year; they would be close to $36 billion. 


But we must remember one thing about the cost of this debt and how we are stuck with it forever and how we are lumbering this onto our children and our grandchildren who will have to pay it: what will the bond rate be in 10 or 20 years time? At what interest rate will this nation be able to go out there and sell government bonds in 10 or 20 years time? At the moment, that billion dollars we are paying every month is done on the current 10-year bond rate at around 3.7 per cent. So I do not care how far-sighted or how clever anyone is. No-one knows what rate we will have to sell those bonds again in 10 or 20 years time if we do not start paying that debt off. 


We do know how inaccurate the long-term economic forecasts have been. If we look to the past, most of the long-term economic forecasts that have been made are simply wrong. So again I ask: what will the interest rate be in 10 and 20 years time? If we go back through history, that can give us an idea of where it could possibly be in the future. The long-term average of the bond rates between 1969 and this year is 7.78 per cent. We are now half the long-term average. In fact the highest bond rates we had were back in May in 1982 when we were selling government bonds for 16.4 per cent—16.4 per cent versus 3.7 per cent. One of the biggest risks we have in this nation going forward is what happens if there is a spike in global interest rates and those bond rates creep up to where they were for the long-term average of the last 40 or 50 years? If they do, we will not be facing interest repayments of $30 billion. We as a nation could be facing interest repayments of up to $60 billion. 


Just imagine if future governments had to find another $30 billion on top of the present debt. That is the risk we are putting on our kids. This is why we need to take this action, to get our debt under control, to reduce it. I do not want my grandchildren or great-grandchildren to have around their heads the burden of needing to pay this huge amount of debt and interest or the risk that it could blow out and double because of the increases in the long-term bond rate. That is one of the risks that this— (Time expired)

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (19:10):   In a curious speech last year, the Prime Minister's No. 1 business adviser, Maurice Newman said:


… Australian wage rates are very high by international standards and our system is dogged by rigidities. 


In a carefully crafted takedown, the noted economist Stephen Koukoulas observed that Mr Newman had kicked an own goal. He cited a number of nations with lower minimum wage rates than Australia but in each case the country he cited had a higher unemployment rate. The example was most extreme in the case of Canada—which Mr Newman curiously referred to as our closest competitor—which, in the 38 years since 1975, has never had an unemployment rate below 5.9 per cent, compared to Australia, where the unemployment had at the time not been above 5.9 per cent since 2003. So much for low wages helping labour market efficiency and driving unemployment lower. 


The facts fly in the face of the Prime Minister's No. 1 business adviser, in much the same pattern as we are seeing for government advisers on climate change. Like Maurice Newman, Dick Warburton is a climate change sceptic, and yet Australia is now seeing temperature records being broken across the board—the year of the highest temperatures on record, the summer of the highest temperatures on record and record hot spells dispelling the climate change deniers like Maurice Newman and Dick Warburton. 


Today, a speech by Christopher Kent, of the Reserve Bank of Australia, went further and dispelled the views of Mr Newman on wages. In a speech titled 'Cyclical and Structural Changes in the Labour Market', Christopher Kent noted a number of points about the labour market. He noted, in particular, that the NAB business survey showed that wage growth has slowed over the past year. Wage outcomes of more than four per cent have become far less common than was the case a few years ago, and outcomes of two to three per cent are more common than outcomes of three to four per cent. He went on to note:


The slowing in wage growth across all industries has meant that firms have experienced relatively slow growth in their labour costs. This is more striking after accounting for the growth in the productivity of labour, which as I've already noted has picked up somewhat compared with the pace we had become accustomed to over much of the 2000s. Over the past year and a half, the growth in nominal wages has been matched by growth in labour productivity. As a result, there has been no increase in the cost of labour required to produce a unit of output. 


In turn, slower growth in labour costs is having a beneficial effect on international competitiveness.


So the data gives the lie to the Prime Minister's No. 1 business adviser, who would have you believe that there is a wages break-out in Australia. The problem with the rhetoric about a wages break-out is that it distracts Australia from more pressing economic challenges. As Reserve Bank officials have noted many times when they have appeared before the House of Representatives Economics Committee, Australia does not have a deficit problem by comparison with other nations around the world. With debt levels peaking around a tenth of national income, Australia is extremely well placed compared to the typical developed country, whose debt is often nearly as large as, and in some cases larger than, their national income. Why does Australia have debt? We have it because we chose to step in and to support 200,000 jobs and tens of thousands of small businesses.



Opposition members interjecting—




Dr LEIGH:
  When those opposite interject and suggest that they would have had Australia take on no debt, effectively they are taking the position of the man who chooses when the floodwaters rise not to put a lifeboat on the credit card. They would have chosen loss of jobs and a recession ahead of taking on modest debt. What Australia bought for the modest debt that we took on during the global financial crisis was hundreds of thousands of lives not blighted by unemployment and small businesses that were able to survive. The best small business policy ever pursued by a government over the course of the last generation was fiscal stimulus in the teeth of the worst downturn since the global recession. When those opposite seek to airbrush out the global financial crisis from Australia's history they are doing a disservice to the bipartisan fiscal stimulus policy supported in its first tranche by the coalition but then backed off from by those who would have you believe that it is better to drown in floodwaters than to put a lifeboat on the credit card. Like the rhetoric on a 'wages break-out', the rhetoric on deficits is belied by the facts.


To the extent that anyone is concerned about deficit levels in Australia they should be concerned about a government that has increased the deficit compared to the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook. The yardstick when a government takes office—as Peter Costello taught us through the Charter of Budget Honesty, and as Scott Morrison, the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, admitted in question time—is the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook. As the minister for immigration put it, that is when officials tell the truth. Compared with that benchmark, the deficit is higher this year, it is higher next year and it is higher under the forward estimates. So those opposite can bleat all they like about deficits. They have increased deficits not decreased them.



Government members interjecting—




Dr LEIGH:
  Those opposite may laugh but these are simple numbers. You can laugh in the face of the budget papers all you like, but the only way those opposite are able to show that they have decreased deficits is if they compare Joe with Joe: if they compare the outcome in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook brought down by Joe Hockey with the outcome in the budget brought down by Joe Hockey. If we do the right thing, the fair thing, the only decent thing, the Charter of Budget Honesty thing, and compare this budget with the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, we see that it has a bigger deficit not a smaller one.


Globally, Australia does not have a debt and deficit problem, but this government is making the problem worse with its deal with the Greens for unlimited debt and with its increase in the deficit. Australia has serious economic challenges to focus on, but those challenges are being distracted from by a government more interested in trash talking the economy than talking it up. We have seen a collapse in consumer confidence, we have seen declining retail sales and we are seeing a fall in house prices. These things are being driven by a government that is fundamentally wanting to remain in opposition mode. We have a Treasurer who is a shadow Treasurer in drag: he is more interested in talking about the problems of the Australian economy than speaking about the great bipartisan success of two decades of uninterrupted economic growth. As Stephen Koukoulas has pointed out and as Matt Cowgill has articulately pointed out on many occasions, the data give the lie to Mr Hockey's attack on the Australian economy. But his attack on the Australian economy has real consequences. It is not just coalition voters who spend; it is Labor voters too and their consumer confidence is going through the floor. 


Australia's biggest challenges are around innovation, around increasing literacy and numeracy scores and around inequality, which has risen through a generation—a generation in which battlers have done worse than billionaires, in which earnings have risen three times as fast for the top 10 per cent as for the bottom 10 per cent, in which the top one per cent income share has doubled and the 0.1 per cent income share has tripled, and in which the richest three Australians have more wealth than the poorest one million Australians. But this budget is a redistributive one—a budget, as John Falzon told a rally for International Cleaners Day in Federation Mall at Parliament House, that takes away from the most vulnerable to give to the most affluent.


They have taken away from the most vulnerable to give to the most affluent. As independent NATSEM research has shown, having taken one-tenth of their income away from the poorest single parents to give to the most affluent Australians, those opposite have the gall to call it class warfare when low-income Australians complain. They do not think it is class warfare when they take money out of the pockets of the poorest single parents in order to give $50,000 to millionaires for a parental leave scheme. They do not think it is class warfare when they cut the pension in order to raise the non-concessional superannuation cap from $150,000 to $180,000. No—they only think it is class warfare when the most vulnerable Australians object to having money taken out of their pockets after a generation of rising inequality. (Time expired)

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2014-06-16,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (19:20):  I rise to speak on the Standing Committee on Economics' review of the Reserve Bank of Australia's annual report of 2013. I must admit I am a little confused about what issues in that report the shadow Assistant Treasurer and member for Fraser was actually talking about, but I do know that he is the author of some very informative books where he makes some very wise and insightful comments. But I am afraid, after some of the points he raised there, that his next book will be more likely to be a children's fiction novel than anything of economic significance.


I will address a couple of the points that the member for Fraser raised. He talked about unemployment. Let us be clear: the record of the previous Labor government saw the unemployment queues of this nation increase by 200,000 people. We can fill the MCG twice with the extra number of people who became unemployed under the policies of the previous Labor government. So the member for Fraser is in no position to stand up here and lecture us about unemployment. Already this year we have seen an extra 100,000 jobs and the majority of those are full-time jobs, as the member for Herbert correctly points out.


The member for Fraser also went on about small business—about the wonderful work that the previous Labor government did for small business. Let me remind the member for Fraser of the number of jobs lost. Does the member for Fraser know the number of jobs lost in the small business sector over the previous six years, when he was a member of the Labor government? It was 513,000. Over half a million jobs in small business were lost during the six years of the previous regime.



A government member interjecting—




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  That is right. There were six separate ministers—a revolving door of small business ministers—and the member for Fraser comes in here and tells us about the wonderful things the previous Labor government did for small business. Dear, oh dear, oh dear, Deputy Speaker. Then he talks about consumer confidence. Well, if you want to damage consumer confidence, you run around the nation engaging in misleading scare campaigns. That is exactly what we hear from the opposition since the budget was handed down: we hear them running out scaremongering, scaring pensioners and students. What they should be out doing is telling the truth.


Firstly, the truth when it comes to health care: there are no cuts; there is a nine per cent increase this year, a nine per cent increase next year and a nine per cent increase the year after that. In education, it is eight per cent this year, eight per cent next year and eight per cent the year after. But what upsets me most about the damage they are doing to consumer confidence is the way they are scaring young students, telling them these outrageous stories about how this coalition government is supposedly ruining their future. Let us get some facts right: in this country the coalition plan is to give the opportunity to give 80,000 more young Australians to get into higher education and learning. And you know what? They will be able to do so without spending one cent up-front. We know, also, that if you leave year 12 and go on to get a university education, throughout your life you will earn on average 75 per cent more than your peer who leaves school at year 12. Over a lifetime that is an additional million dollars.


That is the value of education. That is the message we should be out there telling our kids and our young people: get that education, because it will allow you to earn a much greater living in the future and to make a greater contribution to our nation. Yes, you will have a HECS debt, but the taxpayer will pick up at least 50 per cent of the cost of your education. You will only have to pay 50 per cent, and that is one of the best deals those young people could ever get. That is the message we should be out there telling the young of Australia, not the scare campaigns that we are hearing from the opposition.


Getting back to the report of the Reserve Bank, what this report actually shows is the dangerous denialism we are hearing about the debt and deficit crisis that we have in our nation. We all know that back in 2007 we had no net debt—zero. We actually had money in the bank. Then of course the Labor government was elected and we heard that we would have a temporary deficit. Well, we had six years of so-called 'temporary' deficits, the six largest deficits in our nation's history. The debt that this nation now has outstanding at the end of June, as per the budget papers, is expected to be $358 billion. 


What is the cost of that? The cost is the interest payments to service the debt. We must pay this back sometime in the future, but until we do that we have that interest cost, the cost of the debt. At the moment, that cost is $12 billion every year—a billion dollars every month, $33 million every single day. That is the cost. That has an opportunity cost. Instead of spending on the services that we need—the infrastructure, the aged care, the hospitals, our kids with disabilities, more money on education—we have to put that money aside and we have to use it to pay the interest bill on the debt that the previous Labor government ran up. And we have to do that forever until we start paying that debt back. We know that if nothing is done and we continue in the direction we are going, that debt will not be $300 billion. We are heading in a decade's time to a net debt of $666 billion. If we ever hit that day, the interest payments would not be $12 billion a year; they would be close to $36 billion. 


But we must remember one thing about the cost of this debt and how we are stuck with it forever and how we are lumbering this onto our children and our grandchildren who will have to pay it: what will the bond rate be in 10 or 20 years time? At what interest rate will this nation be able to go out there and sell government bonds in 10 or 20 years time? At the moment, that billion dollars we are paying every month is done on the current 10-year bond rate at around 3.7 per cent. So I do not care how far-sighted or how clever anyone is. No-one knows what rate we will have to sell those bonds again in 10 or 20 years time if we do not start paying that debt off. 


We do know how inaccurate the long-term economic forecasts have been. If we look to the past, most of the long-term economic forecasts that have been made are simply wrong. So again I ask: what will the interest rate be in 10 and 20 years time? If we go back through history, that can give us an idea of where it could possibly be in the future. The long-term average of the bond rates between 1969 and this year is 7.78 per cent. We are now half the long-term average.

"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2014-06-16,"



Ms KING
 (Ballarat) (19:31):  I rise today to speak on the government's attack on our health-care system. I listened with some interest to the previous speaker, who was speaking on another matter, who wants to claim really clearly that somehow or other he can keep deluding himself that there are no cuts to health. 



Mr Craig Kelly interjecting—




Ms KING:
  Perhaps I might ask for your intervention, Deputy Speaker, given we sat here in silence during his frankly appalling contribution.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order!




Ms KING:
  In just 14 days time, the Abbott government's $80 billion cuts to health and education start. The member should inform himself of just what has happened, in terms of the national partnership agreements in health that formed the basis of the health and hospital reform agreements, and talk to his state counterparts for the adjustments that they are having to make—significant adjustments to all of the public hospital budgets, right the way across the country because of the cuts had been made to health. 


These are cuts that do not start in 2017 as the Prime Minister claimed. They are cuts that do not start next year. These cuts start on 1 July this year. That is $55 billion that has been ripped from Australian hospitals, beginning in just 14 days time. Cutting funding from health and public hospitals means more pressure on our emergency departments. It means longer waiting times for elective surgery. It means that Australians will find it even more difficult to access the health care they need.


It is clear from this budget that the Prime Minister and his health minister are trying to shift responsibility for health out of the Commonwealth and back onto the states and territories, and onto individual taxpayers. We had reports today that elective surgery times in South Australia could blow out due to the Abbott government's cuts and we have heard that these cuts will contribute to bed closures in some states. New South Wales Premier Mike Baird said, on 19 May—I note he hands this budget down tomorrow—the impact starts on 1 July. The equivalent here in New South Wales is that over 300 hospital beds in funding disappears. 


Not content with these cruel cuts to hospitals, the Abbott government is slugging patients and families with a $7 GP tax every single time they visit the doctor. The only thing this tax will do is restrict access to doctors and drive up healthcare costs for every Australian. This is explicitly what it is designed to do. I look forward to seeing those members opposite out every today, campaigning, talking to the same people I have been talking to—in nursing homes, and GP-surgery waiting rooms—about why they think this is such a great idea.


We know from Senate estimates the government has done absolutely no modelling at all on the impact a $7 GP tax will have on chronically-ill patients, GPs and emergency departments in public hospitals. There has been no modelling at all done on the impact this tax will have on rural and regional Australians.


We know that experts, from the Australian Medical Association and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners to the Consumers Health Forum, all say that this is very bad health policy. Professor Brian Owler, the new president of the AMA, has said of the GP tax:


In terms of the … effect on emergency departments, we all have fears that patients, instead of seeing their general practitioners, but also accessing pathology and diagnostic imaging services, will default to our public hospital system.


Now, our public hospital system is also taking a cut under this Budget, and it's going to be ill-equipped to be able to deal with any increase in demand that might be provided by the GP diagnostic imaging and pathology …


This is absolutely dud healthcare policy. It is bad health policy and it is policy that hits middle- and low-income earners and some of the most vulnerable Australians the most.


Australia's out-of-pocket costs for health are already high, compared with other OECD countries. So why would you want to impose further pressure on Australians who already pay high out-of-pocket costs? Why would you want to put a barrier in the way of what is the most efficient part of the healthcare system—that is, primary care—the part of the system where you want people to go to access preventative health, to manage their chronic disease conditions so that they can stay out of hospital? That is the most efficient part and the most efficient use of health services. 


Why are we seeing the government pursue this policy? Because the Prime Minister and the health minister appear absolutely determined to pick apart, piece by piece, our Medicare system that we have had in this country for 30 years, creating a two-tiered health system that will end up costing all Australians and families far more. The tax will make it much harder for Australian families to see their GP. It also increases pressure on family budgets. It will also put additional stress on hospital emergency wards and our public hospital system. It will spell the end of bulk-billing as we know it today and will have a devastating effect on millions of Australians.


Those opposite want us to believe that, somehow, they are the best friend of Medicare. But no number of weasel words can hide the fact that the Minister for Health and the Prime Minister are ripping billions of dollars out of our health system and attempting to fundamentally restructure it. They are no friend of Medicare.


The health minister's narrative that health costs in Australia are spiralling out of control and are unsustainable is absolutely and entirely false. During our period in government we were able to ensure that there were 11,000 more doctors, 26,000 more nurses, and more doctors in rural and regional areas. We saw record bulk-billing rates—up to 82 per cent—better access and more access to general practitioners, particularly in those communities where previously access had been limited. The sum of $20 billion was invested in our public hospital systems. The government likes to say that somehow this was a blow-out in hospital funding. No, it was not. It was a deliberate decision of a Labor government to invest in public hospitals, to actually increase the Commonwealth's share in our public hospital system, because we knew that the share had been declining under the Liberal Party. And now we are about to see that share of Commonwealth contribution for our public hospital system hit an even lower point. The world's toughest anti-tobacco laws were introduced by our government and new medicines were made cheaper through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Back in 1984—



A government member interjecting—  




Ms KING:
  You keep repeating yourself; that is just great. I can hear the member saying, again, 'No-one has any problems with co-payments.' Well, you go out there and tell your community why you are backing this GP tax. I look forward to it. 


In 1984, when Bob Hawke was Prime Minister, he warned that without a universal healthcare system more than two million Australians were at risk of bankruptcy in the event of a serious healthcare illness. With the introduction of Medicare we ensured that universal health care was accessible for all. Today, some 8.5 million Australians, under the age of 30, have grown up with no other system but Medicare. They have known no other healthcare system. Now in the year of its 30th anniversary, Medicare is being pulled apart at the seams by the government. They want to end it as we know it.


What does a $7 tax mean for patients and families? It means that, for a parent whose child is ill, a pensioner who needs another prescription from their GP, a person in a nursing home who needs to access a general practitioner or a student who has a chronic disease such as diabetes, they may think twice about going to their GP because of the extra cost. It means that patients such as those are more likely to present at an emergency department or end up in hospital, rather than to their GP, because they have not received the care that they need, squeezing our healthcare system even further. Obviously, what you need to do is make sure that people have access to a GP; after all, it is the most efficient part of the system. Why on earth would you try to place a barrier in the way of people accessing a general practitioner? That is exactly what this GP tax will do. Essentially, it appears the government wants to introduce a two-tiered system: one system where those who have the means to pay will have access and another system where people will not have access to the entire system, which is a slippery slope to ending the universality of Medicare.


In the concluding minutes I have allotted to me, I also want to briefly talk about the government's record in relation to prevention. Millions of dollars have been taken out of—just terminated—the National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health. We have seen the abolition of the Preventative Health Agency. We have seen $3 million taken out of the National Tobacco Campaign. We have seen members flirting in the media about the repeal of plain-packaging legislation. This government has absolutely abandoned prevention. We have slashing of primary care, slashing of public hospitals and ending of commitment to prevention. Where is this government's health policy? It does not have one. (Time expired)
