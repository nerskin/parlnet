Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (13:09):  In summing up in relation to the Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017, can I just put on the record that this bill delivers on an election commitment by the government to establish a regional investment corporation. We're establishing this corporation because we know that a high-performing agricultural sector is good for farmers, good for regional communities and good for national prosperity.


As a nation, we want to make sure that we have strong and resilient farms and farm businesses that can seize the opportunities that are before us. In such a competitive and challenging environment, we need to make sure that we give the tools to those farm businesses that they need to take advantage of these opportunities. We also need the right water infrastructure in place for agriculture to expand and increase its productivity. Establishing the corporation will support both of these goals. The corporation will deliver the Commonwealth's farm business loans program nationally and this will be a significant step forward. Because we believe that we need to be more responsive in providing these loans to meet the needs of farm businesses, loans decisions will also be made consistently across the country under this new instrument. 


The farm business loans program offered by the corporation will be improved and expanded. Its loans will help farm businesses take advantage of opportunities to diversify in the markets they supply and the loans will boost farm productivity and cash flow, and provide positive economic and social flow-on effects to the entire Australian community. The corporation will not be a lender of last resort. The focus will be on giving a hand-up to those farmers who are viable but in need of temporary short-term assistance. The corporation will administer the National Water Loan Facility, providing independent, expert advice to government on water infrastructure projects; it will then administer loans on behalf of the Commonwealth with the right expertise. 


The provisions of the bill were examined in an inquiry by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. The committee recommended that the bill be passed and considered that its enactment would streamline the delivery of concessional loans for farm businesses and for water infrastructure. Obviously, the government welcomes that finding. Despite the committee's overall recommendation, I note that Labor senators provided a dissenting report, which raised a number of issues with the bill and the proposed establishment of the corporation. The policy rationale for establishing the corporation is quite clear. As for the governance and the oversight arrangements, they are appropriate for a corporate Commonwealth entity and align with what the parliament has agreed for similar entities, such as the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. I note that in addition to the requirements in the bill, the corporation will be subject to the requirements of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013, which forms an important part of the overall governance structure. In addition, the corporation will be subject to the usual Senate scrutiny process. 


To conclude, establishing the corporation will make a significant contribution to stronger and more prosperous rural and regional communities across the whole of the country. Its loans will help farm businesses build and maintain diversity in the markets they supply. It will also help support the construction of priority water infrastructure to stimulate investment, economic growth and increase agricultural productivity in rural and regional Australia. Establishing the corporation demonstrates this government's commitment to the Australian farm sector. 



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the bill be now read a second time.

"Gallagher, Sen Katy",ALP,2017-10-17,"



Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (13:20):  I rise in the committee stage to make a few comments on the Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017 and to perhaps make a broader point about the management of the government's business program. If we use this bill as an example, we have seen over the last two days this bill move up the program and down the program a bit yesterday, and then start listed in third place for bills today and be moved up to first position at the last minute before the program was printed. We saw the ridiculous position of bringing a bill on for debate and then having government members filibustering on that bill for at least four hours on a Monday, which is the day, one would presume, the government would like to progress through their legislative program promptly—that is, if they actually wanted bills passed.


The point I'd like to make is that I think it's disrespectful to the crossbench managing the program this way—putting bills on and off, moving them up the program, making these changes, filibustering and bringing it back on for debate this morning. We hear that there are government amendments that may be moved. We haven't seen any of those. We don't know if there are actually any government amendments; we hear rumours circulating that there are, but we haven't seen them. The expectation by the government is, presumably, that we should just be able to process these amendments, form positions on them, debate them, ask questions on them and deal with them without any notice at all. I guess, in general, the government cannot manage its program, and that has been exemplified by the management of this bill.


If, come Wednesday night or Thursday, there are a whole range of bills that the government do want progressed, I would draw their attention to the fact that they have used up the majority of their government business time on Monday actually filibustering their own bill. The opposition will not be disposed positively towards any extension or any motion by the government seeking to extend hours to deal with bills because they have failed miserably to manage this bill in an orderly way that respects other people in this chamber. For the crossbench and for the opposition, it means we have to ensure that people are ready with speeches at a time when the bill might be on, even though it might not be on, it might be pulled halfway or it might come back on without notice.


Now, we get the fact that the government needs to change its program from time to time. We are sympathetic to the reality of running a program, but this is becoming standard practice. It's not something that happens rarely, happens only in exceptional circumstances or happens when there are legitimate reasons; it is happening every business day and it is happening every sitting week. I see that the government amendments now have been circulated, but we're at the point in time when senators are expected to debate these amendments and, presumably, vote on them without any opportunity to discuss them more thoroughly and form a position on them. So, that's the point I'd make.


I hope that the manager of government business is listening because I am making this point not just on this bill but on the management of the government program as a whole. I think you can just look at the amount of time that the Senate is having to sit extended hours to deal with the mismanagement of the government and how it approaches its discussions around getting legislation through this Senate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-17,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (13:24):  I support the comments made by Senator Gallagher. What we've seen in the last couple of days is nothing short of a complete shambles and a complete disrespect for this chamber. We have just received the government's amendments. I haven't had a chance to go through these amendment or the implications of the amendments proposed by the government. But I would like to say that I was very disappointed in the fact that we've come to the in committee stage and that a vote to oppose this bill outright defeated. I would also like to put the party's position on record. We do believe that the bill should have been chucked out. We believe that this is, again, the Deputy Prime Minister's pork barrel for a political advantage.


The Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017 has been developed with no cost-benefit analysis as to whether the corporation will actually deliver any of the claims put forward by the government. There has been no transparent or fair process undertaken by the government to determine where the location of the RIC will be. In fact, a government senator, in their contribution, also questioned the location of the RIC. As I've said, the RIC is just another effort by Mr Joyce to serve a political purpose only.


Another point that the Labor Party made in our contribution to this bill was about the cost of establishing the RIC. We believe that the true cost is $81 million over the forwards, with the potential to be higher if there's a low intake of loans. The existing current loans that are administered by states and the Northern Territory will remain the responsibility of the states and the Territory. Establishing a new body to administer new loans is a waste of taxpayers' money, is inefficient and is costly.


There was a Senate inquiry into this bill. I would like to take a few moments to go through what the dissenting report from Labor senators reported. It was noted in that report that the government:


• Has failed to provide any coherent policy rationale for the establishment of the Regional Investment Corporation (RIC);


• Has offered mixed messages when enunciating the policy objectives for the establishment of the RIC;


And, as I've said, and as the Senate dissenting report on this bill also noted, the government:


• Has failed to undertake a cost-benefit analysis to give confidence that the $28m cost of establishing and operating the RIC delivers good value for the Australian taxpayer;


But it is not unusual when something comes from Mr Barnaby Joyce that there's a failure to undertake a cost-benefit analysis. Given that there hasn't been a cost-benefit analysis, it doesn't give confidence that the $28 million cost—the government's own figure, I might add—of establishing and operating the RIC delivers good value for the Australian taxpayer. I will return to the dissenting report on this bill later in the committee stage.


The Labor Party have proposed and circulated a number of amendments, and we will be requesting that those amendments be moved separately. We are hoping that the minister at the table will seek to explain the intention of the government amendments that have just been put before us.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-17,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (13:29):  Firstly, in response to the comments of Senator Brown in relation to the costs, there were some wildly exaggerated figures thrown around in the House of Representatives when this particular bill, the Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017, was debated. There was some sort of bizarre suggestion that this was going to cost taxpayers $81.4 million over the forwards. That is manifestly false. The government provided $28.5 million in the budget of May 2017 for the current program to establish the RIC over the next four years. Those funds will be offset against charges and are expected to be cost neutral over the life of the project.


In relation to the policy intent of the organisation that we're seeking to establish under the bill, as I said in my summing up notes following the finalisation of the second reading speech, it is for a number of purposes, not least of which is to get a more responsive and streamlined approach to get money to our farmers as quickly as possible when they're most in need. Creating a purpose designed organisation to enable us to be very quick and responsive in times of need for our farmers is a very sound and valid policy reason for the establishment of this particular corporation. It's about giving farmers the quickest and easiest opportunity to respond to unforeseen circumstances and, most importantly, take advantage of market opportunities.


In offering to administer the national water infrastructure loans and grants program through this organisation, we provide a far greater level of transparency than is currently necessary. So it seems somewhat bizarre that those opposite would not accept the offer extended by the government in good faith to provide a greater level of transparency and accountability in relation to the administration of a considerable amount of taxpayers' funds for the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund.


Senator Brown, in her opening remarks, asked me to explain the reasoning behind the small amendments that we have tabled for consideration today. Explicitly included in this bill is a statement to make it absolutely clear that the responsible ministers under this instrumentality, should it become enacted, must exercise their powers consistently with the Water Act. That was implicit in the existing bill, but we put it forward to make sure that it is explicitly stated in this bill that the ministers must act consistently with the Water Act. We are proposing to put forward an added level of transparency. We have charged the Murray-Darling Basin Authority with the responsibility of ensuring that any actions that are taken by the RIC meet the requirements of the Water Act, and we would have a second body that would validate that the Water Act has been complied with, and that validation would be made public. That is the intent of the amendments that have been tabled by the government in relation to this bill, Senator Brown.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (13:34):  I thank the minister for some explanation as to the amendments that the government has put forward, but a first question comes to mind. These two amendments are directed to the Murray-Darling Basin. I would like to know: what does that mean for the water infrastructure projects that are outside the Murray-Darling Basin?

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (13:34):  Before I respond to Senator Brown's question, I table the supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to the bill.


Senator Brown, in response to your question in relation to how these amendments apply in relation to the Murray-Darling Basin versus the Water Act, the principal amendment, which is seeking to amend clause 12(3A) on page 11, says the minister must act consistently with the Water Act. The Water Act obviously covers more than the Murray-Darling Basin, so it is in essence a broad-reaching requirement that the RIC must be compliant with the Water Act in relation to all federal water policy.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (13:41):  I am just seeking clarification on what you are seeking in response to the answer to the question. At the moment, the administration of this particular suite of loans package is being administered under the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources. Obviously we are seeking to have the Regional Investment Corporation undertake the administration of these loans in the future, so I am not quite sure what the question is you are asking. The terms and conditions, the requirements and the objectives we are seeking to achieve by this particular suite of loans package remains the same. We are just seeking for it to be administered by the corporation because we believe it will be delivered in a more streamlined and effective way.

Senator RUSTON

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (13:43):  Ultimately, the decision about the most efficient and effective way to administer and deliver these particular programs, should this bill become successful and translate into the establishment of the corporation, would be made by the corporation. There have been, to my knowledge, no discussions specifically about outsourcing particular aspects of these loan instruments. Is there anything that you have specifically got an issue about? To the best of my knowledge, I can't think of anything that has been discussed to date.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-17,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (13:44):  Minister, I am attempting to find out some detail around the intent of the bill and exactly what discussions have been had because, quite frankly, of the secrecy around it. It is not transparent in the bill as to the actual need for, in my view, the Regional Investment Corporation. Quite often we see in legislation and bills that are produced by the Deputy Prime Minister a lack of transparency and a lack of good governance in legislation that he wants to put forward.


What I'm attempting to do is to find out, through the committee stage, exactly why we need the RIC. You talk about an efficient and effective way of delivering loans, but it certainly hasn't been demonstrated that this is going to be doing that—that the bill is actually going to deliver what you say that it will deliver.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-17,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (13:45):  Thank you, Senator Brown. Well, there are a number of things and factors here that have gone towards why the government believes that the Regional Investment Corporation is the appropriate mechanism by which to deliver loans into the rural and regional farm community.


Firstly, it is to come up with a nationally consistent approach to the delivery of these loans. Very often, when we find that we have a particular situation, it affects a number of states and territories. To have a consistent approach so that we don't have one farmer on one side of the fence and a farmer on the other side of the fence actually being treated differently is certainly seen to be a great advantage.


Secondly, because the corporation is going to be designed with the specific purpose of delivering this type of instrument then, obviously, the charter of the organisation, the mandate of the organisation and the authorities of the organisation will be particularly targeting the efficient and effective delivery of the activities that it is empowered to do.


And, obviously, lastly: as I mentioned to you earlier, an independently-established standalone organisation, like the proposal for the Regional Investment Corporation, delivers a level of transparency. Throughout the whole process of determination of the loan assets and the delivery of the programs transparency will be much greater under this particular organisation than is currently the case.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-17,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (13:47):  I could just ask how so, but, again, I will go to the dissenting report from Labor senators. That has really homed in on one of the great concerns the opposition has with this legislation. It goes to the transparency and the governance in the bill. This is notwithstanding the two government amendments that you have just put forward—no doubt to garner the support of some on the crossbench. Otherwise, we wouldn't see these two amendments that enable some sort of transparency.


This is what the dissenting report said about the bill: the Labor senators believe that the enabling legislation has been structured deliberately to minimise parliamentary scrutiny and/or veto of ministerial directions. The report also indicated that the bill has failed to provide sufficient oversight for the activities of the corporation. Now, I do note, as I said, the two amendments. But they don't go anywhere near allaying concerns that this legislation addresses the lack of governance arrangements and the lack of transparency. And, of course, as we have said before, we believe there has been a lack of proper consultation on this bill, and nothing that you have said to me here this afternoon has allayed those fears. So if you can add to the consultation and address my concerns about lack of transparency and the lack of good governance arrangements, I'd appreciate that.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (13:49):  I will go to your second question first. I draw to the chamber's attention that the corporation will be accountable to the parliament through a series of measures that have been outlined in the bill, such as the requirement to table the operating mandate, requirements of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act—the PGPA Act—and it is also subject to the same Senate scrutiny processes. 


It's probably also worth mentioning that the approach proposed to be taken in this bill and that is written into this bill is very similar to other entities, including the Clean Energy Finance Corporation that was set up under previous arrangements. In a sense, what we have attempted to do in the drafting of this particular bill is to make sure it is consistent and replicates the kinds of requirements in relation to public governance and accountability, reporting and scrutiny, that have been applied to other similar types of organisations and government instruments.

It's certainly no surprise to the opposition that that is the case with anything that comes from the Deputy Prime Minister. It's like some sort of protection racket when it comes to legislation that he puts forward. There always appears to be a lack of detailed scrutiny and a lack of work carried out in terms of the initiatives that Mr Joyce puts forward. So it is no surprise that we again see the lack of parliamentary scrutiny with regard to this bill and, certainly, the lack of transparency. The minister hasn't allayed those concerns for the opposition in her answer at all. What I would like to ask the minister is: what work has the government done to establish the RIC in Orange? 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-17,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (13:53):  We will start from the beginning. Firstly, I don't think for a minute that you are suggesting that the government, of which you were a member when you established the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, were running a protection racket when you put in the provisions in terms of the public governance, accountability and reporting of that particular organisation. On the basis that this particular bill is proposing to establish this organisation in an almost mirror image of how that organisation was established along its governance, accountability and reporting requirements, I'm not quite sure why you would suggest that we are running, as you put it, 'a protection racket'. I'd be interested to hear from you the difference between your establishment of something not being a protection racket, but you seem to think you can throw that at us. 


In relation to the specifics of the requirements in relation to governance, accountability and reporting, as I said, the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 requires this particular organisation to be subject to the provisions of that particular act, as is every other entity of a similar type. You'll also note that, because of the way it's been established, this organisation will be subject to the same sort of Senate scrutiny as others through the estimates process, in which you, obviously, actively take part.


There is, we believe, an appropriate level of parliamentary oversight over the directions of the responsible ministers through exactly the same method and means and in exactly the same way as you have accepted over many years with the reporting of other organisations. This will be no different. The level of oversight, reporting, accountability and transparency will be absolutely no different to other organisations of similar establishment. So I'm struggling to work out what particular aspect of the proposed establishment of this organisation you see as different to the mechanisms and requirements of the establishment of other organisations—as I said, particularly the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, set up under your government.

The Australian government, as this chamber would be well aware, has a very strong commitment to rural and regional Australia, and the decision made by the government to locate the Regional Investment Corporation outside our capital cities is clearly consistent with that policy. I don't know whether you've spent much time in Orange, but Orange is a really important agricultural hub in this country. It's well serviced by transport links to the major capital cities, particularly Sydney. We are seeing an extraordinary increase in growth in this community and the relocation of a number of New South Wales government departments to Orange, creating a very strong rural and regional agricultural hub in that community. The decision to locate this organisation in Orange is extraordinarily consistent with the government policy to establish strong regional centres across the whole of Australia.

 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (13:58):  As I said in my answer to the previous question, I'm sure that everybody in this chamber who comes from a rural and regional community would be delighted to have a government entity, particularly of the size, importance and prestige of the Regional Investment Corporation, located in their community. But, for the reasons that I stated in my previous answer, the decision was made that Orange was a very suitable place for this organisation to be located. Obviously, should we be successful in enacting the establishment of this organisation, it will be up to the board to undertake the preparatory work about the location of the agency in Orange.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-17,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (13:09):  In summing up in relation to the Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017, can I just put on the record that this bill delivers on an election commitment by the government to establish a regional investment corporation. We're establishing this corporation because we know that a high-performing agricultural sector is good for farmers, good for regional communities and good for national prosperity.


As a nation, we want to make sure that we have strong and resilient farms and farm businesses that can seize the opportunities that are before us. In such a competitive and challenging environment, we need to make sure that we give the tools to those farm businesses that they need to take advantage of these opportunities. We also need the right water infrastructure in place for agriculture to expand and increase its productivity. Establishing the corporation will support both of these goals. The corporation will deliver the Commonwealth's farm business loans program nationally and this will be a significant step forward. Because we believe that we need to be more responsive in providing these loans to meet the needs of farm businesses, loans decisions will also be made consistently across the country under this new instrument. 


The farm business loans program offered by the corporation will be improved and expanded. Its loans will help farm businesses take advantage of opportunities to diversify in the markets they supply and the loans will boost farm productivity and cash flow, and provide positive economic and social flow-on effects to the entire Australian community. The corporation will not be a lender of last resort. The focus will be on giving a hand-up to those farmers who are viable but in need of temporary short-term assistance. The corporation will administer the National Water Loan Facility, providing independent, expert advice to government on water infrastructure projects; it will then administer loans on behalf of the Commonwealth with the right expertise. 


The provisions of the bill were examined in an inquiry by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. The committee recommended that the bill be passed and considered that its enactment would streamline the delivery of concessional loans for farm businesses and for water infrastructure. Obviously, the government welcomes that finding. Despite the committee's overall recommendation, I note that Labor senators provided a dissenting report, which raised a number of issues with the bill and the proposed establishment of the corporation. The policy rationale for establishing the corporation is quite clear. As for the governance and the oversight arrangements, they are appropriate for a corporate Commonwealth entity and align with what the parliament has agreed for similar entities, such as the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. I note that in addition to the requirements in the bill, the corporation will be subject to the requirements of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013, which forms an important part of the overall governance structure. In addition, the corporation will be subject to the usual Senate scrutiny process. 


To conclude, establishing the corporation will make a significant contribution to stronger and more prosperous rural and regional communities across the whole of the country. Its loans will help farm businesses build and maintain diversity in the markets they supply. It will also help support the construction of priority water infrastructure to stimulate investment, economic growth and increase agricultural productivity in rural and regional Australia. Establishing the corporation demonstrates this government's commitment to the Australian farm sector. 



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the bill be now read a second time.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2017-10-17,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:04):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Senators Kitching, Dastyari and Singh today relating to energy.


What an interesting garble we heard from the other side today in relation to relation to this new plan from the Liberal government! The party room, as I understand from media reports, agreed to ditch the CET and adopt a National Energy Guarantee that requires electricity retailers to have a minimum amount of power constantly available. Prime Minister Turnbull said that the new plan is a 'game changer'.


It's really interesting because, over a number of years, Minister Turnbull has backed and supported an emissions trading scheme, a carbon tax, an emissions intensity scheme, a clean energy target and a stronger renewable energy target. Now he's backing a National Energy Guarantee. It makes you wonder what he's going to be supporting and backing in tomorrow. Each of these positions, basically, is being pushed by the previous Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, who, it appears, has much more say on that side of the parliament than Mr Turnbull does. Mr Turnbull made his announcement this morning—and we are yet to see detail of it, I might add. I can't find any detail.



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator URQUHART:
  It's been released, says Senator Brandis. Where would we find that, Senator Brandis? It's interesting—I haven't been able to find it. What Prime Minister Turnbull has done is turn his back on his own Chief Scientist. They have turned their back completely on the report that Dr Finkel put out. They have turned their back on renewable energy. Renewable energy is one of the things on the horizon that will create jobs and provide lots of opportunities in regional Australia. We heard Senator Scullion a moment ago talk about how they know regional Australia and how wonderful they are, but he read word for word off a piece of paper. How well does he know regional Australia when he has to read the answer to a dorothy dixer question from his own side? He can't even talk about regional Australia. Well, I tell you, I can—I talk to people on the west coast of Tasmania, who are waiting and have been waiting since Mr Abbott was the Prime Minister and absolutely wrecked the clean energy target, absolutely wrecked the wind industry and absolutely wrecked any renewable opportunities for industries to grow and grow in places where we absolutely need jobs.


From the package of leaks to different newspapers this morning, we can clearly see that this government is hell-bent on absolutely destroying the renewable energy industry and severely restricting growth in Australia over the coming years and decades. That's what this demonstrates. It's like they said: 'We've got a thought bubble today, so we'll run with that. It sounds like a great idea. We won't take any notice of what the Chief Scientist says—oh, no, he wouldn't know. He doesn't have the expertise. So we'll just come up with what we think will placate our backbench and other people and go along with Mr Tony Abbott.' It is a thought bubble to dump the Chief Scientist's recommendation. The Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party this morning was unable to answer any basic questions of detail on the package.



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator URQUHART:
  He could not answer any questions at all. Clearly, the announcement made this morning is the capitulation by the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, to Tony Abbott's hard right-wing agenda for Australia, which is now utterly complete. He's almost got there—the only thing that he's not doing is getting the salary of the Prime Minister.


It was reported in newspapers this morning that renewable energy growth will be restricted over the coming three decades to just 4½ per cent—4½ per cent growth in the renewable energy industry over 30 years. That places at risk thousands and thousands of jobs in the renewable energy industry and makes it utterly clear that Australia is completely unable to satisfy and discharge its commitments around carbon pollution reduction that were made at the Paris conference in 2015. This government should be ashamed of itself for moving the goalposts. (Time expired)

"Duniam, Sen Jonathon",LP,2017-10-17,"



Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (15:09):  It's great to be following Senator Urquhart in taking note of the answers that were provided during question time, but I struggle to understand the point of view that Senator Urquhart is conveying in this chamber. She commenced her contribution by talking about rumours and media reports about what was announced today, rather than actually focusing on the facts.


Talking about ignoring experts was one of the points that Senator Urquhart made. As the Attorney-General pointed out in his answer to questions asked by the opposition today, it was, in fact, experts that were relied upon for the creation of this policy—people on the Energy Security Board, many of whom were appointed by the former Labor government. These are people that the shadow spokesperson for energy has termed as excellent appointments as well. Obviously, what they do is good, so why are these experts now not producing work that's acceptable to those on that side of the chamber?


Not once in question time today did we hear the opposition talk about the issues of reliability and affordability—not at all. It was all about a particular obsession with one thing, and that's renewables—this talk of renewable jobs. I heard Senator Urquhart say that there will be thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs at risk because the renewables sector will only be growing at 4½ per cent. I thought I heard in there the word 'growing', which means that there should be more jobs being created. But it's like they're looking at that issue in isolation, not thinking about those who have to pay power bills—those factories that need affordable, reliable energy to be able to function and to produce the goods that they are there to produce and to support the workers who work in their factories, like dairy operations.


A couple of times during question time today there were references to obsessions with coal as well. Well, Senator Urquhart is a senator for Tasmania, as is Senator Singh, who asked one of the questions, the answers to which we are taking note of today. We also have a coalmine in our state, the Cornwall Coal Mine down on the east coast in the Fingal Valley, which employs a great many people in the regional community. Those opposite aren't concerned about those jobs. What about the people who work at the Cement Australia cement factory in Railton and the hundreds of people there? Does Senator Urquhart want to come with me to a factory located close to both of our electorate offices? Would she like to come out with me, meet the workers there and see how they feel about this notion of abandoning all support for industries that rely on that source of energy—a cheap source of energy? Probably not. I doubt she would accept my invitation to come out with me.


The notion of doing away with subsidies is at the heart of this great policy, which draws a line in the sand and provides certainty moving forward. It creates a situation where we will have reliable and affordable energy. It is something people have been calling out for—business groups, individuals down the street and people on the other side of the chamber. It's something they've wanted for so long. But here we are providing it, and all we get are complaints and criticism. No real analysis, just typical opposition tactics.


But the subsidies proposed by the opposition in their policy are $66 billion worth of subsidies to prop up the jobs that Senator Urquhart was talking about. That's what they cost. Who pays for that? The taxpayer. They're paid for through people's power bills! It's okay for people who live down in the capital city and who don't have to earn their money—




Senator McKim:
  Who pays for climate change? Your children!




Senator DUNIAM:
  Indeed, this does honour our international commitments, taking Senator McKim's interjections. It does deal with that as well. But we seem to be hearing complaints from those opposite that it's all about one part of this debate. People need to turn their power on at home; they need power to live. Businesses need power to function. It's a simple thing that many on the other side seem to have missed. So I do urge senators opposite to go and familiarise themselves with the detail in the policy that was announced today and understand what it's all about. Grab a copy of the document and go and find out what it means to be committed to ensuring we have a reliable and affordable source of energy for our communities—




Senator McCarthy:
  Where is it?




Senator DUNIAM:
  It's right here, Senator McCarthy. I'll walk you a copy around shortly. But it's so important, and so drop the ideology and stand up for Australians and for what they really need. (Time expired)

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2017-10-17,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:14):  In this question time we asked the question, and it's a logical question to ask: given the Prime Minister's many commitments to various approaches to climate policy, and given how many times he has adopted a position and abandoned it at the first headwind, how can we trust him on this latest announcement?


This latest announcement—a three-letter acronym, the NEG—is the new thing we're all supposed to believe in. But why is this any different from the litany of programs adopted by the Prime Minister and abandoned the moment Mr Abbott raised his voice? I can run through them again. He was a supporter of the ETS, he was a supporter of the carbon tax, he was a supporter of an EIS, he was a supporter of a CET and he was a supporter of a RET. Now he's the supporter of a NEG. It doesn't inspire a lot of confidence, does it? We're now into the fifth year of this government—the fifth year in a period where there has been an investment strike. The day this crowd came into the parliament and assumed government they decided to abolish any coherent policy approach to dealing with climate change; and the investment community, quite reasonably, just didn't know what to do. Without clear policy settings about how we intend to address climate change as a nation, it is impossible to make rational assessments about how to direct your investment. And indeed that is what we have been told over and over again.


I was interested to hear Senator Duniam implore us to 'listen to the experts'. Well, I'll remind him of this: the experts have been talking to us for some time. The experts from industry, the expert academic economists and the expert market economists have been talking to us. And what they've been saying to us is, 'You need to put some certainty around the investment environment.' We have waited for four years and we're into our fifth year ,and now we're expected to believe that the NEG is the thing that is going to create that certainty. 


I saw Senator Duniam waving around a glossy brochure, and I look forward to receiving my copy of that glossy brochure. I have spent the last hour and a half trawling the internet trying to find written down details of this policy that has been announced by a press release and, I understand, perhaps on a social media video from the Prime Minister. I think we deserve a little bit more than that. I think we need to understand the analysis and the modelling that lies behind the set of propositions that are being wheeled out now.


But I will tell you what I've been able to find out in the short time that's been able to me. This thing, this policy, involves an emissions guarantee. What is that? How will it work? We don't really know. We had some explanation read out rather laboriously by Senator Scullion. As far as I can tell, the actual target that will form the basis of this emissions guarantee is yet to be set. As far as I can tell from the reports being made in the media, this guarantee is something that is going to be 'worked through' in the lead-up to COAG. So, in fact, we've got absolutely no idea what it is that this guarantee represents. What part of the emissions reduction task that we are committed to in our Paris agreement will this emissions guarantee play? We don't know, because the level hasn't been set, and quite obviously the modelling associated with it has not been done.


It's the same with the reliability guarantee. What is the standard that is to be set? That hasn't been announced publicly and again, as I understand it, this is something to be 'worked through' as we approach COAG. This isn't a policy; this is a set of aspirations and a kind of plea that hopefully they can get together with state and territory governments and work something out as they approach the next COAG. Mr Frydenberg was asked today: 'How can you make these commitments about the cost to households, how can you make these commitments that costs will go down, if you have made none of the decisions about the actual targets to be established in this guarantee?' He responded in this way: 'The Commonwealth will be asking the AEMC to do detailed analysis and modelling of the specific proposal in the lead-up to discussions at COAG. We will provide, if you like, firmer estimates of those price effects. The price numbers you are referring to are based on, if you like, analysis and modelling of the market and the alternative schemes we have looked at in the past. It's an average over the 10 years.' Nothing there. Completely hopeless. All hot air.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2017-10-17,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:19):  The announcement this morning and this afternoon of the latest developments in the government's energy policy comes on the back of numerous other policy achievements. At the end of the parliamentary fortnight of this parliament four weeks ago the government successfully passed its media law reform package. In addition to that we've had success just this morning, today. The foreign minister has successfully argued and campaigned across the globe to make sure that Australia had a seat at the United Nations Human Rights Council.


Senator Urquhart's contribution was to reflect on Julie Bishop, the member for Curtin, the foreign minister, on how she wasn't completely aware of the details of this policy. Senator Urquhart did not even have the decency or the graciousness to acknowledge the great work the foreign minister had been doing with her No. 1 priority, which is, of course, managing the foreign affairs of this country. 


But, ladies and gentlemen, we could have climate peace in our time, and it's beholden only to the attitudes of those on the other side, because there's a very, very clear choice here. They can choose to accept the expert advice, which was made clear in the blueprint which was laid out in the Finkel review—and I'll come to that in a moment—or they can choose not to trust the experts.



Senator McAllister interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  Senator McAllister, some experts are more expert than others, I'm afraid. I suggest that the experts that the government has gathered together on energy policy are the right experts to be listened to. They are more expert than you, and, dare I say it, they are more expert than myself and than many, many senators in this place.


Before I get to the Finkel review, because this is very, very important—the Energy Security Board was a deliberate, conscious and well thought out recommendation of the Finkel review—Labor senators in this place have been keen to scoff at the suggestion that Australian residential energy consumers will be $100 to $115 better off a year as a result of the energy reforms of this government. They scoff at that. Let me remind you that under the carbon tax in my home state of Western Australia residential consumers would have been $134 a year worse off under Labor's carbon tax policy. All I do this afternoon is implore Labor senators to go back to the evidence.


For those of you who watch question time, you might recall that over the last few weeks and the last few months Labor has been quick to criticise the government for not accepting each and every one of the Finkel review recommendations. Today, the Prime Minister has announced, after very careful consideration, a plan that builds on a very specific recommendation of the Finkel review. To make it easier for people who might be listening at home or listening and watching in the gallery, all you need to do is go to page 26 of the Finkel review, recommendation 7.2 under the title of 'Stronger governance'. It makes it very clear. The Finkel review says:


The COAG—


the Council of Australian Governments—


Energy Council should immediately agree to establish an Energy Security Board to have responsibility for the implementation of the blueprint and for providing whole-of-system oversight for energy security and reliability.


It says:


• The Energy Security Board should be provided with the necessary funding to operate.


• The Energy Security Board should be comprised of an independent Chair, supported by an independent Deputy Chair, with the Chief Executive of the Australian Energy Market Operator and the Chairs of the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Energy Market Commission as members.


As part of the same recommendation it goes on to say:


• Administrative support for the Energy Security Board should be provided by the Australian Energy Market Operator.


Why is that, recommendation 7.2, important? Because it is the Energy Security Board that has advised the government and recommended the National Energy Guarantee.


The government has chosen to trust the experts, because this is an area where experts can and should be trusted. For those people who are interested in a more thorough explanation about why it is that the Energy Security Board is necessary—and I invite Senator McKim to start with this in his contribution—you only need to go to page 157 of the Finkel review to see why this is an important and solid first step in providing reliable energy to Australian— (Time expired)

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2017-10-17,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:24):  The worst-kept secret has been revealed today. Who would have thought that we would be in some way shocked to hear that the coalition government has decided to baulk on the Finkel review's clean energy target. The worst-kept secret that Australians have been waiting to hear has come to fruition. And not only has the Prime Minister turned his back on his own chief scientist, but, in doing so, he has embraced the former Prime Minister Tony Abbott's vision of Australian energy, which brings Australia's energy policy back to the 1950s.


But what is really, really unclear is what this new energy policy of the government is really all about, because we are hearing conflicting views when it comes to detail—as usual—from this Turnbull government. The AEMC CEO, Mr John Pierce, today told Sky News that there are indeed different modelling scenarios when it comes to the National Energy Guarantee. This is where Australians are again completely bewildered as to what this government's policy is.


We know that the Prime Minister and the energy minister have been spruiking an average annual power bill reduction of $115 under these new energy reforms. But now we hear from the AEMC's John Pierce that there are different modelling scenarios, and it may indeed be as low as $25 a year according to some confidential modelling. So what is the reality here? How can this government try and hoodwink the Australian people into believing there will be a saving of $115 a year when a very pre-eminent individual by the name of John Pierce, from the AEMC, who the government has been relying on, has made it very clear there are different scenarios and one scenario is as low as $25? That just completely blows this policy out of the water. And all of the rhetoric that Malcolm Turnbull, Minister Josh Frydenberg and the Leader of Government in the Senate, Senator Brandis, have been spruiking is why Labor today asked pertinent questions as to the detail of what this is all about.




Senator Brandis:
  You were the only one who asked a question.




Senator SINGH:
  Indeed I did ask questions, Senator Brandis, around investment in renewables and around investment in jobs—because we rely very much on analysis such as that done by Ernst & Young, which said Labor's 50 per cent renewable target will create 28,000 jobs, whereas Prime Minister Turnbull has turned his back on renewables and therefore turned his back on thousands of new renewable energy jobs.



So not only are we losing out on jobs, we're also losing out on the savings that this government continues to rely on because of what I have just alluded to in the Senate and made clear in the Senate—that the Australian Energy Market Commission's chair, John Pierce, has made it very clear that there are different modelling scenarios and, under one scenario, the savings for families will be just $25 a year in 2020. What a great policy this is that this government is trying to hoodwink the Australian people with! Well, the only one who is buying this policy, the only one who's probably cracking open the champagne right now, is former Prime Minister Tony Abbott—because, let's face it, he is the one who's still really running this country. He is the one that Malcolm Turnbull continues to capitulate to. He is the one, along with the other hard-right members in the coalition, who this government has completely sold out to. Senator Brandis, you should be ashamed and embarrassed because I know you're not one of those hard-right members of the coalition. But, in doing nothing and in going along with them, you certainly have sold yourself out, as has the Prime Minister. But you didn't only sell out what's important for Australia—to be a leader in energy and renewable energy, to have the right energy mix for the country; you also hoodwinked Australians in the process.

Senator McGRATH:
  Thank you. The coalition strongly opposed Labor's repeal of the voluntary student unionism laws passed under the Howard government. For many Liberals and conservatives, guaranteeing students the basic right to freely associate and not be forced to join or contribute funds to a student union has been a lifelong principle. The government will support part (a).


However, part (b) does not reflect the key principle of ensuring freedom of association for all students at all times. It creates an illusion of voluntary student unionism through the use of campus- or institution-wide ballots. Compelling all students to join and fund an organisation by a ballot of their peers is just as illegitimate on campus as if it happened in a workplace or anywhere else in our community. As such, I ask that the question on part (a) be put separately from the question on part (b).

The speech read as follows—



COAL-FIRED POWER FUNDING PROHIBITION BILL 2017


Coal is dying. It's an industry in structural decline and almost every other leader in the world understands this except for Malcolm Turnbull and Donald Trump. 


The world is rapidly moving away from dirty old coal – a legacy technology – and making the transition towards clean, green renewable energy. 


In 2017, coal makes no sense. It doesn't stack up economically or environmentally and it is literally killing people. Not only are the emissions from coal-fired generation making global warming worse, but chemicals like mercury and sulphur dioxide are also being spewed into our atmosphere from burning coal. In Australia, we emit mercury at double the global average and inhaling it and other toxic chemicals carries serious health risks. 


Coal doesn't even work when you need it to. During heatwaves in NSW, Liddell was unable to perform as two of its generator units were unable to switch on due to unforeseen boiler tube leaks. 


There's a reason that no-one in the private sector is building new coal-fired power stations. It doesn't stack up economically. No-one is interested in investing billions of dollars into a giant coal-fired power station that no-one is going to want to switch on in a few years. No-one is interested in sinking capital investment into an ageing technology when the cost of renewables is plummeting and getting cheaper by the day. Investing in coal is about as sensible as investing in a company that builds fax machines and type-writers.


The cost of renewables is plummeting and we live in one of the sunniest, windiest places in the world. If this government had any vision, they'd be positioning Australia to take advantage of the energy revolution. We would be leading the world in renewable energy technology, we'd have some of the lowest prices in the world and we'd be reducing pollution across the economy. 


Instead, we're being left behind. While Minister Frydenberg waxes lyrical about the falling cost of renewables, China is getting on with it and introducing an Emissions Trading Scheme. While the Treasurer and Minister Joyce throw chunks of coal around in Parliament, Germany has been getting up to 85 percent of its electricity from renewable sources on sunny, windy days this year.


To ensure we transition to a nation that is powered by renewables, we need to do two things at once: rapidly introduce clean, cheap, reliable renewable energy into the system, and conduct an orderly retirement of coal-fired power stations. Renewables in, coal out.


But that hasn't stopped this government from peddling their dangerous obsession with coal. So now, we have to stop them.


The conservatives in this place only live and die by the market when it suits them. Right now – markets around the world are forcing out coal and the falling cost of renewables and storage is only going to make them more competitive. So now they're openly talking about frantically pulling on the only lever that's available to them – using public money that should be going to schools and hospitals to fund coal. This is a truly desperate and despicable step by a Prime Minister that's doing anything he can to hang onto power.


Now, the government is trying to build a public case to keep the decrepit old clunker Liddell open, a joint that's held together by spit and sticky-tape. Liddell is falling apart and the current owners, AGL, don't want to spend the money keeping it open, so some in the government are talking about dipping into the public purse to help this old station stay open.


It should be illegal to use public money in this way. Public money that should be going to schools and hospitals. Public money that should be spent on science and research. Public money that should be spent on reducing inequality in this country and ensuring that everyone has access to a high quality education. Public money that should be spent securing our renewable energy future. Public money should be used in the public interest. If the government is wanting to use public money to burn our planet and make climate change worse, that should be illegal. We have to stop them.


The private Senator's bill I introduce today, the Coal-Fired Power Funding Prohibition Bill 2017 prohibits: 


the Commonwealth providing financial support to refurbish or build a coal-fired power station; and 


The Commonwealth purchasing, or assisting with the purchase or transfer or ownership, of a coal-fired power station.


However, this bill does ensure that the government can provide public money to transition-affected workers into new industry or use public money to manage the closure of a coal-fired power station.


Let's be very clear about this: Coal. Kills. Whether it's through the toxic pollutants it spews into the atmosphere that affect the air we breathe, or the global warming that it accelerates that will destroy our way of life – we need to stop burning coal. Already, industry and investment are moving away from coal. No major financial institution in Australia wants to finance Adani and no-one is interested in building new coal-fired power stations. This government and the Trumps in the backbench who control it are resisting and opposing what the markets they claim to worship are telling them, what the science is telling them, what the private sector is telling them, what public opinion is telling them and, most importantly, what the world is telling them. In their blind, dangerous resistance they are turning to the only option they have left: a culture war.


They're using their leverage over Prime Minister Turnbull to condemn our future generations and the Greens are the only ones willing to stand in the way.


Why? Because you can't count on Labor to do it. Labor and Liberals are wedded to each other and wedded to coal. The Labor party tries to talk the talk on renewables and a Clean Energy Target, but then, when the Greens introduce a motion into this place to rule out any attempts to extend the life of Liddell and to develop a plan for an orderly transition away from coal, where do they vote? They vote with the government.


Because when push comes to shove, the Labor party are still beholden to the fossil fuel companies. Labor are still in the pocket of coal. Worse still, the revolving door between big interests isn't just for the Coalition, but the Labor party as well. According to an article published in The Conversation on the 22 of June last year, Martin Ferguson, Craig Emerson and Greg Combet all either took up management jobs with mining and energy companies and associations or worked as consultants for them. Earlier this year, The Australian revealed that Cameron Milner, who has worked for the premier of QLD and in the Leader of the Opposition's office, is volunteering with the ALP while keeping his day job as director and registered lobbyist at Next Level Strategic Services (NLSS), which counts among its clients Indian miner Adani.


But, the Greens have a plan. We've got a plan to extend the Renewable Energy Target which – despite what Senator Abetz and Mr Abbott say – is working, a plan to legislate a national storage target to run Australia on 100% renewable energy, a plan to transition workers from coal communities into the jobs of the future and a plan to re-regulate electricity prices to bring costs down and provide much needed relief for families around this country. We've laid out this plan and we're confident that if it was implemented, we could stabilise the grid, restore investment confidence and end the investment strike on renewables, bring down pollution, bring down prices and meet our paltry Paris obligations. 


It is ideology and weakness, from the Coalition and from Labor, that are standing in the way of the energy revolution. Instead, what we are served up from our government is fear-mongering that falsely blames blackouts on renewables. It is juvenile name-calling in the chamber and it is a government that instead of taking real action to bring down prices, forces energy retailers to write letters to customers telling them how much they've been ripped off.


Enough is enough.


I urge the Labor party and the crossbench to find the courage to support this bill so we can take one important step forward, when the government insists on going backwards. Our precious, scarce public money should not be used propping up old, clunky and dirty coal-fired power stations. If the government doesn't understand that, then we need to make sure that they can't waste our money on this ever again.

That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency: 


The Government within a month, reports to the Senate, on the number of jobs which would have been available to Australians but were taken by individuals on international student visas.


Why is it that almost a third of our youth are either unemployed or underemployed? I'm talking about kids between the ages of 15 and 24. And that stat isn't anything new. These figures have been around since the global financial crisis. I do note that our labour participation rate this year, which is around 62 per cent, is the highest it's been for around five years, and I hope it continues to grow, but I am surprised to learn that last year over 343,000 international student visas were granted. The department of immigration and citizenship does know this figure. How many of these students work, where do they work and do they get paid in cash or report it to the ATO? Apparently, around 100,000 young people on student visas work up to 20 hours a week. That's great. What happens to the other 200,000 people? We don't know. How is this possible? Meanwhile, we've got 273,000 local kids between the ages of 15 and 24 who are struggling, not working, and could be contributing to our local economy. I think it's important that we discover just how many jobs out there could have been taken up by young Australian people but instead were taken up by individuals on international student visas.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2017-10-17,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (16:07):  This motion, while it suggests that there's a concern from One Nation about levels of unemployment, is again a dog-whistling attempt to divide Australians, pit people against each other and turn Australians and people who live in this country against international students. We need to be concerned about underemployment, unemployment and the pressure that they're putting on people. The economy is not working for so many people, but attacking international students is not the way to go. International students actually are a source of cheap labour in this country. I congratulate the unions, who have taken a very fine lead here. They're working with many people from overseas, many of them students, who end up being so exploited. Often they're being paid between $10 and $14 an hour. Many of us would be served by these people when we go to cafes and restaurants, when we buy petrol and in convenience stores. It is a very serious problem, but not in the way it's defined by this motion. This motion is, in fact, very divisive and a real setback. As I just said, I congratulate the unions, who have been working to assist international students who are being exploited. Sometimes these companies are pretty ruthless. They often go belly up because they just want to reinvent themselves as phoenix companies, and the former workers are left with no money—and this can happen overnight. They even lose the meagre weekly income that they have.


There is the Fair Entitlements Guarantee scheme. That scheme was set up to step in when workers are left with nothing. What we find, though, is that they only provide support for people who cannot recover their entitlements and are Australian residents. Again, this is where these international students are so hard done by. They are paid appalling wages, and working conditions are absolutely shocking. Often there's a bit of racism on the side. Often they end up out of work, and there's nobody there to defend them. But, again, some unions have stepped in to fight for their conditions, even though they're often not members of the union. 


Their situation with regard to unemployment and underemployment is very serious in this country. And this is what we should be concentrating on: ensuring that there are well paid jobs that are unionised and have good working conditions for everybody. The Unemployed Workers' Union is doing some fine work in this area. From their analysis of the figures, there are more than 725,000 people unemployed and 1,059,000 underemployed. And this is very characteristic of Australia, as it has been for about the last 10 years. 


International students are an easy target for One Nation, and that is another disgraceful example of their tactics. There are more than half a million international students in this country—at our universities, at our TAFEs, at the private vocational schools—and many of them need to work. They're legally allowed to work for 20 hours a week. And they have to work, in many cases, because the cost of living is considerable in this country, and it is going up all the time. We know how tough it is to find rental accommodation at any reasonable price—many either have to, because of some of the private colleges they're at, or feel they should pay up-front fees. And so they do get caught up in illegal work. You've got the legal aspects of the work that many of the international students get involved in, and there's the illegal employment market as well.


We depend on these international students. Remember the huge revenue that they bring into our country. And there has been some shocking racism. There was a tragic situation with some Indian students. How we were treating these students here became a very big issue in India in terms of racism when they were studying and how they were treated at work. For the federal parliament to be debating a motion with this type of wording is destructive. It's more than unhelpful. It sends a very bad message not just to the international students themselves but to their communities and to the countries that they come from about what sort of country we are and what sort of people we are. It says that we're not really welcoming here. 


Clearly many of these people need to find work. And I want to emphasise that that work should be paid according to award wages. They should have decent working conditions, they should be able to join the union and they should be respected at work. They should not become just a cheap source of labour that allows so many of these companies to profit and to really boost their profits in such a shocking way. They take advantage of the fact that these students, many times, are very concerned that they'll get caught out and so they don't complain. This motion is a destructive, divisive motion and clearly should be defeated.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2017-10-17,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (16:13):  I welcome the opportunity that this motion provides to refute some of the misconceptions that exist in relation to international students and the role they play in Australia. This motion propagates some of those misconceptions; indeed, there are others, including some that Senator Rhiannon just spoke of. There are a number of misconceptions. Importantly, it is critical in the first instance to highlight that international students studying in Australia make an enormous net positive contribution to Australia in a number of ways. They make an enormous net positive contribution to the Australian economy, to education in Australia, and, indeed, to employment in Australia.


The growth of international education provision in our universities, in non-university higher education institutions, in our vocational education and training institutes, including TAFEs, across our schools and across English language providers, has been a remarkable success story of modern Australia. It is perhaps the most significant example of the way in which our economy has transitioned to create jobs and export income through a knowledge based services economy.


The numbers are quite stark now. International education is the third-largest export earner for Australia. It generates an estimated $28 billion in activity in Australia. That's students, and their families and friends who visit while they're here, spending on accommodation in Australia, on restaurants and services in Australia, on travelling and touring in Australia and, yes, on their education while in Australia. All of those different activities stimulate, of course, jobs and other opportunities for Australians. Deloitte Access Economics estimates that international education underpins now and supports some 130,000 Australian jobs.


So, contrary to the notion put in this motion, it is very, very clear that international education is stimulating jobs and opportunities elsewhere across Australia. As an area of earning export income into Australia, it's now our third-largest international earner—the third-largest export earner for Australia—such is the role it's played in the transformation of our economy, and, of course, it is the largest such earner in the services sector.


It's important to appreciate that there are strong protections and frameworks within which international education operates. Only providers who are registered can offer international education services to foreign students. Those providers then have strong safeguards put around their operations. There are protections for those international students, but there are also protections for Australians in terms of what those international students can do whilst they're in Australia.


There are limits on the number of hours the international students can work whilst they're in Australia. Indeed, they are limited to working 40 hours a fortnight. But, notably, most don't do that. In fact, estimates predict that only around 36 per cent of international higher education students, or around 40 per cent of overall international students, seek any kind of work whilst they're in Australia. The significant majority are here to study and to live and learn the Australian experience, and that's precisely what they get on and do. And they do that while spending their money, often their parents' money or their country's money, here in Australia, creating jobs and opportunities for Australians.


We are proudly now the world's third most popular destination, after the United States and the United Kingdom, for students to come and study in. Even with limits on their work rights whilst here, and even with limits on their work rights post graduation, we still now stand, for the vast majority of students who come here, as their first-preference destination. They choose to come here, knowing that we limit their work rights, because of the quality of education and experience that we offer to those students.


In doing so, it's not just our economy that they enhance. They also enhance our educational institutions and, within that, the experience of domestic Australian students as well. They enhance our educational institutions because, yes, they are a significant additional revenue source for those educational institutions, which can enhance other activities, such as research undertakings by Australian institutions and, indeed, other investments that they put into universities and those other educational institutions. But, as I said, they also enhance the opportunity for domestic students whom they're studying alongside, because in the end they create a richer study experience—exposure to foreign cultures and different business approaches, language approaches or otherwise—which, importantly, ensures that Australian graduates get a more rounded education.


Again, those safeguards apply. Just last week the Turnbull government took steps to enhance those safeguards by ensuring that, in terms of the English language skills the international students have when they're completing an English language program prior to commencing a tertiary level of study in Australia, there are clear, required assessment processes in place to guarantee that they are able to fully participate. We do that to make sure that it's fair to those international students so that they get a quality education; to the domestic students, whom they're studying alongside, to make sure that everybody in their classes can fully and equally participate; and, of course, to the teachers in institutions at which they're studying, to make sure that they are able to give the best-quality educational experience possible.


Senator Rhiannon spoke with some negativity about the experience international students have in Australia. That's another misconception I'd like to refute. Surveys indicate that more than 90 per cent of people who study in Australia report an overwhelmingly positive experience of their studies. Work has been undertaken by the Fair Work Ombudsman and others to make sure that there is not exploitation of international students, and I would urge international students, who we now work closely with through our international education strategy, to engage with appropriate authorities such as the Fair Work Ombudsman if they have any concerns about workplace practices. Australia overwhelmingly provides a positive study experience, a positive lifestyle experience and some work experience for those who choose to take it—but a very positive, high-quality experience overall.


Recently, I note, there has been some more media commentary about the impact that international, and particularly Chinese, students may have on the operation of some Australian universities and providers. Our government has been very clear in the view that the academic integrities and freedoms—freedom of expression—at Australian universities are of paramount importance. They should be defended at all costs. Nobody should question the reality that freedom of expression exists at our universities, and everybody should fully expect to have their thoughts and ideas challenged. Equally, I'd say, in relation to misconceptions, that it's unhelpful sometimes when media outlets, in particular, decide to frame stories in a way that suggests there are profound problems, with little evidence in the stories to back up those suggestions. Just as we expect that students from China or elsewhere embrace the freedoms at Australian universities and campuses while they are here, we should acknowledge that whilst they are here they are free to gather to celebrate appropriately their national days or their national traditions as they choose and see fit.


Overall, Australia has an education system that is the envy of much of the world. That's why people vote with their feet and come here. It's a system whose contributions to our economy and to the experience of Australian students are enhanced by the international students who come here. Contrary to the impression that this motion gives, far from undermining Australian jobs, the international education industry with its $28 billion contribution creates some 130,000 Australian jobs, as I have said in estimates.


We in the Turnbull government remain resolute in our commitment to work with international education providers to give the best-quality educational experience to all possible and to continue to grow these opportunities because of the positive contribution they make to all of Australia.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2017-10-17,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (16:23):  I too rise today to oppose this urgency motion on international student visas put forward by One Nation. At the outset, I have to say it seems to me that this is another attempt by the One Nation party to grab a cheap headline at the expense of the truth, playing on elements of racism and a version of the 'other', of someone who is different to me, through a motion which expressly goes to the issue of international students. This motion is an absolute contradiction, because it's not that long ago in this place that One Nation, along with a few of the other crossbenchers, supported the government's ABCC legislation. That legislation prohibits unions from negotiating to limit the number and use of overseas workers with building companies who tender for government contracts. I don't know how they missed that, but they clearly did. The One Nation party, with the government, expressly put in place a limit on a union's ability to limit in an enterprise agreement the number of overseas workers in a company engaged in government tendering. What a contradiction. They also went to limit rostered days off, limit the ordinary hours of overtime and so on and so forth. But the standout feature is we have this so-called urgency motion today on international students and yet we have a party that absolutely voted with the government to say to trade unions: when you're negotiating with building companies who tender with the government, you will be restricted in outlawing overseas workers. That's exactly what One Nation did.


The other surprising feature for me about this urgency motion is that Senator Georgiou like myself and, indeed, like you, Acting Deputy President Reynolds, is a Western Australian. We know in Western Australia we have, I think, three One Nation upper house members in the state parliament. So I can only assume that Senator Georgiou didn't talk to them; otherwise, they would have been able to tell him that the McGowan government has, indeed, put forward a very bold plan in partnership with the universities in Western Australia to make Perth a destination for international students to bolster our economy because, as Senator Birmingham pointed out, international students add to our economy. So once again we have this contradiction between what the One Nation senators in this place think and perhaps what their colleagues in the Western Australian state parliament think.


We also know that international students are not the problem with our job market. Twenty hours a week is what they work, as Senator Birmingham explained to the parliament. But we know that what's happening in our economy right at the moment is it's not the international students; it's the low wages growth. Low wages growth is now starting to have a real impact on our economy because, obviously, when families and individuals don't have decent wage growth—in the private sector it's been as low as 1.8 per cent; the lowest it's been in at least two decades—that impacts spending power, it impacts the way that households are able to meet their expenses and it also impacts on employment. So this furphy around international students is nothing but a cheap headline, another attempt by One Nation not backed up with any kind of facts or figures, trying to scapegoat international students, when, as I said at the outset, One Nation, by voting with the government, sought to restrict our unions' ability to limit the use of overseas workers in their enterprise agreements.


And who could forget the words of the Reserve Bank Governor, Philip Lowe, a couple of months ago, when he called on workers to demand higher pay rises? He said workers need to demand higher pay rises amid a wage growth crisis. When you look at all of those who analyse our labour markets, no-one of any competence is talking about international students; they are talking about low wages. We've seen the disgraceful way the government has failed to acknowledge its own public service and give public servants a decent wage rise. From the day that Mr Abbott was elected Prime Minister, there has been a war on our public servants. Very few of our public servants have had wage rises, and that policy has continued under Mr Turnbull. So we've seen very low or no wage growth in the public sector. We've seen an absolute stalling of wages in the private sector to the tune that analysts and the Reserve Bank governor—hardly a friend of workers—have started saying it's time that workers demanded a wage rise. That's the issue in our economy. It has nothing to do with picking on and scapegoating international students, many of whom have come here from near neighbours who are also often scapegoated by the One Nation party. They had obviously not bothered to talk to their colleagues in the WA parliament, because they would have certainly told them that we are very, very clear and committed to making Perth a destination for international students. Perhaps Senator Georgiou doesn't know this because he's a fairly new senator, but, nevertheless, he's a Western Australian senator and he gets a lot of staff, so he could have done the background work on this. Perth was the No. 1 destination for international students. We've lost that status, and we want to get it back, because we do appreciate that international students make our economy stronger. They bring a lot of wealth. They pay rent, they buy services and they sometimes work—they're limited in their ability to work to 20 hours—and that's the sort of growth that we want to see in Western Australia.


The government hasn't always done the right thing by international students. We've seen the appalling rip-off at 7-Eleven. I presided over a visa inquiry when I was the chair of the Senate Education and Employment References Committee and, quite frankly, I was shocked by the level of exploitation of those students that I saw. They were working for minimal wages and they were being forced to pay back wages. Instead of trying to, wrongly, demonise international students, One Nation and the government should be making sure that we never, ever again see the exploitation that we saw of these guests in our country. Most of them are here for a short time. They come in and take advantage of our good education facilities, and yet, at the same time, they get treated in a way that none of us would stand for as workers in this country. No-one is convinced we have seen the end of that rip-off at 7-Eleven. It's probably still going on. In fact, I think it's definitely still going on, as I speak. We know most of those workers in the 7-Eleven stores are international students who are often forced to work more than 20 hours, forced to work for free and forced to pay back wages. They don't get their proper entitlements and they have never seen a penalty rate and so on. 


If you want further proof, we also know that in the Western Australian state election this year One Nation gave its preferences to the Liberal Party that wants to reduce wages, that doesn't stand for penalty rates and that has presided over critically high unemployment in Western Australia. That's the party that One Nation chose to support in the recent state election: a party that doesn't support a minimum wage and that thinks workers can be ripped off on the weekends and not get penalty rates. I don't know where this concocted notion about international students comes from; it's completely wrong. One Nation should have taken a better look at the bills it supported in the past were it specifically outlawed overseas workers. This should be dismissed. It's nothing but a headline grabber.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:33):  I'm delighted, this afternoon, to make my contribution to what I think is an important motion from Senator Georgiou—a One Nation senator from my home state of Western Australia—but I'm going to be a little bit more gracious. I think what Senator Georgiou is trying to do is highlight the important plight of young Australians that are looking for work. I don't think it's a bad idea that Senator Georgiou, who is a new senator here in the Senate from Western Australia, has spent some time thinking about what could be the various causes of that problem, or that he has invited us in this place to sit down and discuss whether or not we think this particular cause has merit or whether or not other causes have merit.


What I'd like to do, in the brief opportunity available to me this afternoon, is to talk about why I don't think it is right to look at international students but how I do think that there are other opportunities to provide jobs growth, particularly in our home state of Western Australia. Of course, Senator Georgiou won't be surprised to learn that I'm putting my effort and consideration into reform of the GST system and why I think that will be a great opportunity, not just in Western Australia. I think I might have heard Senator Polley scoff at my idea of goods and services tax distribution reform in our country. I'm pleased to say, Senator Polley, that none other than the Productivity Commission itself, in its draft report into horizontal fiscal equalisation, says that there is opportunity for reform in our country of the GST system. I'm pleased that the New South Wales Treasurer has even endorsed reform. I'm pleased that the new Labor government in Western Australia—as the previous Liberal government did—has also endorsed reform. I'm delighted that my parliamentary colleague the Treasurer, Mr Morrison, embraced an idea—led by me and endorsed by other Western Australian Liberals—that said that the GST system needs review. I will come back to that in a moment, and why I think that Senator Georgiou's sentiment is correct, even if I don't necessarily agree with the first proposition that he has put forward this afternoon. But that doesn't mean we should dismiss it, because we know that things change and our economic conditions change. Indeed, the contribution that international students make to our country will continue to change over time.


But I'm one who believes that the existence and the participation of international students in our education system and in the broader Australian economy benefits our community and our cultural development as a nation and of course enhances our economic development. The economic benefits of international students in Australia are undeniable. Education is our third-largest import. It has contributed over $28 billion to the Australian economy in such a short time—in the period 2016 to 2017. Estimates by Deloitte Access Economics are that international education creates over 130,000 jobs across a range of sectors. As Senator Lines alluded to, it's certainly my ambition and my hope that the new Western Australian government—I had hoped it would have been an ambition of the previous government, but it wasn't to be so—will commit its time and its energy to doing more to attract international students to Western Australia.


We know that, once students are here in Australia, they are expected to focus primarily on their educational studies, which is why international students can only work 40 hours in every fortnight. A national student survey found that only 36 per cent of international higher education students reported working while studying, while 87 per cent of vocational education and training, or VET, students did. This equated to around 200,000 students: 90,000 higher education students and 110,000 VET students in 2016. We also know that less than 40 per cent of international students seek any kind of work in Australia and some of those are engaged in volunteering activities rather than in paid work. When they compete against Australians in the job market, research—specifically, from the Australian Council for Educational Research—demonstrates that it is usually the Australians who win, not the international students. Importantly, most international student employment is in jobs that employers find hard to fill, meaning that international students might have an interest, a capacity and a need to fill those jobs that Australian students—young Australians—might not be interested in filling in the first instance.


But I think it is worth just examining the evidence in a little bit more detail, before I do move on to what I think might be a better way to address the issue of employment and educational opportunities for young people. We also know that the ABS has recently reported that international education income has reached $28 billion in 2016-2017. Significantly, it is up 16 per cent from the year before. Of course, as one of our largest service exports, Australian international education is leading the transition of our economy, the Australian economy, from one that's centred on mining to a broader knowledge and services based economy. This is very important and leads me to my substantive point about the importance of GST distribution reform. I think the argument has been well made in this Senate by Western Australian colleagues of mine. We don't hear Labor Senate colleagues from Western Australia talking too much about GST distribution reform. In arguing for an independent, economically focused review of Australia's horizontal fiscal equalisation arrangements, which the Treasurer commissioned and which is the subject of the draft report that was released only in the last few weeks, what Western Australian Liberals have been arguing for is that GST distribution reform, while important to Western Australia, is not just limited to benefiting Western Australia and that, in fact, if we're going to have the macroeconomic reform that is needed in this country to propel it to the next stage of growth, the next stage of productivity, it is important that every element of the economy come under close examination—forensic examination, in fact. I would argue that the GST system has gone unchallenged for too long. What's been very, very valuable about the draft Productivity Commission report is that it has at least opened up the issue of horizontal fiscal equalisation and opened up the issue of GST distribution reform to make sure that that system is doing everything that it possibly can to support growth and to support productivity in our country.


A couple of months ago, with the support of the Parliamentary Library—and I am very, very grateful for the work that they were able to do on my behalf—it was revealed that, in the period 2000-01 to 2015-16, WA had contributed $186 billion to the rest of Australia. That is a big figure, and I'll be the first one to say that, when you go out into the community and talk about $186 billion, people don't know what it means. How do you digest what $186 billion means to your local economy? So I'm grateful for the help of the Parliamentary Library. They were able to turn that into an infrastructure loss figure but also an employment loss figure. As a result of that, we know that Western Australia lost $73.1 billion in possible infrastructure spending as a result of a flawed GST distribution system. And, more particularly relevant to Senator Georgiou's motion this afternoon, Western Australia lost, on average, 94,000 jobs over that period. It lost 94,000 jobs over that period.


So this afternoon I agree with the sentiment of Senator Georgiou that we should be doing more to make jobs available to young Australians, but I would argue that Senator Georgiou should join with me and other Western Australian Liberal senators in arguing for GST distribution reform, because it will deliver important infrastructure spending, and it will deliver important jobs growth. You're right, Senator Hanson—I saw you nodding your head. To your credit, Senator Georgiou is on the bandwagon and is on the campaign supporting GST distribution reform in Western Australia. It was great to wake up to headlines like this in Western Australia, because we know that reform of anything in our country takes time and takes energy, but the most important thing is that it's a demonstration that, unfortunately, the squeaky wheel gets the oil. I am pleased that Western Australian Liberal senators and members have been squeaking those wheels, and we are on the path to— (Time expired)

"Chisholm, Sen Anthony",ALP,2017-10-17,"



Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (16:43):  I rise to speak on this matter as well. When I first saw this, this morning, I thought, 'Maybe One Nation are going to express some concern for foreign workers that have been exploited.' We've seen various examples of that over recent years. But, no, I think what we've got with One Nation is just another dog whistle. We know that Senator Hanson has attacked foreign students in this country as early as in February this year, where she said: 'I was told—and I was just gobsmacked at this—that we had 400,000 foreign students in Australia, going to our universities. No wonder our kids can't find jobs. I think it needs to be addressed.' So what we see today is just a continuing attack on foreign students in this country and the importance of them to the economy of Australia and particularly regional economies.


If you'd spent any time in regional Queensland, you would understand the importance of foreign students to those universities and the fact that they add diversity to them, let alone the role that that plays in the broader Asia-Pacific and within the world. There are some Queensland issues that I want to come back to that I think just show you how out of touch Senator Hanson and her team are with what is happening in Queensland and indeed throughout Australia.


I know many other senators here have raised the importance of this to the national economy, but it's broader than that. You only have to spend any time in Brisbane to understand the economic boom that Brisbane has gone through as a result of foreign students wanting to come and study at our universities. We have seen high-rise buildings get built and we have seen students come and use that accommodation. We have seen that the resulting economic benefit has been substantial. This has been replicated throughout Queensland and throughout Australia. It shows the ignorance that we have seen from One Nation. They fail to understand the economic importance of this to our country. They say it's a bad thing that we have 400,000 international students studying right here in Australia. I see that as an opportunity. They get an education. Australia has so many universities ranked in the top 100, and our regional universities are doing particularly well. We're an attractive destination, and this is a great thing.


When they come, they also obviously want to work. They need some employment to keep it going. Quite often they are doing the jobs that some other people don't want to do, but we can't let them be exploited when they are doing that. There have been examples of that throughout regional Queensland, and I am sure there are examples throughout Australia as well. But One Nation don't want to put a focus on that. Every time they've had an opportunity to vote for antiworker or anti-union legislation, they've put their hand up as quick as a flash. If they actually wanted to protect international workers and vulnerable workers, they would vote to strengthen labour laws, not diminish them, and they would actually vote to strengthen the role of unions in the workplace who can protect these people. But we see from One Nation a consistent theme: the opposite. It just shows how dysfunctional they are. They come in here and pursue what is basically a dog whistle to parts of Australia to say, 'We don't want more foreigners coming in.'


The economic devastation that would follow from this would be unprecedented. As we know, there are 400,000 international students studying right here in Australia. We know that they are spread throughout Australia and that they include regional universities as well. The international education sector in Australia is valued at $28 billion. Our education system is our nation's third-highest export. This is how important it is. You only have to talk to a vice chancellor or a regional vice chancellor for them to extol how important it is for their university and their ability to offer courses for Australian residents as well. It should be a source of pride and something we should be talking about in a positive light—about the benefits that this brings and the expansion that it has enabled our universities—but One Nation want to put a negative light on it. It is really disappointing that they want to talk down regional universities and Australian universities, all to have a dog whistle for their supporters.


This urgency motion once again shows that One Nation simply don't understand how the economy works and the broader benefits that this brings, as I said, around construction and the spending power that these people bring to regional economies, particularly when we look at the state of Queensland. I look at examples like we have in Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton and the Sunshine Coast, which are home to universities like James Cook University, Central Queensland University and the University of the Sunshine Coast. If their foreign students numbers were to be cut, it would have a devastating impact on those local economies. James Cook University, in particular, has almost 2,000 international students studying on campuses in Townsville and Cairns. At the University of the Sunshine Coast there are 1,600 foreign students enrolled. It is estimated that the international student enrolments at the University of the Sunshine Coast inject $60 million into the local Sunshine Coast economy. These are significant numbers that have a real benefit for regional communities, particularly when you look at Townsville and Cairns. We understand that from time to time those economies do it tough. Townsville, in particular, has high unemployment at the moment. So the benefits of having those international students would be significant to boosting those local economies.


We also understand that there is an important role that our regional universities—particularly those in Queensland—play with our neighbouring nations such as Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. They rely on regional Queensland universities to educate their next generation of leaders. So this is providing a really vital leadership role in the Asia-Pacific region for students from other countries to come here and study, further their leadership abilities and then take that to their local communities to benefit their people as well.


Due to those links, there's the indirect benefit which our international students provide to our communities. For example, Townsville is now the beneficiary of direct international flights to Port Moresby, partially as a result of the number of Papua New Guineans studying at James Cook University. Due to James Cook University's strong links to Singapore, there is even talk that Townsville could benefit from stronger social and economic ties to Singapore. We potentially see that with the deal that the Singapore Army have done to do further training. That obviously has a direct link to Townsville, as part of that will take place there. I think this just goes to show you that, in the longer term, international education can also improve our links and relations with our regional neighbours, such as Singapore, Papua New Guinea and other important partners to Australia. These links are enhanced by international students coming to study in our region.


On top of the contribution that international education injects into our economy, the education system employs over 900,000 people, and 128,000 of those jobs are supported by the investment that is made by international students. If One Nation really cared about protecting jobs, imagine what such a stunt would do to existing employment levels at universities. If, all of a sudden, foreign students were taken out of the system, what an impact that would have! But, again, we don't see One Nation focusing in on the issues that we have seen around exploitation. We don't see any concern for the way that those workers have been treated. Instead what we see is just a scare campaign and a dog whistle. If they really cared about Australian jobs, they wouldn't be so hell bent on getting rid of an industry that provides a $28 million windfall for the economy. They would be happy to close the doors of the universities to foreign students, and that would have a devastating impact.


So I say to One Nation that they really need to get an understanding of the importance of universities to Australia. Maybe they could spend some time at a regional university in Queensland so that they could learn the important role that foreign students play and the economic benefits that are brought to those regions because of this. You only have to talk to a mayor from any of those regional towns, from Cairns, Townsville or Mackay, for them to talk about the benefits of having international students, the cultural diversity it brings, the importance of the financial contribution it adds to those economies and also the growing trade links that can happen as a result. I've mentioned the benefits in Townsville. I've seen the benefits in Cairns. There are so many students who want to come and study in Cairns because it is such an attractive lifestyle there and because of its vicinity to the Great Barrier Reef as well.


In conclusion, I think what we've seen from the efforts of One Nation in this debate really is nothing more than a dog whistle from them. They will stop at nothing to target xenophobia in Australia, and the damage that it does to the economy and to regional economies is absolutely a second thought that they have no regard for.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2017-10-17,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (16:53):  Well, I'm gobsmacked again. I cannot believe the response to this urgency motion to question jobs in Australia that international students may be taking from Australians. I won't deny international students bring a lot of income—actually the third-highest income into Australia, by all means. The Department of Immigration and Border Protection granted 343,035 international student visas in 2016-17, and these visa types are growing at a rate of 10 per cent a year.


I have to say, in relation to a lot of these universities in Melbourne and Sydney, that I was at a meeting just recently and a student from down in Melbourne got up and was talking to me and she was actually crying. She said, 'I feel like a foreigner in my own university.' That's what she said, with no prompting—nothing. She wasn't the only one; another one said that to me. So this is actually how they're feeling in their own universities; they're feeling like foreigners in their own universities.


The vast majority of these international student visas have a work right of up to 40 hours a fortnight during the term and unlimited work rights at other times. Let me repeat that: unlimited work rights at other times. When they get the visas to come into the country they should prove that they are self-funding—that they really don't need to work. And it's true: we estimate that about 30 to 50 per cent of the international students with a work right do work. But it's ridiculous that no-one in government knows which students work, how much they work, where they work or whether they report their earnings to the ATO. So are we getting tax from them? Who knows? We don't know that.


What we are saying is that at the point in time they are granted visas to Australia, those foreign students should be applying and getting a TFN so that when they go to work we know what income they're making and that they pay taxes in this country. The whole fact is that if we have changed to having backpackers pay tax from the first dollar they earn, and at 15 per cent, why shouldn't international students do exactly the same thing instead of just being out there taking the jobs? This is the case.


These questions could be answered if the government routinely linked administrative data and cross-matched it with census data. We know from a study published this year, based on the 2011 census, that international students are employed predominantly in 10 occupations: hospitality; cleaners and laundry workers; sales assistants; food preparation assistants; food trade workers; personal carers; checkout operators; tertiary education teachers; automobile, bus and rail drivers; and packers and product assemblers. They don't need education; there are a lot of people out there who can do those jobs. These occupations are predominantly lower-skill jobs which could be done by Australians—in particular, by young unemployed Australians.


Listen to the Labor Party, who is supposed to be for the worker. Yes, they parade their unions around and say that the unions are fighting for the rights of the workers and all the rest of it, but what about the rights of the youth and unemployed? What about them? Why aren't they addressing that? It is One Nation with an apprenticeship policy: in the first year the government pays 75 per cent of the wage, in the second year it pays 50 per cent of the wage and in the third year it pays 25 per cent of the wage. Let's get apprenticeship schemes going in this country.



A government senator interjecting—




Senator HANSON:
  What have you done about it? Absolutely nothing! Let me tell you about some of the youth unemployment rates in these areas. Youth unemployment was a big problem in the year ending August 2017. In the 15 to 24 age group, 35 per cent are unemployed in Australia.


Senator Chisholm talked about James Cook University in North Queensland. In Townsville there is a 46.4 per cent unemployment rate for those aged between 15 and 24. Let's go to the Sunshine Coast: 37.1 per cent. In Brisbane, we're looking at an average of 43 to 45 per cent. These are people who are looking for jobs. These are our kids, Australian kids. They can't get jobs.


You're more concerned about international students. I'm not knocking them coming here; yes, it makes us a lot of money. But why don't you get out and look at what they're doing in this country by us giving them work visas? They should be supporting themselves. If we talk about housing: international students can buy established housing. But the fact is that their parents buy the houses for them, so the parents own them. They are supposed to sell that house before they leave the country. They don't; they actually then have a house in Australia. So therefore we've got another market out there. They're paying all the rent, are they? Well, a lot of them are actually in houses bought by their parents.


The whole thing is that it needs to be looked at. Are they paying taxes in Australia? How many jobs do they actually have? A lot of it is under the counter; they're being paid cash in hand. We need to look at this with international students. My concern is for Australia and Australian kids. They are who I am concerned about. They are who should be getting these jobs. As I said, 343,035 international student visas were allocated in 2016-17. That is in one year. How many foreign students do we have in this country now? Can anyone tell me? Is it up to a million students? How many jobs are they taking? No wonder we've go so much unemployment, underemployment and casualisation of jobs in this country. Where are the unions speaking up about this?


I've seen both sides of politics in here. This has been escalating the problems. Rural and regional areas are dying because kids are leaving the towns because they do not have jobs. And you are not doing anything about it! All I see in here are people who are hypocrites. Because we are doing something about this, all you can do is direct your fingers and say that raising this issue is about racism. Well, I can tell you that One Nation is a party that is standing up for the Australian people about jobs and about people paying their taxes. I am here to represent the Australian people, first and foremost, and to worry about everyone in this country, as are my colleagues. When you get your act together and know how to run this country, we might get ourselves out of $504 billion of debt that is heading towards $600 billion. I think both the coalition and the Labor Party, while you've both been in government, have done a very good job in raising the debt of this country. It is lucky that One Nation is here because we can keep you on your toes and start really addressing the true concerns of the Australian people.

The speeches read as follows—



CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES) BILL 2017


I am pleased to present the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Measures) Bill 2017.


The Government is committed to free and fair trade. Protectionist policies will not solve the problem of slow-growing economies throughout the world. More globalised trade provides very real benefits for Australian businesses and consumers, such as greater access to materials for manufacturing and decreased prices for goods, to name just two.


Australian businesses must be globally competitive and should not be shielded from genuine competition. 


However, dumping and foreign government subsidisation of goods exported to Australia is not genuine competition and can distort markets and injure Australian manufacturers. Our anti-dumping system allows Australian manufacturing businesses to compete on a level playing field against imported goods, by imposing duties on those goods in proven cases of dumping or subsidisation. A robust and effective anti-dumping system is an essential part of the Government's commitment to free and fair trade.


Since 2013, more than 93 new anti‑dumping or subsidy investigations have been initiated by the Anti-Dumping Commission, and there are currently more than 75 final measures in place on dumped or subsidised goods exported to Australia.


Australia's anti-dumping system is composed of a number of interlinked processes, all of which need to operate effectively to ensure the system's ongoing effectiveness. The amendment that I am introducing today is designed to address an unintended consequence generated in one of these processes, known as 'reviews of measures'.


After anti-dumping duties have been in place for 12 months, affected parties can apply for a review of measures. The purpose of the review is to ensure that the rate of the duty is contemporaneous. The new duty rate is calculated by, amongst other things, examining the price the foreign exporter sells the goods for in their home market, and the price at which they export the goods to Australia.


Reviews allow anti-dumping duties to keep in step with changes in exporter's commercial behaviour. If the exporter continues to dump, the duty rate can stay the same or increase. If the exporter has stopped or reduced their rate of dumping, the duty rate can decrease.


Currently, there exists the possibility that foreign exporters subject to duties can subvert the reviews of measures process to undermine the remedial effect of Australia's anti-dumping system. Foreign exporters are able to deliberately limit exports of the dutiable goods for a period of time in order to obtain a more favourable rate of duty for future exports. This facilitates the opportunity for the exporter to resume dumping and continue to injure Australian industry.


To address this behaviour, which is clearly against the intent of Australia's anti‑dumping system, the Government is introducing specific methods to determine export prices for foreign exporters in reviews of measures.


When an exporter has made no exports during a review period, or has made a small number of exports that are not representative of commercial trade, the Anti-Dumping Commission will be able to use three specified methods to set an export price. This export price then informs the level of dumping duty that is applied to future exports.


This change will increase Australian manufacturing industry's confidence in the strength of the anti-dumping system by removing an unintended consequence of reviews of measures which could be exploited by foreign exporters. This will make sure that the system continues to operate as intended to provide relief from injurious dumping for Australian manufacturers.


Australia's anti-dumping system is held in high regard by many of our trading partners, and so the Government has worked hard to ensure that this change complies with our international trade obligations, and that it will not diminish the international perception of our system's integrity and transparency.


Australia's anti‑dumping system is a complex space that necessitates both long-term vision as well as the ability to act rapidly when significant issues arise. The Government continually monitors the efficiency and effectiveness of the system, and remains in close consultation with Australian industry stakeholders in evaluating the need for further reform.


The Government is committed to ensuring that Australian industry can compete on a level playing field. This amendment will ensure that Australian industries continue to have access to a strong anti-dumping system that delivers efficient and effective remedies for Australian businesses injured by dumping and subsidisation.


I commend the bill to the Chamber.


FAIR WORK (REGISTERED ORGANISATIONS) AMENDMENT (ENSURING INTEGRITY) BILL 2017


I move that this Bill now be read a second time.


Unions and employer associations have a privileged position in the workplace relations system and the economy more broadly, and their members place a great deal of trust in them.


There is absolutely no place for those who breach this trust and act in their own interest at the expense of members.


There is also no place for those who show nothing but contempt for the laws that apply equally to all Australians.


That is why we committed at the last election to implement the changes in this Bill to ensure that unions, employer associations and their officials act with integrity.


The changes in the Bill strengthen the grounds for the Fair Work Commission and the Federal Court to deal effectively with the financial misconduct, disregard for the law and abandonment of members that has been all too common in recent times.


The Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption identified countless examples of officials breaching their duties, engaging in blackmail, extortion, coercion and secondary boycott conduct, abusing their rights of entry, acting in contempt of court or failing to stop their organisations from repeatedly breaking the law. 


The Bill will restore integrity to registered organisations through four improvements to the law.


First, the Bill will create a public interest test to be applied by the Fair Work Commission when unions or employer associations seek to merge. 


When companies seek to merge, they must first satisfy a regulator – the ACCC - such a merger won't substantially lessen competition. 


This competition test is like a public interest test companies seeking to merge. 


By comparison, unions and employer associations face no similar test. Currently, the Fair Work Commission has very limited ability to do anything other than effectively rubber stamp a merger approved by just a bare majority of members.


There are no general public interest considerations and there is very limited scope for affected parties to raise any concerns about a proposed merger of registered organisations. 


Some unions and employer groups have greater assets than many companies. Some also have a capacity to disrupt major sections of the economy. And considering their privileged position, including tax exempt status, it is especially important that they are accountable.


If large, powerful unions or employer groups seek to become more powerful, with more coverage across the economy, then a public interest test should apply. 


So this Bill introduces a new public interest test, which will take account of the broader impact of a proposed merger and also the record of the organisations in complying with the law.


Second, the Bill will strengthen the Federal Court's power to disqualify an official from standing for or holding office where they deliberately flout the law, fail to act in their members' interests, breach their duties or are otherwise found to be not fit and proper to act as officials. 


The Bill will also make it an offence to act as an official while disqualified. 


Again, this is a sensible change, consistent with community standards. 


If a company director breaks the law they can be disqualified by a court from running a corporation. If a driver repeatedly breaks the road rules, they can be disqualified by a court from holding a driver's licence. 


A similar standard should be applied to an official from a registered organisation who repeatedly breaks the law. 


As recommended by the Royal Commission, the Bill also includes automatic disqualification for serious criminal offences punishable by five or more years' imprisonment. 


How can anyone seriously suggest that individuals convicted of serious offences such as blackmail, extortion and threatening to cause serious harm to public officials, should be allowed to hold office in a registered organisation? 


Third, the Bill strengthens the powers for the Federal Court to cancel the registration of an organisation or take appropriate action against a part of the organisation. 


Under present rules, it is virtually impossible to deregister a union or employer organisation – even if they persistently break the law. 


This needs to change.


This Bill will allow the Court to cancel registration where the organisation or its senior officials have repeatedly broken the law, breached their duties or failed to put their members first. 


Again, this applies a consistent standard. The new grounds for cancellation are modelled on similar power relating to the winding up of companies. 


Where a ground for cancellation has been made out because of the conduct of officers or members of a particular branch of an organisation, the Bill will also provide for the Court to make an order specific to that particular branch, division or other part of an organisation.


Last, the Bill strengthens the provisions providing for an organisation to be placed into administration. The current provisions offer little guidance on the circumstances in which administration is available, and do not make clear what steps the Court can take to deal with those situations.


The proposed provisions will ensure that the Court can appoint an administrator to a registered organisation or part of it when financial misconduct has occurred in an organisation, its officials have repeatedly broken the law or breached their duties or it is otherwise dysfunctional.


These provisions will deal with the problems that arose in the context of the HSU being placed into administration. That case was ultimately resolved because the parties largely agreed about the facts in issue. 


However, there were numerous court applications, which resulted in a confusing process that could have been extremely lengthy had the facts been contested. 


All of these changes will help ensure that unions and employer groups focus on doing the right thing by their members and the industries they represent and ensure that when the law is broken, the court can take action. 


The Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment (Ensuring Integrity) Bill 2017 will help improve and in some cases, restore, a culture of integrity to registered organisations - for the benefit of members and also the wider community.

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
) (17:39):  As senators may be aware, earlier today Senator Leyonhjelm sought to postpone business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1, relating to the disallowance of the Competition and Consumer (Industry Code—Sugar) Regulations 2017. At the request of a senator, the question was put and was negatived.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2017-10-17,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (17:40):  I move:


That the Competition and Consumer (Industry Code—Sugar) Regulations 2017, made under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, be disallowed.


Tonight we're considering the unbalanced code of conduct covering the sugar industry. This unbalanced code was hastily prepared in response to One Nation saying that they would go on strike if such a code wasn't introduced. This threat not to vote on legislation was made back in March, when the government was seeking to legislate to lower the company tax rate, an issue of great significance to Australia. The code is also a response to the Nationals wanting to demonstrate that they can respond in knee-jerk fashion to short-sighted complaints as quickly as One Nation can.


Because it was hastily prepared, there was none of the usual consultation covering all the stakeholders that would be subject to the code. Because the code is so fundamental to the functioning of the industry, this is an irresponsible omission. Because the code was a response to short-sighted complaints, it is not like the codes of conduct found in other industries, which take an even-handed approach and make clear that negotiations are to be in good faith. Instead, this code tilts the scales heavily in favour of the blinkered demands of those who complain the most, to the long-term detriment of the entire sugar industry. With the Greens and some other crossbenchers willing to jump into bed with One Nation and the Nationals on this, it looks like the long-term decline in Australia's share of global sugar production is set to continue. Once again we see that the antibusiness, foreigner-fearing Greens and One Nation are more alike than either wants to admit.


This code is not a balanced code of conduct, because it allows arbitration pre contract and it is proscriptive about the arbitrator's role. The code refers to 'grower economic interest sugar', which is a concept set in Queensland legislation. The code forces the arbitrator to rule that the marketing entity for this sugar must be chosen by the canegrowers. Yet this is sugar made and owned by a miller. The decisions as to how that sugar will be sold will be taken out of the hands of the miller. Forcing a miller to negotiate with an input supplier over the sale of the miller's own products and to comply with the directives of an arbitrator should it fail to agree with those input suppliers is not a formula for business confidence.


It's a pretty safe bet that there won't be a rush of additional investment in sugar mills while this code remains. That's important because our international competitiveness is already marginal. If sugar milling becomes uncompetitive through lack of investment, canegrowers will suffer as much as anyone. What growers really need is competition for their cane. They ought to be doing everything possible to attract new entrants into milling, if not investing their own money. As it stands, the only people who say the canegrowers have a legitimate claim are those who are pandering to get their vote, plus a few who don't like foreign investment and don't understand the issues. Significantly, neither the Productivity Commission nor the Queensland Productivity Commission supported this sort of government intervention, noting that it would cost money and jobs.


It really comes down to the idea that you shouldn't control what you don't own. Once canegrowers deliver their cane to a railway siding or delivery point near their farm, it belongs to the mill, which processes it into sugar. In the past, when many sugar mills were owned by grower cooperatives, canegrowers felt they had some—albeit remote—influence over how the mill marketed its sugar. Australia has a very minor influence on world sugar prices, but growers liked the thought that they had a say. Those days are gone. Most mills now have no grower shareholders at all. However, despite having sold the cane and with no equity in either the sugar or the mill, growers are still demanding a say over who markets the sugar. Some of the owners of mills have vast access to international markets and have put real money into sugar communities. But it seems the main point people make about these owners is the complaint that they are foreigners.


This disallowance motion may well be defeated, but the real losers will be future generations of Queenslanders who will continue to see their share of the global sugar market fall to countries with a more business friendly approach. I commend the motion to the Senate.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2017-10-17,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (17:46):  Senator Leyonhjelm has it very wrong here. Leaving it to the market is fine when you have a fair, competitive market. But the fact is that, when canegrowers grow their cane, they must take it as quickly as possible to the nearest processing plant—the nearest mill. They can't say, 'Oh, the price today at this mill is such and such and down the road it's a better price.' You can't take it down the road.


Early in 2014 I met with sugarcane growers at Condong, near Murwillumbah. I spoke to my colleague Queensland Nationals Senator Barry O'Sullivan—welcome to the chamber—in June, and we instigated an inquiry through the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee in June 2014. We held hearings at Murwillumbah, Mackay and Townsville. They were attended at various times by Senator O'Sullivan, Senator Canavan, Senator Macdonald, former Senator Bullock and committee chair Senator Sterle.


Sugarcane production contributes $2.5 billion to the Australian economy each year and is largely concentrated along Australia's eastern coastline in Queensland and New South Wales. That's where the sugar's mainly grown. Queensland has the bulk of the sugar produced by the states, at 95 per cent, and only five per cent is in New South Wales. While it is vastly different, there are some issues which are of common concern to both states.


Wilmar, MSF Sugar and Tully Sugar had given notice to terminate their RSS agreements with Queensland Sugar Limited in 2017. This caused great concern in the industry. As the inquiry progressed, it became clear that grower choice in relation to grower economic interest in sugar was an issue of central importance to growers and their representative bodies. Canegrowers and the Australian Cane Farm Association suggest any real choice for canegrowers would be removed if the large milling companies were to take control of the sugar marketing sector. Growers were acutely aware that they were at a disadvantage when it came to the amount of power the milling companies held at the time. The committee was told that, in fact, both sectors of the industry had been experiencing considerable difficulties in their attempts to decide on terms and reach agreements on new contracts.


Burdekin District Cane Growers Limited also argued that the tension between growers and millers such as Wilmar had more to do with the imbalance of bargaining power between growers and Wilmar Sugar than it does with Wilmar Sugar being a foreign-owned company. The committee was told there was no statutory or mandatory dispute resolution process which would assist sugar industry stakeholders, both canegrowers and millers, to resolve commercial disputes. The committee observed the strong interrelationship and interdependence which exists between sugarcane growers and sugar milling companies. It was clear that neither would be able to survive without the other remaining profitable and sustainable. There was a lack of trust on the part of the canegrowers in relation to the large milling companies, particularly Wilmar. It was agreed that Wilmar needed to come to the table prepared to engage in positive negotiations with canegrowers and their representatives and that the canegrowers needed to show they were prepared to negotiate in a positive way.


At the same time as the Senate inquiry, a task force was involved in the development of a code of conduct for the industry and there was only one recommendation, which stated:


The committee recommends the development and implementation of a mandatory sugar industry code of conduct acknowledging that provide appropriate stake holder consultation is undertaking the work of the sugar marketing code of conduct task force may provide a foundation on which a code of conduct may be established.


The code came into force April this year. Quotes from the correspondence received in my office from CANEGROWERS Mackay, which represents 1,100 members, said:


The code came into force in April 2017. Three years into a bitter dispute triggered by several mill owners attempting to unilaterally take control of all sugar marketing in their regions. Assisting a resolution in that dispute, the code is now a point of security for you in our future negotiations. The code addresses a power imbalance between millers and growers by requiring good faith, fair and honest negotiations without intimidation.. In the case of Wilmar sugar suppliers in 2017, the code of conduct forced the miller to complete a cane supplier agreement negotiations and prevented it from continuing to hold growers to ransom head of the start of the season.


CANEGROWERS Cairns Region said in a letter to me:


The sugar industry code of conduct is point of security for our organisation in all negotiations with our only available milling company, MSF Sugar Limited.


Senator Leyonhjelm talks about the market. I will repeat what they say:


… with our only available milling company, MSF Sugar Limited. Should the code be disallowed, our sugar cane producers would be put in an extremely vulnerable position in an area where the mill owners, MSF Sugar, has a regional monopoly.


Here's the point, senators, about monopolies. Tableland Canegrowers Limited, which represents 80 growers on the Atherton Tableland, told me:


This disallowance motion disregards a 2015 Senate committee's recommendation, pre-judges the code form review in 2018 and was introduced by a senator who has not taken the time to talk to sugar canegrowers, representatives of the industry or to understand its recent history.


CANEGROWERS Proserpine, which represents 200 growers, wrote to me asking that I not support this disallowance and pointing out that it fixes the imbalance between growers and millers.


Senator Leyonhjelm doesn't seem to understand how the sugar industry works. I note that in a new article on 15 September he said:


Growers need to accept the new reality of multinational companies owning Queensland sugar mills.


The manager of Proserpine CANEGROWERS, Mike Porter, said in the same article that his growers get about 60 per cent of the estimated value of the cane delivered to the mill, and for Senator Leyonhjelm to say that they get 90 per cent is stretching it. Senator Leyonhjelm says that spending $400 million on the regulation of the sugar industry was a waste, but this was shot down by Mr Porter, who said that rationalisation has created a lot of efficiencies and that the Australian industry is one of the most efficient in the world, and probably the envy of most countries that grow sugar.


It was Minister Barnaby Joyce who said to the sugar industry, 'Come to an agreement, get your act in order, make a decision, or we will.' He said that for months before this was released. Sure, it was backed by Senator Hanson and One Nation. We launched an inquiry in 2014, Senator O'Sullivan and I. We carried out the inquiry, along with other senators here, and we saw how the market is simply unfair in the sugar industry and how the big end of town has a monopoly and can dictate the terms to the canegrowers.


Once again, the canegrower, the primary producer, is a price taker not a price maker. Not many of you in this Senate would understand what I'm talking about, but I have lived it for most of my life. Now we have the situation where we now have surety and security and everyone is happy. As I said, Minister Joyce said to them, 'If you don't come to an agreement with the growers and companies like Wilmar, we will put a mandatory code of conduct in.' And we did. Thank you for honouring your word again, Minister Joyce.


Now we have someone, in the form of Senator Leyonhjelm, trying to disallow this—I believe he is backed by the Labor Party and probably the Greens as well. This is scary. Why have you got such a set on primary producers? If the market were fair I would totally support this, but the market is not fair. A canegrower must take their cane to the nearest mill within hours of cutting it. There's none of this: 'What's the price at this mill today?' 'It's such and such.' 'I'll get a quote down the road; I'll take it to the mill down the road.' You can't do that, you have to run it to the nearest mill. There is no competition as far as the mill goes, so the market is failing. It is unfair, and that's why it needs a code of conduct to deliver fairness to the canegrowers. I urge senators to vote against this disallowance motion.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (17:55):  I will only trouble the Senate for a few moments. I regret that this motion has been brought on at this time. I'd had some conversations with Senator Leyonhjelm about delaying or deferring it for the simple reason that I needed more information in order to make a decision.


I've met with some of the canegrowers and I have respect for their position, albeit that slightly nuanced positions have been put to me in some of the discussions with different interest groups. What I haven't been able to ascertain is the position of the 'alternative narrative' from the other side of the equation.


As I said, I regret that the government has brought this on. I still don't understand the particular reasoning for it but I will listen to the debate and make my decision accordingly.

"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2017-10-17,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (17:56):  I can clear up a couple of things for Senator Bernardi.



Senator Bernardi interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Just for a moment, Senator Bernardi—I'd appreciate that. This matter has now been lingering around this place for multiple weeks. Without directing my attention to Senator Bernardi, I think there's been adequate time for any senator to explore all sides of this equation in order to make their mind up about whether they should or shouldn't support this disallowance motion. Indeed, reference to the report that Senator Williams has spoken about would have articulated it clearly. That was a massive inquiry. Senator Macdonald, who is the father of the Senate, told me he'd never been at a Senate hearing with as many stakeholders present. In Townsville there were over 350 in a massive hall. They just attended to observe the conduct of the inquiry. All the millers were there and all the growers were there. So that would have aided it.


But can I say, Senator Bernardi, that the reason this motion was brought on today is that this has been continuing to cause great angst back in this industry. It has had nearly three years where people weren't able to plan. Planning around sugar is a big deal; you've got to make a decision now about a five-year business plan. So, the investment that you make this season will have impacts on your business operations for five years. After three years of uncertainty, which was stabilised with the application of the code, there was a massive sigh of relief across the canegrowers in my home state of Queensland, which is largely where the production in this country is. I know that Senator Williams has cane production in the northern part of New South Wales, but Australia's cane production is largely in the state of Queensland. There was a huge sigh of relief—and I mean from people in their thousands. I've been here nearly four years now, and I've never had so much correspondence and traffic—phone calls and contact events—made over an issue as I did over sugar. There are, on average, 4,500 families and something like 67 small communities involved, and if the sugar industry is disrupted it will disrupt their economies and their social circumstances right across my home state. They are small communities, some of them with only a couple of hundred residents. You could probably argue that this instability ran from somewhere north of the Tweed and up through Childers with a break and then through to production areas around Serena and Mackay and all the way up the coast almost all the way to Cairns. There is not one of those small coastal communities on the eastern side of the Great Divide that would not be affected by this continued instability in the sugar industry.


We don't even need to return to our contemporary inquiry to understand why this became necessary. There was a royal commission in this country in 1932, I think it was, into the sugar industry because the sugar industry was not developing. That was because of the concern about the power imbalance of millers with respect to this particular commodity.


I just want to pick up and elaborate further on a couple of points made by Senator Williams. This commodity has to be harvested in a very short period of time. It's measured in weeks. It's not as if you can just throw the crop in and say, 'I'll come back from holidays in January, and I'll take the crop off, or, if that doesn't suit me, I'll wait until Easter,' or use any of the other rotations that can occur with other commodities. Once it's harvested, its life, its productivity, is measured in hours, not even days. What happens to it is that it goes onto a little, flimsy carriage on a little, flimsy rail line, and it can only go to one place. That's the mill. It can't be stored. It's not efficient to transport it by any other method to another mill—and, even if you could, you are likely, in my home state of Queensland, to arrive at another mill owned by the same miller you were trying to avoid 60 kilometres down the road.


I had some colleagues who wanted to talk to me about the free market. Well, I'm a free marketeer to a certain extent. I'm not going to make out that I'm a total free marketeer; I don't mind protected markets. But the thing you need, to be able to make decisions around a free market, is a free market, and there is no free market with respect to this sugar.


What the royal commission almost a hundred years ago, 70-something years ago, decided was the principle of economic interest—so the relationship between the miller and the grower. It didn't matter that the mills were sometimes cooperatively owned by the growers. This principle of economic interest was the safeguard.


Now, when this mob came along, of course, they made undertakings when they came through the Foreign Investment Review Board that they weren't going to disturb these marketing conditions that had prevailed and operated successfully in this space for all of this period of time. One thing I can tell you about the corporation Wilmar is that they are very persistent, and they are very patient. This won't end here today. With this episode today with Senator Leyonhjelm, I've got to imagine that they have persuaded him or convinced him of the merits of his activities here today. There can be no other reason. Senator Leyonhjelm didn't wake up one day in his apartment in Sydney and say, 'Golly gee, by the end of the day I'd better fix this business around sugarcane marketing in a state that I rarely visit.' And, of course, he won't be able to visit it any longer. He won't be able to go to any beach community between Noosa and Cairns unless he's got a wig and a moustache on.


I wasn't even going to speak today, but I was persuaded. I listened to this in my office. He started to make allegations in here that were not accurate. One was that the National Party somehow had some knee-jerk reaction with the code of conduct. Well, I've got to tell you: it's a pretty slowly operating knee, because it started in 2014 and it didn't come into play until any number of years later. And, on the suggestion that somehow a government in which I'm involved has done some dirty deal with any crossbenchers, such as One Nation, I know that One Nation genuinely support agriculture, growers and small farmers in my home state. You couldn't put a Tally-Ho paper between One Nation and the National Party in their attitude to small communities, agriculture and supporting these industries and these particular economies. It wouldn't matter what the circumstances were. It was of no surprise that One Nation themselves turned their attention to this particular issue with the sugar industry and joined us, in effect.


I'm happy to say we were there because our circumstances allowed. We were there well before it. We had spent, in my case, hundreds and hundreds of hours travelling in these inquiries, poring over reports, making adjustments and changes. I must have attended 25 or 30 meetings. When Senator Leyonhjelm says there was no consultation, I've got to tell you that I couldn't even go into my bathroom; representatives of Wilmar and other mills were sitting on the bench there waiting for me in my suite. So any suggestion that we didn't talk to, listen to, debate and argue with every element within industry—and I'm not just talking about canegrowers and cane processors.


I travelled that country up there as many do and my colleagues here do. I've travelled it dozens of times. And this was a topic of conversation with local government, with local business associations, with everybody. So every stakeholder was consulted, and we arrived, at the end of the day, with the decision around the mandatory code. The mandatory code was mandatory as opposed to voluntary because Wilmar indicated that they wouldn't comply with a voluntary code. So it had to be made mandatory for it to have any sort of effect. I like Senator Leyonhjelm and I've got on well with him while I have been here. But—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Senator O'Sullivan, it's the fifth time you've said it, so I will pull you up. It's Senator Leyonhjelm.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  My apologies. I have trouble with long names. I like Senator Leyonhjelm and I've had cooperation with him since I have been here. But I will not tolerate any senator coming in here and attacking the agricultural base of these great families, 4,500 of them, who have provided enormous input to the economy of my state and the economy of this nation. These are decent family men and women. You go there; these are real family communities. These are places where the kids often work on the farm, or not far away, and there are four or five generations involved in the development of sugar. And I'll say to any senator that wants to attack it front on: I won't sleep until I defend these farmers at every level; and if I have to default, if someone has to be favoured, it will be the farmers.


The big boys, the Wilmars, one of the biggest processors in the world, can look after themselves. I don't want to attack Wilmar. They're a company and I'm always very cautious in this place not to do reputational damage to corporations. But one of the telling questions was that Wilmar wanted to enter the marketplace and have the right to sell the sugar of these growers—and they have been granted that right. The old single desk that was around, QSL, was expanded. So Wilmar can, if they choose, entice the growers to allow them to market their sugar, to pick up this other premium that they think is there to be had. But why don't the sugar growers use them? Because there's been a complete and absolute collapse of trust in Wilmar over the last three or four years as these dealings evolved. They don't trust them. They understand that, if they go off there for a fortnight, it's like having a new girlfriend and leaving the wife at home. If QSL is not there, at the end of the day we do have a single desk, a Wilmar desk, controlling the ports and the logistics—and that's when you know you've got trouble. That's when you've got 'farm gate'. That's when you have those little railway lines that go off to the mill and come back still full of cane.


So we will be vigilant on this while ever we're in power. I really appreciate the support of One Nation. I have to correct my colleague, Senator Williams. I think he was a bit hasty in jumping on the Greens. I don't know what the Greens will do with this vote. But there was an indication earlier today when they supported bringing this on and restoring stability into the sugar industry for sugar growers.


I want to close by saying this. My message to Wilmar is: look straight down the barrel. You're not the only one that's patient. You're not the only one that knows how to exercise power. It's a long way between now and when you cripple our sugar industry. It's a long way between now and when you get sole power over this important industry. The message to you is clear: it won't matter whether I'm here, whether Senator Hanson and her colleagues are here or whether Senator Williams is here, our side of politics will continue to protect the interests and integrity of industries that are so important to so many thousands of our families, so many hundreds of our communities, from now until the end of time. So, Wilmar, if you don't like those circumstances, pack your bags and go to Brazil or somewhere else.

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (18:09):  My grandmother would have described the situation with this sugar code as a butty mess. The whole drafting, implementation and now potential disallowance of this code has been mired in party politics. It's been the party politics of the Nationals versus One Nation versus doing deals to stop George Christensen crossing the floor in the other place. It has been a mess. But the people that have been hung out to dry during this mess are the farmers. They are the ones that have been used as political pawns in this political game playing. 


As Greens, we have approached this by saying: 'Look, we don't want to get involved with the murky, messy politics of the Nationals and the Liberals and George Christensen and One Nation in Queensland. That's not what we want to be engaged with.' I understand the Labor Party have basically decided to support this disallowance because they knew that if this code was disallowed all that politics would flare up again and they would be poking the beehive and causing chaos, and that's what they wanted to do. But we decided, 'Look, let's just look at this from a very policy-focused point of view as to what is right.' We decided to go back to Greens principles. And this is a matter of fairness. It is about sugarcane growers versus the predatory behaviours of large, monopolistic corporations.


Yes, this code of conduct isn't perfect. Yes, it was developed, as I said, in that murky mire of politics. Yes, it was developed without a regulatory impact statement. It could have been done a lot better. But, ultimately, having this code with its flaws is much better than having no code at all. So the Greens will not be supporting Senator Leyonhjelm's disallowance of this code tonight, because we are standing up for farmers, against the predatory behaviours of those multinational corporations who, if this code was disallowed and no longer existed, would be able to keep on screwing down the screws and hanging cane growers out to dry. 


Basically, this code is making sure that farmers have access to some protection, protection that they need in order to deal with their local monopolist. It is clear that if this disallowance got up—if we did not have a code of conduct—sugar millers would be able to further abuse their market power. They would be able to do things like pushing Australian cane growers to accept their terms on supply agreements, on marketing choice and on a host of other contractual matters. The code addresses the serious, perverse incentives that otherwise apply for millers to be able to maximise their margins at the expense of growers, which is what monopolies are able to do.


It is effectively a monopoly situation. If you're a cane grower, you don't have a choice as to who you are going to sell your sugar to. There is a massive market imbalance, and that's where you need governments to step in. You need governments to regulate, to level the playing field and give some power back to the growers who otherwise wouldn't have any. There is a very large market imbalance; without this code, sugar millers are able to continue negotiating right up to the day of harvest, knowing that unless a supply agreement is struck the cane growers are legally unable to sell their cane, because a supply agreement has to be in place for the sale to be legal. So there are very strong and necessary reasons that you have a code in place. 


As I said, this code is far from perfect, but it's what we've got. It was introduced without the usual regulatory processes being followed. It was introduced without a regulatory impact statement; there was no formal industry consultation, and it was introduced with a speed that was set not by good process and good governance but by political necessity. That is not good policy practice. But it's here and it's better than nothing. So the Greens want to see this code continue to be in place. There is a review process that's going to occur over the next 12 months. We look forward to that review process and to being able to improve the code. We look forward to the consultation process that will occur as part of that review process, so that we can make sure that all sections of the industry, particularly the canegrowers, are able to get a good outcome that is in the interests of Australia overall.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-17,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (18:15):  Labor is not opposed to a mandatory code, but the current code of conduct is nothing more than a political fix. It was imposed on our sugar industry against their will. There was barely any consultation or assessment of the potential impacts on investment and jobs in the industry. We need to make sure that we get the balance right, bridge the disparity between canegrowers and millers and make sure that no single stakeholder has more power than the other. Any sugar code of conduct must ensure that canegrowers are confident that their livelihoods will be supported by the industry at large, that millers and other industry stakeholders have the capacity to better promote their products, and that there is greater competition in the industry. In particular, we need to ensure that millers are also working in the interest of hardworking canegrowers—the people who actually grow the product that they refine for sale to the rest of the community.


Labor believes that there is a case for a properly and responsibly developed code of conduct which addresses any of the market power imbalances between canegrowers and millers. The re-regulation of Queensland's sugar industry in December 2015 enables sugar canegrowers to direct how millers market sugar internationally. While canegrowers in Queensland were happy to see the changes go through, it looks like further issues have arisen since the re-regulation of the industry. Re-regulation of the sugar industry has restricted competition in the industry, reduced investment in milling capacity and reduced the incentive to promote further innovation in the industry.


Australia is part of a global economy, and our canegrowers are in the situation where they have to compete with other canegrowers from around the world, most notably from Brazil. We need to ensure that our canegrowers, millers and the industry as a whole are able to compete against countries like Brazil. In order for that to happen we need to make sure that the power imbalance between our canegrowers and millers is addressed. The current code of conduct does almost nothing to address this imbalance.


Labor supports further consultation and consideration of the implications that regulation would have on the sugar industry. Until adequate consultation is had and the views of various stakeholders are heard, we believe that the current code is not good enough and should be ripped up.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2017-10-17,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (18:17):  It's quite interesting to hear Labor's comments about the code of conduct—that it's not drafted very well and it's not good, so we'll allow the disallowance motion by Senator Leyonhjelm. The fact is that it was Labor's policy under Wayne Swan that allowed Wilmar, a multinational company, to buy in Australia and buy the mills in north Queensland. Because of that, at that time, a five-year agreement was drawn up where they had to deal with the canegrowers through Queensland Sugar Ltd as well. The canegrowers sell their cane to the mill—it's called a cane supply agreement—and then it is marketed. It was marketed by QSL, who had been doing it for many, many years. The canegrowers got a fair deal because it was set up by the canegrowers originally—a non-profit organisation. But, after the five years, Wilmar said, 'Hang on a minute, we want to take your cane, but we want to market it as well.' It did not give the canegrowers an option about who markets their sugar. There was no option where QSL could market it. Wilmar said, 'We're going to crush your sugar, and we want to mill it as well.' Wilmar, as I've been told, hasn't got a great reputation for selling their product to countries overseas because their quality is not up to standard. QSL has a very, very high reputation with overseas countries and buying Australian sugar.


Hence, why haven't all these sugarcane growers signed up with Wilmar? They were put on the spot. Months and months and months went by. Nothing was done about it, because they didn't trust Wilmar, until they got to the very end. They were forced, and they only had a matter of weeks to go. They had to sign the contract. Why the code of conduct? Because they had to start cutting their cane within a matter of weeks. They needed the code of conduct so then they could determine who would market their sugar.


Why did One Nation get involved? It is because they were hitting their heads up against a brick wall. The growers could not get anyone to listen to them about the situation they were in. And, because the deals were not done and they were not signed up to a cane supply agreement, the whole area lost. A matter of $150 million was taken out of that economy for those canegrowers. Why did One Nation take a stand on this? We abstained from voting on the floor of parliament until we actually got a code of conduct for the canegrowers, because they were on their knees. No-one was listening to them. Nothing was being done. And I'm pleased that we forced the issue.


I was pleased to hear Senator Barry O'Sullivan. He has been involved in this in attending meetings. I attended meetings up in North Queensland myself. I spoke to the canegrowers. I don't recall ever seeing Senator Leyonhjelm, the senator for New South Wales, at any of those meetings. I have no understanding of—I am gobsmacked to understand—why Senator Leyonhjelm is actually supporting a multinational company over the canegrowers.


I really appreciate how the Greens are viewing this and their support on this matter, because it is all about the growers. It's all about the struggling families.


When I spoke to Senator Leyonhjelm about this, I said, 'Why are you doing this to the growers?' And his response was, 'Well, they can actually go and take it to another mill.' But they can't. They have to put it on the rail lines. The rail lines are owned by Wilmar. It has to go to the mill. 'Well, they can put it on trucks and ship it somewhere else.' No, you can't do that. You see, once the cane is cut, it's 12 hours; it has to get to the mill. So there's nowhere else they can take it. So the whole fact is: 'Well, tell them to get out of it. Go and do another business. Go and get out of the cane growing.' No wonder the farmers are fed up with this attitude. Some of them are saying to the kids now: 'Get off the farm. There's no future here. We don't know what's going to happen.'


And here we have the Labor Party saying, 'Oh, well, it's drawn up in a hurry, so we need to really look at this before we do anything about it.' It's about time you started listening to the Australian people and what's happening to them. They are just about going under, losing their properties and everything because they can't get an agreement, didn't know whether they should cut their cane or what to do with it—and you're worried about whether a code of conduct is drawn up properly. Probably not. But—do you know what?—it's given them a grace period of approximately two, maybe three, years. It's not settled yet. And your Labor Party counterparts in Queensland haven't supported them either. I hope they realise that come the next election, when they won't get the votes from them. They won't be voting for the Labor Party. They haven't supported them at all. And I've got to say that the LNP in Queensland hasn't been much better either in supporting them.


Wilmar also have a 30 per cent ownership in the QSL, so I have no understanding of why they want to dictate and determine it. Talk about multinationals—and all I hear now is the Labor Party supporting multinationals. That's exactly what they're doing: supporting big business in Australia. Wilmar are a Singaporean that's come in to dictate terms. The Labor Party agreed to it, to allow them to take over a mill that controls the whole area. This is what multinationals, foreign ownership, can do in our country. We've seen it not once, not twice; we've seen it many, many times.


Jobs—yes, we've got to protect jobs in Australia. If we see the canegrowers go under, in North Queensland or throughout the state, it will also affect the mills, and then you will have more people out of work. If you haven't got cane farming, you don't need the mills. All of North Queensland relies on the money brought in by the canegrowers.


So I call on the Labor Party: please consider this. Do not allow this disallowance motion to pass in this chamber today. It will affect the canegrowers again. It is under review; let's find something better; but, for the next two to three years, let's just support the system the way it is and find a better answer. Throwing these regulations out will not help the canegrowers at all. They're depending on us to make the right decisions for them in this chamber. It's all about their future. It's all about their kids. It's all about their farming, which is so important to us. I once again say thank you very much to the Greens for looking at this rationally and not supporting the disallowance motion, and I thank the Liberal and National parties also for their support of the canegrowers.

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-10-17,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (18:26):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I am against this disallowance. We acted. We listened. This action was initiated by the canegrowers. It was not initiated by a strike pulled by Senator Hanson. All we did was listen, and then all we did was take action. This issue at its core is about farmers, food production and not being heard; and it's about farmers, food producers, with little power.


I'm proud of the fact that, over the last 170 years, since the Industrial Revolution—actually, over the last 250 years, thanks to the revolution in Britain and governance; actually, over the last 700 years, since the Magna Carta—we have lived in the sort of country that we live in today. Those events were due to freedom. They were due to largely free markets. At my core, I am a libertarian. I believe passionately in freedom of speech and freedom of markets. But, sadly, we do not have free markets globally. We do not have free markets in this country. I have worked and lived and studied in the United States. They do not have free markets. Increasingly, government is getting involved around the world, and it is causing problems. For those who live in cities, perhaps you can identify with another problem—the problem facing taxi drivers. We know it in Brisbane, we know it in Queensland and it's the same around the country. Taxi drivers are saddled now with expensive plates because Uber has come in with none of the burdens faced by taxi drivers. The core problem there is excessive government in the first place. While government was initially protecting some rich taxi drivers, that has turned and become government now impeding all taxi drivers.


We live in the real world. I admire Senator Leyonhjelm's philosophy, his honesty and his integrity with his principles. However, we do not live in a free world. We live in a world that has been manipulated and distorted by governments for many, many decades. This building, in my honest opinion, has been very destructive in some of the policies and government interventions that have come out of here. At its core, I'll bet the roots of this issue go back to excessive government intervention in the first place. In the real world, this kind of world, we need to look after the basics—the basics like food production; the basics of making sure that farmers have free access and free support. Food is an issue for all city dwellers. We all eat, and food is an issue for all people who buy food. It is part of the process to produce, distribute, process, distribute and then eat food. In this process, the leach is the government, quite often.


But the casualties are in the communities. When I went through Home Hill and Ayr not long ago, the number of businesses boarded up with blank windows and empty buildings was staggering. That means the community is suffering. I see initiatives in the regional towns—not far to the north, in Ingham—not being supported by the government and not being supported by the LNP in Queensland, the Labor Party in Queensland or their local members. Yet these are initiatives that regional people from Queensland are initiating which could contribute to fixing health problems around our whole country. Government is not doing its job. This industry's future depends on the process of farming, which, as Senator O'Sullivan said, can take many years to plan for and harvest to then get the rewards from the crop. It can take many years.


As Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Lending to Primary Production Customers, it has become clear to me that in addition to some of the banks' behaviours, some of the receivers' behaviours and some of the other people in the chain, one other entity has been doing enormous damage, and that entity is government both state and federal. Think about this: a farmer goes and buys some land. He or she then has property rights. Those property rights are then stolen. That land is worth less as a result of government intervention—government stealing land. Today in Queensland we see farmers actually suffering a loss of property rights thanks to the current Labor government and past Labor governments. That property rights issue destroys land values, destroys farm productivity and raises costs for farmers.


Another issue that governments control is tax. Tax is crippling. We have taxes on payroll, of all things. We know that if we tax something we decrease its use. Why are we taxing payroll? We know that it's difficult in our country for farmers to get labour in towns with high unemployment, and that's why we need backpackers. Something is wrong. We saw in 2011 the live cattle trade completely shut down overnight. We saw cattle then being moved from the north of Western Australia all the way down into New South Wales to be sold, and the prices plummeted and communities were devastated. Farmers and families were devastated and people were suiciding.


And then we see government intervention in the form of water control. Some of the farmers—there are some here now—from the Burdekin have had an increase of around 300 per cent in the cost of their water in recent years. Overall, I'm told, that most farmers have faced a 50 per cent increase in their water costs. But that's not all. They say power prices have increased 110 per cent in recent years in a state where the state government wants to destroy a cheap, reliable and secure source of power and replace it with a renewable energy target of 50 per cent—and the LNP supports that by supporting the Labor budget.


These farmers, some of whom are here, are not wealthy. They work in delicatessens and they own delicatessens to make sure that they can get by. Some do earth moving on the side to keep them busy and to get by. They are stressed. It doesn't matter whether they're cotton farmers from Mondure, or cattle men or what: these days they face international markets and they have to be very much on top of the science, to be au fait with the economics and to be lawyers—because they're taken to court or they have a state government stealing property rights. So they need to be experts in everything, and that's not fair. We pay for it throughout the country. We have the best farmers in the world—from the dry south-west right through to the tropical Cape York. We have the best farmers in the world, but they're challenged by overseas subsidies paid by foreign governments. Their challenged by overseas companies coming in here. They're challenged by our own government policies and regulations destroying businesses, making it difficult even to live. There are tax, energy costs, property rights and—there it is again—government. Government needs to get out. But in this case we have an imbalance of power—a huge imbalance of power. We have a $7 million company versus a $40 billion corporation who has legal power, market power and staying power.


This is about trust, as Senator Hanson so wisely said. This is about making sure Australians have a fair go, because under tax regimes in this country foreign companies quite often don't pay any company tax. That puts them at a 30 per cent advantage straight away. This is not a simple little issue.


We are against this disallowance. Our responsibility in One Nation is to listen, to ask questions, to listen, to take action, to listen, to serve and to be accountable, and we are willing to be accountable to the canegrowers of Queensland. We're willing to check ourselves and we want to restore our Constitution. We congratulate the canefarmers and we congratulate Senator Hanson for taking her action. This is a matter of trust, and we will not be supporting this disallowance.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Social Services and Multicultural Affairs) (18:36):  The government opposes the disallowance motion. The coalition government delivered a mandatory sugar code of conduct to support dealing with sugar mills in time for the June 2017 crush. The coalition government introduced a code following a listening tour of growers in North Queensland to assist growers, mills and marketers dealing with disputes. The code came into immediate effect in April following months of protracted negotiations between growers, mills and sugar marketers.


Farmers have welcomed the code, which has had a positive impact on the industry, with all growers able to sign agreements prior to commencement of the 2017 crush. The new code guarantees growers choice in marketer as well as providing precontract arbitration between mill owners and marketers and between canegrowers and mill owners if an agreement cannot be reached.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2017-10-17,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (17:40):  I move:


That the Competition and Consumer (Industry Code—Sugar) Regulations 2017, made under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, be disallowed.


Tonight we're considering the unbalanced code of conduct covering the sugar industry. This unbalanced code was hastily prepared in response to One Nation saying that they would go on strike if such a code wasn't introduced. This threat not to vote on legislation was made back in March, when the government was seeking to legislate to lower the company tax rate, an issue of great significance to Australia. The code is also a response to the Nationals wanting to demonstrate that they can respond in knee-jerk fashion to short-sighted complaints as quickly as One Nation can.


Because it was hastily prepared, there was none of the usual consultation covering all the stakeholders that would be subject to the code. Because the code is so fundamental to the functioning of the industry, this is an irresponsible omission. Because the code was a response to short-sighted complaints, it is not like the codes of conduct found in other industries, which take an even-handed approach and make clear that negotiations are to be in good faith. Instead, this code tilts the scales heavily in favour of the blinkered demands of those who complain the most, to the long-term detriment of the entire sugar industry. With the Greens and some other crossbenchers willing to jump into bed with One Nation and the Nationals on this, it looks like the long-term decline in Australia's share of global sugar production is set to continue. Once again we see that the antibusiness, foreigner-fearing Greens and One Nation are more alike than either wants to admit.


This code is not a balanced code of conduct, because it allows arbitration pre contract and it is proscriptive about the arbitrator's role. The code refers to 'grower economic interest sugar', which is a concept set in Queensland legislation. The code forces the arbitrator to rule that the marketing entity for this sugar must be chosen by the canegrowers. Yet this is sugar made and owned by a miller. The decisions as to how that sugar will be sold will be taken out of the hands of the miller. Forcing a miller to negotiate with an input supplier over the sale of the miller's own products and to comply with the directives of an arbitrator should it fail to agree with those input suppliers is not a formula for business confidence.


It's a pretty safe bet that there won't be a rush of additional investment in sugar mills while this code remains. That's important because our international competitiveness is already marginal. If sugar milling becomes uncompetitive through lack of investment, canegrowers will suffer as much as anyone. What growers really need is competition for their cane. They ought to be doing everything possible to attract new entrants into milling, if not investing their own money. As it stands, the only people who say the canegrowers have a legitimate claim are those who are pandering to get their vote, plus a few who don't like foreign investment and don't understand the issues. Significantly, neither the Productivity Commission nor the Queensland Productivity Commission supported this sort of government intervention, noting that it would cost money and jobs.


It really comes down to the idea that you shouldn't control what you don't own. Once canegrowers deliver their cane to a railway siding or delivery point near their farm, it belongs to the mill, which processes it into sugar. In the past, when many sugar mills were owned by grower cooperatives, canegrowers felt they had some—albeit remote—influence over how the mill marketed its sugar. Australia has a very minor influence on world sugar prices, but growers liked the thought that they had a say. Those days are gone. Most mills now have no grower shareholders at all. However, despite having sold the cane and with no equity in either the sugar or the mill, growers are still demanding a say over who markets the sugar. Some of the owners of mills have vast access to international markets and have put real money into sugar communities. But it seems the main point people make about these owners is the complaint that they are foreigners.


This disallowance motion may well be defeated, but the real losers will be future generations of Queenslanders who will continue to see their share of the global sugar market fall to countries with a more business friendly approach. I commend the motion to the Senate.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2017-10-17,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (17:46):  Senator Leyonhjelm has it very wrong here. Leaving it to the market is fine when you have a fair, competitive market. But the fact is that, when canegrowers grow their cane, they must take it as quickly as possible to the nearest processing plant—the nearest mill. They can't say, 'Oh, the price today at this mill is such and such and down the road it's a better price.' You can't take it down the road.


Early in 2014 I met with sugarcane growers at Condong, near Murwillumbah. I spoke to my colleague Queensland Nationals Senator Barry O'Sullivan—welcome to the chamber—in June, and we instigated an inquiry through the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee in June 2014. We held hearings at Murwillumbah, Mackay and Townsville. They were attended at various times by Senator O'Sullivan, Senator Canavan, Senator Macdonald, former Senator Bullock and committee chair Senator Sterle.


Sugarcane production contributes $2.5 billion to the Australian economy each year and is largely concentrated along Australia's eastern coastline in Queensland and New South Wales. That's where the sugar's mainly grown. Queensland has the bulk of the sugar produced by the states, at 95 per cent, and only five per cent is in New South Wales. While it is vastly different, there are some issues which are of common concern to both states.


Wilmar, MSF Sugar and Tully Sugar had given notice to terminate their RSS agreements with Queensland Sugar Limited in 2017. This caused great concern in the industry. As the inquiry progressed, it became clear that grower choice in relation to grower economic interest in sugar was an issue of central importance to growers and their representative bodies. Canegrowers and the Australian Cane Farm Association suggest any real choice for canegrowers would be removed if the large milling companies were to take control of the sugar marketing sector. Growers were acutely aware that they were at a disadvantage when it came to the amount of power the milling companies held at the time. The committee was told that, in fact, both sectors of the industry had been experiencing considerable difficulties in their attempts to decide on terms and reach agreements on new contracts.


Burdekin District Cane Growers Limited also argued that the tension between growers and millers such as Wilmar had more to do with the imbalance of bargaining power between growers and Wilmar Sugar than it does with Wilmar Sugar being a foreign-owned company. The committee was told there was no statutory or mandatory dispute resolution process which would assist sugar industry stakeholders, both canegrowers and millers, to resolve commercial disputes. The committee observed the strong interrelationship and interdependence which exists between sugarcane growers and sugar milling companies. It was clear that neither would be able to survive without the other remaining profitable and sustainable. There was a lack of trust on the part of the canegrowers in relation to the large milling companies, particularly Wilmar. It was agreed that Wilmar needed to come to the table prepared to engage in positive negotiations with canegrowers and their representatives and that the canegrowers needed to show they were prepared to negotiate in a positive way.


At the same time as the Senate inquiry, a task force was involved in the development of a code of conduct for the industry and there was only one recommendation, which stated:


The committee recommends the development and implementation of a mandatory sugar industry code of conduct acknowledging that provide appropriate stake holder consultation is undertaking the work of the sugar marketing code of conduct task force may provide a foundation on which a code of conduct may be established.


The code came into force April this year. Quotes from the correspondence received in my office from CANEGROWERS Mackay, which represents 1,100 members, said:


The code came into force in April 2017. Three years into a bitter dispute triggered by several mill owners attempting to unilaterally take control of all sugar marketing in their regions. Assisting a resolution in that dispute, the code is now a point of security for you in our future negotiations. The code addresses a power imbalance between millers and growers by requiring good faith, fair and honest negotiations without intimidation.. In the case of Wilmar sugar suppliers in 2017, the code of conduct forced the miller to complete a cane supplier agreement negotiations and prevented it from continuing to hold growers to ransom head of the start of the season.


CANEGROWERS Cairns Region said in a letter to me:


The sugar industry code of conduct is point of security for our organisation in all negotiations with our only available milling company, MSF Sugar Limited.


Senator Leyonhjelm talks about the market. I will repeat what they say:


… with our only available milling company, MSF Sugar Limited. Should the code be disallowed, our sugar cane producers would be put in an extremely vulnerable position in an area where the mill owners, MSF Sugar, has a regional monopoly.


Here's the point, senators, about monopolies. Tableland Canegrowers Limited, which represents 80 growers on the Atherton Tableland, told me:


This disallowance motion disregards a 2015 Senate committee's recommendation, pre-judges the code form review in 2018 and was introduced by a senator who has not taken the time to talk to sugar canegrowers, representatives of the industry or to understand its recent history.


CANEGROWERS Proserpine, which represents 200 growers, wrote to me asking that I not support this disallowance and pointing out that it fixes the imbalance between growers and millers.


Senator Leyonhjelm doesn't seem to understand how the sugar industry works. I note that in a new article on 15 September he said:


Growers need to accept the new reality of multinational companies owning Queensland sugar mills.


The manager of Proserpine CANEGROWERS, Mike Porter, said in the same article that his growers get about 60 per cent of the estimated value of the cane delivered to the mill, and for Senator Leyonhjelm to say that they get 90 per cent is stretching it. Senator Leyonhjelm says that spending $400 million on the regulation of the sugar industry was a waste, but this was shot down by Mr Porter, who said that rationalisation has created a lot of efficiencies and that the Australian industry is one of the most efficient in the world, and probably the envy of most countries that grow sugar.


It was Minister Barnaby Joyce who said to the sugar industry, 'Come to an agreement, get your act in order, make a decision, or we will.' He said that for months before this was released. Sure, it was backed by Senator Hanson and One Nation. We launched an inquiry in 2014, Senator O'Sullivan and I. We carried out the inquiry, along with other senators here, and we saw how the market is simply unfair in the sugar industry and how the big end of town has a monopoly and can dictate the terms to the canegrowers.


Once again, the canegrower, the primary producer, is a price taker not a price maker. Not many of you in this Senate would understand what I'm talking about, but I have lived it for most of my life. Now we have the situation where we now have surety and security and everyone is happy. As I said, Minister Joyce said to them, 'If you don't come to an agreement with the growers and companies like Wilmar, we will put a mandatory code of conduct in.' And we did. Thank you for honouring your word again, Minister Joyce.


Now we have someone, in the form of Senator Leyonhjelm, trying to disallow this—I believe he is backed by the Labor Party and probably the Greens as well. This is scary. Why have you got such a set on primary producers? If the market were fair I would totally support this, but the market is not fair. A canegrower must take their cane to the nearest mill within hours of cutting it. There's none of this: 'What's the price at this mill today?' 'It's such and such.' 'I'll get a quote down the road; I'll take it to the mill down the road.' You can't do that, you have to run it to the nearest mill. There is no competition as far as the mill goes, so the market is failing. It is unfair, and that's why it needs a code of conduct to deliver fairness to the canegrowers. I urge senators to vote against this disallowance motion.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (17:55):  I will only trouble the Senate for a few moments. I regret that this motion has been brought on at this time. I'd had some conversations with Senator Leyonhjelm about delaying or deferring it for the simple reason that I needed more information in order to make a decision.


I've met with some of the canegrowers and I have respect for their position, albeit that slightly nuanced positions have been put to me in some of the discussions with different interest groups. What I haven't been able to ascertain is the position of the 'alternative narrative' from the other side of the equation.


As I said, I regret that the government has brought this on. I still don't understand the particular reasoning for it but I will listen to the debate and make my decision accordingly.

",Senate,<title>REGULATIONS AND DETERMINATIONS</title>,<title>Disallowance</title>,REGULATIONS AND DETERMINATIONS,20,2
"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2017-10-17,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (17:56):  I can clear up a couple of things for Senator Bernardi.



Senator Bernardi interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Just for a moment, Senator Bernardi—I'd appreciate that. This matter has now been lingering around this place for multiple weeks. Without directing my attention to Senator Bernardi, I think there's been adequate time for any senator to explore all sides of this equation in order to make their mind up about whether they should or shouldn't support this disallowance motion. Indeed, reference to the report that Senator Williams has spoken about would have articulated it clearly. That was a massive inquiry. Senator Macdonald, who is the father of the Senate, told me he'd never been at a Senate hearing with as many stakeholders present. In Townsville there were over 350 in a massive hall. They just attended to observe the conduct of the inquiry. All the millers were there and all the growers were there. So that would have aided it.


But can I say, Senator Bernardi, that the reason this motion was brought on today is that this has been continuing to cause great angst back in this industry. It has had nearly three years where people weren't able to plan. Planning around sugar is a big deal; you've got to make a decision now about a five-year business plan. So, the investment that you make this season will have impacts on your business operations for five years. After three years of uncertainty, which was stabilised with the application of the code, there was a massive sigh of relief across the canegrowers in my home state of Queensland, which is largely where the production in this country is. I know that Senator Williams has cane production in the northern part of New South Wales, but Australia's cane production is largely in the state of Queensland. There was a huge sigh of relief—and I mean from people in their thousands. I've been here nearly four years now, and I've never had so much correspondence and traffic—phone calls and contact events—made over an issue as I did over sugar. There are, on average, 4,500 families and something like 67 small communities involved, and if the sugar industry is disrupted it will disrupt their economies and their social circumstances right across my home state. They are small communities, some of them with only a couple of hundred residents. You could probably argue that this instability ran from somewhere north of the Tweed and up through Childers with a break and then through to production areas around Serena and Mackay and all the way up the coast almost all the way to Cairns. There is not one of those small coastal communities on the eastern side of the Great Divide that would not be affected by this continued instability in the sugar industry.


We don't even need to return to our contemporary inquiry to understand why this became necessary. There was a royal commission in this country in 1932, I think it was, into the sugar industry because the sugar industry was not developing. That was because of the concern about the power imbalance of millers with respect to this particular commodity.


I just want to pick up and elaborate further on a couple of points made by Senator Williams. This commodity has to be harvested in a very short period of time. It's measured in weeks. It's not as if you can just throw the crop in and say, 'I'll come back from holidays in January, and I'll take the crop off, or, if that doesn't suit me, I'll wait until Easter,' or use any of the other rotations that can occur with other commodities. Once it's harvested, its life, its productivity, is measured in hours, not even days. What happens to it is that it goes onto a little, flimsy carriage on a little, flimsy rail line, and it can only go to one place. That's the mill. It can't be stored. It's not efficient to transport it by any other method to another mill—and, even if you could, you are likely, in my home state of Queensland, to arrive at another mill owned by the same miller you were trying to avoid 60 kilometres down the road.


I had some colleagues who wanted to talk to me about the free market. Well, I'm a free marketeer to a certain extent. I'm not going to make out that I'm a total free marketeer; I don't mind protected markets. But the thing you need, to be able to make decisions around a free market, is a free market, and there is no free market with respect to this sugar.


What the royal commission almost a hundred years ago, 70-something years ago, decided was the principle of economic interest—so the relationship between the miller and the grower. It didn't matter that the mills were sometimes cooperatively owned by the growers. This principle of economic interest was the safeguard.


Now, when this mob came along, of course, they made undertakings when they came through the Foreign Investment Review Board that they weren't going to disturb these marketing conditions that had prevailed and operated successfully in this space for all of this period of time. One thing I can tell you about the corporation Wilmar is that they are very persistent, and they are very patient. This won't end here today. With this episode today with Senator Leyonhjelm, I've got to imagine that they have persuaded him or convinced him of the merits of his activities here today. There can be no other reason. Senator Leyonhjelm didn't wake up one day in his apartment in Sydney and say, 'Golly gee, by the end of the day I'd better fix this business around sugarcane marketing in a state that I rarely visit.' And, of course, he won't be able to visit it any longer. He won't be able to go to any beach community between Noosa and Cairns unless he's got a wig and a moustache on.


I wasn't even going to speak today, but I was persuaded. I listened to this in my office. He started to make allegations in here that were not accurate. One was that the National Party somehow had some knee-jerk reaction with the code of conduct. Well, I've got to tell you: it's a pretty slowly operating knee, because it started in 2014 and it didn't come into play until any number of years later. And, on the suggestion that somehow a government in which I'm involved has done some dirty deal with any crossbenchers, such as One Nation, I know that One Nation genuinely support agriculture, growers and small farmers in my home state. You couldn't put a Tally-Ho paper between One Nation and the National Party in their attitude to small communities, agriculture and supporting these industries and these particular economies. It wouldn't matter what the circumstances were. It was of no surprise that One Nation themselves turned their attention to this particular issue with the sugar industry and joined us, in effect.


I'm happy to say we were there because our circumstances allowed. We were there well before it. We had spent, in my case, hundreds and hundreds of hours travelling in these inquiries, poring over reports, making adjustments and changes. I must have attended 25 or 30 meetings. When Senator Leyonhjelm says there was no consultation, I've got to tell you that I couldn't even go into my bathroom; representatives of Wilmar and other mills were sitting on the bench there waiting for me in my suite. So any suggestion that we didn't talk to, listen to, debate and argue with every element within industry—and I'm not just talking about canegrowers and cane processors.


I travelled that country up there as many do and my colleagues here do. I've travelled it dozens of times. And this was a topic of conversation with local government, with local business associations, with everybody. So every stakeholder was consulted, and we arrived, at the end of the day, with the decision around the mandatory code. The mandatory code was mandatory as opposed to voluntary because Wilmar indicated that they wouldn't comply with a voluntary code. So it had to be made mandatory for it to have any sort of effect. I like Senator Leyonhjelm and I've got on well with him while I have been here. But—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Senator O'Sullivan, it's the fifth time you've said it, so I will pull you up. It's Senator Leyonhjelm.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  My apologies. I have trouble with long names. I like Senator Leyonhjelm and I've had cooperation with him since I have been here. But I will not tolerate any senator coming in here and attacking the agricultural base of these great families, 4,500 of them, who have provided enormous input to the economy of my state and the economy of this nation. These are decent family men and women. You go there; these are real family communities. These are places where the kids often work on the farm, or not far away, and there are four or five generations involved in the development of sugar. And I'll say to any senator that wants to attack it front on: I won't sleep until I defend these farmers at every level; and if I have to default, if someone has to be favoured, it will be the farmers.


The big boys, the Wilmars, one of the biggest processors in the world, can look after themselves. I don't want to attack Wilmar. They're a company and I'm always very cautious in this place not to do reputational damage to corporations. But one of the telling questions was that Wilmar wanted to enter the marketplace and have the right to sell the sugar of these growers—and they have been granted that right. The old single desk that was around, QSL, was expanded. So Wilmar can, if they choose, entice the growers to allow them to market their sugar, to pick up this other premium that they think is there to be had. But why don't the sugar growers use them? Because there's been a complete and absolute collapse of trust in Wilmar over the last three or four years as these dealings evolved. They don't trust them. They understand that, if they go off there for a fortnight, it's like having a new girlfriend and leaving the wife at home. If QSL is not there, at the end of the day we do have a single desk, a Wilmar desk, controlling the ports and the logistics—and that's when you know you've got trouble. That's when you've got 'farm gate'. That's when you have those little railway lines that go off to the mill and come back still full of cane.


So we will be vigilant on this while ever we're in power. I really appreciate the support of One Nation. I have to correct my colleague, Senator Williams. I think he was a bit hasty in jumping on the Greens. I don't know what the Greens will do with this vote. But there was an indication earlier today when they supported bringing this on and restoring stability into the sugar industry for sugar growers.


I want to close by saying this. My message to Wilmar is: look straight down the barrel. You're not the only one that's patient. You're not the only one that knows how to exercise power. It's a long way between now and when you cripple our sugar industry. It's a long way between now and when you get sole power over this important industry. The message to you is clear: it won't matter whether I'm here, whether Senator Hanson and her colleagues are here or whether Senator Williams is here, our side of politics will continue to protect the interests and integrity of industries that are so important to so many thousands of our families, so many hundreds of our communities, from now until the end of time. So, Wilmar, if you don't like those circumstances, pack your bags and go to Brazil or somewhere else.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-10-17,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (18:09):  My grandmother would have described the situation with this sugar code as a butty mess. The whole drafting, implementation and now potential disallowance of this code has been mired in party politics. It's been the party politics of the Nationals versus One Nation versus doing deals to stop George Christensen crossing the floor in the other place. It has been a mess. But the people that have been hung out to dry during this mess are the farmers. They are the ones that have been used as political pawns in this political game playing. 


As Greens, we have approached this by saying: 'Look, we don't want to get involved with the murky, messy politics of the Nationals and the Liberals and George Christensen and One Nation in Queensland. That's not what we want to be engaged with.' I understand the Labor Party have basically decided to support this disallowance because they knew that if this code was disallowed all that politics would flare up again and they would be poking the beehive and causing chaos, and that's what they wanted to do. But we decided, 'Look, let's just look at this from a very policy-focused point of view as to what is right.' We decided to go back to Greens principles. And this is a matter of fairness. It is about sugarcane growers versus the predatory behaviours of large, monopolistic corporations.


Yes, this code of conduct isn't perfect. Yes, it was developed, as I said, in that murky mire of politics. Yes, it was developed without a regulatory impact statement. It could have been done a lot better. But, ultimately, having this code with its flaws is much better than having no code at all. So the Greens will not be supporting Senator Leyonhjelm's disallowance of this code tonight, because we are standing up for farmers, against the predatory behaviours of those multinational corporations who, if this code was disallowed and no longer existed, would be able to keep on screwing down the screws and hanging cane growers out to dry. 


Basically, this code is making sure that farmers have access to some protection, protection that they need in order to deal with their local monopolist. It is clear that if this disallowance got up—if we did not have a code of conduct—sugar millers would be able to further abuse their market power. They would be able to do things like pushing Australian cane growers to accept their terms on supply agreements, on marketing choice and on a host of other contractual matters. The code addresses the serious, perverse incentives that otherwise apply for millers to be able to maximise their margins at the expense of growers, which is what monopolies are able to do.


It is effectively a monopoly situation. If you're a cane grower, you don't have a choice as to who you are going to sell your sugar to. There is a massive market imbalance, and that's where you need governments to step in. You need governments to regulate, to level the playing field and give some power back to the growers who otherwise wouldn't have any. There is a very large market imbalance; without this code, sugar millers are able to continue negotiating right up to the day of harvest, knowing that unless a supply agreement is struck the cane growers are legally unable to sell their cane, because a supply agreement has to be in place for the sale to be legal. So there are very strong and necessary reasons that you have a code in place. 


As I said, this code is far from perfect, but it's what we've got. It was introduced without the usual regulatory processes being followed. It was introduced without a regulatory impact statement; there was no formal industry consultation, and it was introduced with a speed that was set not by good process and good governance but by political necessity. That is not good policy practice. But it's here and it's better than nothing. So the Greens want to see this code continue to be in place. There is a review process that's going to occur over the next 12 months. We look forward to that review process and to being able to improve the code. We look forward to the consultation process that will occur as part of that review process, so that we can make sure that all sections of the industry, particularly the canegrowers, are able to get a good outcome that is in the interests of Australia overall.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-17,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (18:15):  Labor is not opposed to a mandatory code, but the current code of conduct is nothing more than a political fix. It was imposed on our sugar industry against their will. There was barely any consultation or assessment of the potential impacts on investment and jobs in the industry. We need to make sure that we get the balance right, bridge the disparity between canegrowers and millers and make sure that no single stakeholder has more power than the other. Any sugar code of conduct must ensure that canegrowers are confident that their livelihoods will be supported by the industry at large, that millers and other industry stakeholders have the capacity to better promote their products, and that there is greater competition in the industry. In particular, we need to ensure that millers are also working in the interest of hardworking canegrowers—the people who actually grow the product that they refine for sale to the rest of the community.


Labor believes that there is a case for a properly and responsibly developed code of conduct which addresses any of the market power imbalances between canegrowers and millers. The re-regulation of Queensland's sugar industry in December 2015 enables sugar canegrowers to direct how millers market sugar internationally. While canegrowers in Queensland were happy to see the changes go through, it looks like further issues have arisen since the re-regulation of the industry. Re-regulation of the sugar industry has restricted competition in the industry, reduced investment in milling capacity and reduced the incentive to promote further innovation in the industry.


Australia is part of a global economy, and our canegrowers are in the situation where they have to compete with other canegrowers from around the world, most notably from Brazil. We need to ensure that our canegrowers, millers and the industry as a whole are able to compete against countries like Brazil. In order for that to happen we need to make sure that the power imbalance between our canegrowers and millers is addressed. The current code of conduct does almost nothing to address this imbalance.


Labor supports further consultation and consideration of the implications that regulation would have on the sugar industry. Until adequate consultation is had and the views of various stakeholders are heard, we believe that the current code is not good enough and should be ripped up.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2017-10-17,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (18:17):  It's quite interesting to hear Labor's comments about the code of conduct—that it's not drafted very well and it's not good, so we'll allow the disallowance motion by Senator Leyonhjelm. The fact is that it was Labor's policy under Wayne Swan that allowed Wilmar, a multinational company, to buy in Australia and buy the mills in north Queensland. Because of that, at that time, a five-year agreement was drawn up where they had to deal with the canegrowers through Queensland Sugar Ltd as well. The canegrowers sell their cane to the mill—it's called a cane supply agreement—and then it is marketed. It was marketed by QSL, who had been doing it for many, many years. The canegrowers got a fair deal because it was set up by the canegrowers originally—a non-profit organisation. But, after the five years, Wilmar said, 'Hang on a minute, we want to take your cane, but we want to market it as well.' It did not give the canegrowers an option about who markets their sugar. There was no option where QSL could market it. Wilmar said, 'We're going to crush your sugar, and we want to mill it as well.' Wilmar, as I've been told, hasn't got a great reputation for selling their product to countries overseas because their quality is not up to standard. QSL has a very, very high reputation with overseas countries and buying Australian sugar.


Hence, why haven't all these sugarcane growers signed up with Wilmar? They were put on the spot. Months and months and months went by. Nothing was done about it, because they didn't trust Wilmar, until they got to the very end. They were forced, and they only had a matter of weeks to go. They had to sign the contract. Why the code of conduct? Because they had to start cutting their cane within a matter of weeks. They needed the code of conduct so then they could determine who would market their sugar.


Why did One Nation get involved? It is because they were hitting their heads up against a brick wall. The growers could not get anyone to listen to them about the situation they were in. And, because the deals were not done and they were not signed up to a cane supply agreement, the whole area lost. A matter of $150 million was taken out of that economy for those canegrowers. Why did One Nation take a stand on this? We abstained from voting on the floor of parliament until we actually got a code of conduct for the canegrowers, because they were on their knees. No-one was listening to them. Nothing was being done. And I'm pleased that we forced the issue.


I was pleased to hear Senator Barry O'Sullivan. He has been involved in this in attending meetings. I attended meetings up in North Queensland myself. I spoke to the canegrowers. I don't recall ever seeing Senator Leyonhjelm, the senator for New South Wales, at any of those meetings. I have no understanding of—I am gobsmacked to understand—why Senator Leyonhjelm is actually supporting a multinational company over the canegrowers.


I really appreciate how the Greens are viewing this and their support on this matter, because it is all about the growers. It's all about the struggling families.


When I spoke to Senator Leyonhjelm about this, I said, 'Why are you doing this to the growers?' And his response was, 'Well, they can actually go and take it to another mill.' But they can't. They have to put it on the rail lines. The rail lines are owned by Wilmar. It has to go to the mill. 'Well, they can put it on trucks and ship it somewhere else.' No, you can't do that. You see, once the cane is cut, it's 12 hours; it has to get to the mill. So there's nowhere else they can take it. So the whole fact is: 'Well, tell them to get out of it. Go and do another business. Go and get out of the cane growing.' No wonder the farmers are fed up with this attitude. Some of them are saying to the kids now: 'Get off the farm. There's no future here. We don't know what's going to happen.'


And here we have the Labor Party saying, 'Oh, well, it's drawn up in a hurry, so we need to really look at this before we do anything about it.' It's about time you started listening to the Australian people and what's happening to them. They are just about going under, losing their properties and everything because they can't get an agreement, didn't know whether they should cut their cane or what to do with it—and you're worried about whether a code of conduct is drawn up properly. Probably not. But—do you know what?—it's given them a grace period of approximately two, maybe three, years. It's not settled yet. And your Labor Party counterparts in Queensland haven't supported them either. I hope they realise that come the next election, when they won't get the votes from them. They won't be voting for the Labor Party. They haven't supported them at all. And I've got to say that the LNP in Queensland hasn't been much better either in supporting them.


Wilmar also have a 30 per cent ownership in the QSL, so I have no understanding of why they want to dictate and determine it. Talk about multinationals—and all I hear now is the Labor Party supporting multinationals. That's exactly what they're doing: supporting big business in Australia. Wilmar are a Singaporean that's come in to dictate terms. The Labor Party agreed to it, to allow them to take over a mill that controls the whole area. This is what multinationals, foreign ownership, can do in our country. We've seen it not once, not twice; we've seen it many, many times.


Jobs—yes, we've got to protect jobs in Australia. If we see the canegrowers go under, in North Queensland or throughout the state, it will also affect the mills, and then you will have more people out of work. If you haven't got cane farming, you don't need the mills. All of North Queensland relies on the money brought in by the canegrowers.


So I call on the Labor Party: please consider this. Do not allow this disallowance motion to pass in this chamber today. It will affect the canegrowers again. It is under review; let's find something better; but, for the next two to three years, let's just support the system the way it is and find a better answer. Throwing these regulations out will not help the canegrowers at all. They're depending on us to make the right decisions for them in this chamber. It's all about their future. It's all about their kids. It's all about their farming, which is so important to us. I once again say thank you very much to the Greens for looking at this rationally and not supporting the disallowance motion, and I thank the Liberal and National parties also for their support of the canegrowers.

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-10-17,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (18:26):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I am against this disallowance. We acted. We listened. This action was initiated by the canegrowers. It was not initiated by a strike pulled by Senator Hanson. All we did was listen, and then all we did was take action. This issue at its core is about farmers, food production and not being heard; and it's about farmers, food producers, with little power.


I'm proud of the fact that, over the last 170 years, since the Industrial Revolution—actually, over the last 250 years, thanks to the revolution in Britain and governance; actually, over the last 700 years, since the Magna Carta—we have lived in the sort of country that we live in today. Those events were due to freedom. They were due to largely free markets. At my core, I am a libertarian. I believe passionately in freedom of speech and freedom of markets. But, sadly, we do not have free markets globally. We do not have free markets in this country. I have worked and lived and studied in the United States. They do not have free markets. Increasingly, government is getting involved around the world, and it is causing problems. For those who live in cities, perhaps you can identify with another problem—the problem facing taxi drivers. We know it in Brisbane, we know it in Queensland and it's the same around the country. Taxi drivers are saddled now with expensive plates because Uber has come in with none of the burdens faced by taxi drivers. The core problem there is excessive government in the first place. While government was initially protecting some rich taxi drivers, that has turned and become government now impeding all taxi drivers.


We live in the real world. I admire Senator Leyonhjelm's philosophy, his honesty and his integrity with his principles. However, we do not live in a free world. We live in a world that has been manipulated and distorted by governments for many, many decades. This building, in my honest opinion, has been very destructive in some of the policies and government interventions that have come out of here. At its core, I'll bet the roots of this issue go back to excessive government intervention in the first place. In the real world, this kind of world, we need to look after the basics—the basics like food production; the basics of making sure that farmers have free access and free support. Food is an issue for all city dwellers. We all eat, and food is an issue for all people who buy food. It is part of the process to produce, distribute, process, distribute and then eat food. In this process, the leach is the government, quite often.


But the casualties are in the communities. When I went through Home Hill and Ayr not long ago, the number of businesses boarded up with blank windows and empty buildings was staggering. That means the community is suffering. I see initiatives in the regional towns—not far to the north, in Ingham—not being supported by the government and not being supported by the LNP in Queensland, the Labor Party in Queensland or their local members. Yet these are initiatives that regional people from Queensland are initiating which could contribute to fixing health problems around our whole country. Government is not doing its job. This industry's future depends on the process of farming, which, as Senator O'Sullivan said, can take many years to plan for and harvest to then get the rewards from the crop. It can take many years.


As Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Lending to Primary Production Customers, it has become clear to me that in addition to some of the banks' behaviours, some of the receivers' behaviours and some of the other people in the chain, one other entity has been doing enormous damage, and that entity is government both state and federal. Think about this: a farmer goes and buys some land. He or she then has property rights. Those property rights are then stolen. That land is worth less as a result of government intervention—government stealing land. Today in Queensland we see farmers actually suffering a loss of property rights thanks to the current Labor government and past Labor governments. That property rights issue destroys land values, destroys farm productivity and raises costs for farmers.


Another issue that governments control is tax. Tax is crippling. We have taxes on payroll, of all things. We know that if we tax something we decrease its use. Why are we taxing payroll? We know that it's difficult in our country for farmers to get labour in towns with high unemployment, and that's why we need backpackers. Something is wrong. We saw in 2011 the live cattle trade completely shut down overnight. We saw cattle then being moved from the north of Western Australia all the way down into New South Wales to be sold, and the prices plummeted and communities were devastated. Farmers and families were devastated and people were suiciding.


And then we see government intervention in the form of water control. Some of the farmers—there are some here now—from the Burdekin have had an increase of around 300 per cent in the cost of their water in recent years. Overall, I'm told, that most farmers have faced a 50 per cent increase in their water costs. But that's not all. They say power prices have increased 110 per cent in recent years in a state where the state government wants to destroy a cheap, reliable and secure source of power and replace it with a renewable energy target of 50 per cent—and the LNP supports that by supporting the Labor budget.


These farmers, some of whom are here, are not wealthy. They work in delicatessens and they own delicatessens to make sure that they can get by. Some do earth moving on the side to keep them busy and to get by. They are stressed. It doesn't matter whether they're cotton farmers from Mondure, or cattle men or what: these days they face international markets and they have to be very much on top of the science, to be au fait with the economics and to be lawyers—because they're taken to court or they have a state government stealing property rights. So they need to be experts in everything, and that's not fair. We pay for it throughout the country. We have the best farmers in the world—from the dry south-west right through to the tropical Cape York. We have the best farmers in the world, but they're challenged by overseas subsidies paid by foreign governments. Their challenged by overseas companies coming in here. They're challenged by our own government policies and regulations destroying businesses, making it difficult even to live. There are tax, energy costs, property rights and—there it is again—government. Government needs to get out. But in this case we have an imbalance of power—a huge imbalance of power. We have a $7 million company versus a $40 billion corporation who has legal power, market power and staying power.


This is about trust, as Senator Hanson so wisely said. This is about making sure Australians have a fair go, because under tax regimes in this country foreign companies quite often don't pay any company tax. That puts them at a 30 per cent advantage straight away. This is not a simple little issue.


We are against this disallowance. Our responsibility in One Nation is to listen, to ask questions, to listen, to take action, to listen, to serve and to be accountable, and we are willing to be accountable to the canegrowers of Queensland. We're willing to check ourselves and we want to restore our Constitution. We congratulate the canefarmers and we congratulate Senator Hanson for taking her action. This is a matter of trust, and we will not be supporting this disallowance.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Social Services and Multicultural Affairs) (18:36):  The government opposes the disallowance motion. The coalition government delivered a mandatory sugar code of conduct to support dealing with sugar mills in time for the June 2017 crush. The coalition government introduced a code following a listening tour of growers in North Queensland to assist growers, mills and marketers dealing with disputes. The code came into immediate effect in April following months of protracted negotiations between growers, mills and sugar marketers.


Farmers have welcomed the code, which has had a positive impact on the industry, with all growers able to sign agreements prior to commencement of the 2017 crush. The new code guarantees growers choice in marketer as well as providing precontract arbitration between mill owners and marketers and between canegrowers and mill owners if an agreement cannot be reached.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that the disallowance motion moved by Senator Leyonhjelm be agreed to.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (19:20):  Free speech is one of the great virtues that underpin our society. Failure to celebrate free speech, especially for one's political or ideological opponents, is to seriously undermine this foundational institution of our society. Universities as institutions of learning should not only defend but actively encourage free speech, allowing for robust discussion to enable logical assessments to be made by our fellow citizens.


Despite the self-evident benefits of free speech, we are witnessing a creeping, ugly totalitarianism that seeks to stifle if not completely stop the exercise of free speech in our society. You've guessed it: it's done in the name of tolerance, whilst at the same time the perpetrators engage in name-calling, calling opponents hateful or bigots—insert insult of choice—all in the cause of virtue-signalling their love, their inclusiveness and, of course, their tolerance.


Recently, Balliol College at the University of Oxford banned their Christian group from its open day, not because the group had done anything wrong but because of alleged misdeeds by Christianity in the past. The university administration did step in, but it was too late for that open day.


Similarly, my local university, shamefully, initially refused to provide facilities for the holding of a forum to present the no case in the current postal survey. To its credit, the university reversed its decision. I congratulate the university for doing so. Regrettably, this is not the end of the story. There is now an ugly rearguard action being run by a group, including senior lecturers, seeking signatures to a petition to condemn the university for its commitment to free speech. Make no mistake: when senior lecturers email students seeking support, the pressure to sign is immense. The absence of a signature may well be noted. Students and other underlings of a senior lecturer will hardly feel free not to sign.


Indeed, that's how I became aware of the letter. A person felt intimidated. The covering letter of the senior lecturer refers to her feeling 'disgusted and hurt'. The opening paragraph of the proposed letter to the university does not deal with the matters of principle, like the universal human right to free speech. No, the great intellectual argument was expressed as follows: 'We are writing to express our disappointment in relation to the university's decision to make the Burbury Lecture Theatre available to the Coalition for Marriage. It would be possible for each of us to respond by detailing the ways in which this action has profoundly affected us. We feel betrayed, let down, insulted, offended, frustrated, disillusioned and humiliated.' It's all about their subjective feelings: they feel betrayed, let down et cetera.


When you operate on actual principle, you ask: how would you feel if the boot were on the other foot? Do unto others as you would have done unto you. Did the intellectuals, before deciding on their campaign, ask those to whom they would deny a facility to hold their forum how they would feel? Could they feel profoundly affected? Could they feel betrayed and let down that an institution of learning and free thought denied them the right to meet? Could they feel insulted, offended, frustrated, disillusioned and, indeed, humiliated—to use their language—by being told they are not worthy to express their views? Could their self-esteem and mental health have been impacted? An honest answer to these questions exposes not only the hypocrisy of the perpetrators but an ugly intolerance that puts personal subjective feelings above the universally recognised human right of free speech.


Those that seek to shut down free speech because they don't like what is being said today would do well to remember that, if that becomes the standard, their freedom will be similarly shut down by others tomorrow. We all win and protect each other for our mutual individual and societal good and benefit if we allow freedom of speech to flourish. That is why everyone should support the university's decision, irrespective of their view on the survey. (Time expired)
