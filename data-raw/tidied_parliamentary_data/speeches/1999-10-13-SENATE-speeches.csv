"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-13,"—by leave—I move:
(1)	 That the Senate:
	 (a)	 censures the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Newman) for her contempt of the Senate in failing to comply with an order made on 30 September 1999, that a document, namely the welfare reform discussion paper originally prepared for her Press Club speech on 29 September 1999, and now being provided to the Minister's newly-established reference group on welfare reform, be tabled by 3 pm on 12 October 1999; and
	 (b)	 resolves that:
		 (i)	 the Minister purge the contempt in which she has held the Senate by tabling the document on or before 3 pm on 18 October 1999,
		 (ii)	 if the document is not tabled by this time, the question on any motion moved by the Minister for:
			 (a)	 the introduction of any bill,
			 (b)	 the consideration of any stage of any bill, or
			 (c)	 in committee of the whole, any amendment or any request for amendment to any bill,
			 not be put until the Minister has undertaken to lay the document on the table, and
		 (iii)	 the Minister not be heard on any other matter relating to her activities as a minister.  

(2)	 That this resolution remain in force until either the document is tabled or until the last sitting day of 1999, whichever is earlier.
(3)	 That, as the first item of business on the Monday of each sitting week, the Minister be required to make a statement to the Senate outlining whether she is intending to comply with the order and, if not, outlining her reasons, and a motion may be moved without notice to take note of the Minister's statement.
This matter, as senators would be aware, relates to the failure of the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Newman, to comply with an order of the Senate and table a discussion paper on welfare reform which was highlighted a number of times in the press prior to the minister's Press Club speech on 29 September as containing the government's blueprint for where they saw the future of welfare policy in this country. As senators would be aware, the minister changed her mind about providing the discussion paper at that time, allegedly under pressure from the Prime Minister. Instead, she proceeded with a speech which was a bit of a vision thing rather than an outline of concrete proposals. The only concrete proposal contained within it was to set up a reference group to develop a green paper for the government for consideration by cabinet, to see the light of day somewhere around the middle of next year.
The Senate supported the motion that I moved for that discussion paper to be tabled in this chamber and to be made public. From my point of view, and without speaking for the rationale of all other senators, I believed it was important that, if we were to have a public debate on the future of welfare policy in this country—something that the Democrats certainly believe is important—we should do it from a fully informed position and should have a clear idea of what the government's thinking is. Obviously a discussion paper doesn't require the government to be locked into the proposals contained within it, but it gives clearer parameters for the public and the Senate to consider the future directions in which welfare policy may go in this country.
The minister has chosen not to table the paper. Her rationale in her statement yesterday was basically that she was still developing it and would provide it to the Senate when she provided it to the reference group at some time down the track. The minister may indicate in her contribution today as to when that may be. From the point of view of the Democrats that isn't adequate, for two reasons. The broader reasons I will go to in some detail. Firstly, there is the need to respect the powers and responsibility of the Senate when a return to order is made for a particular document to be tabled. It is a measure that the Senate uses from time to time to enable public scrutiny of documents that the Senate believes it is appropriate to be made public. It is not something that is done lightly and it is not something that should be ignored by ministers, except for extremely good reasons.
The second component in some ways gives me greater concern. The motion before the chamber today talks about the minister failing to comply with the return to order and proposals to censure the minister for that contempt of the Senate's return to order. The minister's statement yesterday gave an indication that she was still completing the paper, was still working on the paper, and therefore couldn't table it because it was not finished yet. That was the first time that I have ever heard an indication that somehow or other this paper was a work in progress rather than a finished document. The minister, I am sure, will elaborate on this in further detail. Certainly prior to the minister's Press Club speech at the end of September there was a widespread expectation that a discussion paper would be provided. She chose not to do that at the time, which is her choice and, one would suspect, a political choice. It was her choice not to proceed with it.
Certainly there was a widespread indication that the discussion paper had been finished and was ready to be provided then. It wasn't so much a matter of, `We cannot provide it at the Press Club because it is not finished', but `We have chosen not to go down that path and will now give it to the reference group instead.' To now suggest that it is a work in 
 progress is a disconcerting suggestion—if that is what is being suggested by the minister as one of the reasons why it can't be tabled. If a paper is finally provided to the Senate one would have to suspect that the original discussion paper is being rewritten and that what we may end up getting is not what the original return to order relates to but some other modified, sanitised version.
I hope the minister does not go down that path, firstly, because it would mean providing the Senate with a document that is not what is actually the subject of the return to order and, secondly, it would fail to end the speculation that the government has a hidden agenda. Obviously it is up to the government to decide their own strategy—I am sure they are not interested in gratuitous advice from me—but I think it would be far better to have the full discussion paper on the table so that the government and the minister would not be subject to scare campaigns about what may or may not be in the discussion paper and about what the hidden agenda may or may not be. We could see what the agenda was and the government could justify it and debate it in a full and robust way, in the same way as all of us have to justify and debate our positions on all policy, including welfare policy, in a robust way. I certainly encourage the government to go down that path.
Moving away from the issue of welfare policy to the specific motion before the chamber to censure the minister and require her to table the document by 3 p.m. on 18 October and then going through some suggested actions if that is not done, to some extent it is worth going over the history of returns to order in this chamber—what the practice has been and what the views of the Senate have been. Obviously, each time a minister chooses not to comply with a return to order, it is a matter for the Senate to decide whether it accepts the reasons put forward by the minister. That is part of what this motion is about loosely. From my point of view and the Democrats' point of view, we do not accept the reasons put forward by the minister.
It is worth emphasising that it is not particularly common for ministers not to comply 
 with returns to order. According to statistics in the latest edition of Odgers Senate Practice—always a good read, which I recommend all senators have a look at—in the last term of the previous government 53 returns to order were made and only four were not complied with. In the first term of the current government, from 1996 to 1998, 48 returns to order were made and only five were not complied with. Usually refusal to comply has been based on some variation of the argument that to produce the document would not be in the public interest. The most popular reasons put forward have been matters such as commercial-in-confidence, excessive and inappropriate use of departmental resources where a large number of documents have been requested—that is obviously not the case in this particular circumstance—that somehow the documents are sub judice or relate to legal professional privilege or they are a matter of cabinet confidentiality. Clearly, on all the evidence to date, none of those factors apply to this document. As I stated previously, the rationale put forward by the minister as to why it is not appropriate to table it seems to me to be incredibly flimsy.
In the past when returns to order have not been complied with the Senate has considered what action to take. Occasionally it has accepted the reasons put forward by the relevant minister or the government, if they were along the lines of the reasons I just outlined. Sometimes the Senate has not chosen to accept the reasons put forward by the minister. Without going through a full history of the Senate's responses to such circumstances, it is worth highlighting a few cases to put it in context. I see in the press this morning that a spokesperson for the minister has labelled this censure motion a stunt. I certainly do not see it as a stunt. I see it as an important matter of emphasising the rights of the Senate in the parliament for appropriate scrutiny of the executive in terms of what the executive is considering doing. It has a long history stretching right back to the origins of the Senate at the start of this century. It is an important power of the Senate which is not exercised lightly. When ministers choose not to comply with it, it is something that should be viewed seriously 
 and the reasons given considered in great detail.
To give a few examples of previous occasions when ministers have chosen not to comply with a return to order, back in 1982 there was a refusal by the government to produce documents connected with tax avoidance and evasion on the ground that to do so would be harmful to the administration of justice. That matter had not been resolved by the time the 1983 election came along and the government changed. In 1991, the Senate agreed to an order requiring the government to table a tape recording of conversations between a minister and representative conservation groups. The leader of the government subsequently tabled a letter stating that the government would not table the tape recording but attached an extract from a transcript of the recording. On that particular occasion, the Senate censured the government for its refusal to table that tape.
In 1992, the government refused to produce documents in response to an order for the production of a note on a Treasury file and indicated that producing it might damage Australia's relationships with other countries. I do not think that is something that applies in this case. In 1993, the then Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, was ordered to produce a letter by a minister relating to woodchip export licences. Senator Evans declined to produce that on the grounds of confidentiality and the Senate chose to censure him at that time for this refusal. I would suggest again that cabinet confidentiality and commercial confidentiality are much more serious reasons for not tabling something than the one that has been put forward by the minister to date.
The Senate has constantly indicated its displeasure with failures to comply with returns to order except on serious grounds and a number of times has censured ministers for their failure to comply. This year, as senators would probably recall, the current Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, was censured for not responding properly to an order for documents relating to the Jabiluka uranium mine, where the minister tabled some documents and listed others which were 
 withheld on stated grounds but subsequently stated that he had only produced key documents rather than all documents. Again, the Senate deemed that that was not a satisfactory response and censured the minister.
So it is not just a matter of some stunt; it is a matter of ensuring that the Senate highlights the importance of returns to order. In a sense, it moves beyond what I believe is an important policy issue of welfare reform. I would hope to see us discussing that issue in detail rather than matters such as this, ideally, but it moves beyond that to the issue of the duties, responsibilities and powers of the Senate, as against the executive of the day, and the requirement of the executive to respect the role and the powers of the parliament.
The second component of the motion, beyond the censure and requiring the minister to table the document by 3 p.m. on 18 October, is to introduce some measures if the minister continues to fail to respect the order of the Senate. From the Democrats' point of view, this is, I believe, an important component. The measures that are contained in paragraph (b) of the motion, which basically seek to prevent a motion put by the minister from being voted on until the document has been tabled, are shamelessly plagiarised from a contingent notice of motion put forward by the then opposition—I think by Senator Ian Campbell—in 1994 at a time when the then Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan, refused to table documents relating to Casselden Place and the rental rates there. He gave a contingent notice of motion which would have had an identical effect to part of what is contained in the motion before us today, which was to prevent that minister being able to have any item of business voted on. I have gone to that as precedent, if you like. Whilst the coalition at that time gave a contingent notice of motion that it might move to prevent a motion by the minister being voted on, it never actually acted on that contingent notice of motion. What I seek to do with this motion is to put that in place, rather than leave the sword dangling—to actually wield the sword, in a gentle and non-violent way, of course—by ensuring that there is some follow-on action by the Senate if the minister 
 fails to comply with the continuing order of the Senate.
I think this is particularly important because one of the unfortunate components of censure motions over time has been—whilst I personally believe they are important and I know the Democrats have always considered them seriously before we have decided to vote for them and have not always voted in favour of censure motions that have been put forward—that they have been portrayed, basically, as a slap on the wrist. That has certainly been suggested to me by the media that have spoken to me about this in the last 24 hours. I do not see it as a slap on the wrist: I see it as an important statement by the Senate, but I do acknowledge that unless there is some follow-up action it does not have any practical effect. What this motion also seeks to do is to ensure that there is some practical effect in relation to the censure motion and the minister's ongoing failure to comply with the return to order.
Senators would be aware that in recent times the New South Wales upper house has exercised its powers fairly strongly in relation to a minister that refused to table documents. In fact, on a number of occasions it has chosen to eject the Treasurer of the government of New South Wales from the chamber because of his refusal to comply. So in that sense I would see the proposal put forward in my motion as being rather more mild than what the state parliament in New South Wales has chosen to do. It appears clear to me that the Senate has the power to do this. As the New South Wales upper house has shown, it is important, when ministers refuse to comply with directions of a chamber, to follow through with some form of action to ensure that it is not just perceived as some slap on the wrist or indeed some badge of honour for a minister to be censured. What I have attempted to do in the second part of the motion is to ensure that there is follow-on action—that if the Senate believes that it is a serious issue that the minister has chosen not to comply with a return to order that we express that, not just by passing a motion of censure but by coupling it with concrete action which has some impact on the minister.
I have noted comments in the newspaper today by the opposition spokesperson in this area, Mr Wayne Swan, from the lower house indicating that, whilst the Labor Party may have some uncertainty about components of what is being proposed in the second part of the motion, they are not going to go soft on the minister: they are keen to ensure that she does not get off lightly, if you like, for this particular contempt of the Senate. I hope that the opposition, the Labor Party, in the Senate will follow through on the words of their spokesperson, Mr Swan, and ensure that there is some teeth to this censure motion. If they have some concerns about the specifics of what is being proposed, I am sure they will express those, but hopefully they will put forward some other alternatives which will at least have some impact in terms of ensuring that it is not just a motion without any practical effect but that it does have some follow-on impact as a way of ensuring that the displeasure of the Senate is clearly indicated.
Whilst there has been a long history of returns to order and a much shorter history, although not a totally uncommon history, of ministers refusing to comply with them, there have been censure motions that have been passed. As far as I am aware, there have not been other components coupled with those motions which have had practical effect. I believe it is time that the Senate moved to that stage on these issues. It seems fairly pointless passing returns to order and requiring ministers to table various documents unless we follow through with some sort of action in the event of a minister failing to comply without adequate reason. In this case, on the evidence available to date, I do not believe the minister has given an adequate reason, by any stretch of the imagination, and that is why I believe the motion is important. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Censure Motion,1,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-10-13,"—Senator Newman's three-year record as Minister for Social Security and then as Minister for Family and Community Services is a very sorry record indeed. The implementation of Centrelink has been a shambolic mess. Last week's Ombudsman's report 
 underlines that. The Ombudsman found that Centrelink often failed to give clients enough information about their entitlements and then was prevented by law from backdating payments when mistakes were made. He correctly recommended social security laws be changed to allow Centrelink to backdate payments for up to 12 months when people had not received the amounts to which they were entitled. But this is years too late. The previous Ombudsman, Ms Philippa Smith, had similar criticisms in earlier reports. Senator Newman should have been managing all of this a lot better, a lot sooner and a lot earlier than she was.
But ministerial mismanagement of Centrelink is just a very small part of the picture with Senator Newman. Senator Newman is the minister who in the first term of the Howard government allowed the destruction of the Commonwealth dental scheme, cuts to child care, the introduction of fees for home and community care programs such as Meals on Wheels—in fact, cuts to almost a billion dollars of welfare assistance.
She, along with other ministers in the government, has slashed funds to those in the community who are dissenting voices, particularly in the community sector, including only last week the Girl Guides—of all people—because they had the hide to criticise the GST during the Senate committee process. There was the defunding of the Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition, AYPAC, and National Shelter. All these decisions symbolise this minister's fear of criticism and the proactive approach this minister has to smothering dissent in her portfolio area.
On 1 October, Senator Newman removed funding from more community groups—groups which represent the interests of Australian women and their families. Groups caught up in the reprisals here were the Women's Electoral Lobby, which copped a $50,000 cut. The National Women's Justice Coalition, the National Women's Media Centre and the Women's Action Alliance all copped a $25,000 cut. That is the sort of thing that Senator Newman has been on about, as senators know.
—Senator Faulkner, I hesitate to interrupt, but I draw your attention to the motion. I accept preamble, but I draw your attention to the motion.
—I do not appreciate the intervention, Madam President. I am making the point that what is concerning—
—How about a bit of respect for the Chair?
—This is perfectly proper for a censure motion, in my view. These are the same groups that have raised concerns over the past 12 months about the harsh impacts of the GST and have challenged the direction of government policy for women. I am making the point that this is typical of Senator Newman; this is typical of this minister. To make things worse, Senator Newman now refuses to make public her blueprint—her earth-shattering position paper—for national welfare reform, the blueprint on which her address to the National Press Club was supposed to be based. It is a pattern. She does it all the time.
For example, the Canberra Times of 29 August received the good oil from Senator Newman's minders. Her position paper was `to focus on the mutual obligations that recipients have for payments'. It was going to outline Senator Newman's policy to arrest the increase in the number of disability pensioners. On 8 September, a media advisory was posted in the gallery which touted the forthcoming speech. It stated that it would launch `an agenda setting discussion paper on welfare'. The speech was to be given on 21 September. But Senator Newman came unstuck. Somewhere between 8 and 10 September the Prime Minister, John Howard, and his gatekeepers read the speech and discussion paper and they went ballistic. A correction was posted in the gallery. It read:
Due to unforeseen circumstances, the seminal address, The Future of Welfare in the 21st Century by Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Jocelyn Newman, will be delivered at the National Press Club on Wednesday, 29 September rather than Tuesday, 21 September.
The launch of the discussion paper was canned by John Howard and the government. The speech was delayed. There was a hasty 
 rewrite of the speech; all the ugly bits were taken out and we were left with a blancmange. I read the AAP report on 27 September. It was hilarious. It read:
The Federal Government today went into damage control over reports that it was preparing to slash its welfare program targeting sole parents and disabled pensioners . . . Measures reportedly being considered include forcing single parents to look for work when their children turn 12, extending work for the dole to over-35s and drastically tightening Disability Support Pension rules. But Mr Howard, anxious to underpin his family-friendly credentials, promised the speech would not contain specific measures regarding individual income support . . . Senator Newman appeared to backtrack, playing down the significance of the speech as opposition senators claimed she had been rolled by the prime minister amid fears of a voter backlash.
That is the truth of the matter. On 29 September, Senator Newman promised a blueprint. The blueprint became a meandering speech which outlined the social problems that everyone knows all post-industrial globalised economies face. She announced the formation of a reference group, announced the Chair, Mr McClure, announced a green paper and finally announced a timetable. This reference group was now tasked to set the agenda, not Senator Newman. What a humiliating backdown from Senator Newman.
Back in Senator Newman's office, there abandoned on the desk is the discussion paper—the much publicised discussion paper—with the i's dotted and the t's crossed. The press gallery and welfare groups were all salivating for the detail of this discussion paper, but what did we get? The last refuge of a cornered minister—nothing. There is a proposed green paper and a timetable. She did not even have the terms of reference organised, it was such a fiasco.
In the pitiful excuse we heard from Senator Newman in the Senate yesterday for the non-production of this `agenda setting' discussion paper, she said that she regretted she was not in a position to give any discussion paper. She said it was still being developed as the government submission to the reference group and it will be completed shortly. In other words, she now claims she is writing the discussion paper that was advertised. That is 
 apparently going to be part of this hastily organised green paper exercise. No-one would believe that.
The first question that begs an answer in this place is: if it was ready to be unveiled at the Press Club, how come you are still writing it? Staff were priming us all for the great vision for Australian welfare in the new millennium. Now the vision is being revised and revisited. What we got from Senator Newman again yesterday in the Senate was a smokescreen—a weak explanation, a deliberate mislead and a cover-up. We know that a humiliating gag was applied to Senator Newman by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, just before her so-called seminal speech. What was the reason? The proposal was so politically unpalatable that even the Prime Minister could not cop it and it required more careful management.
I think everyone understands that this is the way this government does business. We have come to expect this from the government. It is part and parcel of the way the Howard government operates: gagging everyone, silencing the critics, a lack of provision of information to the public, and the devious ways in which accountability and scrutiny in this parliament and in the public arena are ignored. I was pleased about that editorial earlier in the week in the Australian, which pointed out, quite rightly:
. . . political opportunism perpetuates a damaging cycle of mistrust of politicians by the public. This mistrust is a cancer to our democracy.
The lack of accountability, the smothering of voices, the cover-ups, the defunding of potential critics of the government and the secrecy over policy measures are the modus operandi of Senator Newman and the Howard government.
We are going to stand up on this issue, as we have. We are going to ensure that we actually get answers to questions like why the Girl Guides have been defunded and why the Women's Electoral Lobby have been defunded. Why can't Senator Newman come clean over this seminal blueprint after delivering such a hollow speech that was laced with a couple of general observations and had a few motherhood statements thrown in for 
 good measure, culminating in a timetable? What a performance from this minister. It was a speech that ended up announcing a task force that had not been properly constructed and was without terms of reference. But, importantly, the promised blueprint—the promised discussion paper—was not provided or produced and is now being covered up deliberately by the government. Why can't this minister tell us what she plans for the poor and the needy in our community? What does she have to hide? What is the government hiding in this document that they will not produce?
Madam President, you have a situation where I think many in the community are entitled to be wary and worried about the contents of this discussion paper that the minister has gone to such extraordinary lengths to cover up. There is no doubt that Senator Newman deserves censure for failing to come clean on this issue. The Howard government needs desperately to clean up its act on accountability issues from the bottom up.
I know the Democrats put forward a proposal, but they have not been in government. They are wanting to punish Senator Newman now by applying a gag. I can understand the frustration that the Democrats feel. I heard Senator Murray on Monday night's PM program saying that the difficulty with accountability is whether you can enforce it or not. He said:
Now we've tried before to enforce accountability and until Labor are prepared to actually make ministers not be heard, in fact until they're prepared to enforce the Senate's powers, there's a limit to how far the Senate can in fact push accountability.
You really do understand that no Australian Democrat senator has been a minister and no Australian Democrat has formed a government. You see, gagging a minister like Senator Newman and ensuring that she is not heard in this place is a John Howard technique. That is a Liberal Party technique. Why are the Australian Democrats hell-bent on gagging a minister? If she is gagged and if she is not heard, she has a holiday from accountability. We are not going to be part of that. It means she cannot take legislation 
 through the chamber and she cannot answer questions. It means that she can go off and plot and plan with her bureaucrats and her reference group without explaining herself at all. It is not on.
This is probably one of the worst ministers in a bad government. Everyone knows Senator Newman's performance here in question time. Everyone has seen her at Senate estimates. This is a minister who can just sit at the table and completely depend on bureaucrats to answer questions, who cannot answer a question in Senate question time and who is simply incapable of responding to serious questions asked of her about public policy in the forums of the Australian parliament. We are not going to gag her. We do not want to be any part of that.
I do not think the Democrats understand this issue. It was the Democrats who, behind closed doors, let the environment bill go through and did their GST deals. That all went through the Senate under a guillotine. The deal included arrangements for greenhouse, book compensation moneys and so forth. That was all done behind closed doors with John Howard. That might be the way the Democrats do business, but we are not going to have any part of that. The Democrats claim to be champions of accountability—I do not think that is the case—but they have to look seriously at a proposition which proposes a gag of Senator Newman, because a gag of Senator Newman means that she will evade scrutiny and will not be accountable to the parliament.
Such a proposal as moved by Senator Bartlett will not provide accountability; it will provide the reverse. Senator Newman would avoid questioning, avoid making parliamentary and ministerial statements and so on and so forth. Avoiding parliamentary scrutiny is not the way to provide a sanction for this minister's failure to comply with an order of the Senate. The Democrats really need now to start grappling with the real outcomes of some of these ideas. Gagging, we know, is a Howard government technique; Senator Newman is a past master of it. We need to ensure that parliament is more accountable, not less accountable. Senator Newman needs to 
 provide her policy paper to the parliament. She is required to do so. Of course, Senator Hill and Senator Alston ought to front up with the 16 Federation Fund projects while they are at it. Perhaps Mr Costello could outline the business tax compliance measures, and perhaps he could reveal the revenue modelling for his business tax proposals as well. I hope that the Democrats would support all those outcomes as well as this.
We support the censure—it is deserved—but we oppose the gag. I invite Senator Bartlett and the Australian Democrats to discuss with Labor and other non-government senators some constructive sanctions that will widen accountability to the parliament. I have some suggestions, and I am happy to discuss them with the Democrats, but I do not want to let Senator Newman off the hook. Since Senator Newman became a minister she has consistently had a flawed approach to her ministerial responsibilities. Everyone knows that. Of course, she should not ignore such an order of the parliament. She deserves to be censured, and sanctions are warranted—not gagging.
Let us have a look at some sanctions that might really hurt Senator Newman and the government. Why don't we look at a sanction which extends question time until a certain number of non-government questions have been asked and answered each day? Why don't we prevent government ministers and government senators from debate on motions to take note of answers to questions in question time? Why don't we prevent the government from moving extensions to the days and hours of sittings and changing the routine of business in the Senate until Senator Newman complies with this order? They are real sanctions, and the Australian Democrats should give them some serious consideration and talk to other senators and the opposition in the chamber about them. They are more constructive penalties and sanctions. They will cause the government real discomfort. They can be put in place until Senator Newman fronts up as she should with the original document she has so desperately attempted to cover up since her brave announcement of September this year.
To that effect, in relation to Senator Bartlett's motion, I move:
Omit subparagraphs (1)(b)(ii) and (iii) and paragraphs (2) and (3).
This amendment deletes that part of Senator Bartlett's motion in relation to sanctions. That is something we should revisit after we see whether Senator Newman is willing to purge her contempt of the Senate. If the amendment is not passed, Labor cannot support such a censure motion, even though this minister deserves to be roundly censured for what she has done. Let us amend the motion and talk about appropriate sanctions. Let us not put a gag on the minister, a gag on accountability and a gag on parliamentary scrutiny, but let us condemn this minister as she so roundly deserves.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-10-13,"—Firstly, I want to congratulate Senator Faulkner on that speech, because I think it covered the ground very well, in particular the failure of this minister to perform in one of the most important portfolios that a national government has. The minister had flagged at her Press Club speech that she was going to bring out a blueprint of her thinking for social justice in Australia as we go into the next century. Added to the billion dollars per annum taken away from the needy in this country, she was going to outline a list of punishments for single parents, the unemployed and disabled people in this country.
Government senator interjecting—
—It is not a lie, Senator. You will have your opportunity in a moment. The fact that the minister has refused to follow through with the blueprint that she said she was going to produce herself shows the size of the cover-up in which she is involved. The active agent in the cover-up was not the minister herself; she is gung-ho about these very right wing moves that she wanted to make in her administration of this portfolio. The Prime Minister intervened, as Senator Faulkner has said. Even he could not stomach what the minister was planning. The minders knew that this would cause widespread revulsion amongst the Australian electorate in general. So a speech that Senator Newman was to make had to be sanitised, the process 
 was Kennettised and the doors to information were closed down. It is entirely reasonable, under the circumstances in which the minister has flouted her responsibility to the Senate and therefore to the Australian public to produce this document, that she be censured.
However, the process that the Democrats have brought forward is, as Senator Faulkner has cogently explained, not the right one. It is not helpful in a democracy which depends on information to censure a minister by requiring her to give less information—by truncating her responsibilities to give further information to the Senate. You might remember, Madam President, the last time these words, that a member of this Senate `not be heard', were used. I remember former Senator O'Chee getting to his feet when I came into the Senate one day without my coat on. He asked that I not be heard until I went out and put my coat on. Here we have the Democrats following that up with the addled view that the minister not be heard until she produces information that she suppressed in the past, in other words, that she should suppress further information. It is not clear thinking and it is the wrong way to go. We are trying to get information out of this minister, not a complete close-down on her responsibility to be giving information to the Senate. There are alternative sanctions. They ought to apply to the government. It is the Prime Minister's responsibility that this minister is not performing in that she has clamped down on the important document that the Senate and the Australian people deserve to see. I would therefore support a future move by the opposition or the Democrats along the lines outlined by Senator Faulkner.
Let me say this to the Democrats, however. This is a very important matter which has gained national publicity overnight and today, but we have Senator Bartlett on his own in the Senate and a complete absence of the Leader or Deputy Leader of the Democrats, who ought to be prosecuting this very important matter in here right now. If you are going to pursue a matter as important as this, it is important that the whole party is here to prosecute the case. Senator Bartlett, I feel sorry for you that you are left totally aban 
 doned, with none of the other Democrats here to support you and, in particular, the leader missing altogether. I do not know where the leader is—maybe out negotiating the next round of compromise with the Prime Minister or with other members of the government.
One is left to believe that the sincerity is not there, that this is a quid pro quo for the concessions that the Democrats are making in taxation and other matters to the very agenda that we want to see Senator Newman called to order on. After all, Madam President, the Democrats did put through the GST legislation, which hits many of the entities that Senator Newman wants to hit again. The Democrats did put through the environment legislation with its extraordinarily damaging flow-ons for the Australian environment, not least the forests of this country. The Democrats did negotiate with the government for the wind-back of century-old and honoured industrial relations provisions to protect people in this country from right-wing moves to disempower workers.
—Senator Brown, I would draw your attention to the substance of the motion. I realise that there may be some latitude in preamble, but I do draw your attention to the motion.
—I join with Senator Faulkner in saying that I do not appreciate that intervention. I will take note of what you had to say, Madam President, but if you were listening to the line of my argument—
—I am listening, Senator.
—I am pleased to note that, and you will let me finish, Madam President.
—Madam President, I raise a point of order. There have now been two particular occasions when Senator Brown has been exceedingly discourteous to the chair and shown a degree of contempt which I have not seen in this chamber before. I urge you to bring the senator to order.
—I certainly have noticed that. I draw Senator Brown's attention to the motion and to his conduct and invite him to continue.
—Madam President, the senator who has just spoken was not here when Senator Faulkner responded to you in exactly the same fashion and the government made no comment at all. You will also notice that senators have to be able to defend themselves, particularly in my position, and not be cowed by the government and not be deprived of any right to speak or develop an argument if it is proper to do so.
Let me get back to the substance of my argument, to which you are committed to listening, Madam President. It is that on the one hand the Democrats are moving to have the minister prevented from getting information to the Senate through this motion. On the other hand they are dealing with the government behind closed doors in ways which facilitate the very philosophy that this minister puts forward. That is a very important component of this argument. It concerns me greatly that that process is taking place in tandem with this motion today to have the minister's responsibilities to inform the Senate further wound back. Madam President, I think you will agree that that is a legitimate component of this argument.
That said, I will be supporting the censure of the minister. The minister deserves to be censured. It is totally improper, in a democracy which depends on information going to the electorate, that a paper which the minister herself flagged she was going to release at a Press Club function and therefore to the Australian populace was then suppressed—suppressed, no doubt, by a prime ministerial review which said, `This is going to be bad news for the government. The Australian public is not going to wear it.' Therefore, the motion for censure is valid. However, the provisions that flow on from the move of the Democrats to have the minister excused from giving further information to the Senate are not valid. I do not think they were well thought out and they do need to be reviewed. The alternative put forward by the Labor Party is a much better way to go.",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Censure Motion,1,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-10-13,"—I am aston 
 ished actually at the contributions that I have just heard from Senators Brown and Faulkner: they have not contributed anything to the debate on what is an important issue. The hot air that has been generated here this morning is actually evidence of why I was so strong in my speech to the National Press Club for a mature consideration of the issues that I addressed.
I do acknowledge that Senator Bartlett did accept my invitation to go to the Press Club and did sit through what was a very serious speech and, I would say quite properly, a seminal speech: it did reveal my thinking on these issues. For senators who did not go there to claim that there is some kind of hidden agenda or cover-up simply means that they have not done their homework and that it is a political stunt on their part. Can I just read out to senators the final two passages of my speech. I draw these to your attention because they refer to the salient points in the censure debate. This is what I said to the Press Club:
I particularly want to say to the members of the media here today, that they have an important role in ensuring the debate that our community must have, does not become a sterile exercise characterised by cheap political point scoring and sensational headlines. The job before us is an important one. It goes to the very essence of the way in which we structure our society, the way in which we face the future and the confidence with which we meet the challenges that lie ahead.
I say also to the many stakeholders in this debate that they must avoid the temptation to adopt a narrow self-interested approach to the debate. It is by working together that the community can develop a sustainable welfare system that provides an effective safety net for those in need, but does not encourage a dependence mentality which is debilitating for the individual, their families and for the community.
That is what this is all about. That is on the record, in great detail for half an hour to the National Press Club. The people of Australia heard that and I am just astonished that anybody could think that they could sustain a claim that there has been some kind of cover-up or hidden agenda.
I note that Senator Bartlett was at the Press Club. He did hear my speech and he would have been clearly aware of those comments. 
 They were in no way sanitised; it was an important and significant speech. But Senator Bartlett's censure motion falls directly into the trap which I highlighted in my speech—that is, turning the much needed community debate on reform of our welfare system into a political exercise. That is a pity because I do believe that at heart Senator Bartlett does have concerns about policy. His effort to go and listen to this, and to the question time that followed, was something that I would also have expected and hoped—on such an important national issue—to have seen from senators on the other side of the chamber, apart from Senator Bartlett.
But Senator Bartlett's censure motion does not serve or enhance his role in representing the interests of the Democrats or those of the wider community, and I am disappointed in him, I must say. I would have expected better from the social security spokesperson from the Australian Democrats. I have usually found him interested in the issues and in talking through matters of reform. I would have expected it from Senator Faulkner, I would have expected it from Senator Brown but I would not have expected it from Senator Bartlett, and I am disappointed.
I made it clear in my statement to the Senate yesterday that I am not in a position to give any discussion paper to the Senate at this time. But I did not refuse to provide the Senate with the paper, and anybody who likes to can look at Hansard and see that. I said that I will comply when I provide the completed paper to the reference group shortly. There is no disrespect to the Senate. I told Senator Bartlett, in answer to his question in the Senate two weeks ago, that it was an internal working document and therefore not for tabling. I stand by that; that is consistent.
The discussion paper is still being developed as the government's submission to the reference group, and it will be completed shortly. Is the Senate not able to wait a short time, as the reference group will be waiting, for it to be completed? As soon as it is completed, I shall give it to the reference group and I am happy to give it to the Senate at the same time. I want to make it absolutely clear that the government is not attempting to 
 hide anything. Both the discussion paper—once it has been provided to the reference group—and the final green paper will be public documents. Now what is hidden in that? The public has been invited to make submissions to the reference group—there is the involvement of the community in that—and the final green paper, when it is produced, will also of course be a matter for discussion in the community.
I announced in my speech on 29 September at the Press Club that further social policy reform would be the next major reform priority of the Howard government. That speech was an agenda setting speech. There is no hidden agenda, as anybody who likes to go and read it will see. And I welcome the Prime Minister's support for making social policy the next major reform priority of the government, quite contrary to some of the slurs that have been produced in the chamber today about the Prime Minister and his involvement.
Also at that same time I announced that a high level reference group would guide the development of a comprehensive green paper—which would be taken to cabinet soon thereafter, but they are public documents—and they will be involving the public. I have said that Mr Patrick McClure from Mission Australia will chair the reference group. His deputy chair will be Mr Wayne Jackson, the Deputy Secretary to my department, who is very well respected for his policy expertise and strong interest. Other members of the reference group will be announced very shortly.
I said the reference group was going to consider the broader application of mutual obligation; demographic changes; sustainability of the current system; and incentives for people to train, work and participate in the wider community. I would have thought that most of those would have been things that would have been encompassed by the principles which Senator Bartlett put out in his most recent press release on the subject. But I made it clear yesterday in the Senate that the reference group will draw on community input. It will provide me with a preliminary draft paper early next year, with the final 
 paper to be provided by 30 June. That is a proper and measured process which involves the community. It will obviously involve the parliament and members of the parliament but, very importantly, it will involve the public.
In answer to a question from the press at the Press Club, I pointed out that this is a discussion which has been held for some time in the wider community—over the barbecues and in the lounge rooms—in Australia. People from all walks of life have views about our welfare system. They are concerned at the growing long-term welfare dependency of our people and what it does to them and their children. I would have thought that those contributors today who just simply contributed hot air on what is actually a very serious and important matter should be ashamed of themselves. What does the public think about Senators Faulkner and Brown, who are not even prepared to give this matter the serious attention that it deserves?
I believe no nation can afford to leave unchecked the waste—the economic and social isolation—that is the consequence of welfare dependency. It is this commitment to social and economic participation and the need to best utilise our national resources which leads us to continued welfare reform. Let us get it clear: the social welfare system is not just about government payments; it has to be about all the players in our society working in partnership to develop a social coalition. The Prime Minister has shown great leadership in the need for a social coalition. But it is not just government payments; modernising our welfare system to go into the next century is an important part of our wider reform process. It is integral to a globalised economy and a cohesive society. It should be complementing other policies that promote a skilled, adaptable and productive work force. Appropriately designed, the welfare system is part of the solution, not just residual support for those out of work or in need.
I set out in my speech at the Press Club the six key principles outlining the approach that reform to the welfare system must take, and I will mention them briefly: maintaining equity, simplicity, transparency and sustaina 
 bility; establishing better incentives for people receiving social security payments, so that work, education and training are rewarded; creating greater opportunities for people to increase self-reliance and capacity-building, rather than merely providing a passive safety net; expecting people on income support to help themselves and contribute to society through increased social and economic participation in a framework of mutual obligation; providing choices and support for individuals and families with more tailored assistance that focuses on prevention and early intervention; and, at the same time, maintaining the government's disciplined approach to fiscal policy. They are proper principles on which reform must be based. They are principles which I think the Australian community believe we should be discussing in reforming our system.
Do not forget that this is not something which is done in isolation from the rest of the world. It fascinated me when I was in London just recently meeting with ministers of the Blair government—
—Madam President, I raise a point of order. Your advice to both Senator Faulkner and me was to speak to the motion, which is about the suppression of a document and the consequences of that. I ask you to consider an even-handed approach to the minister's current contribution.
—I am, Senator; I am listening very carefully.
—Madam President, I did not intend to take up the time of the Senate for too long. I was actually about to sum up by saying that this is not just an issue for Australia. The Blair government in Britain, the governments of New Zealand and the United States and the OECD have all turned their attention to the waste of human lives that is brought about by welfare dependency and the need for action to do something about it.
My seminal speech to the National Press Club set out the problems facing Australia's welfare system and the need for reform. A mature society will not play games on such an important issue. I fear that we have senators here today who are only playing games. We 
 need to work together and talk to each other to find better ways to provide support to those needing help. Long-term welfare dependency is not a kindness; it is simply a way of throwing money at a problem, thereby producing an even greater problem for future generations. I believe Australia can do better than that. I call on the Senate to join with the government in doing better.
I utterly reject that I am in contempt of the Senate. I told the Senate yesterday that I will provide the paper shortly, when it is completed and it goes to the reference group. In no way can that justify a censure motion. In my view, this motion devalues the use of censure motions, and it is a shame for the Senate to so devalue one of its own procedures.",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Censure Motion,1,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-10-13,"—It is interesting that the Minister for Family and Community Services offered no real defence for her failure to table the discussion paper in compliance with the order of the Senate. I think the key issue here is that yesterday the minister relied on the defence that the paper `is still being developed'. Quite frankly, Minister, we do not believe you. It is not at all consistent with anything you have said for the last three weeks. You walked in yesterday with a new defence—your last line of defence—which was that the paper is still being developed. Until then we had not heard that line of defence. There had been a series of defences offered previously, but that was not one of them. But that was the one you used yesterday. You have shifted and turned as this embarrassing episode has put you under a lot of pressure—internally within the government—as the debate rages inside the government about the future of welfare policy.
But the key issue here, Madam President, is that we do not believe the minister. It may well be that the discussion paper is being rewritten as we speak. I suspect it is, because clearly the Prime Minister did not like the tone or the direction of the original paper. But what the Senate is debating today is a censure of the minister for her failure to comply with the order that she release the discussion paper that she was preparing to release on 29 
 September—the paper that she told us she was going to release; the paper that her media advisers hyped up all around the Press Gallery, telling journalists that she was going to release it on 29 September. That is the paper we want to see, not the reworked, sanitised version she is working on now to present to a committee for which she still has not been able to get a membership together. What we want is the original paper. That is what the Senate asked for. The minister has failed to offer any reasonable defence for not providing that to us, because there is no defence. There is just severe embarrassment on her part that the Prime Minister does not want that paper released. The Prime Minister does not want that to be at the core of the debate. But we think the Australian people and the Australian parliament have a right to see it. The minister keeps describing it as `seminal'. If it is seminal, let us see it. Let us all have the ability to debate it.
I think it is important that we go through the arguments as to why we do not believe the minister, because that is at the core of this: we do not believe Senator Newman. In the days leading up to the Wednesday 29 September speech, the press was full of discussion about the speech. There was to be released an agenda setting discussion paper. It was hyped up in all the national papers that this was going to be a major speech with a major, agenda setting seminal discussion paper. Every leading newspaper in the country carried the story, describing it as an agenda setting paper. How did they all get it so wrong? How did the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age, the Australian and the Daily Telegraph all get it so wrong? It is an answer that the minister has failed to give us.
What we do know is that sometime over the weekend leading up to that Press Club speech there was furore inside the government. The Prime Minister intervened and there was a serious dispute inside the government as to the direction of social welfare policy and/or the timing of the release of the discussion paper. That was what was reported in the Weekend Australian but, even following that intervention, the minister was obviously fighting on. Her press people were still up in 
 the gallery selling the story, saying that the minister had not been nobbled and that reports of her being pulled into line by the Prime Minister were wrong. She was still going to release this agenda setting paper. I quote from an article by Aban Contractor in the Canberra Times of 30 September—I think it is important that I read this into the record. The article states:
A spokesman for Senator Newman said the decision to pull the paper had been made within the past two weeks, but he told the Canberra Times  on Monday that copies would be available on the morning of the Minister's speech. Mr Howard had not vetoed publication, he said.
We have the minister first of all saying that there was not a paper and that it had not been vetoed, but we have her own spokesman quoted in the paper, outlining her fightback against the Prime Minister's intervention. The article goes on to say:
""It's not necessarily been pulled,"" the spokesman said. ""It's been referred to the discussion group and it will be an important part of the group's resources.""
So here he was—the minister's spokesperson—describing the paper, describing its purpose, describing its role, fighting back against the Prime Minister's intervention, saying that it would be still available, that the minister was going to win this battle with the Prime Minister and that it would be still available. Now the minister says it is still being developed; it has not been written. Was the spokesman lying? Has he been sacked? Or was the minister misleading the parliament today? We do not believe the minister because it is not consistent with anything said by her or her office in the weeks leading up to this debate. Every leading paper in the country, apparently, got it wrong because they misinterpreted what the minister and her office were saying to them.
On Wednesday, 29 September, Senator Bartlett asked the minister to table the discussion paper, and her reply was this:
No, I will not. It is an internal working document which will inform the work of the reference group.
There is no mention of it not being completed, no mention that it was still being written. She refused to table it because it was an internal working document. There was no 
 question about it not being completed—just the mere assertion that in her view it was an internal working document that we should not see. That was her view and that was fine. We disagreed with her view, but her view was that this paper, which she had been going to release on Wednesday, 29 September, was an internal working document now and she would not release it to us.
When she was asked about it on the same day at the Press Club she said, `I am sending it to the committee.' Again, no mention that it was not completed. She only mentioned that she would be sending it to the committee. It was to form the basis of their considerations. On Friday, 1 October in the Financial Review there was a discussion which indicated that the minister wanted a comprehensive debate—not, she was quoted as saying, `just a five-minute flash of paper'. So her defence on that day in the Financial Review was just that she did not want the paper to be the sole focus of the debate. That was her reason for not releasing it on Friday the 1st.
The minister has shifted and turned throughout this episode, trying to find a way through. But what is clear is that the minister is not telling us the truth about this paper in her latest defence. There was a paper, it was to be released, she presold it to the press, but it was withdrawn at the last minute. The parliament has asked for it to be made available to it, and she now says there is no such paper or it is still in a stage of development. That is not true and it is misleading the Senate to claim that it is true.
On 30 September, the Senate adopted Senator Bartlett's motion. Thirteen days later, the minister wanders into Senate question time and, at 3 o'clock right on the knocker, Senator Lightfoot, of all people, gets up to provide the dorothy dixer for her to explain why she has failed to table the paper. Right on the knocker of the deadline of the order of the Senate, the dorothy dixer was asked. Her answer to Senator Lightfoot was, `It is still being developed.' In 13 days we had not heard this excuse. In 13 days this defence had not been offered, but, for the first time in 13 days—and longer if you add the three or four days of hyping up the document to the press 
 prior to the Press Club luncheon speech—the minister offered that defence. It was her excuse for not tabling the paper. It took her 13 days to come up with that excuse. Quite frankly, I think she should have done better because for 13 days work it was a pretty poor effort. It reminded me of a naughty schoolgirl trying to explain her excuses for failing to do her homework. It is like saying `The dog ate it' or `It fell in the fire'. That is the best she could do in terms of defending the fact that the Prime Minister stopped her from releasing it, and she does not want to release it now.
I just do not think it is good enough for the minister to try to rely on that defence. She has no reason for not releasing it other than that it will be politically damaging, she thinks, to the government. That is not a reasonable excuse. The paper was hyped up by her and her staff. They sold the importance of it. She created fear and uncertainty in the community by alluding to the sorts of changes in welfare policy that would be contained in it. But, having created that, she now seeks to blame Senator Bartlett or Mr Wayne Swan for the fear, uncertainty and concern about that debate. She created the debate and she created the fear and uncertainty by hyping up, in pre-publicity of the speech and the paper, what it contained. She mentioned that there would be an attack on sole parents' entitlements. She mentioned that there would be an extension of mutual obligation to disability support pensioners.
These people are worried because the minister's own office and the minister herself started this debate about their entitlements. They have a right to know now what she intends. They do not intend to be fobbed off by some suggestion that she will rework the paper and send it off to a committee. They have a right to know and the parliament has a right to know. This is a debate that she created. This is a debate that she intended starting, and it is no good trying to blame the Democrats or the Labor Party now that the debate has been commenced. We have a right to know what was considered so seminal. We have a right to know what was considered so important by the minister right up until the day of her speech.
Up until that time, she was describing her discussion paper as `seminal', as `significant', and as an `important agenda-setting paper'. She then went on to describe her speech as a `blasted good speech'. Admittedly, Senator Newman was the author of all those superlatives about her speech and the paper. I have not seen one other commentator describe them in such glowing terms, because there was nothing in the speech. By the time the Prime Minister got to her, there was nothing in the speech except the announcement of the establishment of a committee. She could not tell us what the terms of references were for that committee. She could not tell us who was to be on the committee, although Mr McClure got rung up the night before and agreed to chair it. This was a last minute fix-up to try to hide the fact that the discussion paper had been pulled. There is no question about that.
For the minister to try to continue to hype up her contribution at the Press Club, given that it was largely content free, is a nonsense. The content was in the discussion paper—she knows it; we know it—the completed discussion paper that was to be tabled and presented at the Press Club on that day. That paper is in existence. It was ready to go. The minister said it was ready to go. Her media adviser said it was ready to go. They talked it up all through the press gallery and all through the Australian community—this paper was going to be seminal. Now she says, `Oh, we're still working on it. It's not completed. You can have it when it's finished.' I do not believe you, Minister. It was going to be finished for Wednesday, 29 September. It was not presented, for reasons best known to the government. But we have a right to see it. The people who will be affected by the changes you propose have a right to see it. It is no good saying to us now, `Oh, well, we're still working on it. You can have it some time down the track when I find enough people to serve on the committee and when I sort out the process.' That is not an answer to the order of the Senate that says we want to get a copy of the discussion paper you were going to release then, not the reworked, rehashed, sanitised version. We want a copy of the paper that you said was to be so seminal, that you said was to be so important and that you said was 
 to be an agenda-setting paper. That is the one we want to see.
If there are now two papers, as I suspect there are, we are not interested in the second one. We will see that when you send it off to the committee. I think we are quite happy to wait for that one, Senator Bartlett. What we do want to see is the one that was to be released on Wednesday, 29 September. When the minister comes in here, as I say, like a naughty schoolgirl who has not done her homework and the best excuse she can give is, `We're still working on it,' we do not believe her. The Senate should not believe her and the Australian public should not believe her, because it is not consistent with anything she has said for the last two weeks. She dreams up this weak excuse 13 days later and comes in here and patronises Senator Bartlett and says, `I expected better of you, Senator Bartlett.' You should get used to it, Senator Bartlett—I have been patronised by her a lot. You are joining a very large club.
The point is that the Senate made an order for that discussion paper to be tabled, and the minister has failed to comply with that order. The Senate has a right, an obligation and a duty to censure the minister for failing to comply with that. She has offered no good excuse as to why it should not be presented to the Senate. Her excuse was absolutely pathetic. To pretend that it is still being worked on when she had so hyped it up, so sold it to the Australian media and the Australian public that it would be released on Wednesday, 29 September and two weeks later come in and say `We're still working on it' is just incredulous. It is just not the truth. There may well be work going on on that paper now, but we do not want to see the sanitised, revised version. We want to see the original version that was to be presented on Wednesday, 29 September. The Australian community and those who rely on social security support in this country have a right to see that paper.
The minister now says that she wants a proper debate. I agree with her. We ought to have a proper debate, and the starting point for that debate is the government's discussion paper. If the minister wants a rational, con 
 sidered, intelligent debate I am happy to join in, but let us see the paper.
—That would be the first time.
—Senator Kemp, you may say that it is for the first time. But I think that is unfair of you and not like you.
—Oh, that's a bit patronising!
—Well, it is the day for it. I think it is important that we see the paper. It is important that we have a rational, considered debate. But it is not fair to come in here and sell the direction of the policy paper, sell the importance of the paper and talk about how important it is going to be to the government's agenda and then say, `We're not going to release it to the public.' The Senate quite rightly ordered that it be released. The Senate, I think, has to stand on its obligations to the Australian community and insist that the paper be released now. As I have said, and I want to make the point very clearly, we are not interested in what the minister is reworking now and what might go to the committee. We are interested in the discussion paper that she said would be released on Wednesday, 29 September. That is the one the order applied to and that is the one we want to see. I urge the Senate to support the censure motion.",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Censure Motion,1,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1999-10-13,"—I have witnessed some feeble censure motions in this place, but I regret to say that this one creates a new bottom line. What are we censuring this minister for?
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! A censure motion is a serious matter. The minister should be heard.
—Madam President, I take your comment because, of course, a censure motion should be a serious matter. It should be taken in serious circumstances, and this one obviously is not. The devaluation of the currency of censure motions is the reason that so few take them seriously any longer. I think that is a matter for regret.
—You started the devaluation.
—Picking up the interjection of Senator Sherry, it did not start with us. In actual fact, we were careful in relation to censure motions. We moved them rarely and we only moved them in relation to serious matters. What apparently is being called for here, and it was emphasised by Senator Chris Evans's contribution, are really the internal documents of Senator Newman in her responsibility as the Minister for Family and Community Services. Senator Newman is contributing to the development of policy which she will presumably, ultimately, take to cabinet and seek to have it endorsed and, if so, implemented through legislation or administration.
This is an ongoing responsibility and process of government. Ministers are doing this every day, and all honourable senators are aware of this. To come in here and to attempt to censure the minister for failing to put on the table those internal workings is extraordinary and, as far as I know, unprecedented. We understood that what was being sought was an open and transparent process with this public reference group.
Let me recall the history of this matter. Senator Newman recently made a very important speech on social security reform at the press club. It builds upon her record as an innovative and reformist minister. She went further and said that, in the development of a new range of reforms, she wished to have a public process. She said that she would set up a reference group which would consult with the public on future reforms, and she would assist that reference group by providing it with a discussion paper. It is a process of achieving legislative and administrative reform that should be commended. She said that that discussion paper can be made a public document when it has been delivered to the reference group, so that everybody knows what the government has in mind in relation to the work of the reference group—again, something that I would have thought should be applauded.
The motion that was moved originally by Senator Bartlett said that that discussion 
 group should be made public. We accept that; that is fine. It should be made public, and Senator Newman has said that as soon as the discussion paper is delivered to the reference group, it will be tabled in this place and will therefore be on the public record. So what is she being censured for? Having indicated that she will make public the document that will be delivered to the reference group, Senator Bartlett stood up yesterday and said, `That's not good enough. What I was really talking about in my motion of demand'—the motion that was passed in this place—`are preceding documents.'
Madam President, that is not what Senator Bartlett had in his motion at all. His motion, which was carried by the Senate, asked:
That the Senate
(a) notes that the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Newman) will be providing a discussion paper to her newly-established reference group developing a green paper on welfare reform;
(b) supports the notion of an open, public and wide-ranging community debate on the future of Australia's welfare system;—
I am pleased the Democrats support that—
and
(c) requires that the discussion paper mentioned in (a)—
that is, the discussion paper that she will be presenting to the reference group—
be laid on the table . . . 
which is exactly what she has said she will do. But that is not good enough for Senator Bartlett. He said that his first clause really referred to preceding documents that are not going to be given to the discussion group—working documents in the development of the discussion paper. Senator Bartlett said that these are the papers that the motion really referred to—or should have referred to—and, because they are not being tabled, she should now be censured. There is no basis for a censure in those circumstances. She is going to comply with the order that the Senate made, but she cannot comply with it within the time frame because the document that is to be presented to the reference committee has still not been finalised. How could one sensibly and rationally censure a minister in those 
 circumstances? That is why I say that, regrettably, this censure motion achieves a new low and further devalues the currency. If we are concerned that censure motions are not taken seriously by the community now, this will not help.
There are two points. Firstly, the motion was incorrectly drawn. If Senator Bartlett wanted the Senate to adopt a motion requiring working documents, he should have said so in his motion. Secondly, because Senator Bartlett was seeking internal documents—and as Senator Bartlett knows, it has been a long- standing practice that governments do not normally put on the table working documents; otherwise, the whole process of government would grind to a halt if every minute that Senator Kemp worked on had to be then tabled—they would not be tabled in any event. For those reasons, this censure certainly should not succeed today and, if it does, it will not be taken seriously by the community.
In conclusion, I want to say a few things. Firstly, it is a privilege and a pleasure to work with Senator Newman. She has been an excellent Minister for Family and Community Services. She not only has been sensitive to her constituency but she has also has accepted the responsibility to ensure that public money is wisely spent. If you look through the reforms that she has been able to implement so far, you will see both trains of thought. Public money is targeted to where it is most needed.
Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—
—Yes, Senator, we do not apologise for that; we have always said that the best form of welfare is a job. We have an entirely different approach from the Australian Labor Party to these matters. Where money has not been wisely spent, and where it has been abused, Senator Newman has come down hard, and that angers the ALP as well. But it is something that is applauded by the community at large. As I said, it has been a privilege and a pleasure to work alongside such a successful minister. Long may she continue in her role, doing the good work that she is doing.
The second point I want to make is that being able to stand on a good record is not 
 enough for Senator Newman. She wants to move the agenda on to do even better for the future. For that, I commend her as well. In many ways, it is her determination to keep proceeding down a path that the community strongly supports and that the Labor Party condemns in here today. She has been a reformist minister. She would make no apology for that, and I appreciate it. She is prepared to continue down the reform path and I commend her for that.
Thirdly, I commend her willingness to engage in open and transparent process, to set up this reference group and to bring the community into the debate. These issues are complex and it is much better if the community can understand and be incorporated in the process. Her willingness to engage the community is something I applaud. Her willingness, therefore, to put this discussion paper on the public record as it is delivered to the reference group and therefore to facilitate the Senate as well as the community at large is something that the Senate should be acknowledging with appreciation, not condemning her for. I note that the other side are giggling.
Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—
—That demonstrates that the other side does not take this matter seriously. That is what we regret—the devaluation of censure motions. They are not taken seriously by the Labor Party. They have therefore lost their serious aspect as far as the community is concerned. I do not think that is in the Senate's interest in the long term.
This is a minister who deserves to be applauded, not condemned. This is a censure motion that deserves to be thrown out, and I trust that it will be today. Even if it is carried, I regret to say that nobody will take it seriously because it has failed in the terms of the motion and it has failed in terms of seeking to meddle in the internal business of government. It is inconsistent with the willingness of the minister to put the discussion paper on the public record at the appropriate time. I urge senators to dismiss this motion.",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Censure Motion,1,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-13,"—in reply—In closing the debate on this motion, what has sunk to a new low in this 
 debate is not the worthwhileness of the censure motion but the feebleness of the arguments put forward by the government in relation to why they are not complying with the return to order. It is something I find breathtaking. The whole concept that the minister has always been keen to be open and willing and desirous of having a public debate on this seems like a very recent invention.
Senator Hill tried to point out some alleged inconsistency in relation to this motion and the original return to order. The only reason there is any possibility of even being able to try to make that argument is that it wasn't until yesterday that somehow or other we now have two discussion papers around the place—the original discussion paper which has now been transformed into a `working document' and the discussion paper that is still being prepared. The suggestion that there was never any finalised discussion paper that was going to be released at the Press Club beggars belief. It is a new low in terms of excuses put forward by a minister and by a government as to why they refuse to comply with an order of the Senate.
It wasn't until yesterday that any suggestion had been put forward by the minister that there wasn't a complete discussion paper that was already in her possession. To now suggest that there was never any discussion paper, that it was always a work in progress, a working document, that it is inappropriate for the Senate to try to access is a highly dubious argument, to put it politely. The minister and the government are now suggesting that they have a work in progress and they will willingly and gladly table that when it is finished. I am glad the minister is now deciding that she is willing to table that. I would remind the Senate that, when I initially asked the minister during question time to table the discussion paper rather than just provide it in private to the reference group, she refused. At that time she said: `I am going to give it to the reference group, I am not going to table it and I am not going to make it public; bad luck.'
So I guess if there is one positive aspect of this debate and of the original return to order it is that it has obviously at least changed the 
 minister's mind about the appropriateness of making the document that she provides to the reference group a public document. Unfortunately, what we are now seeing is that that document will not be the discussion paper that she had prepared originally for the Press Club. She is rewriting it. One would find it difficult to do anything other than to assume that she is sanitising it in the process.
Let me quote from a couple of press reports today in relation to the existence of this discussion paper. As, I think, Senator Evans highlighted, Senator Newman's staff were strongly beating up throughout the press gallery in the lead-up to her Press Club speech the existence of the discussion paper, how groundbreaking it was going to be and when it was going to be provided. I refer to Kate Hannon's piece in today's Hobart Mercury, stating that Senator Newman had originally promised to release the 20-page discussion paper on ideas for welfare reform during a National Press Club speech. Only last night a spokesperson for the minister said that the minister had never claimed a discussion paper would be ready for release in time for the Press Club. I have yet to find a journalist who wasn't aware that it had been claimed quite frequently and with great pride that the discussion paper was going to be released. How everybody seemed to be of the view that it was a 20-page discussion paper, if it was a non-existent work in progress set of working documents, is beyond me. I quote from Aban Contractor's piece in the Canberra Times today:
A spokesperson for Senator Newman said two weeks ago that the paper had already been referred to the committee—
that is the reference group, I presume—
and would form an important part of its resources.
So let us, for starters, highlight the hollowness of the government's claim that there is no complete discussion paper and it is a work in progress which is inappropriate for the government to table.
The Democrats certainly do take this censure motion and all censure motions seriously. Senator Hill was the subject of a censure by the Senate earlier this year. I do not think he took that one terribly seriously. That is more 
 an indication of an overall attitude of the government than any degradation of the seriousness that the Senate puts on these issues. Senator Faulkner, when he was in government, had been the subject of a censure motion, I think an unsuccessful one. It is interesting in that context to put that in line with the ALP's response to the second component of my motion to try to put some sort of ongoing sanction on the minister.
One would think, if the ALP were serious about censure motions, they would back measures to have constructive sanctions. One has to wonder about the seriousness of the ALP's approach to the motion when they themselves are not willing to back it up with any teeth. Nonetheless, the Democrats will reluctantly accept the ALP's amendments to ensure that at least a censure motion is passed. I am happy to talk to the ALP or to any other senator about measures other than those put forward but I am surprised today that they have not actually put any suggestions forward as amendments.
I am reminded again of the statement on this issue by Labor's shadow spokesperson, Mr Wayne Swan, who is quoted in the West Australian today saying that he did have some problems with proposals I was putting forward but that `We agree on the objective. We are prepared to be very tough on her.' We have not seen any evidence of that here today unfortunately. It looks like a fairly weak response in the case of the Labor Party. I am pleased they are supporting the censure motion, but I do not see any evidence at all of any tough action in relation to following that through with concrete sanctions.
It was suggested and there were arguments put forward about why what amounts to a gag on the minister was inappropriate. I remind the Senate, as I said in my initial contribution, that in large part what is contained in here is actually a straight steal from what was put forward in the Senate in 1994 as a proposed course of action in relation to a minister who was in contempt of the Senate. It is a precedent which was already there, on which we are willing to build.
I also point again to the actions of the New South Wales upper house, which not only 
 gagged a minister but repeatedly threw him out altogether, which is obviously a much more serious action. I suggest again that is an established precedent and one of the few precedents in Australian parliaments for concrete sanctions against a minister who is in contempt of a house of parliament. It is in that spirit of trying to build on such precedents as exist that we put forward what is contained in the second part of this motion. Nonetheless, we are willing to consider other proposals, even though, unfortunately, none were put forward today. So the opportunity to implement them as part of this censure motion is lost.
Again, I would have to wonder whether or not Labor are keen not to get measures adopted by the Senate which set the precedent of concrete action against ministers who refuse to comply with orders of the Senate, obviously thinking about a time when they may be in government in the future and subject to such sanctions themselves. The Labor Party are obviously happy to frustrate and destabilise the entire government. They want to create a hostile Senate for the Howard government, but the Democrats are keen to ensure that the Senate does perform its role in an ongoing sense which will enable us to consider legislation. We would look at any proposals in that context. I find it difficult to believe that Labor is serious about the issue of following through a censure motion with concrete sanctions. Otherwise, they would have had amendments available, but I am quite happy to be proven wrong on that and am willing to consider concrete proposals that are put forward.
I was going to say that I should respond briefly to some of the comments by Senator Brown, but in some respects I probably should not bother. Perhaps I need to answer them. Probably only Senator Brown could somehow turn a censure motion on the social security minister into an attack on the Democrats's position on an environment bill. I guess that is par for the course in relation to his ongoing attempts to continue to provide misinformation about the Democrats' action on the environment bill. Somehow or other, it seems to concern Senator Brown that the 
 Democrats talk to the government, to the opposition and to other members of parliament. I suggest to him that it is actually not too bad an idea when you are in the parliament to talk to other parliamentarians if you want to get things through, but I guess he can go about things the way he chooses.
It is worth correcting the record in relation to his ongoing misinformation about the environment legislation. Rather than revisit that debate, perhaps I will just point him to a piece in today's Courier-Mail highlighting views of the Local Government Association of Queensland that there has been a massive expansion of federal government powers in relation to environment legislation as a result of the amendments that the Democrats put forward. Now over 90 per cent of Queensland could theoretically fall within the federal government's jurisdiction for planning approval. I would also draw his attention to a speech by Mr Hugh Morgan—not renowned as a tree hugger—about the new piece of environment legislation and complaining about the fact that it has now put environment issues centre stage. I suggest he have a read of that speech, which is available on the Internet under the Business Council of Australia web site and complains about the fact that biodiversity conservation and ecological integrity have now become fundamental in decision making—a good outcome from the Democrats' point of view; obviously a bad outcome from Hugh Morgan's point of view and apparently from Senator Brown's point of view as well.
We also had the new concept in Senate debate that somehow or other, unless I have my entire parliamentary party present in the chamber with me, the party is not serious about the measure that is put forward. I suppose it is easy for Senator Brown to have his entire party here with him each time he speaks, given that he is the only one here. It is not surprising that he often does not have other senators in the chamber supporting him when he follows that sort of logic, which is not to say that I am not happy to have my colleagues here when I am speaking. I am sure Senator Lees and Senator Stott Despoja would do a far better job than I would at 
 putting forward arguments, which is why they are leader and deputy. Nonetheless, I am pleased that they have sufficient confidence in me to actually put forward a motion on my own without having to sit here and keep an eye on me. It is a curious new benchmark that is being suggested in relation to motions put forward in this place. Perhaps when Senator Brown has an approach where you do not talk to anybody else while you are in this place, then maybe he does not have anything else to do with his time while he is here.
There were many comments in the debate about the adequacy or otherwise of Senator Newman's performance as Minister for Family and Community Services and in the social security area. I will not comment on those at the moment. I think that we have plenty of opportunities to debate such issues. As with many ministers, I could provide lots of criticism and also some compliments about varying actions of the minister. But what we are debating today is not the performance of the minister across her whole portfolio: we are debating the principal issue of a return to order which has not been complied with by the minister and the right of the Senate and the powers of the Senate to require a minister or a government to table particular documents. It is about that fundamental issue of the powers of the parliament as against the executive. It is that issue where the minister has completely failed to comply with the return to order. As I said at the start, she has put forward one of the more feeble excuses I have heard yet as to why she has not chosen to do that.
If this was just a bunch of working documents in progress, I could understand some of the comments that Senator Hill put forward. But clearly it was, and is, a concrete and specifically detailed discussion paper and it is completely appropriate for the Senate to seek to have it tabled, particularly in the context of the statements that the minister and her colleagues have made about the need for a public, open, ongoing and widespread comprehensive debate about welfare policy in this country. The difficulty of doing that, when the fundamental component of the government's plans is not made public, is pretty self- 
evident. It is no surprise that there are claims about hidden agendas of the government, secret agendas and concerns about harsh measures that may be contained in it, if it is not made public.
Again, I would urge the minister to reconsider her approach to this. She is concerned about beat-ups and scare campaigns being waged about what the government may or may not propose in this area. It is a sensitive area, but it is an important one. You are much more likely to be able to prevent scare campaigns and beat-ups if you have everything out in the open rather than refuse to table a document that we all know exists, which is a comprehensive document and obviously contains some concrete proposals or suggestions for the future of welfare reform in this country. It is much more appropriate to have that out in the open. You would prevent claims of scare campaigns and hidden agendas if you ceased to hide it. That is the concern that the Democrats have in this debate. We believe it is one that needs to be had but, unfortunately, we cannot have a comprehensive debate without the minister being open about what is being proposed.
Once again, I come back to the fundamental issue of this now newly redefined discussion paper which has suddenly been transformed into a `work in progress' and suggest that, if it is to be tabled at some later date—obviously I have no objection to it being tabled—with a suggestion that that is the document which the Senate is seeking to be tabled, not only would we have concerns about contempt of the Senate in relation to not complying with a return to order but also we would be looking seriously at a misleading of the Senate if a sanitised document is tabled and tried to be presented as the original discussion paper. That is a concern that I would have. Again, I hope that the minister does not go down that path.
In conclusion, the censure motion is an important one. It is one that the Democrats take seriously, even if the government does not. From its response to previous censure motions, it is not something which it takes seriously, unfortunately. That is why I sought to add on to it specific concrete sanctions to 
 highlight to the government how seriously we do take this issue. It is unfortunate that they will not be agreed to by the Senate and that no other concrete proposals are being put forward in their place. There is precedent now in Australian parliaments, via the New South Wales upper house, for actions such as those to be taken, and I hope that the Senate will consider alternative constructive sanctions—in the words of Senator Faulkner—and not continue the precedent of not following through with any concrete sanctions linked to censure motions.
I would have a concern that Labor does not want to set a precedent in that regard for when it ends up back in government, but I am quite willing, and indeed hopeful, that it will prove me wrong in that regard. Nonetheless, I will have to accept the Labor Party amendment, reluctantly, to ensure that at least the initial basic censure motion does get through. Once again, I call on the minister to reconsider the issue and to comply with the other part of the motion which will remain, and which will be passed, which is for her to table the original discussion paper which we all know exists and which we all know was a finalised discussion paper at the time indicated in the motion.

I make the comment that the amendments arise from the report and recommendations of the joint statutory committee. I think it is fair to say that the government has picked up the great bulk of the recommendations of the committee.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I would seek to have amendments 26 
 to 28 separated so that they can be dealt with a little later when we deal with the majority of amendments to do with compulsory acquisition. It is just a question of either having the debate twice or having it once, if that is acceptable to the government.
Motion (by Senator Ian Campbell) agreed to:
That further consideration of amendments Nos 26, 27 and 28 be postponed.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-13,"—Just for clarification, I would like to determine exactly what we are dealing with at the moment. As I understand it, it is government amendments Nos 4 to 38, excluding Nos 26 to 28, together with amendments Nos 40, 43 to 45 and 47 to 71.
—That is correct.
—If the opposition do not wish to speak first on these, I have a few remarks that I would just like to address to these amendments as a whole. The Australian Democrats support these amendments. In the process of developing them, I omitted yesterday to thank my adviser Lee Jones who has assisted me greatly in this process. He has interacted with the government on their amendments and, as I have said already, we do support them.
These amendments are largely of a technical or corrective nature, but I do note that a number of them give effect to policy changes which the minister has made in response to the report of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. I would make the point that this is how governments should behave. There is no point in having a joint committee which considers these matters on an objective and independent basis if the government do not respond positively to them where they can see their way to doing so. I thank the government for dealing positively with that report.
In dealing with a few of those amendments briefly, amendment No. 8 responds to a recommendation contained in my own supplementary report. That recommendation was that, regardless of the type of consideration being offered for shares in a takeover situation, the minimum consideration on offer 
 must at least equal the maximum paid during the four months before the date of the bid. The existing provision only imposed that requirement where one of the forms of consideration offered was cash. If cash was not being offered, the requirement did not apply. I am glad the government saw fit to accept that recommendation.
Amendment No. 19 establishes an internal revenue mechanism for decisions made by the Corporations and Securities Panel. The Democrats were concerned that, in its present form, the legislation had provided no redress whatsoever for a person aggrieved by a decision made by the panel. We are happy to see the provision for internal review of panel decisions, which will hopefully balance the need for an appeal mechanism against the desire to avoid lengthy court appeals during the takeover process.
In making those remarks, I should say in passing that the committee noted, in its interaction with the UK takeover panel by telephone conference, that that takeover panel had been free of court appeals and court processes because its own process of dealing with takeovers is so well accepted in the market. I hope that the new takeover panel will indeed have that same atmosphere and culture surrounding it.
Amendment No. 20, which we are also considering at this time, picks up another recommendation in our supplementary report to the joint committee's inquiry, namely, allowing an extended range of persons to obtain enforcement of the orders by the Corporations and Securities Panel rather than just ASIC. Orders of the panel will now be able to be enforced by any person to whom the order relates, any party to the proceedings or the president of the panel. It was the Australian Institute of Company Directors that expressed concern with the original limitation. It was suggested that limiting applications for enforcement to ASIC alone was consistent with the objective of curbing the litigious nature of takeover activity.
As I said in my supplementary report, I am of the view that allowing enforcement applications by persons other than ASIC will: firstly, not result in any substantial increase 
 in litigation given that there must first be an order on foot and a contravention of that order before an application can be made; and, secondly, relieve ASIC of the need to become involved in litigation which is essentially between private citizens. Once again I thank the government for including that in their own amendments. That is all I have to say on those government amendments and I repeat that we support them.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I want to indicate briefly that the opposition support the amendments. The Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Bill 1998  and these amendments seek to revamp the takeover panel based on the UK model. While we are supportive of the principle that a body can act in arbitration to settle takeover disputes as an alternative to the courts, we have some doubts about our ability to emulate the success of the UK's panel.
Australia has a somewhat different business culture to that of Britain, based on evidence provided to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. British corporations are less adversarial and less inclined to pursue litigation compared to their Australian counterparts. It is because of these concerns that the opposition support the government's amendments to their own bill on the takeover panel. We hope that these changes will boost the relevance and authority of the takeover panel in considering debates arising during the takeover process.
I would, however, like to draw one interesting parallel. The government seem dead keen to have some sort of independent arbitrator outside of the courts when it comes to a battle between their corporate mates. But when it comes to industrial relations we have a situation where they want the courts involved. They want to take away the powers of the independent umpire. It seems to me that they are setting a double standard here. They are setting a standard which says it is all right for our corporate mates to have a chat and go through this independent process with lots of powers and no constant litigation or extra costs, but if you are a worker or a union you are going to lose under this government's ideological war. You are going to lose 
 protections and rights, and you are going to have the capacity to arbitrate taken away.
I find it interesting that there is such a staggering double standard. I am hoping that in later debates this can again be highlighted: there is one rule for the bosses and the companies, but if you are a worker or a union then you are going to have to be open to the influence of lawyers, courts and all sorts of actions to try to break and destroy you. I hope the Senate and the senators in this chamber are conscious of this double standard when it comes, in a few months time, to dealing with a number of issues revolving around the so-called second wave or third wave or fourth wave or whatever we are up to by the time it finally gets here. It is important to emphasise that double standard.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-13,"—Mr Temporary Chairman Sherry, I must apologise to you and my colleagues because I was not alert enough to the fact that I wanted one item in the government amendments being put to be considered later. The item concerned is government amendment No. 14. I ask the Senate whether that amendment can be considered after Democrat amendment No. 2 on sheet 1592, so I move:
That further consideration of amendment No. 14 be postponed.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
—The question now is that the government amendments be agreed to.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-13,"—The Australian Democrats support this. It is consequential to the previous group of government amendments and relates to commencement. We do not feel any further comment is necessary.
Question resolved in the negative.
—Do you want to move on to (26), (27) and (28)?

(1)	 Schedule 1, item 1, page 4 (lines 2 to 25), omit subsections (2) and (3).
This amendment is to do with directors' duties and the business judgment rule. The opposition has considered the issue of the business judgment rule or safe harbour very carefully. We have weighed the arguments for 
 and against. We believe our decision to oppose it is the correct one. The government has argued that the common law has not provided the necessary degree of certainty with regard to the duties of directors, which has hampered them from doing their jobs effectively. Thus it argues that legislation is required to correct this and to encourage risk taking by directors. The opposition disagrees.
The common law has provided adequate consideration of directors' rights and has, in the main, restricted itself from second guessing directors' decisions. There already exists a so-called business judgment doctrine as a result of the case of Harlowe's Nominees Pty Ltd v. Woodside 1968. A statutory business judgment rule is therefore unnecessary. It is also unnecessary because there has been scarce litigation regarding directors' decisions. Even when directors are brought to court they are rarely penalised or found at fault. The case of Vrisakis v. Australian Securities Commission 1995 underlines this point. For those unfamiliar with this case, the court found that it could not convict Vrisakis, a non-executive director, for statutory breach of care and diligence. The court agreed that, as he was in the situation of salvaging a sinking company, he needed to consider more risky proposals, otherwise the company would have definitely failed. Where is the concern?
The government assumes that the business judgment rule will be sufficient to encourage directors to take risky decisions that could prove profitable. This is ridiculous. Market mechanisms exist which give directors incentives to perform. If directors fail to perform, it will be reflected in the company's performance and in its stock prices. If the directors also own stocks in their company or are involved in schemes which tie their remuneration to the company's performance, then I have no doubt that those directors are doing all they can to improve the performance of their companies.
Directors have blamed the AWA Ltd v. Daniels 1992 and the Daniels v. Anderson 1995 cases for the uncertainty, but these cases in fact clarified directors' duties. What is made clear is that, so long as directors actively participated in the company's affairs and 
 based their decisions on an informed basis, they would not be penalised even if the company ultimately failed. The standards may have been raised, but these are appropriate to ensure directors take their fiduciary role of managing other people's assets seriously. Directors should not be excused if they fail in their duties, which usually means economic loss for other Australians. This is what the government's business judgment rule would do: it would effectively remove directors' exposure to negligence. Why should directors be treated differently from other professionals?
The government's proposed business judgment rule was inspired by a similar law in the US state of Delaware. It is quite interesting to note, however, that the business judgment rule did little to protect directors from litigation and thus did little to provide certainty or clarity. The case of Smith v. Gorkom of 1985, considered in the Delaware Supreme Court, found the directors wanting in their decision making process. This was in spite of the existence of a business judgment rule. The key issues that weighed against the directors in this case were that they were not fully informed and had not applied independent judgment when making their decision. Also, the court found that their decision was not made in good faith due to haste and lack of prudence in making the decision. The big question now is whether the Smith v. Gorkom case would receive the same judgment and lead to a similar outcome under the proposed new regime of the government. For that matter, is the government's codification in step with the judgment in the Daniels v. Anderson case? That is, does the government accept that directors need to `take reasonable steps to place themselves in a position to guide and monitor the management of the company'? Moreover, do you agree that directors cannot use ignorance and a failure to inquire in making their decision as a protection against liability for negligence?
I expect the government's response to be negative in all instances. The government has drafted a bill that would ensure negligent directors are not held accountable. Why propose a safe harbour when directors get 
 away with enough as it is? The Burns Philp episode shows that, no matter how bad you are as a director, you will not face any sort of sanction. As ASIC's chairman acknowledged, `incompetency is not a crime'. ASIC's assessment of the Burns Philp fiasco found that there was a lack of mix of independent and non-independent members on the board. Also, while outside expertise was sought in certain valuations, not all the relevant information was passed on to the valuer and the directors themselves did not apply independent judgment in considering the expert's valuations. I believe that it was important that certain Burns Philp directors should have faced some form of legal sanction but, as the chairman of ASIC concluded, as I have already said, incompetence is not a crime. ASIC should have at least moved to disqualify or ban these directors from holding office in the future. Alternatively, it could have pursued a civil lawsuit on behalf of aggrieved shareholders. Unfortunately, ASIC is loath to pursue civil litigation.
The class action being taken by GIO shareholders on botched advice from the GIO board about the merits of the AMP takeover bid should be another textbook case on why companies need to apply good corporate governance practices and on why directors need to be aware of fiduciary duties. In this instance, it is alleged that directors failed to take account of or failed to reveal to the market the significant risk of massive losses in one of their divisions. I welcome the class action in principle—admittedly for its shock element—because it is important for directors to understand their critical role not only in helping run the company but also in their fiduciary responsibility as representatives of shareholders of the company.
The board's responsibility, as well as the expert's opinion, becomes particularly critical for companies with a dominant proportion of so-called mum and dad shareholders. They tend not to have access to their own experts nor access to independent information. I would hate to be right on the dangers that might be realised from the government's proposal, because it would mean that the hard-earned savings of Australians could be 
 lost. No matter what sanction you put in place after such a catastrophe, when the money is gone it is gone. The government will not compensate those who would have lost their money. It is also unlikely that the company or its directors would be able to find the money when the company is bankrupt.
This is an issue which, despite the submissions, many people have got reservations on. I would like to read to you a quote from such a prominent individual as Alan Kohler, not someone who is notably a Labor Party supporter.
—He is a closet supporter.
—We wish. He states:
The business judgment rule is basically a legislative reversal of the decision by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in AWA when it overturned an earlier decision by Justice Andrew Rogers in 1995. Rogers had effectively written a business judgment rule into the common law by letting directors off the hook over the shenanigans that went on in AWA's foreign exchange transactions, but the Court of Appeal threw it out and put the directors squarely back in the frame.
What we have here today is an attempt which is not, as is being described in the press release in nice, friendly language, just about making sure that directors are not constrained. Have a look at the words in the legislation: this is overturning the Court of Appeal and returning to Justice Andrew Rogers's position, which was clearly one that was tossed out on appeal. What we are doing is returning to that. That is what Alan Kohler said.
I would like to make mention of another of Alan Kohler's articles where he talks about what has actually been going on here. He describes it as follows:
Meanwhile, the company directors' lobby has got the business judgment rule for which it has been agitating for so long. It was felt by them, and agreed by Peter Costello, that the law should give directors a safe harbour from personal liability in the event of breaches of care and diligence if they made an `honest, informed and rational business judgment'—in other words, the old `it was a good idea at the time' defence.
This is not the Labor Party; this is a commentator who has credibility on these issues because he has studied case law and he has studied the issues. He has made those points.
I have always struggled to come to terms with the claims that were made before the companies and securities commission when we were told how constrained business had been by this lack of judgment rule. That is not evidenced in the economy at the moment: we have profits booming and the sharemarket increasing. We unfortunately have unemployment going up but all of the conditions are seeing corporate profitability at record highs, yet we are being told that company directors are burdened, weighed down. So you have a situation where, if you examine the rhetoric and what is really happening, you actually see that what is being proposed is a subterfuge to introduce the streaker's defence: it was a good idea at the time. By changing the emphasis and by putting the words in this way in this legislation, it will be nearly impossible to find a director incompetent and to deal with it.
You have a situation at the moment in GIO where there has been significant allegations of poor management by the board. A court will decide this—as I have said—but, Senator Murray, you have to ask yourself this: if you pass this legislation, will you be helping those GIO shareholders in their class action against their board? Many commentators—and I could read you the comments of three, four or five others in this clippings set—have indicated that in actual fact this is shifting the balance of power between shareholders and company directors. I would put to senators here today that, if you pass this rule, in the future another GIO situation could arise and the capacity of shareholders who have been severely disadvantaged by the conduct of their board will be such that they will not be able to get restitution.
That is the key test for voting for or against this particular piece of legislation: will you be assisting shareholders—the true owners of a company—and not directors? The directors are appointed and are not the owners in most cases. The directors are there with the responsibility to maximise shareholder value, and in some cases we have directors behaving otherwise, as was proven in the eighties with the Skases and the Bonds. Would you be able to convict Christopher Skase or Alan Bond if you go ahead and vote for these proposals? 
 Would you be able to convict the GIO board? I put to you that you would struggle much harder and that the test would be much harder if you were to vote for this proposal.
Senator Murray, despite your comments yesterday about me always being on report, I have played contact sport and I have, can I say to you, never ever received a red card and never ever been put on report. I have had the odd yellow card but I have not actually ever been put on report in any circumstances and, despite the wish of some senators on the other side, I intend to keep it that way. But I am surprised at the Democrats' willingness to vote for this. I believe that, if you examine case law and the consequences that are likely to flow from this, you will actually see that you have worked against the interests of shareholders and that this is not something that you should be proud of simply because one group—and it is a very powerful group, the Australian Institute of Company Directors is a very powerful organisation—has lobbied extensively. It has pushed for this for years, as has been noted. This is not a radical new proposal; it has been around for 10 or 15 years.
—We call it the Cooney proposal.
—Senator Cooney can speak for himself.
—He has.
—He does not need you to speak for him, Senator Campbell. I believe that, in the future, when the first of the court cases is lost because of the streaker's defence, those who voted for this will hang their heads in shame as shareholders will have lost their money and will have no chance of restitution.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-13,"—The usefulness of having Senator Conroy speak is that you always do have something to react to. That is very useful. But the Labor Party is quite right in isolating this as an area which is deserving of proper debate on the record in this committee of the whole. If you look at the 469 pages of legislation, the nine schedules that we have here and the number of amendments which will enlarge it, you will see this is one of the 
 areas in which there is indeed some controversy. The effect of Senator Conroy's amendment is to abolish the business judgment rule, and we should go through what all that means and how that has been developed as a thought.
Before I do so, I should indicate that the Australian Institute of Company Directors have indeed supported this and have indeed lobbied about it. But to imply that the Democrats were influenced by either their size or their lobbying would be mistaken; we have been influenced by their case. I would point out to you that they are on the record in writing as being very much not our friends. Their miserable and wrongheaded remarks about the Senate's and the Democrats' roles in both Corporations Law and taxation matters have been well noted by us. Frankly, if I were on their board of management, I would want to know why up to this date they have been so remarkably incompetent in interacting with political parties like ours.
Of course, in making those remarks, I refer to the leadership of the AICD, not company directors at large. I am, quite frankly, unimpressed by their view of the political process and the role of the Senate and of its various functioning parties. But that does not mean to say that I will not accord with their view when I think they have a legitimate case, and that is the role of political parties in this place—that is, to assess issues on their merits.
To return to the business judgment rule, the business judgment rule is a statutory formulation of the position at common law. The courts are loath to review the merits of a decision on a matter of business judgment. In a general sense, the business judgment rule will require the courts to review directors' behaviour in a much more precise manner, and that is one of its virtues. I noted that the shadow minister outlined some American case history. He quite correctly indicated that, where the business judgment rule exists there, more litigation has resulted, which I think may in fact be a useful consequence of this—in other words, the greater precision of the law may in fact encourage a better focus.
But we should not escape from the view that the intention is that the proposed provi 
 sion will result in the Corporations Law not only setting out the duty of care and diligence of directors but also providing an explicit safe harbour for directors. If it is the view that every director and every business person has to be regarded with suspicion, obviously none of us in this place will accept that—certainly none of the people I know who are familiar with this. If it is the view that you will always find directors who behave appallingly, yes I agree with that. But now directors will know with some certainty that if—and it is an `if'—they fulfil the requirements of the new section 180 they will effectively be shielded from liability for any unclear breach, if you like, of their duty of care and diligence.
I understand that the Labor Party take the view that the business judgment rule will act as some sort of licence for delinquent directors to act in an even more irresponsible manner. I would like to briefly paraphrase the provisions of the new rule and let members of the Senate make up their own minds as to whether they agree that will be the case. The starting point is that a director must exercise his or her powers and discharge his or her duties with the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person would if that person was a director of a corporation in the corporations circumstances and occupied the same office and held the same responsibilities within the corporation. That is the primary obligation in relation to directors acting with care and diligence. They have to act with the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person in their circumstances would. How else would you deal with such a matter? The courts have always struggled with it because you cannot expect directors to go to the extremes of responsibility in every circumstance.
The business judgment rule says that if you comply with the four criteria that are set out in the rule you will be taken to have acted reasonably. Let us bear in mind that the criteria laid down have a framework and history in common law judgments. What are those criteria? Firstly, you must make the judgment in good faith and for a proper purpose. Secondly, you must not have a material personal interest in the subject matter 
 of the decision—that deals with the conflict of interest area. Thirdly, you must inform yourself about the subject matter of the judgment to the extent that you reasonably believe to be appropriate. Finally, you must rationally believe that the judgment is in the best interest of the corporation.
Notwithstanding the comments of Senator Conroy earlier, the business judgment rule does not give directors a free rein—and you did not use these words, but I will paraphrase them in this way—to act like idiots and squander the resources of companies to the detriment of shareholders. It is the view of the Democrats that it is a subjective judgment as to whether you believe that the obligation of care and diligence, combined with the criteria contained in the business judgment rule, is a satisfactory level of obligation on company directors. The Australian Democrats take the view that the rule strikes an appropriate balance between demanding a reasonable standard of diligence from directors for the protection of shareholders and not imposing such a high standard as to make directors averse to taking any decision which may involve even a hint of risk.
Senator Conroy quoted the words, I think it was, of Alan Cameron, the head of ASIC, who said that incompetency is not a crime. I laughed when Senator Conroy said that because I just wondered about the 76 of us. There would be a few in here who might now and again be guilty of that themselves. And, frankly, it is not a crime. I have long believed—and people who are attuned to debate in this area of the law would know of my strong feelings on this—that in fact the real problem with directors as a class is the nature of their election and how they get to be appointed to their boards. We have heard evidence in the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities about the astonishing difference in the standards of information and presentation even under existing company law in existing company constitutions as to how directors are presented to their shareholders to be elected. Frankly, it is often a gerrymandered and manipulated system.
If we are going to improve the performance of boards, we really have to as a community 
 of legislators attend to that election issue and fix it up. I have strong feelings on that, as I am sure others in the Senate do. We have to make it more democratic. It is what I call a campaign for the democratisation of companies, that will have the result of making directors more responsible to their shareholders.
The second leg of enforcing accountability and greater competency on boards is a campaign to get rid of the concept of the unitary board. You cannot allow the unitary board system to continue in this country as long as unitary boards themselves manage issues in which they have clear conflicts of interest. How can boards determine their own remuneration, including share options? By giving people share options you deprive other shareholders of value which might accord to them. I do not have any problem with share options, but I do have a problem with people voting their own share options and their own remuneration—which, as we know with certain directors in this country, has resulted in them getting tens of millions of dollars worth of benefits. That is a clear conflict of interest and it arises because it is a unitary board. If you had a binary board structure, as I have previously proposed to the Senate, you could address that issue.
The other area of concern is the appointment of auditors, valuers, independent experts and so on. The board has a conflict of interest in doing that because they want a certain outcome. There are related party transactions and numerous other areas which I have dwelt on before, and I raise these issues because I think, when we are discussing the issue of directors' standards, Senator Conroy is quite right: this is what this is about and this is why it is controversial. We also have to pay attention to the bigger picture.
Returning to the amendment before us and to the provisions of the bill, the Democrats have come to the view that this provision, as put in the bill, will actually tighten up and improve accountability in this area, whilst giving appropriate protection for people who must take risks and who must be allowed to exercise a degree of responsible judgment to pursue the interests of their companies. We 
 will oppose your amendment—we will find out later whether our judgment is wrong. I do not think the Labor Party is at all wrong to bring up the issue and to seek to expose it and pursue it in the manner they have. I do not disagree with that view. We have, however, taken a different view, and we will support the government on this matter.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-13,"—Before I respond to some of Senator Murray's comments, I draw to the committee's attention that this has been considered in the other chamber and the minister, Mr Hockey, made the following point:
The fundamental purpose of the business judgment rule is to protect the authority of directors in the exercise of their duties, not to insulate the directors from liability.
Yet what this bill actually does is insulate. It does allow a protection—an increased protection from what has been there previously. He goes on to say:
Whilst it is correct that the courts rarely review bona fide business decisions . . . 
So the minister is accepting that the courts have not sought to overstep their mark in this area. I contrast that with a contribution by Senator Campbell of last night. As is sometimes his way, he likes to wax lyrical and exaggerate a situation. He suggests the exact opposite of what the minister has suggested. He said:
One of the problems with directors, clearly identified by both shareholders and directors, is that they become incredibly risk averse because of court decisions and litigation that try to second guess directors' decisions years, and potentially decades or more, after those decisions have been taken.
I can only describe Senator Campbell's contribution of last night as an utter furphy and an utter scare campaign designed to influence members of the Senate in our deliberations on this. I repeat: Mr Hockey, the minister, accepts that `Whilst it is correct that the courts rarely review bona fide business decisions'. And that is the case here. Why are we making this change? On the one hand we have the minister, who quite responsibly supports the propositions that I have put forward—that courts have very rarely second guessed and have acted prudently and sensib 
 ly in this area. But in his contribution, which I can only describe as inflammatory and scaremongering, he seeks to suggest that in actual fact the courts are running around the whole time second guessing business decisions. This is clearly nothing more than an attempt to influence Senator Brown or perhaps Senator Harradine or perhaps even Senator Murray and the Democrats. I would urge you to ignore the inflammatory suggestions but to go to the heart of what he also said, which was:
The fundamental purpose of the business judgment rule is to protect the authority of directors in the exercise of their duties, not to insulate the directors from liability.
That is what they say they are about; that is what the press release is about. But the bill does not do that. The bill does the opposite to what the press release says. The stated intention is not what happens in the actual words of the legislation. Senator Murray, I am sure you were not suggesting—and I am happy for you to clarify this—that we take a suspicious view of directors. This is untrue.
—No, I am not.
—I accept that. I was sure you would not reflect on the intent and purpose of the debate, because I would be disappointed if you believed that I and members of the Labor Party took the point of view that the starting point is suspicion of directors. I do not think that is the case. What we want to do is not, as you perhaps suggested, to encourage reckless behaviour or to suggest that this will encourage reckless behaviour. What we want to do is make directors accountable for their behaviour. It is not about saying, `This will lead to further reckless behaviour' although many people suggest it will. What I am arguing is the question of accountability. I am arguing that we must be prepared to make the managers of other people's assets and money accountable to the people they are managing it on behalf of.
You raised the point that incompetence is not a crime. Incompetence should not be rewarded. The point I made in the Burns Philp case is that, to this day, the directors who perpetrated the collapse in shareholder value in Burns Philp  have not been brought 
 to account. They can quite easily take up positions on other boards, running other companies and managing other people's money. I have strongly put to ASIC that I believe they failed when they did not seek to at least ban the directors, even if it were for just a year, from holding office. While incompetence may not be a crime, it should not be rewarded. The Burns Philp case is the most dramatic recent case. There are others—National Mutual, which no longer exists, had a shareholder value of $6 billion. Within a five- to seven-year period, the shareholder value was reduced to $1 billion. No-one has ever made the directors accountable for that sort of collapse. If you were a BHP shareholder right now, you would want to be asking questions in relation to what has happened to the share price of BHP. Maybe Robert Holmes a Court was right. Maybe what happened in the 1980s, when the Melbourne club got together—and the Melbourne club includes some people whom I have spoken about many times here—to fend off and to protect BHP, and the shareholders were manipulated in the way they were, has come home to roost. They are now starting to close down divisions and sell-off divisions, et cetera.
So this is not about wanting to encourage reckless behaviour. And even though the government are proposing this legislation, I do not believe they are seeking to encourage reckless behaviour. I simply make the point that it has been stated as a concern that it could encourage reckless behaviour. This is about the accountability of management to owner and not, as some seem to think, that the directors are the owners. They are not. They are in trust to the owners to manage the funds. I am disappointed if the imputation you are making is that what we are seeking to do is to make directors less accountable. What we are seeking to do is to make directors accountable.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-10-13,"—I have a specific question to ask of the government, and of the people who are contributing to this debate, in relation to a particular interest of mine—that is, the matter of donations to political parties. I would like 
 to know whether the legislation, as brought to the Senate by the government, is going to increase the obligation of directors making a decision to make a payment to a political party to ensure that it is in the interests of the shareholders. Basic commonsense is that corporations, business entities, do not make donations to political parties without the expectation of a quid pro quo. In fact, it would be against the overall requirements of directors that they act always in the interests of the shareholders if they were to make such a donation without expecting that it was to enhance the return to the shareholders; in other words, without expecting to effect a political influence that was in the interests of the shareholders.
We know that tens of millions of dollars from the corporate sector go into the electoral coffers of political parties in the run-up to every election. It seems to me that we have to face the question: is this money simply a loss to the shareholders? In other words, it is a loss from their returns at the end of the year. Or, alternatively, is it influencing the body politic to get a result? We suspend debate on that sort of matter because there are clear implications for the functioning of a democracy and the so-called independence of political parties in making decisions in the interests of the wider community.
I think there is clearly an argument that a director who is involved in a donation to a political party where there is not an ostensible or clear return to the shareholders from that donation is not acting in the interests of either the corporation involved or those shareholders and is therefore committing an act against their interests. My belief is that not only should such donations be publicly accountable, as they are, but that the shareholders ought to be consulted and that the directors, when they are making donations to political parties, ought to explain to shareholders in clear and precise terms what the return is going to be—that is, why it is to the benefit of those shareholders and that corporate entity.
So the question I pose as far as these provisions are concerned is: will they, or do they, place a requirement on directors that 
 when it comes to political donations there be consultation with the shareholders or, indeed, that there be any clear exposition from the directors involved that this is going to be in the interests of the company they represent?",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-13,—The answer to the honourable senator's question is that the provisions being debated here today make no change whatsoever to directors' responsibilities in relation to that matter.,SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I want to again emphasise, particularly to the Democrats but also to the government, that both sides of politics have been party to an enormous increase in the number of shareholders in ordinary Australia. Both sides agree that that is a good thing. There are Telstra shareholders, AMP shareholders, Qantas shareholders and Commonwealth Bank shareholders.
Arising out of the AWA and Daniels case, directors are considered fiduciaries as they hold and control other people's money and they are therefore in a position of trust; they do not owe any fiduciary duty to an individual shareholder but rather to the general body of corporates in the form of a company. The courts' directions reflect community concerns that higher standards of vigilance and honesty are required in dealing with other people's money. Kirby P., in Darvall v. North Sydney Brick and Tile Co. Limited (1989), is a classic example of that.
Commercial judges require higher standards because the community expects this from directors, especially executive directors, when dealing with significant matters. They should bring an informed and independent judgment to bear on the various matters that come before them. The key here is that the independent judgment is not reflected in the business judgment rule. This is the nub of the issue. When the government say they are codifying—that they are just seeking to clarify—they are removing from case law the critical question of independent judgment, and that is why the Labor Party is so concerned 
 about this issue. The role of directors is to manage other people's money; it is not to manage their own. They are given a trust. Whether the government's press release is right or whether the government's legislation is right, the key test is the test of independent judgment, and it is not in the business judgment rule.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-10-13,"—In response to my earlier submission about political donations being made on behalf of corporations by directors, Senator Campbell said on behalf of the government that this legislation will not alter the responsibility of directors in relation to that matter. I ask Senator Campbell: as legislation stands, what are the responsibilities of directors in relation to that matter?",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-13,"—As I said in my earlier answer, it is not the subject of this law. Companies' responsibilities in relation to political donations are the subject of a number of other laws that have been passed by this parliament.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-10-13,"—That is not so. What we are dealing with is the director or other officer of a corporation making a business judgment—and that of course involves the finances of any corporation—in good faith, that they do not have a personal material interest, and so on. Quite clearly, if a corporation is handing across $1 million to a political party, that is a major business decision. I ask Senator Campbell to address himself to these provisions. Is he saying that they will not affect the decision of a director of a corporation, when that director does make a donation on behalf of the corporation which can involve millions of dollars? Of course it does.
Yes, there are other pieces of legislation dealing with political donations, but that is not the point I am making. The point I am making is that the decision on those donations is made by directors, and it has to be in the interests of the shareholders. I ask the minister: in this specific matter, what obligations will there be on directors, if these 
 provisions are to be satisfactory, to ensure that when donations are made to political parties they are in the best interests of the shareholders? I would think it would require consultation with the shareholders. Is there provision here for such consultation? If not, why not? Can the minister say how any director acting in the interests of a corporation could make a political donation without weighing up the pros and cons of the effect of that political donation and the bearing it will have on the fortunes of the corporation and therefore the shareholders' interests?",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I am wondering whether Senator Campbell is going to respond.
—I've already answered the question.
—You've had your answer, Senator Brown; I didn't notice it, but you have had it! I want to make one final contribution, tongue in cheek. I note an article written last year. Senator Campbell, you might have seen it. I think it was by Ivor Rees, who was very complimentary about you. He said:
If Costello's reforms get up this year—
he does say `this year' so I suspect you have possibly missed out, because it was written last year—
they will change the way business is done in this country. If that happens, Costello should buy a case of Grange for Senator Ian Campbell, Costello's understudy, and lawyer turned company director Kath Walter, both of whom have spent the past six months selling the reforms to the business community.
I am just seeking a declaration here.
—I declare it!
—He continues:
If this comes off, Campbell and Walter will have made Costello look like a real quiet achiever.
I was just interested if you have a bottle or two of Grange on this being completed today.
—If the minister responds, I want to know whether Senator Conroy and I will be invited.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-10-13,"—Senator Campbell, who has carriage of this legislation for the government, remained 
 silent when I made my earlier request for information.
—Bob, I'll send you a bottle.
—Please don't! I put it to Senator Campbell that what I am talking about here is very germane to this government legislation. Section 181, which requires directors to show good faith and outline civil obligations, says:
(1) A director or other officer of a corporation must exercise their powers and discharge their duties:
(a) in good faith in what they believe to be in the best interests of the corporation; and
(b) for a proper purpose.
Can the minister say whether making political donations is a proper purpose? If so, why? If not, why not? Is there some other section which deals with the making of donations of shareholders' money—because that is what it is—without reference to the shareholders, to political parties?",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I am interested in and intrigued by Senator Brown's questions. I was hoping for a lengthier answer. I am sure Senator Brown has noticed that there are some proposals on the table at the moment to make trade unions more accountable for how they make political donations. I have always been open-minded about it, as many are, in terms of accountability to their membership. I am surprised that Senator Campbell does not want to respond in any greater detail to Senator Brown. The government try to pretend that they have a balance in their current proposals between donations from a union and a peak employer group, as if they are the same. I would have thought the more direct comparison is a company and a trade union, not a peak employer group.
I am not familiar with many peak employer groups that make direct donations—perhaps in kind by doing some intellectual work for them, and they need a lot of that. Perhaps that happens. But to try and fudge the question as blatantly as the government has regarding a trade union making donations but not deal with the question of corporate donations is a valid concern. I am disappointed that Senator 
 Campbell is not prepared to enter into discussion with you on that, Senator Brown. I support you in your pursuit of this issue because the hypocrisy and double standard that I have already alluded to earlier today in relation to the takeover panel and independent umpires when it suits the government for its mates but not in the industrial system is again evident in what it is seeking to do and in regard to the points that you are making today.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-13,"—On the point which Senator Brown has raised, I indicate for the record that the Australian Democrats in the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters, in its report on the 1996 election, recommended that if disclosure by companies and by unions were to be increased that should be common to all organisations, whether trusts, partnerships, unions or corporations in terms of political donations. The point is made that if you make donations on behalf of others, whether they be members of a union, a trust or a partnership or owners of a company, you should do so on the basis of a policy and on the basis of approval. That is essentially the point: those who own or participate in or belong to organisations, companies, trusts or partnerships should have a say in making sure that the policy is worth their approval.
Senator Brown, if you have an interest in this matter, you should go back over some of the debates and the 1996 report. There is a tax bill that will be dealing with political donations, and all disclosure provisions are covered in the Electoral Act. I am not sure that this necessarily is the right act to deal with it. But we have previously indicated that far better policies need to prevail in all organisations, unions or otherwise, and that the question of disclosure and improvement in disclosure levels should be dealt with through the 1918 Commonwealth Electoral Act—I cannot find the right terminology for that act, but you know the one I am referring to—rather than through general devices such as the Corporations Law. On the tax law side it relates to the size and nature of donations. But disclosure should be specifically dealt with. Senator Brown, I sit on the electoral 
 matters committee but I am not sure: did you make a submission to the electoral matters committee on this issue?
—I will be making a submission to the parliament very shortly on it.
—No. What I am suggesting is that the report for 1998 hasn't yet been written. I suggest to Senator Brown, if he has an interest in this area, that because the report on the 1998 election is not yet written, in my view there is still time for him to make suggestions to that committee, which suggestions I am sure it would appreciate receiving. I hope that contribution is helpful.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-10-13,"—I thank Senator Murray for that. That is a constructive contribution. I will be making my submission to the parliament, but it is awesome that the government goes silent on this matter. I will tell you why. It is indefensible that corporations are making donations of hundreds of thousands, and over the years millions and tens of millions, of dollars to the big political parties with no reference at all to the shareholders. You do not have to be a mathematician to work out that that money which goes to the political parties does not go to the profit line and therefore is taken from the interests of the shareholders, unless you can show a greater interest accruing to the shareholders through the political influence which the donation system levies. In my view, that system is corrupt. It therefore needs to be brought to order.
The government has flagged legislation which will make unions and peak employer groups—presumably like the National Association of Forest Industries, the Australian Mining Industry Council, and so on—accountable to their membership when they make political donations. But these are not the big political donors. The big political donors are the corporations themselves. So we have double standards where the government is saying, `We want to shelter the corporations, which make millions of dollars of donations into our coffers, from having to explain themselves to shareholders.' The point I make is that this legislation is a proper place to be debating this matter. I will move amendments when the government legislation comes into 
 this place to make unions accountable and to ensure that corporations are accountable and that there are no further donations made to any political party without the matter having been referred to shareholders.
—Beforehand?
—Beforehand, you are right. You do not make the reference afterwards; you make the reference beforehand. That would be responsible use of shareholders' money. It would then become incumbent on the directors to explain what they were going to get out of putting X million dollars into the coffers of the Liberal Party, the National Party, the Labor Party or the Democrats, whatever it might be.
—Or the Greens.
—There has not been such a donation.
—Yes, there has. Look at the Greens (WA).
—Senator, you will have your opportunity in a moment. The big players here, as you know, are the hundreds of thousands of dollars going to the big political parties. The Greens (WA) have at least insisted that the matter go on the record at the time, very different from the practice of the other political parties, including the Democrats.
—I object to that. That is a misrepresentation and is typical of your style.
—Well, Senator, you can get up and respond next. I am not going to be deterred from this matter and I will move amendments to that legislation when the government brings it into this place.
—Why don't you move amendments to this legislation?
—Where are your amendments? You are grandstanding.
—Order! Senator Murray and Senator Campbell. Senator Brown, continue, please.
—Thank you. The other senators are welcome to make their contribution to this very important matter. I am glad 
 I have raised it because the government has flagged legislation, as I said, specifically to tackle other entities than corporations and it will become a major debate then. I foreshadow the fact that my office is doing quite a bit of work about the donation system. I think it is in the public interest that there be analysis of that.
—It is about time you caught up.
—Senator, I am sure the Democrats will be supporting the amendments when, on behalf of the Greens, I bring them into this place further down the line.
I am very concerned about the whole political donations system. I believe that pure democracy is not helped by it at all. I believe it helps the interests of those who are already wealthy against the interests of those who are neither wealthy nor have power. I believe that that in itself is leading to the increased gap between the haves and the have-nots in our nation. We need to face up to it—those who want to defend the system as it is or those of us who feel we can do better to support changes to increase accountability. I believe ultimately we should move away from a donation system to political parties because donations are made with the clear intention of levying political effect and I do not think we should be able to buy political favour. Parliaments exist to debate the public interest and I do not think the public interest is helped by the donation system.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-13,"—The Senate knows that I do not normally raise my voice in this chamber. It is unusual for me to get annoyed, but frankly this contribution by Senator Brown is opportunist and probably affected by the fact that we are being broadcast. Senator Brown has made some very legitimate points and has a legitimate point of view which deserves to be pursued, but in the process he has to add to it a kind of slimy innuendo, a kind of creeping nastiness which, frankly, is very irritating when I know that countless senators in this place, especially in my own party, have fought this issue of accountability for many years and have done a great deal of work on it. I think the legitimate interest he has taken 
 and the issue he raises deserve to be debated and pursued. He is probably quite right; the Democrats may well be supporting that intention because we have a long history of greater exposure of donations. I just find it appalling that you cannot make legitimate points without politicisation and nastiness attached to them.
The point we make is that greater accountability is required from companies in making political donations, as it is required from unions, clubs, trusts and partnerships. That is a very good point to make. But do not in the process smear the Democrats in passing. I am sure the other parties will defend themselves.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-13,"—I want to respond briefly to Senator Brown's intervention in the debate. Of course, all senators are welcome to debate any issue that comes before us. In this debate, we are debating a policy and a piece of legislation that has effectively been in the public domain since January 1997. It has been widely consulted. When I had charge of the portfolio, I gave all senators information about that process—discussion papers, policy papers and draft legislation which was put out in April 1998.
Had Senator Brown taken the same interest as Senator Conroy or Senator Murray, or other people interested in this, at any time in the last 18 months, he could have proposed amendments, if he felt so strongly about changing directors' duties in relation to political donations. He chose not to do that. He has not done the work, and that shows. The sad thing is that he has come in here today to derail the debate that has otherwise been constructive and well informed. I suggest to Senator Brown, if he wants to make a constructive contribution, that he does his homework.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,1999-10-13,"—Since the beginning of civilisation, there have been storytellers and today, 
 as chair of the Senate legislation committee which deals with the arts, I would like to pay a tribute to Morris West, who died at his desk in Sydney last Saturday evening. Morris West was perhaps Australia's most successful storyteller. He wrote 26 books and three plays, selling over 60 million copies worldwide, which were translated into 27 languages. Several of his works were turned into films, including The Devil's Advocate  and The Shoes of the Fisherman .
Morris West was educated at Christian Brothers College in St Kilda and Melbourne University. He joined Christian Brothers in 1933 as a schoolteacher and left after 12 years before taking vows to become a priest. Morris West served in World War II and, following this, he was press secretary to Billy Hughes for a short time in the parliament before working in radio and then moving to Italy, where he further developed his writing skills.
West acquired a great wealth of knowledge and perspective from his variety of experiences, focusing largely on social issues of a moral and religious nature. The Catholic Church remained a powerful factor in Morris West's life and was almost always an important part of the focus of his books, in which he very often portrayed the political intrigue of the inner circles of the Catholic Church. Novelist and critic Laurie Clancy said that West was lucid on issues affecting the Vatican and the papacy's involvement in political affairs.
Many of West's novels anticipated contemporary political events such as The Ambassador in 1965, which dealt with the conflict in Vietnam, The Tower of Babel, which was a story of the politics of the Middle East and was published immediately after the Six-Day War, and The Salamander, which dealt with the renewal of Italian fascism in the early 1970s. More recently in Eminence, published in 1998, West predicted that Cardinal Carlo Martini of Milan will be the next pope. We will have to see whether or not that prediction proves to be correct.
Morris West will be remembered for his religious beliefs and strong views, which influenced many Australians, and, in his own words, as `a man who always carried his 
 country with him'. He was always an Australian and took an Australian point of view about the world around him. He was passionate about self-expression and the pursuit of what individuals believed in. His analysis of world events and social change captured his readers. West's themes encompassed political advice in the context of power, accountability and leadership, and he encouraged public debate on issues of democracy, leadership and the like. In recording West's passing, the Age last Monday quoted Edmund Campion, who wrote:
In his fiction West had been particularly interested in people's power over each other and the tendency of power to corrupt; in both church and state he stood for the rights of the individual voice of conscience . . . He was a committed believer and wanted to assert the rights of a member of the household to speak to the household. And what he spoke of was a profound normal belief in Christian religion, a belief in sacraments, in mass, in prayers and the Bible.
The article continued:
Campion suggested that the prescience of some of his fiction could have originated with his wide circle of contacts. His apartment in Rome was famous for the people you might meet there. There would be politicians, cardinals, newspaper commentators, diplomats, US business people and film people. It must point to the fact that he was very engaged with life—tuned into what was happening in the world.
Morris West was the recipient of a number of accolades and awards, including the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1960; the Royal Society of Literature Heinemann Award, also in 1960; the Dag Hammarskjold Prize in 1978; and the Universe Literary Prize in 1981. He was awarded an AM in 1985 and was elevated to an AO in 1996 for his services to literature.
For me personally, Morris West was the herald of Christmas. This was because his books almost always appeared just before Christmas and, knowing how much I enjoyed the political intrigue and conflicts between idealism and pragmatism which his plots embodied, I was always given a Morris West book for Christmas by my family. Morris West brought his ideas to the masses, not only through his literary works but in speeches, lectures, presentations and work 
 shops to businessmen, universities and literary groups. He assisted in founding the Australian Society of Authors—a writers watchdog organisation—and acted in various roles on the executive of that organisation.
This week the Prime Minister referred to Morris West as the `foremost Australian novelist of his time'. There is no doubt that Morris West was a great Australian who will be warmly remembered in the hearts of many around the world and, I am sure, respected by future generations who come to read his works. Although Morris West the man is no longer with us, the tales of Morris West the storyteller will live on long into the future. So on behalf of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee, I would like to offer condolences to the West family and commend Morris West for his great contribution to the discourse on ideas and issues of the latter part of the 20th century.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,"<title>West, Mr Morris</title>",Matters of Public Interest,3,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-13,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (1999 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1999, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.
I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during this sitting and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
 STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE IN THE 1999 SPRING SITTINGS
FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (1999 BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL
The Bill provides for the implementation of the following measures announced in the 1999 Budget;
.	 simplification of the isolated and secondary student boarder concession,
.	 extension of the definition of `independent employment' for the purposes of the youth allowance Family Actual Means Test:
.	 implementation of decisions relating to data matching;
.	 expansion of eligibility for Student Financial Supplement Loans; and
.	 introduction of new income support arrangements for separated parents sharing care of a child.
As some of the initiatives are to commence on 1 January 2000, it is essential that the enabling legislation be planned in the 1999 Spring Sittings.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-13,"—Madam Deputy President, I appreciate the courtesy you have shown me in this matter. I wish to give notice that, on the next day sitting, I shall move—
—Is leave granted for Senator Murray to give a notice of motion?
—Madam Deputy President, I rise on a point of order which relates to the change to the sessional orders. As you will be aware, senators now have the capacity to either hand these motions in to the clerk or have them read before the chamber. I understand that senators in the chamber are happy to give leave on this occasion, and I certainly never stand in the way of the chamber moving along to deal with these sorts of matters as quickly and expeditiously as possible. But 
 I do make the point that, with the changes to our sessional orders or orders of continuing effect—I am not quite clear, but I think it is standing order 76—there is a capacity for us not to have to do this. That is one of the intentions. However, in this case I understand that it is an important issue, and I think it would be generous of the Senate to give leave to Senator Murray and to Senator Cook, who wants to do the same thing. I have no objection. I just draw that to your attention, Madam Deputy President, because the Procedure Committee looked at some changes to try to ensure that we did not need to have this procedure. On this occasion, having made that minor point, I have no problem with leave being granted, and I am sure other senators in the chamber would be just as generous.
—The Leader of the Opposition is quite right to point that out to me. I wish to state that I do not intend to read the entire notice of motion. I just intend to signal the heading and, with the permission of the Senate, hand it over to the clerk in the normal way. If that is satisfactory, that is what I will do. I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
(1)	 That the following matters be referred to the Economics References Committee for inquiry and report by 3 November 1999:
(a)	 the economic theories, assumptions, calculations, projections, estimates and modelling which underpin the Government's proposals for business taxation reform, contained in the Treasurer's press release no. 58 of 21 September 1999 and in subsequent announcements;
(b)	 whether the package is revenue neutral and, if not, how it could be made revenue neutral;
(c)	 whether there are any uncertainties in the assumptions, costings or implementation of the measures which threaten revenue neutrality, including:
	 (i)	 the realisation assumptions concerning capital gains tax,
	 (ii)	 the potential for income to be converted to capital gains in order to minimise overall tax paid, and
	 (iii)	 the timing or the collection and bring forward of revenue;
(d)	 the effects of the package on future federal budget revenues, expenditures and surpluses, 
 including a critical assessment of the economic and other assumptions underpinning the projections, and an assessment of the effects on other Commonwealth programs of implementing these business tax proposals;
(e)	 the estimated levels of revenue to be generated or forgone due to the proposed changes in business tax and capital gains tax and the basis for those estimates;
(f)	 options for reducing tax avoidance and minimisation;
(g)	 the further effective reduction in the research and development tax concession arising from the package; and
(h)	 such other technical funding matters as the committee considers fall within the scope of this inquiry.

Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to incorporate my tabling statement in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Madam President, the report which I have just tabled concerns the proposed construction of facilities at the CSIRO's Clayton site in Melbourne.
Research complexes at the Clayton site now house the largest concentration of CSIRO scientific expertise in Victoria. The site is the centre of CSIRO research into minerals, forest products, molecular and polymer science, manufacturing science and technology and mathematical and information science.
The proposal examined by the Committee will enable the consolidation of CSIRO's the Divisions of Manufacturing Science and Technology, Mathematics, Information Science, Information Technology Services and Petroleum Resources at Clayton.
This consolidation will enable CSIRO to vacate sites at Preston and Syndal, freeing up these sites for sale.
It will also relocate staff and resources from leased premises.
The extent of the proposal will provide nearly 7,000 square metres gross floor area of new building accommodation, together with another 7,000 square metres of refurbishment in an existing laboratory complex. The scope of the proposed works will provide laboratories, offices, process and technical bays, research support facilities and staff amenities.
It will provide modern scientific research facilities for over 370 staff.
When referred to the Committee, the estimated cost of the project was $28 million.
The Committee has recommended that the project should proceed.
In arriving at this recommendation, the Committee has concluded that since 1961, substantial investments have been made by the Commonwealth in the construction of major CSIRO research laboratory complexes at Clayton.
A number of elements of research Divisions, in particular Manufacturing Science and Technology and Petroleum Resources remain at other centres within the Melbourne metropolitan area in properties owned or leased by CSIRO.
Capacity remains at the Clayton site for further collocation and rationalisation of research activities.
This rationalisation would result in reduced overheads and realise proceeds from property sales for investment in new and upgraded research facilities at Clayton.
It would also facilitate interaction between research groups and between Divisions, cooperative research centres and staff and post-graduate students from 
 Monash University which is located adjacent to the Clayton site.
In property terms, sites at Preston and Syndal and leased premises at Carlton and Clayton could be vacated and staff relocated to Clayton.
On this basis, the Committee concluded that a need therefore exists to provide additional research facilities at the Clayton site for more than 370 CSIRO staff.
The Committee has also concluded that the scope of the proposed development includes refurbished and new accommodation at a standard commensurate with modern research requirements and on a scale consistent with the number of staff to be employed.
The scope of the project can also be justified as making adaptive reuse of refurbished buildings with new construction reflecting contemporary generic research facilities already provided at other sites.
There is capacity for expansion.
Two matters need to be addressed by the CSIRO. First, the Committee has recommended that the need for stainless steel downpipes proposed for the refurbished David Rivett Building should be reviewed.
Secondly, the Committee has recommended that the CSIRO should develop a master plan for the further development of the site which will avoid costly removal of existing facilities and infrastructure.
I commend the report to the Senate.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-13,"—As the shadow minister advised the House of Representatives this morning, Labor will act today to save the $2 billion Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme. We said yesterday that we were committed to facilitating the ACIS Administration Bill 1999  and today we will deliver on that commitment. We are doing this because Senator Minchin has managed to get himself caught on a hook from which he cannot get off. We 
 will get Senator Minchin off the hook. He should have but we will.
Senator Minchin is on this hook because of his own failure to act on this bill. He has known for five months that he had a problem—that we were proposing a review of ACIS before it was to cease. We moved these amendments five months ago in the House of Representatives, but Senator Minchin did nothing. He had no discussions with us until the very last minute. I do not think he had any discussions with the Democrats at all. He should not pretend, as he has been doing, that we had come up with some last minute opposition to this bill. He knows that is not true. He had five months to consider, discuss and negotiate about the timing of the proposed review. He knows that we have not opposed any other aspect of the package. Why should we? It was through our efforts from opposition that the government even agreed to it in the first place.
Unfortunately, Senator Minchin has spent the last five months trying to save the Queen. He should have been spending it trying to save the car industry. Senator Minchin reacted only when the ACIS bill got to the Senate—far too late. So it was Senator Minchin, not us, who put doubt on the future of the ACIS package by not dealing with sensible amendments and sitting on his hands for five months. What was our amendment? We debated it yesterday. We want to have a review of ACIS before it ends—hardly revolutionary stuff. In fact, by any objective measure, this is eminently sensible. Instead, we will now be left with the absurd position where there will be a review of a scheme after the scheme has already ended—talk about putting the cart before the horse! It is a bit like debating Charles's suitability as the future King of Australia after we have become a republic. I can see how Senator Minchin would be emotionally, if not intellectually, committed to that debate. I cannot see why he should apply such nonsense to such an important industry as the car industry. It is this absurd outcome which shows that Senator Minchin has been prepared to jeopardise and play politics with this important scheme. I want to make it perfectly clear that Labor 
 would still like ACIS to be reviewed before its completion date of 2005. The only way this will now happen is by the election of a Labor government.",SENATE,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Messages</title>,Bills,24,1

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1999-10-13,"—I will resist the temptation to indulge in the childish politics to which Senator Conroy seeks to have this debate reduced by bringing in nefarious and other subjects. I want to be as gracious as I possibly can and thank the Labor Party and the Democrats for recognising the importance to the car industry of the ACIS Administration Bill 1999  proceeding forthwith on the basis announced by the government over 2½ years ago. This is a package which is terrific news for the car industry. It does set it up for the 21st century. I am extremely confident that, once it is law, we will have a highly successful, productive, export oriented, automobile industry in this country with a great future.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I guess I can only make one final plea to the 
 Democrats on this issue. Yesterday, in an answer to a dorothy dixer from his own backbench, Mr Costello said:
. . . 32 per cent of Australians directly own shares. In the sale of the first tranche of Telstra, 560,000 Australians purchased shares . . . something like 75 per cent of Telstra employees took up shares.
He went on to say that 31 per cent of Australians now own shares. This is the sort of revolution that began under the Labor government and has continued under the coalition government. These are the sorts of mum and dad shareholders that the Labor Party is trying to protect today.
As I have already mentioned, we have a proposition before us that waters down protections for shareholders. Shareholders, not directors, are actually the owners of companies. Directors are the employees of the shareholders. Business Judgment Rule 2C says that directors have to inform themselves about the subject matter of the judgment to the extent that they reasonably believe to be appropriate. The key there is `inform themselves.' `Inform themselves' is not the same as what has been through the court system. Judges have ruled on these matters, and these are their words: `They should bring an informed and independent judgment to bear on the various matters that come to the board for decision.' That is Rogers in AWA Limited v. Daniels. So the courts have said independent judgment is critical to competent and responsible management. And this bill, as it stands before us today, clearly states:
A director or other officer of a corporation who makes a business judgment is taken to meet the requirements of subsection (1), and their equivalent duties at common law and in equity, in respect of the judgment if they:
. . .              . . .             . . .
(c)	 inform themselves about the subject matter of the judgment to the extent they reasonably believe to be appropriate;
This is not the same as the government's touted press releases on this issue and the statements from the parliamentary secretary. The whole thrust, they told us, was `We want to codify what is in the law now'. What is in the law now, protecting hundreds of thousands of ordinary Australians and their 
 shareholdings, are judgments like the AWA v. Daniels case in 1992 which say that a director should bring an informed and independent judgment to bear. That is not what is written in this legislation. It is not possible to argue that the words `inform themselves about the subject matter of the judgment to the extent they reasonably believe to be appropriate' is the same as `bring an informed and independent judgment to bear'. These are clearly different legal concepts.
This parliament would be letting down the hundreds of thousands of Australians that the Treasurer touted as recently as yesterday, and it would be watering down the protections that they have and their ability to seek accountability from the people they employ to manage their funds. I implore the Democrats to reconsider their position on this, because it is clear that the words in this bill are not the same as the codifications and the principles that the courts of this country have been establishing for the last 30 years.
As I said, this is really just a last plea to the Democrats to reconsider. They will not be proud in the future when ordinary Australians lose their life savings, their shares and their shareholder value. I urge the Democrats: reconsider on this issue. It is very important to the future of hundreds of thousands of ordinary, battling Australians—mums and dads—that they are able to call to account their employees and their directors if they see the need to.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-13,"—While Senator Conroy was talking I was reminded of the managed investments bill debate, when I and the Democrats thought that dire things would happen if a particular amendment of ours was not accepted—which have not happened yet, thankfully—and Labor disagreed with us. We had to wear it. At the heart of your proposition is your belief that things will get worse as a result of this and that fairly dire consequences will result. Our judgment is that it does not make it worse, although we do understand your argument and whence it comes. So I regret that, despite an informed plea from you, Senator Conroy, we will 
 continue with our position of supporting the government on this issue.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I will just briefly respond that I appreciate the points Senator Murray makes and simply say to him that, as he would probably remember, the MIB debate was quite lengthy and that I gave a speech that was probably more supportive of Senator Murray's position than the one we finally adopted. But I say to Senator Murray that a number of the things, a lot of the issues, he raised and that I also raised in that debate are coming to pass. People are worse off because that bill was passed. I know that Senator Murray will be looking forward to the review where we will be able to test a number of the assertions that were put to the committee in the MIA, or the MIB as it now is. When that review comes up, it will show that the people involved in these investments are actually worse off because we passed that bill. Many of them have had amendments to their structures that have actually been slipped through on this bill and that are to their detriment.
There were promised fee savings—and I am sure Senator Murray knows this. But, not only are fees not going down; a broad range of managed investment fees are going up. And I see you nodding, Senator Murray. Both you and I have been talking to the same people. It has been public. It has been in newspapers that not only have there been excessive increases when there should have been decreases but also the structures of managed investments have been changed, and parts of constitutions or the equivalents of constitutions have been changed in some quite outrageous ways. I think that the issues Senator Murray raised, and I raised to a lesser degree in my contributions in that debate, are coming to pass. So I would urge, Senator Murray, that you and I were probably right last time, and I think that in a couple of years you will have to concede that we were right this time.
—The question is that opposition amendment No. 1 on sheet 1414 be agreed to.
	 Question put.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-13,"—by leave—I move:
(2)	 Schedule 1, item 1, page 4 (line 27) to page 5 (line 4), omit subsection (1), substitute:
Good faith—directors and other officers
	 (1)	 A director or other officer of a corporation must exercise their powers and discharge their duties: 

		 (a)	 in good faith in the best interests of the corporation; and
		 (b)	 with due regard to, and active consideration of, all relevant issues and information; and
		 (c)	 for a proper purpose.
		 Note 1:	 This subsection is a civil penalty provision (see section 1317E).
		 Note 2:	 Section 187 deals with the situation of directors of wholly-owned subsidiaries.
(38)	 Schedule 5, item 11, page 436 (line 28) to page 437 (line 3), omit subsection (1), substitute:
Good faith—officers
	 (1)	 An officer of a Commonwealth authority must exercise his or her powers and discharge his or her duties:
		 (a)	 in good faith in the best interests of the Commonwealth; and
		 (b)	 with due regard to, and active consideration of, all relevant issues and information; and
		 (c)	 for a proper purpose.
		 Note 1:	 This subsection is a civil penalty provision (see Schedule 2).
		 Note 2:	 Section 187 of the Corporations Law  deals with the position of directors of wholly-owned subsidiaries of Commonwealth authorities.
These amendments relate to the provisions that define the concept of good faith as it pertains to directors' duties. The opposition's amendments in this regard are minor but ultimately important. The opposition's first amendment in this area ensures that good faith under civil obligation reflects the full responsibilities of directors as laid down by the courts and corrects the subjective test of the provision which requires directors to exercise their powers and discharge their duties in what they believe to be in the company's interests.
In addition, as the courts have acknowledged that good faith must be accompanied by appropriate informed judgments, we wish this view to be reflected in the legislation. The government has maintained that its efforts  on defining directors' duties are purely to codify common law, so why not stick to the definition as clearly set out by the courts? 
 Good faith not based on informed judgment injects new doubt as to the meaning of the term. Good faith not based on informed judgment will be taken by directors to be a new lower benchmark in their responsibilities. Moreover, it will send a message to the courts that this is the preferred definition. Like the business judgment rule, the good faith civil obligation provision does not encourage directors to be actively involved in guiding and monitoring the management of a company.
The government is setting a lower standard for directors in the governance of companies. This is totally inappropriate because it would encourage directors to be less prudent in their decision making. If the government is sincere about clearly reflecting common law in statute, then it should support our amendment in this regard.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-13,"—Senator Conroy's presentation was shorter than I expected. Given the rather lengthy and quite strong discussion he and I had, I must say that Senator Conroy knows well how to argue his corner both privately and publicly. Once again these amendments have been delivered with the right intention in mind, but we have some reservations. These two amendments relate to the obligation of good faith which is cast on directors and specifically the obligation which, if reached, will give rise to civil rather than criminal liability. The effect of the amendments is to add a requirement into the good faith obligation that directors must exercise their powers with due regard to—and this is the important area—and active consideration of all relevant issues and information.
At first glance that sounds very reasonable; however, we have problems for two reasons. Firstly, the obligation of good faith is about acting in the best interests of a corporation and acting for a proper purpose. The obligation of good faith is not about diligence or consideration of all issues. In other words, it is about an attitude not about performance. It is my view that the substance of the amendment which the Labor Party has moved would be better dealt with as an amendment to obligation to act with care and diligence 
 rather than duty of good faith, because active consideration of issues is a matter of diligence rather than good faith.
Secondly, we would be concerned that the active consideration of all relevant issues requirement would open up a Pandora's box in terms of interpretation. If you imagine a judge who is a stickler for black letter law, he or she might interpret this very widely indeed. He would ask himself or she would ask herself: what precisely does `active consideration of all relevant issues' mean? Does `active consideration of all issues' mean that a full due diligence exercise needs to be conducted of the type that is conducted prior to the issue of prospectuses, with all the consequent costs attached to that? To what length does a director have to go to inform himself or herself of all the relevant issues? There is no reference to information which is reasonably within reach and to reasonable judgment in these matters.
The interpretation of the expression `the active consideration of all relevant issues' opens the door to a very wide interpretation as to what an average director would have to do to satisfy that obligation. As I have remarked, we believe that the duty of care and diligence combined with the business judgment rule impose an appropriate duty on directors. In fact, part of the business judgment rule requires directors to inform themselves about the subject matter of the judgment. Any reasonable judiciary would regard that as a proper informing process—in other words, one having due regard to the appropriate information. Because of that and because these particular sections have been widely discussed and reviewed, we think that on balance, despite the good intention of the shadow minister, we cannot support these amendments.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I just want to respond again to Senator Murray. I appreciate that he believes we are acting with the right motives. I am again, however, disappointed that he fears the words  `informed judgment'. As I indicated in my last contribution, independent judgment is at the heart of a string of court cases in which judges have said that it is not good enough to 
 just say, `I acted in good faith,' and to not make an informed judgment or seek to get information. There is a legal understanding of informed judgment—there is an agreed set of principles about informed judgment which courts have ruled on for 30 years.
I am not looking to second-guess what the courts have done previously and the courts have not sought to second-guess business decisions. To argue that informed judgment is something that directors, average or otherwise, should be afraid of is a cop-out. Directors are not the owners. Directors are there to provide the management skills—that is why they are employed. When they do not have those skills and they choose not to make an informed judgment, it is not good enough to say that that is constraining them, that they should be able to avoid scrutiny and that they can avoid liability. Again, I would urge the Democrats to reconsider their position on this. Good faith that is not based on informed judgment is an entirely new, lower benchmark for the courts to be told to apply. I do not understand why the government believes that it wants uninformed judgments to be able to pass through under the guise of good faith. I would be interested in a small contribution from Senator Ian Campbell on this matter.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-13,"—I am happy to contribute; it is a very important matter. The government's views have been grossly misrepresented. Good faith under common law does ensure that directors have to inform themselves, but what the Labor amendments seek to do is significantly increase the requirement under the current law. All we are doing, I think it is fair to say, is maintaining the existing requirements to act in good faith in a law that stayed in place for the 13 years of the Labor government through a whole range of corporate law reviews undertaken by a series of committees, including one chaired by Senator Barney Cooney and another chaired by Mr Michael Lavarch, former chair of the House of Representatives committee. 
I remind the Senate that the committee excellently chaired by Senator Cooney and the committee that reported in November 1991 and that was excellently chaired by Michael Lavarch, who supported Senator Cooney's recommendations in relation to the business judgment rule and directors' duties, without reservation supported the business judgment rule—which the Labor Party today have just voted against—and did not seek in any way to change the definition of good faith in the Corporations Law.
As Senator Murray has very accurately said, this would significantly increase the requirements on directors in terms of consideration of all relevant issues and information—it would be a significant increase in what directors would have to do. As Senator Murray quite properly said, it would mean that a prudent director, in order to protect his or her own legal position, would have to undertake due diligence in relation to every matter of relevance to the company. It is an inane proposal.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I have conferred with other senators in the chamber. I would now like to move a further amendment to section 181, line 30, `Good faith—civil obligations', in the following terms. No. (1)(a) currently reads `in good faith in what they believe to be in the best interests of the corporation'. I will be moving an amendment to delete the words `in what they believe to be', so the sentence will read `in good faith in the best interests of the corporation'. This is, I believe, an important amendment. Again, it only sounds like a few words, but it actually takes this test and turns it from a subjective test into an objective test, which I believe is a substantial improvement. I welcome the Democrats' support for this and I thank them for it.
—Senator Conroy, I am sorry to interrupt you, but may we deal with your amendments that are actually before the chair first and then deal next with the subsequent amendment to which you are referring.
—We are just writing it up now.
—By that stage, we will then have your amendment in writing. So the question before the chair at the moment is that opposition amendments Nos 2 and 38 moved by Senator Conroy be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-10-13,"—I support the opposition amendments. I note that there is concern from the government and the Democrats that the test that a director or officer of a corporation must exercise their powers and discharge their duties with due regard to an act of consideration of all relevant issues and information is too tough a test. There is a further amendment coming down the line. I have not heard that the opposition has withdrawn this particular component in response to—
—Senator Brown, the opposition has not withdrawn either amendment.
—Yes, that is my understanding, too.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-13,"—If I can clarify it for Senator Brown's information, we will continue with our existing amendment. When that is defeated, as the Democrats have indicated it will be, we will then move this further amendment which goes some way towards satisfying some of our concerns.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-10-13,"—That is as I understood it, too. I thank Senator Conroy for that. I think it is very important that the chamber does support the Labor amendment in full. Why should directors and chief executive officers, some of whom these days are getting $3 million, $4 million or $5 million a year, not have due regard to and take active consideration of all the relevant issues and information when they make decisions on behalf of their corporations? Of course they should. There are harder tests than that for many a public servant. If it is good enough for the public sector, then it is good enough for the private sector.
This morning I raised the matter of political donations. Under current rules, I think the good faith of directors is not required to be exercised on behalf of the company, at least 
 in a way which is stated on the balance sheet when it comes to making political donations. These are made frequently. They add up to tens of millions of dollars. They are made to political parties without any written commitment but with the expectation that there will be some advantage to the corporation for having made that donation. I believe this matter should be referred to shareholders, and the chief executive officers involved should have to point out what exactly it is that they expect to get in return. As I said this morning, I believe the system is corrupting.
The provision here—the government provision which is supported by the Democrats—that a director or other officer of a corporation must exercise their powers and discharge their duties in good faith in what they believe to be in the best interests of the corporation I believe allows anything to go. In a court of law a director or chief executive officer has to establish that she or he believed it to be in the best interests of the corporation. That is a free run. We need a much tighter provision. We need much more clarification in the corporate law for the directors and officers involved. Good faith of itself is a direction, but it is not as specific. The Labor amendment is actually very minor, but it does tighten up what is meant by `good faith' or what is required of a director or other officer acting in good faith. I support it.
I note that Senator Conroy has flagged a further amendment if this one fails, and that is to remove the loophole allowing directors and senior corporate officers to say, `Well, we acted in good faith because we thought we were acting in the interests of the corporation.' Could you imagine any director or CEO going to a court and saying, `I thought I was acting against the interests of the corporation'? Of course they are not going to. You cannot get into the mind of such a person to establish the truth or otherwise; you have to  accept their word. So this provision as it stands allows anything that goes. All the director or CEO has to be able to say is, `Oh, when I did it, of course I thought it was in the best interests of the corporation. Of course I thought giving myself a package of $1 million per annum was in the interests of the 
 corporation because it would raise my work output. Of course I thought that giving a donation to this or that political party was in the interests of the corporation because it would help the political party that we favour get into power.' These things need a much stronger test than that.
As I said this morning on the second matter, political donations, when the government brings in more relevant legislation, flagged for later this year, I will be moving that the views of shareholders have to be canvassed before corporate donations are made. I will be interested to hear whether the government thinks that isn't a matter of good faith towards shareholders in this country. Of course it is, but the government will say that it believes it is not necessary to make such a provision. They will use the very loophole that is in this legislation now to get off the hook in defending the huge political donations made to political parties from the corporate sector in the interests of currying favour, but against the interests of shareholders in the main. So I support the Labor amendment.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I thank Senator Brown for a very clear description of what the government had been seeking to achieve. I thank him for setting that out. I suspect I see some legal training in there somewhere. I do not have any, which is readily apparent. The Labor Party will proceed, as I said earlier, with our original amendment. We believe that our original amendment covers all the sorts of issues that Senator Brown has just so clearly outlined. We still hope that the Democrats could see their way to supporting this, although we accept that it appears that the numbers are against us on this one. As I have foreshadowed, we have an amendment, which I believe is agreed to now by all parties. So I would not want to delay the chamber any further on this.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I move:
Schedule 1, item 1, page 4, (line 30), omit `in what they believe to be'.
I thank all senators for their support on this. I think that is what has been indicated by the 
 government. It is a small but important change again which takes a subjective test and makes it an objective test. This is an important change in a court because, as Senator Brown so clearly indicated, what director would ever stand up and say: `I didn't think it was in the interests of the company'? Given that that now appears to be supported by all parties, I will not waste any more time in the chamber on it.
Amendment agreed to.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-13,"—by leave—I move opposition amendments Nos 3, 4 and 39:
(3)	 Schedule 1, item 1, page 6 (lines 8 to 16), omit subsection (1), substitute:
Good faith—directors and other officers
	 (1)	 A director or other officer of a corporation commits an offence if they:

		 (d)	 for a proper purpose.
		 Note:	 Section 187 deals with the situation of directors of wholly-owned subsidiaries.
(4)	 Schedule 1, item 1, page 9 (lines 23 and 24), omit subparagraph (b)(ii), substitute:
			 (ii)	 after making an independent assessment of the information or advice, having regard to the director's knowledge of the corporation and the complexity of the structure and operations of the corporation; and
(39)	 Schedule 5, item 11, page 438 (lines 10 to 20), omit subsection (1), substitute:
Good faith—officers
	 (1)	 An officer of a Commonwealth authority commits an offence if he or she:
		 (a)	 is intentionally reckless; or
		 (b)	 is intentionally dishonest;
		 and fails to exercise his or her powers and discharge his or her duties:
		 (c)	 in good faith in what he or she believes to be in the best interests of the Commonwealth authority; or
		 (d)	 for a proper purpose. 

		 Note:	 Section 187 of the Corporations Law deals with the position of directors of wholly-owned subsidiaries of Commonwealth authorities.
		 Penalty:	 Imprisonment for 5 years.
The opposition's amendments to the `good faith' criminal obligation are designed to ensure that the proposed law would clearly distinguish what is intentionally dishonest and intentionally reckless. Also, we are putting forward an amendment that would ensure that the defence based on reliance of expert advice would apply only if the director applied independent judgments. These amendments are consistent with the decisions of the courts. They are well established and accepted judgments. These amendments ensure that the government's attempt at codification of the common law will indeed bring clarity, as opposed to uncertainty and complexity. It is with a great deal of hope that the opposition's amendments will have the desired impact and will avert a wave of mismanagement that might sweep across Australia's corporate landscape.
To put it in simple terms, the government is proposing  for directors to be able to say: `I received advice from my lawyer, I received advice from my accountant and they told me to do this, so I did it.' I believe it to be a complete and utter cop-out on behalf of the government to allow such a defence to be put up in court and for it to be successful. I am still amazed that the government even put this forward. I believe the Democrats, and possibly Senator Brown, may be supporting these amendments. So I look forward to the government's contribution to explain its position and, hopefully, the contribution of the minor parties.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-13,"—I thought it would be good to put the government's position on the record first because the Democrats might want to comment on the two sides of the argument. The government is opposed to these provisions, particularly the wording of the amendment in relation to recklessness. The amendment moved by the opposition seeks to put into the provisions 
 relating to good faith the words `intentionally reckless' or `intentionally dishonest'. Any plain English reading of this would effectively render it nonsensical and, therefore, unworkable. It is by definition impossible to be intentionally reckless. Our legal advice is that the effect of making this change would be to lower the burden of proof, lower the requirements, on a director. Because of its nonsensicality and therefore unworkability it would be virtually impossible to make out a case and achieve a guilty verdict.
The burden of proof is for the prosecution to prove that a director has been intentionally reckless before they can be found guilty. As I have said, this is actually a watering down of the current standard of good faith. So we are strongly opposed to this. We think that it is a significant reduction in the balance between shareholders' rights and directors' duties. It is a significant watering down of the directors' duties under these provisions.
In relation to (4), the reliance on information provision, this amendment is unnecessary and could defeat the whole purpose of the main provision, which is to allow directors to rely on experts where it is reasonable to do so. Clearly a court could not find it acceptable for a director to blindly rely on expert advice where the circumstances may indicate that the advice is unreliable.
The government is very strongly opposed to these provisions. We think that in the very important balancing act in the incredible array of discussions that have taken place, not only in the last two years but also—and I do not say this at all flippantly—in all of the discussions on directors' duties, the common law development of directors' duties and the development of the black letter law that has  occurred through those committees, such as the Cooney committee in 1989 and the Lavarch committee in 1991, you are always trying to find a way to ensure that both the common law and the black letter law in the statute impose very important obligations upon directors who do have that fiduciary responsibility. The government's advice to the Senate is that this wording would significantly 
 reduce a director's obligations under the law because it is nonsensical and unworkable.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-13,"—Before I come to a view on this matter, I would like to ask the minister two questions arising from the remarks he has made. Parliamentary secretary, I am not sure whether you would remember a famous daredevil American called Evel Knievel. Evel Knievel was likely a corporation in his own right because he earned a great deal of money doing extraordinary stunts. I would suggest to you that any person would have regarded what Evel Knievel did as intentionally reckless. I do not know how else you would describe somebody who went whizzing over ravines and canyons all in the interests of earning money for his corporation. The reason I raise such an example is that, as I was sitting here, it was the only example which jumped to mind of the potential for somebody to be legally defined as intentionally reckless. I would have some difficulty in imagining a judge could not view the actions of somebody like Evel Knievel as reckless and intentionally so. He did it to raise money. I do see that there is a link in those words, but he was not dishonest in doing that.
Quite frankly, if I had money invested in the Evel Knievel corporation, I would want him to limit the extent of his intentional recklessness so that, if he was going to jump over buses, he should jump over 50 buses, not 100.
—But being reckless was his business; that's the difference.
—Well, we are dealing here with Corporations Law, which is why I have introduced it. What I am trying to do is to give you an example of a situation where I could conceive that lawyers would be capable of defining `intentional recklessness'.
The second question I have related to your remarks is that in the Labor Party's amendment they use the words `intentionally reckless'. In amendment (3)(1) they say:
A director or other officer of a corporation commits an offence if they:
(a)	 are intentionally reckless; or
(b)	 are intentionally dishonest. 

I would have thought, if you have problems with the word `intentionally' attached to `reckless', you would have the same problems attached to `dishonest'. So I would like to know whether that is a problem for you as well because I cannot conceive of anybody being dishonest unintentionally. Surely you have to have an intention to be dishonest. The problem may in fact be Labor's addition of the word `intentionally'. My question to you is: would you accept the Labor amendments if the word `intentionally' were dropped from both the reckless and the dishonest subclauses? While I can see that somebody could be intentionally reckless, I suspect it would be a tautology to believe they could be anything other than intentionally dishonest. To be dishonest is an intention. I hope that fairly lengthy exposition is clear to you. I would like your response to those remarks.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-13,"—I am happy to respond because I think it is important. The Evel Knievel example makes the point that a lot of people could try to copy Mr Knievel and would simply just be reckless—they may be slightly intentionally reckless. At the moment, a director just has to be reckless and gets himself off the hook if he is not intentionally reckless. So we are significantly reducing the standard of behaviour that is required of directors. To answer the question, I think the word `intentionally' is nowhere near as problematic when it is attached to the word `dishonest'. It does not change things so much.
The government is opposed to fiddling with the wording here because there is a balance that has been sought in all of these changes with the business judgment rule and the statutory derivative action. There are a series of balances and, when you slightly tamper with words that relate to duties of directors, you can collapse a set of dominoes that could end up in a serious undermining of the law. I am informed by my legal eagle experts that the word `reckless' is something that has had a legal definition that has been built up in case law over 100 years. To then attach the 
 word `intentionally' to it would necessarily significantly change that body of law in relation to good faith and directors.
The key point is that to be reckless is the test at the moment. To then say to the court that it must also prove that a person has been intentionally reckless makes it a lot easier for a director to get off the hook. He or she could say, `I admit to the court that I was reckless. I was totally reckless. I flew the company motorbike over the Grand Canyon. That was totally reckless. But I did not intend to do it. I was actually trying to drive along the road. I took the wrong turn and I went over the Grand Canyon. It was not my intention to be reckless.' A director says, `Yes, I was reckless; I didn't intend to be', and he is off the hook. That is the point I seek to make. That is why the government regards this as a serious undermining of the duties that the law puts on directors at the moment.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,1999-10-13,"—Perhaps I am a little more perplexed now. As I understood the parliamentary secretary's earlier submission, he was saying that it was a nonsensical provision when you put the two together. Then after Senator Murray's additions his position appears to have changed. He is now arguing that it would be a watering down, or at least a different reflection upon it, or someone might then get off. The parliamentary secretary then mentioned that he had it on some authority that it was a nonsensical provision—in other words, that you cannot put `intentionally reckless' together in the same phrase. I wonder what authority he was relying on when he made that statement.
As I understand it, a person can be intentionally reckless. I am open to persuasion in that respect, but some of the case law that I can recall in the law of negligence was where a person—I cannot remember the name of the case—might drive a car without a steering wheel and choose to use a pair of pliers to do the steering. In using the pair of pliers to do the steering, one would regard that the person intended to steer the vehicle and continue on their way. But it was reckless: there was an intention to be reckless in respect of that matter. That is as I understand the situation. 
 The amendment does not necessarily water it down. I would be pleased to receive a response to the issue that I raised about what the parliamentary secretary was relying on when he said that this was a nonsensical provision.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-13,"—The nonsensicality of it is that the person driving the car would be judged, under the existing provisions in this law, to be reckless. If you are trying to impose a standard on a director, it is nonsensical if you have to prove that he had some intention to do it. Why would you want to do that? Why would you want to reduce the standard of duty of care and the standard of good faith on a director? Senator Ludwig and I agree that getting into a corporate vehicle—taking the analogy—and driving with a pair of pliers would be reckless, unless they were a damned good pair of pliers and were not going to slip, and he had a pretty steady head. Any judge in the land would say that was reckless. So why, if you are seeking—as everyone seems to be around this chamber—to make sure that directors act in good faith and have a duty of care, would you then say to a court that needs to impose that duty of care on those directors, `We are going to lift the bar. You actually have to prove that he had an intention'? Why do that?",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-13,"—Unfortunately, I am not a lawyer—or fortunately, depending on your perspective. There are a number of discussions taking place around the chamber to clarify the legal points.  I am not sure whether Senator Campbell is a lawyer by training. No; he is shaking his head.
—I just hire them when I need them.
—Fair enough. We are concerned that, on this issue, you may be under a misapprehension in the way you have described this as a `watering down'. We are not sure that that is the case in terms of legal text and legal position. It may be useful to move on while some discussions place. I yield to Senator Murray on that, if he has a view.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-13,"—Through the chair: Parliamentary Secretary, I think you make some good points. Whilst I think there is a case for people being intentionally reckless—using my example—nevertheless, I do not think it adds anything and may take away, as you have outlined, from the ability to pin a director for offences. The Labor Party amendment would be improved if it just said `(a) are reckless' rather than `(a) are intentionally reckless'. I do not think we lose anything with that. With regard to paragraph (b) of the Labor Party's amendment, I believe that putting `intentionally' next to `dishonest' does not make any sense because you are either dishonest or you are not. So I would drop `intentionally' there too. As your advisers know, we have previously indicated to the Labor Party that we have sympathy with its amendment because we believe it captures all the elements of the government's amendment but has an improved layout.
There are many phrases in both amendments which are exactly similar to phrases in the bill, but the differences are in the presentation of the government's first sentence. The Labor amendment isolates those items and presents them sequentially. That is a matter of style, but we felt it gave greater impact. The Labor amendment then proceeds to include the rest of your intention. So unless the government has a strong and vigorous opposition to it, we would suggest that the Labor amendment—with the deletion of the words `intentionally'—improves both the layout and presentation of the government's clause in the bill without losing any of the strength of it. I would suggest the very valid point Senator Campbell has made about the word `intentionally' should be accepted by the Labor Party, and the word should be deleted.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I should indicate that, following the discussions, we would happily accept an amendment from Senator Murray that removed the word `intentionally' from our amendments in both those lines. If Senator Murray wanted to move that way following a discussion, we would happily accept that amendment.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-13,"—I think I should therefore move an amendment to the Labor Party amendment and see if the Senate would accept it.
—We will get it in writing. I understand that you want to remove the word `intentionally' wherever it is mentioned in schedule 3.
—Yes. Let me be specific for Hansard .
—Sorry; in amendment (3) and amendment (39).
—Yes. It is on sheet 1414. It is amendments (3) and (39). In amendment (3), the word `intentionally' appears in (1)(a) and (1)(b) and should be removed. In amendment (39), it also appears in (1)(a) and (1)(b) and should be removed. I therefore move an amendment to the Labor amendment:
Omit ""intentionally reckless"", substitute ""reckless"" (wherever occurring).",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-13,"—Could I indicate the government's position? It is important. The government would support taking the word `intentionally' out where it appears before the word `reckless'. We do not support taking it out in relation to `dishonest'. Our advice is that `intentionally dishonest' has an important legal meaning, as does `reckless'. It is not the word `intentionally' that we are worried about. We think people with intentions are good people. But we believe that the standard remains high if you remove the word `intentionally' from before `reckless' and you leave it there before `dishonest'.
I hope I will not need to speak again if I say this: the government regards this tinkering as incredibly dangerous. We are opposed to the provision even as amended. We continue to have serious reservations about it but we will not seek to divide on it. In other words, as long as we leave the second `intentionally' in there, we agree that what is happening is a significant improvement; yet we still regard 
 it as a dangerous change. But we will not divide on the issue and we would be less unhappy to see the word `intentionally' in the first instance removed.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-13,"—I want to make it clear that this is not tinkering on the run. As the advisers and the minister know, these matters have been discussed at length prior to this. The Labor Party's amendment was circulated to the government. Obviously, other senators have the option to decide whether to support them or not. But this is not on the run. I am aware that the Labor Party's amendment has long been known to both the government and ourselves.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-13,"—I want to make the point that, to the extent that this has been around, the government has always made its strong opposition known. It has not been considered by any expert committee, such as CASAC. No outside organisations have been consulted, contrary to what  has happened with all changes to directors' duties that have been made in the Corporations Law in at least the last 15 years. Making changes in this way is potentially very dangerous. But the Senate has a democratic right to do this. The government will have to make a decision when we see the shape of the final bill. But I am just making it very clear that we will not divide on this. We think that the amendment that is going to be made is an improvement, yet we still have significant reservations about it. I would be very happy to see it put to a vote and move to the next issue.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-13,"—I will just make one last point. If your viewpoint is valid, it is up to the government to have discussions with the ALP. You have the opportunity within the House of Representatives to look at this matter further, and I am sure they would be willing to do that.
—Can I clarify one thing I need to know? Are you now moving that you remove the word `intentionally' from (1)(a) where it relates to 
 `reckless' but not where it relates to `dishonest'?
—Yes, that is my amendment.
—So in opposition amendments (3) and (39), in (1)(a) the word `intentionally' is removed where it appears before `reckless' but it stays where it appears before `dishonest'.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I do not want to take too much of Senator Campbell's time on this point. We need to move along. The Labor Party has come to a considered position in putting the words `intentionally dishonest' in the amendments that have been proposed. I was curious about your reversal of that originally. As I understand it, you can in fact be intentionally dishonest and you can be dishonest without intent. That has always been my understanding of it. But the matters you raised were effectively that you could not be that. I am curious as to why you have now reversed your position in respect of that. On what basis have you done so?",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-13,"—If it seems to anyone that I have reversed my position, I did not mean to. My position always was that I was concerned about the word in relation to `reckless'. That has always been my advice. But if it seemed to anyone that I had mentioned both `intentionally dishonest' and `intentionally reckless', then I apologise for the lack of clarity in my remarks.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I just wanted to point out to Senator Ian Campbell—and I think Senator Murray has made this point—that both Senator Murray and I have been burnt by Senator Ian Campbell's interpretations on matters before the chamber. These amendments were circulated and debated in the House of Representatives on 3 June—that is, some four months ago. It would be disappointing if people tried to portray these as last-minute amendments when the last minute was four months ago.
I personally circulated these amendments some time ago—three or four weeks ago—to IFSA and to the Australian Institute of Company Directors.
—And I opposed them and opposed them.
—There is a difference between discussion and whether or not people agree. The argument that you have previously burnt Senator Murray and me with—and you seem to be beginning to set up the debate again—is that these are last-minute amendments that no-one has looked at. These are amendments that people have looked at. If they do not agree with them, that is a different argument from trying to portray these as last-minute amendments.
It would be very disappointing if the government sought, as they did more than 12 months ago, to portray amendments that have been on the table for some months, but that the government did not agree with, as being last minute. I do not mind you saying you do not agree with them, I do not mind the company directors saying they do not agree with them and I do not mind IFSA saying they do not agree with them. What I object to very strongly is the sort of campaign that was waged against both Senator Murray and me over 12 months ago saying that these were last-minute amendments by the chamber. This is not the case.
These amendments have been tabled in parliament for four months. I personally wrote to IFSA and the AICD some weeks ago when they appeared not to have seen them, despite them being on the public record for a number of months. I just wanted to make the point that, if Senator Ian Campbell is looking to try to run that campaign, the Hansard and parliamentary record will show that that is incorrect.
I also want to indicate that we would support the withdrawal of `intentionally' in both cases, which was what I thought the original amendment you moved intended. You are now indicating that it is just one `intentionally'. We are happy to support your revised amendment to our amendment, which is to take `intentionally' away from `reckless' 
 but to keep it with `dishonest'. We accept your amendment, Senator Murray.
Amendments agreed to.
—The question is that opposition amendments Nos. 3 and 39, as amended, and opposition amendment No. 4 be agreed to.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I move:
(38A)	 Schedule 5, item 11, page 436 (line 31), omit ""what he or she believes to be"".
This is a consequential amendment that arose through an earlier amendment, when we amended only schedule 1. It was agreed to by everybody previously but there is a second bit that needs to be done as well. I will not speak to it. Senator Ian Campbell and Senator Murray are nodding, so I will not take up any more of the chamber's time. It is just consequential to an earlier amendment.
Amendment agreed to.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-13,"—I move:
(1)	 Schedule 1, item 1, page 45 (after line 18), at the end of section 204B, add:
	 (3)	 ASIC may determine the qualifications or experience that a person must have to be appointed as a secretary of a public company.
This amendment relates to page 45, schedule 1, item 1 at the end of section 204B and is in reference to company secretaries. This is an issue, as you know, on which all of us have been lobbied—rather late in the day in some cases—by the professional association who concern themselves with this matter. The effect of this amendment is to allow ASIC to determine the qualifications that a person must have to be appointed as the secretary of a public company. At present, the Corporations Law requires all companies to appoint a company secretary. This bill removes that requirement and replaces it with a requirement that only public companies must appoint a company secretary.
We have been lobbied to retain the existing requirement in relation to company secretaries. We do not see any real value in requir 
 ing all companies to appoint a company secretary, which was also the government's view. This is particularly the case in two-director, mum and dad companies. Quite often, that situation results in the mere nomination of a person as the secretary when that person may in fact have very little involvement in the company. However, we do see value in requiring public companies to appoint a secretary, who will usually have responsibility for ensuring compliance with all manners of statutes. I believe that there is merit in requiring the secretaries of public companies to have qualifications of a certain standard. However, I do believe that the approach to be taken to such a requirement must be flexible.
I do not envisage that the law should contain a section which states that a public company secretary must have a law degree or an accounting qualification; that was obviously the request of the professional association that looks after company secretaries. But I can envisage a situation where company secretaries in future might have entirely different qualifications, such as being very proficient with, for instance, computers. It should be the case that the Australian Securities and Investment Commission might periodically prescribe qualifications when and if they think that is appropriate. Accordingly, I commend this amendment to the committee as a means of improving the intention with standards in this area, without derogating at all from the government's intention.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-13,"—The government does have concerns on a number of aspects of this. Firstly, the prescription of minimum qualifications in the law is potentially undesirable. The government has conducted no consultations whatsoever on this proposal. As all honourable senators know, it has been the practice of this government and also previous governments to have significant broad ranging consultations with stakeholders when there has been any change to the Corporations Law. That generally makes changes to the Corporations Law long and tedious, but it 
 usually ensures that there is a high degree of certainty about them. This change, therefore, would have the potential to create a great deal of uncertainty. We are not aware—certainly they did not come to my attention during my term in the portfolio—of any failure of company secretaries to adequately fulfil their duties under the law. Accordingly, there seems to be little justification to impose the suggested changes at this time.
I have not discussed this with the minister, and I do not want this to be seen as a fob off—it is a genuine offer—but I am happy to have consultations on this matter. I am happy to have it inquired into either by a relevant parliamentary committee or even by a body such as CASAC, for example, if we do not want to leave it to a parliamentary committee. I am sure the minister would agree to have an independent expert body like CASAC look into this. As honourable senators who are interested in Corporations Law reform know, further bills are coming before this place over the coming months—if not the next year, at least—and on behalf of the government, yet without consultation with the minister I represent, I would be happy to see this referred to a body such as the joint statutory committee or CASAC. I would be happy to hear other views on that, but I do not think it is particularly good practice to impose this new requirement without any consultations  whatsoever. We have reservations about it, but I am not saying that it is a bad idea. I am happy to consult on it.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I note that my colleague Senator Cooney also wishes to make a contribution, so I will be brief so we can hear from him. The Labor Party are genuinely supportive of Senator Murray's amendment. We think that there is an appropriate need for the right sort of qualifications for people who hold these positions. I have also been lobbied on this issue and I do believe that the company secretary has traditionally been a very important focus for these sorts of corporate governance issues which this parliament has seen fit to support. My concern with where the government seems to be going on this is that those corporate governance issues tend to find 
 a focal point in the position of company secretary—not always, but they do in many cases become the focal point and the point from which good corporate governance practices come and are dealt with in a corporation. To have them dispersed within corporations, certainly the large ones, would in my view be a retrograde step, but I accept the points that Senator Campbell has made and that Senator Murray has made in terms of small companies. Having the position of a company secretary can sometimes cause stretching of resources in the mum and dad partnership company structure.
Senator Campbell, I do support and welcome your suggestion that it be referred to a committee. I would like to see both CASAC and the parliamentary committee involved—or perhaps CASAC could make a submission to the parliamentary committee on this. As I indicated to you privately a minute ago—and I am in no way reflecting on your word—you recently made an offer on behalf of the government to do with supporting the re-establishment of the Patrick issue. Senator Murray sat through a very tedious discussion of this at the recent Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, as I think did Senator Cooney. When I sought to re-establish the Patrick issue, which you had offered support for, government members and senators on that committee voted me down. I urged them to consult you on this. I said that this was an offer made on the floor of the Senate by Senator Campbell on behalf of the government and that all I was seeking to do was to get them to keep the commitment from Senator Campbell.
Senator Campbell, you are nodding, so you are aware of the particular debate. I was particularly disappointed that, when I sought to re-establish the reference, which was agreed to in this chamber, by dint of the election coming along the government members and senators voted me down. While I in no way doubt your word on it, I have unfortunately had a recent experience on that reference where your members and senators did not keep the government's word and the word that you gave. I would be keen for you to indicate that my recollection and, as you seem 
 to be nodding, your recollection that the government made a commitment to hold that inquiry is correct. I will take on face value your commitment to refer that matter, but I also draw to your attention the fact that, unfortunately, some members and senators did not keep your previous commitment on that Patrick debate. I urge you to speak with them so that, if I were to move that again, I would have the support of the government members and senators on that committee. So I seek your guidance on both those issues.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-13,"—I would be very disturbed if any commitment I have made in the chamber on behalf of the government were not fulfilled. I will look closely at the detail of that commitment and undertake to see that it is fulfilled. We will certainly ensure that any undertaking I make in relation to this matter is fulfilled. I regard it as an important matter. Company secretaries are critical people in corporate governance in Australia and I would certainly ensure that, if it is decided in the great wisdom of the Senate that it should refer to something like CASAC or the joint statutory committee, that would happen.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I would be interested to know from Senator Murray—of course, our position has been put by Senator Conroy—why ASIC is the body that may determine the qualifications or experience that a person must have to be appointed as a secretary of a public company. I know a number of the people in ASIC and they are quite outstanding in the work they do and well qualified, but I am not sure that they are qualified as teachers or as people who know, to the depth that we would perhaps like, what makes a good company secretary. I ask Senator Murray why ASIC should have a part in the setting of qualifications and the education and experience of these people.
I know, for example, that doctors, lawyers, architects and other people qualify and have their standards set by universities, or when a person goes on to be a solicitor by a board of examiners, but what precisely ASIC has to do 
 with the qualifications and experience of a secretary I am not sure. It just seems to me that there are plenty of other bodies that could do that better. I am not concerned about the proposition that people ought to be qualified properly to take on the secretaryship of a public company, because public companies are a vital social institution. But why should ASIC, in addition to the onerous tasks it has already got, and I know it has not got enough people to do them, have to take on the additional task of setting qualifications and experience, and how is it possibly going to be able to do it?",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-13,"—As always, Senator Cooney asks interesting questions. I will start by referring, if I may, to Senator Cooney's own guild, his own closed shop, and that is the lawyers, who determine what qualifications one should have and how one should proceed to be recognised in law and in practice. The Institute of Company Secretaries—I need your attention, Senator Cooney, if you are going to understand the response—
—I am listening.
—The Institute of Company Secretaries lobbied the government, the Labor Party and us with a full submission. That submission was somewhat self-serving, as you would expect. They are looking after their own self-interest, and there is nothing wrong with that. What they were saying in their submission is that the law should be prescriptive as to not only what entities should have company secretaries, to a far greater extent than the government has suggested, but also the qualifications and duties that those company secretaries should have. We, the Democrats, took account of the government's view that they wished to avoid as much prescription in there as possible and we understood that they are seeking to allow companies, through their boards, to determine who does what and what are the appropriate qualifications that are relevant to those boards. However, we accepted that the company secretaries have traditionally had a very important role in the focus that they put on corporate governance, on dealing with legal issues and on dealing with accounting issues 
 in a particular professional way. In other words, they are often the ethics commissioner, the attorney-general, if you like, of a board, with that kind of brief to be both independent and objective in the pursuit of their duties.
To return to your question, if we agreed with the government that we should in fact avoid prescription but we agreed with the company secretaries that you should have persons of appropriate qualifications, and we could also envisage a situation where the appropriate qualifications could change over time—and I gave as an example that it might be extremely important for persons with that function to be highly proficient in interactive computer skills—and if there was a desire to maintain high professional standards then the best body to determine that would be ASIC, who would obviously do it in consultation with the professional associations that determine these things. Otherwise, like the lawyers, who have this kind of closed shop device whereby they determine their own background and destiny and how things get along—I am not saying this to dig into your ribs; I am merely saying that they have got a superbly organised closed shop, in my opinion—the Institute of Company Secretaries would continue to run things the way that  suited them and their people best. So my view is that ASIC, as the professional body with real authority and understanding of Corporations Law, is the appropriate body to lay down appropriate qualifications, after consultation with the professional bodies that are concerned, which is not just the Institute of Company Secretaries but would include the Institute of Company Directors and any other body that they thought appropriate.
The second thing I should say with regard to the parliamentary secretary's remarks is that I should have made it clear in my exposition of the arguments for this amendment that I have used the word `may'—not `must', `may'—because ASIC may take the view that the qualifications and standards being pursued are perfectly reasonable and acceptable at this time, but in five or 10 years time they may not take that view. They may then decide that they need to beef up ethics and standards by 
 perhaps being a little tighter with their recommendations on qualifications.
I hope that fairly fulsome response gives you an understanding of my reasons. You might not agree with them, but hopefully you now understand what my reasons are. They result from a very considered response to interviews with, and a very detailed presentation in the submission from, the Chartered Institute of Company Secretaries. It is not something that we just dreamt up as we went along. That is the purpose of it.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-10-13,"—What Senator Murray has said is that you should not leave these things to the profession, and that is more and more the way these days. In Victoria, for example, you now have all sorts of bodies set up to regulate the legal profession. But all those bodies have the purpose of looking after the profession in the sense of regulating it—looking at standards and what have you. We do not have the Victorian police determining the qualifications or experience that a person must have to be appointed a lawyer in Victoria because the Victorian police have a different function. Senator Murray said that he has discussed these issues with the Chartered Institute of Company Secretaries and so on, so this is a planned thing.
But as it stands there now you have the strange situation where the contents of, and the qualifications and experience required by, a profession have to be determined by what is in effect a regulatory body—a body that polices a particular section of society, namely companies. That seems to me to be a  different function altogether from that of setting qualifications and experience. ASIC might set standards—in fact, it does. It says, `You've got to come up to this level of action for it to get past our scrutiny.' But we are not talking about actions here or conduct; we are talking about qualifications and experience. How people at ASIC, with all their goodness, can sit there and judge the experience of a company secretary—how they have the time to do that, for a start, in the way that we would want it done here—seems very interesting to me. 
The other point I want to make is this: when they regulated the profession in Victoria, as Senator Murray said, they did so with a fairly thick bit of legislation, because it is a much more complicated process than simply putting a couple of lines in a general act, may I suggest.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,1999-10-13,"—My comment comes on the back of what has already been put. It is an interesting point that is being made. When you look at the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, they are, as Senator Cooney has pointed out, a regulatory authority. One would then have to look at whether or not to come to the conclusion that ASIC should have the ability to set or determine qualifications. One would have to be able to look at ASIC to determine whether or not they have within their own ranks people who have the necessary training and ability to set and determine competency levels and qualifications, to then put them into effect and to require people to determine those qualifications for the secretary's position.
In addition, it is important to look at putting those two functions together—that is, both the policing or regulatory authority and an auth ority that would also look after the qualifications. As far back as the Robens committee of inquiry in England, they put forward the notion that you should separate both the policing and the regulatory authority so that there was at least a separation between the two. Otherwise, you run the risk of having someone who not only regulates but also enforces sitting in the same chair. It has always been decided, at least from a Public Service perspective, that it is far better to be able to separate them for scrutiny and for a whole range of other reasons.
Senator Murray raises an interesting question. He raises the fortunate issue that ASIC `may' determine the qualifications. I found through my experience that usually if you put `may', ASIC will read that as `must' and will launch off and do that. I could not imagine them being reticent about setting qualifications. It then does not provide an idea of what those qualifications, the criteria and other matters involved in determining those qualifi 
 cations for a company secretary might be. So I would caution against moving directly as Senator Murray has suggested without, at least, far more consideration of the issue than what is being given here today.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-13,"—I would like  to make an intervention. My idea of sending Senator Murray's amendments to CASAC or the committee was an alternative to putting it into law. I do regard it as bad form that it has gone into law without any consultation with stakeholders. That was my offer. It was not, `Let's pass it and then send it to a committee.' My offer was, `Let's not put it into law before it has been considered by stakeholders.' Can I make that clear to the chamber so it does not come up in another year's time that I did not do it. I will not now be sending it to CASAC or to the joint statutory committee because it is now in the law and ASIC will have to work it out somehow. I hope that was clear when the Labor Party actually voted for this: it is now in the law.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-13,"—I must confess I cannot remember, when I had the discussion with ASIC, whether I did discuss this with them. I suspect I did, but I am not going to produce a sworn affidavit to that effect. I got a bit confused by that because, having had Senators Cooney and Ludwig argue against it, I expected it to go down. So I was a little surprised.
Senator Ian Campbell interjecting—
—I know Senator Campbell does not like to give an inch, if he can avoid it. I do not say that unkindly, Senator Campbell; I just make the observation. If the government remains very strong about this matter, it will no doubt come back to the Senate. I think the provisions of May in fact give the discretion that is appropriate. I have previously discussed this with the advisers and the minister, so they are well aware of it. They will let the Labor Party make a judgment on it.

I suspect, in some respects, it would probably be the CASAC.

Labor is moving an amendment to the government's proposal to allow shareholders to undertake a statutory derivative action and court proceedings on behalf of a company. The current Corporations Law regime already 
 allows such action, but the process to do so is not clear and it is not often used. There is a widely held view that, without clear statutory procedures, pursuing a derivative action will continue to be a confusing exercise.
However, the opposition believes that the statutory derivative action rule proposed by the government is likely to be too onerous for individual investors to utilise. It is doubtful whether many shareholders will be able to meet the onerous requirement of applying for leave from the court to take action. The ineligibility of ASIC to apply for leave from the court is difficult to understand. As the government created consumer protector, ASIC should surely have the power to act under these provisions. Labor accepts that it would be appropriate that the right to take a statutory derivative action should be extended to ASIC because small shareholders may not have the resources to take such action. The opposition's amendment is designed to ensure that this can occur.
It was the opposition's initial understanding that the government had indicated an intention to accept a recommendation of the joint parliamentary committee report to allow this to occur. If this is still the case, I look forward to the government's support for the amendment. Our amendment to allow ASIC, which is the government nominated consumer financial services protection agency, to have the right to pursue statutory derivative actions on the behalf of shareholders will extend consumer protection and improve the accountability of directors. While the government claims that its proposal to allow shareholders to take a statutory derivative action will balance the so-called safe harbour provisions, it is clear that the government's proposal does not balance the ledger at all.
Labor's amendment will go some way towards achieving appropriate rights for shareholders. With the government trumpeting its support for Australia as a shareholding nation, I would have thought that it would support a regime that provides an appropriate level of protection for the thousands of new and somewhat inexperienced shareholders who have entered the market.
I recently attended a two-day seminar on corporate governance and a whole variety of issues to do with corporate governance, including some discussion on the statutory derivative action. One of the nation's largest legal firms was the speaker on this issue at that conference. I think it would be fair to say that this company did not realise that I was in the audience because, when asked about the statutory derivative action, the response from one of the leading law firms of this country was that the statutory derivative action as defined in this bill was a joke, it was irrelevant, and it would be something which companies could ignore at will. This is not the Labor Party saying this; this is not the Democrats saying this. I say to Senator Murray and the Democrats that this was a leading Australian law firm which said it was a joke. So the government come before us today and say that this is the balance for the safe harbour, but this is no balance at all. In its current form it does not go anywhere near far enough. It is rightly being treated and described as a joke in business and legal circles. For the government to try to maintain the fiction that  it is an appropriate level of balance is just that—a fiction.
I commend the amendments to the Senate, and I look forward to hearing the government's position. As I said, they did indicate earlier on that they may be willing to support the amendments. I am not sure where they are at the moment. I am hopeful that the Democrats are also willing to support our amendments.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-13,"—I fully trust what Senator Conroy is saying about a supposedly major senior law firm in Australia, or at least a spokesman for it. We genuinely try to balance the BJR proposals against the statutory derivative action. It is a genuine, quite clear and constructive move towards giving enhanced rights to shareholders to take actions on behalf of the company at the company's expense where the company refuses to act. Beyond any doubt it is a new right. People might argue about how much the 
 right will be used or how it could be curtailed. We went to extraordinary lengths to ensure that it was a significant new statutory right for shareholders, particularly minority shareholders by definition.
It is fair to say that during those consultations interests associated with company directors, right up until the final drafting of the law, fought hammer and tongs to not have a statutory derivative action. The company director side of the argument did not like this; they did not want it. They thought they should have a business judgment rule, that that was all okay, but they did not want an SDA. I think people like Senator Cooney and probably Senator Conroy and Senator Murray, who have had discussions with the various stakeholders in this debate, would not be surprised that I say that. The company directors would much prefer not to have the statutory derivative action. Generally speaking, it is fair to say that some of the minority shareholder interests would prefer not to have the BJR.
We looked very carefully at the proposals in the Cooney committee, the Lavarch committee and other committees outside the parliament for a business judgment rule. I know that proposals for an SDA, a statutory derivative right of action, were also considered because I read the Lavarch report again today. I cannot remember whether Senator Cooney's committee looked at a SDA when they were considering a BJR. I apologise to people across Australia who are tuned into this lively and interesting debate on Corporations Law reform for using those acronyms. We put the SDA in to create a balance. The achievement of the government is that everyone, including the Australian Shareholders Association and other consumer organisations, has agreed that we have found a fair balance.
To answer Senator Conroy's point that we could toughen this up by giving ASIC the right to use it as well, I did, as he would expect, raise this matter over the couple of years it took to draft these laws. It is a quite legitimate proposal. I discussed it closely with ASIC, who were totally sanguine about it. They were sanguine about it for this reason: 
 under section 50, for example, they can already take action on behalf of investors. With the statutory derivative right of action—that is, giving a statutory right of action to shareholders to take action against directors on behalf of the company or against the company using the company's resources—we are giving a right to the shareholders that, at the moment, is only available to the regulator.
During my term in the portfolio, I received many letters—as I am sure all of us who have been associated with corporate affairs will have—from disgruntled shareholders who want ASIC to go after someone. ASIC have limited resources; they always have limited resources by nature. They can only go after the ones where they are pretty certain of getting a prosecution. Like any organisation that has limited resources, they cannot chase down every rabbit hole, every complaint from every disgruntled investor. We would love it if they could. What this does is say to those shareholders that, if you can get an action together, if you can get together as a group of  shareholders, you now have this right to do so under the law. You do not have to do it through the civil provisions.
ASIC's powers are the focus of the amendments moved by Labor. As I said, I did have a close look at it. The government closely considered whether, firstly, ASIC needed or wanted the powers. We discussed and debated that with them closely. We discussed it with other stakeholders. We found that, under section 50, ASIC could already take action on behalf of shareholders and could also bring proceedings directly for any breach of the law under the civil and criminal penalty regime of the Corporations Law. The point I make, as briefly as possible, is that ASIC do not need this power; they already have it. What we are trying to do is give shareholders' minority interests access to the sorts of powers under the law that ASIC already hold. That is the government's view on it. We see nothing wrong with the intention of these amendments moved by Senator Conroy on behalf of the opposition, but we do not think they achieve anything.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I would like to speak to the point you 
 raised regarding section 236. As I understand it, you are effectively saying that it is a positive advantage; you are broadening the proposal to allow a court appointed investigator to be able to investigate the causes of actions and report back to the court itself. Recently I read an article from the CCH Internet site written by Russell Evans and headed `Court appointed investigators in statutory derivative actions'. It states:
Left unaddressed is whether an investigator becomes an officer of the Court by virtue of his or her appointment. And, if so, could a person be in contempt of Court by refusing to co-operate with an investigator? Will an investigator have privilege? Will an investigator be bound by an obligation of confidence?
I wonder if you could provide some advice to the chamber if you are going to go down the track of having an investigator who can act in these very important matters. As we know, the rule in Foss v. Harbottle has practically done away with the statutory derivative action provision that you are intending to use.
If it is the case that a person who takes on that mantle is able, by virtue of their appointment, to go in and do what is necessary, there is the question of whether they can go in fearlessly, with confidence and with the surety that they have things such as privilege or qualified privilege. They are fine points, but without that being made clear people will certainly be left in some doubt. Could the minister provide some information with respect to that?",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-13,"—I do not think this particularly relates to the debate about the statutory derivative right of action that we are seeking to give to shareholders. As I understood the question, it goes to the rights of investigators who work for ASIC—going back to the concept of the regulator also acting as the prosecutor—and whether or not that role is compromised in any way by these provisions. Perhaps you could clarify that. I do not see that the point you made is actually directly related to the statutory derivative right of action.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,1999-10-13,"—Section 236 will permit specified persons to bring an action on behalf of the company or to intervene to take responsibility for proceedings of which the company is already a party. The person specified is `a member, former member or a person entitled to become a member of a company or related body corporate, or an officer or a former officer of the company'. Such a person will need to apply to the court for leave to bring or intervene in the proceedings. So it does arise directly within section 236.
When you look at that situation, the court must grant leave if it is satisfied as to certain criteria, including that `the applicant is acting in good faith, that there is a serious issue to be tried and that the granting of leave would be in the best interests of the company', which is stated in section 237. It will also be possible for a further person to be granted leave by the court in substitution for the person initially granted leave by the court,  which is stated in section 238. Labor is suggesting that ASIC also be added as one of those bodies. The reason behind that, I suspect, is to ensure there is a properly resourced, independent appropriate body to look at it. Because of the way that the existing provisions are actually worded, I am left in some doubt as to the position of that investigator—that is, the person would then be able to do it without the amendments proposed by Labor.
I will go again to the questions that remain, which are, I understand, left in the body of section 236. Those questions are: if that person becomes an officer of the court by virtue of his or her appointment, could that person be in contempt of court by refusing to cooperate with an investigator, will an investigator have privilege and will an investigator be bound by an obligation of confidence? You can then look at the court's power to appoint an investigator, which comes up under `General powers of the Court', at section 241. That section says:
The Court may make any orders, and give any directions, that it considers appropriate in relation to proceedings brought or intervened in with leave, or an application for leave, including . . .  

And it goes on with (a), (b), (c), and so forth. When you examine that provision you find that the court is required to make orders as to who is to be liable for the investigator's costs, although the court may vary that order at any time, which is stated in section 241(3). It goes on further. Part 2F.1A is silent on the question of whether a court appointed investigator is an officer of the court. I take you to 6.63, which is in the explanatory memorandum. It says that `a court appointed investigator will effectively be an officer of the court'. It does not say that they will in fact be an officer of the court; it just says `effectively'.
They are matters that have been raised in a number of articles that, as I have said, I have read in respect of this section, which I suspect has prompted our view be adopted that ASIC should be in there. I think it is entirely appropriate and that is the basis of the argument that I am putting to you. I hope that has explained, in short form I suspect, where I am coming from so that you can provide some light on some of those matters. I am asking: can refusal to cooperate with an investigator be a contempt of court? It is a serious matter that I think requires an answer in respect of those provisions under section 236, which has obviously prompted this side of the chamber to also include ASIC as part of the operation. I can go on with a further explanation, but I hope that makes it a bit plainer.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-13,"—I am clear. We were on slightly different wavelengths but we have now got into a simulcast situation. The position remains the same. I have listened very carefully and have understood the points made, but the government position remains unchanged. This is not a provision that seeks to give ASIC any alternative powers; it is an addition to the law which is designed absolutely to give shareholders additional powers. The law already sets out a range of powers and rights of action for statutory rights of action for ASIC in relation to a whole range of matters. This is a provision that is aimed fairly and squarely and unambiguously at giving shareholders a right.
It does not inhibit shareholders running off to ASIC; it gives shareholders a special new statutory derivative right of action that they can take. They can go to the courts and if they can satisfy the courts in respect of the terms in section 236 and onwards that Senator Ludwig has already eloquently outlined and if they can meet what are very reasonable tests—it cannot be frivolous and it cannot be vexatious; they have to have a serious case to try—then they can do so. The company will pay for it and the court can establish investigators, and so forth. I hear what Senator Ludwig is saying. I have heard the argument before. I have heard the arguments back and forth about whether ASIC should be listed here. It is contrary to the clear policy intent to have ASIC included in the SDA.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-13,"—The effect of these amendments is to give ASIC the power to bring statutory derivative actions. Let me see how we go with this: a derivative action is a claim made through the courts by the shareholders of a company against the director of the company. The important point to note is that the action against the director is brought in the name of the company, not in the name of the shareholders. As a general comment, under present law, derivative actions are not permitted. That means that, if directors commit a wrong against a company and they decide that a company should not commence an action against themselves, the shareholders have no ability to commence an action against them in the name of the company.
The statutory derivative action contained in proposed section 236 will allow shareholders to commence a derivative action against the directors in certain circumstances, and that is a desirable improvement to the law. In proposed section 237, derivative action may be brought only with leave of the court. The court must be satisfied that it is probable that the company will not itself bring the proceedings, that the applicant is acting in good faith, that it is in the best interests of the company that the applicant be allowed to commence proceedings, that there is a serious question to be tried, and that notice has been given of the intention to seek leave. These Labor Party 
 amendments propose that the right of a shareholder to bring a derivative action should also be extended to ASIC—that is, that ASIC should also be able to apply to a court to bring a derivative action. I see in this the following issue: shareholders have not had this right and now they are to be given this right. In other words, they have the ability to act in a way they have not before, and that is very desirable.
Parliamentary Secretary, is it your expectation in behavioural terms that, if ASIC were given the power, shareholders would not do anything—that they would demand that ASIC do it? In other words, that they would shift the responsibility and the cost from themselves to the government and ask the government to pursue a private action against a company? Is it a weakness that is at the core of this problem? I do not want to put words into their mouths because I have not heard them say it, but I assume the Labor Party are saying that there may be some shareholders who would not be able to get their act together, or who are very poor, or who would not understand how to do things. They would like somebody else to do it for them because, otherwise, it would not happen.
That would not be the case with many shareholders. You might find some extremely well-heeled shareholders—some very large, powerful and wealthy shareholders—who would say, `Hang on. Why should we carry the cost and the expense and the difficulty of this action? We'll get ASIC to do it for us, and we'll tie up public resources, public money and public officers with pursuing what is essentially a private action.' Parliamentary Secretary, am I right?
—Spot on.
—Could you let me know where this problem lies and where the real issue is? My memory does not extend to that, despite having been exposed to all this stuff for years. Could you let me know whether most of the people who write to you to complain about the inability to take action have been poor, weak and disorganised shareholders or whether they constitute the whole range of shareholders from those who 
 are ordinary to those who are substantially well off?",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-13,"—I am very happy to. Senator Murray has hit bullseye with his summation of the problem. Certainly in my time I did get correspondence from very wealthy individuals who were disgruntled, wanted to take action and were very upset that ASIC had not. I vowed not to call them mums and dads, but I got small investors—householders and Howard battlers—who wanted their gripe with the company resolved.
This new statutory right for shareholders will, for the first time, give them the opportunity to take their case on behalf of their interests and the interests of the company. It  is a new right. It will not matter if they are not particularly well off—and Senator Ludwig will tell you, I'm sure, that there are a lot of lawyers around who are looking to take cases—because all they will have to do will be to find a lawyer who thinks they have half a case. If they have a decent case they will get it into the court and the company will pay. So a lawyer who is looking to help the poor downtrodden shareholder is likely to assist if they, in their own judgment, decide that the shareholder has some sort of case under this law. The point you make in terms of the incentive for a shareholder to go running first to ASIC is a very valid one, and that is why we have been very clear.
We have looked at it very closely. It is not an ideological position; it is a practical position, as you have picked up, Senator Murray. It is a very practical thing. We have thought about it, we have looked at it and we have made the decision that this is for shareholders. We want to encourage shareholder activism, and this is a brilliant way to do it. It gives them a right to be active. They do not have to yell and scream at an AGM and be fobbed off and come back in 12 months time. If they are not happy they have this right, and they can take it.
It is a very good corporate governance measure. I will be watching very closely— 
probably more closely than just about anybody this country—to see how often it is used and how successfully it is used. I really hope it gets through intact today and that it is embraced by shareholders as a new arrow in their armoury to improve the rights of shareholders and increase and better Australia's corporate governance.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-13,"—Parliamentary Secretary, let me ensure that I have got the sequence right. Although I know that the company can end up paying for the action eventually, in the intervening time shareholders have to get together and risk a bit of money to get advice early on and get the whole thing processed. It is in that intervening stage that they would find it much more attractive to get ASIC involved in the early cost. That is true, isn't it? Although the company itself might pay for an action which does get into the courts on due grounds, it is the intervening phase which makes it attractive for shareholders to go to ASIC because they do not get involved with having to get expensive advice and to fund the early stages.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-13,"—Section 242 at page 85 of the bill makes it clear:
The Court may at any time make any orders it considers appropriate about the costs of the following persons—
which are then enumerated—
in relation to proceedings brought or intervened in with leave under section 237. . . 
What I am advised that means is that even on the very first day of the court the person representing the shareholder or shareholders can seek costs and that the court under this provision has the power to make those cost orders on day one. So one would envisage that, if the shareholders went to the court on the first day and the court gave leave under 237, the cost orders could be made there and then. So the risk is very low at the outset. As long as the lawyer thought there was a case to be tried and thought he had a fair go, he could go along to the court and clearly, if 
 they were successful in the very initial stages, the court could make those costs. I am not a lawyer. As I said, I hire them when I need them. I have many good ones advising me today at little cost to me but at massive cost to the taxpayer.
—They wish.
—They deserve to be paid a lot more, these people, they really do.
That would be an appropriate thing a court would take into account, I would think. If you went there and you had an impecunious set of shareholders, that would be something I would imagine their legal representation would put before the court there and then and, if the case had merit, ensure that it could proceed.
We have agreement amongst the parties to allow the Senate to sit till 7.20 p.m. on this matter. I thought I might deal with that now rather than waiting until later.
Progress reported.
Motion (by Senator Ian Campbell) agreed to:
That the committee have leave to sit again at a later hour of the day.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-13,"—The points you have raised are very valid, Senator Murray. If you read—and I am sure you have—the explanatory memorandum closely, 6.3 on page 21 makes it quite clear what the agenda is here. It mentions Foss v. Harbottle , which more learned people than I have already referred to, and talks about what flowed from that—there is no proper role for 
 ASIC to proceed. `Effectively, the action is designed to be a self-help measure' is how the government is describing this venture. It says:
In this regard, a statutory derivative action has the potential to remove some of the regulatory burden from ASIC by making it easier for investors . . .
What we are seeing here is ASIC being able to wash its hands of small investors who have a problem. Notwithstanding that, they go on to say—Senator Campbell has also said this—that there are other means by which ASIC may commence actions on behalf of investors—for example, under section 50. This is a mechanism that is about saying: `No, I am not going to intervene.' This is ASIC getting out of its obligation.
There are some things that as a community and as a parliament we expect ASIC to do. We supported ASIC becoming the consumer watchdog, the consumer protector, the financial services protector for small shareholders. We all voted for that, we passed it and the government assured us that ASIC would have the resources to do its job. As Senator Campbell has already said, there are things that ASIC will always have to prioritise.
What we will be doing here today, if we do not accept the Labor amendments, is consigning small shareholders to the dustbin because, as you have described, Senator Murray, there is not a lot of opportunity for people who are not as well off to actually get involved in this. Many times lawyers will require collateral. Would you be prepared to put your house on taking on a huge corporation? Would you be prepared to risk all of your assets?
—Slater and Gordon would take it on.
—Would you be prepared to risk all of your superannuation to take on a huge company, with almost unlimited legal resources designed to drive you into the ground? The answer is: of course not. That is what will happen if ASIC is able to wash its hands. Always be suspicious when a regulatory authority wants to say, `This is for self-help.' It is designed to remove some of the regulatory burden from ASIC. I did not know we wanted to remove the regulatory burden from ASIC. I thought that was their job. I thought that is why we created ASIC in 
 its current form. That is why this Senate chamber was asked by the government—I think the Democrats, like the opposition, supported this—to make ASIC the watchdog in this area. Well, now we are into self-help, a bit of reciprocal obligation for the poor punter who has a few shares and nothing much else behind them.
I urge the Democrats to reconsider. Senator Murray has asked Senator Ian Campbell all the right questions so far. I do not believe he has given the Democrats any satisfactory answers, making jokes about Slater and Gordon across the chamber. What is at stake here is far more than what is at stake for you or me.
—What about Rene Rivkin? He'll do it too.
—The parliamentary secretary can make frivolous interjections, but we are talking about genuine protection and the capacity for people who are not able to take on big corporations being taken away if this amendment is not supported.
—But the company pays.
—To get involved, you have to go to court first before the company pays, Senator Campbell, as you well know. You have to be prepared to put your money up to start the process. That is the hurdle that you know full well is there and that is what will make sure that almost nobody bothers to take up this option.
—What's your solution? Do you have a solution?
—My solution is for ASIC. This is what the amendment is about.
—It is already in there.
—It is not. You well know, Senator Campbell, that this is designed to do the exact opposite to what you describe. This is designed to stop small shareholders being able to access their proper legal rights. This is about ASIC washing its hands and saying, `You've got the option. You go away and do it. We don't have to do it.' That is what this is about. This is the excuse for 
 ASIC to wash its hands of all small shareholders complaints. That is not the role of the regulator. It is not about self-help. It is not about removing the regulatory burden from ASIC.
—You just said ASIC wants what you want. You cannot have it both ways. Do ASIC want it or don't they want it? Do you know?
—I am not interested in whether or not ASIC want it. I am saying that it is this parliament's job to decide ASIC's role and to assign its regulatory burden. As you have described in the explanatory memorandum—these are your words; I hope you have read them—`a statutory derivative action has the potential to remove some of the regulatory burden from ASIC', and it is removing it from ASIC by plonking it onto the people who can least afford it. I say that is wrong and we give it back to ASIC, whether ASIC want it or not. It is not ASIC's job to say, `We don't want to be involved in those little shareholder things.' If the parliament says, `That's your job; that's your role,' then we expect ASIC to perform its role. It is nice that you organised for Alan Cameron to meet with Senator Murray on a range of these issues. There was no such offer to us, at any stage, to discuss these issues with ASIC.
—I asked for it, Senator Conroy.
—I am glad that the government were willing to cooperate. I appreciate the interjection, Senator Murray.
—I asked ASIC; I did not ask the government.
—I am sure that ASIC cleared it with the government before they came wandering down to see you. I am sure that the government have not let it slip—
—They come to see you without having talked to us. That's always been the way.
—They have never wandered in to see me. I occasionally have conversations with ASIC, usually informally over a cup of tea during estimates.
—They have regularly done so.
—I have not been briefed by them yet on any issues. The point is that, if ASIC came to me to discuss these issues and said, `Look, Senator Conroy, we really don't want this. We're into this self-help stuff. We're into making the poor people pay if they want to try to start this process,' I would say, `Well that's nice of you, ASIC, but tough!' What my amendments seek to do is to put on the table that ASIC has to do this and has to commit resources to it. I know resources are a constant battle, Senator Campbell. I appreciate the point you made earlier.  There is always a prioritisation. But to effectively give small shareholders the flick in this way, as you are seeking to do if you vote against the Labor Party amendment, is reprehensible. I do not believe it is in the interests of shareholders. I do not believe it is in the interests of all the mums and dads whom you and your government so regularly champion. As recently as yesterday, the Treasurer waxed lyrical about the 32 per cent of Australians directly owning shares, the 560,000 Australians who purchased shares, the 75 per cent of Telstra employees who took up shares. They are the people you will be giving the flick to if you vote against these amendments.
I ask the Democrats to reconsider. You have asked all the right questions, Senator Murray. I cannot believe that the answers that I have heard would have satisfied your concerns in this area. Just because ASIC say that they do not want it and are saying, `We would like to remove some of our regulatory burden,' that should not be enough for this chamber, for the Labor Party and the Democrats, to say, `Okay, we'll give ASIC what they want,' or, `We'll give the government what they want.' I urge you to consider supporting our amendments and hope that you are willing to vote for them.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I wish to add to what Senator Conroy has said. If we are to have a law, it ought to be available to everybody who needs it. What often happens in discussions in this chamber is that various parliamentarians arguing around the chamber creates scenarios which 
 prove their point. That was done in this case. Senator Murray said, `What would big business people do? What would people with big money do? They would go to ASIC. Therefore, ASIC would have to spend money which would be better spent elsewhere and would, as it were, supplement with legal aid people who are rich and wealthy.' That ignores the fact that ASIC would have a choice. The section reads that a person—it may be ASIC—`may bring proceedings'. A person does not have to do so.
If the amendments that the opposition proposes were carried, it would give small people, as Senator Conroy has said, the opportunity of making use of the proceedings that are now made available under section 236. Those proceedings are now going to be available to very wealthy people, but they are not going to be available to the mums and dads who are not wealthy—as has been said again and again during this debate—but who now have shares. Australia has become a shareholding nation. Why should those people be denied the same opportunity that will be available, when this legislation is passed, to people with greater resources? Why should they be denied that simply because they do not have the money? That is a question that is asked again and again in the general law in terms of legal aid. This is not a matter of legal aid: it is a matter of enabling, in the proper circumstances—and I would imagine that they would be very limited—ASIC to take proceedings that are appropriate. If you are going to give a right, make that right available to all people.
This is an important section. It is a section that gives people who are members of companies, or have been members of companies, a constitutional right, as it were, to do something about that company. This procedure is going to be very expensive. As has been said, first of all, leave has to be obtained and the person that seeks the leave has the onus of proving the various matters that are set out in section 237. That could well be an expensive proceeding. You have to prove, for example, that it is in the best interests of the company that the applicant be granted leave. Once that 
 leave is granted, proceedings, of whatever nature, must follow.
It is said that there are lawyers who do matters subject to results and that is so, particularly in matters such as criminal law or family law. But I do not know many big legal firms that tend to deal with company matters that would do these matters on contingency for small people. That is fair enough. They are big companies and they are handling big clients. To handle small matters like this would interfere with the general running of their practice. I am not condemning that. I might say that many big firms do give legal  aid in areas such as criminal law and family law. I am not in any way denigrating them. What I am saying is that the structure of their business would not enable them to do that.
Perhaps the parliamentary secretary could ask his advisers how an action such as this would affect the running of a company, what would be involved, what witnesses you would have to get, what the cost of it would be and what sort of evidence would be needed. Indeed, in their experience of having run these cases, can they say how long similar cases have run and how much those barristers that practise in company law would charge? Do they think that a small person would have not only the financial resources but also the emotional resources to go up against a big company which, I would imagine, would have the top people in the land acting for them, and do they reckon that would be a fair contest?
We have to remember that ASIC would make the choice as to whether or not it would take up such an action. It is not obliged to take up an action if it does not want to do so. We are talking about a couple of gateways for somebody who wants to bring an action against a company. The first gateway is getting through ASIC, which would be very difficult. The second is getting through the gateway of the court to get leave to take proceedings. The third gateway is the actual action that the particular person wants to take. It is a very complicated issue. To simply say that ASIC is going to become, as it were, the milking cow for very big people is an ab 
 surd—and I use that expression advisedly—proposition.
If we do not include ASIC, it will mean that it is only those with the big money—and I have nothing against big money—who will be able to take the action that is contemplated here. Small people—mums and dads—will be unable to do so for the reasons which I have already mentioned and which are fairly obvious in any event. One of the problems with that is that the law, therefore, becomes available to only a particular class of people. That situation is already occurring, and it is bad to add to it by legislation such as this.
ASIC is a body that would make a judgment as to whether or not it is going to go on in this area. We trust ASIC to regulate the corporate world; surely we can trust it to make a decision as to whether or not there is an action open to people who come to see it. Even if it does say there is, it might say, `Well, in any event, it is not the sort of action that we should spend money on because ASIC has a statement and a budget.' Indeed, if the government became a bit concerned about the way ASIC was going, all it would have to do is reduce its funds. For those reasons, I think that if we leave ASIC out, it will be a bad thing for the general running of the law.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-13,"—Let us recognise, if we can, some of the very real benefits of what the government have put in this bill and let us consider the Labor Party's amendment as seeking to add to that. We see here that under the present law and under the proposed law ASIC has numerous provisions under which it can prosecute directors for breach of their duties. It does have numerous provisions on which it can act in regard to its duties on behalf of the act. The section that Senator Conroy read out could be taken in another way and the government may have had that in mind. That sentence said:
In this regard, a statutory derivative action has the potential to remove some of the regulatory burden—
not the prosecutorial burden, but the regulatory burden—
from ASIC by making it easier for investors themselves to protect the interests of a company. 

When I read that, I thought it meant that right now ASIC are burdened by people coming to them and saying, `We have difficulties in our circumstances. Will you do something?' and ASIC sometimes can—because they have provisions, as you know—but quite often cannot. That is why I and my party welcomed this new provision 236 and the other provisions. It introduced an additional protection for shareholders—an additional ability to get justice, to access the law and to progress their issues and their concerns to their satisfaction. When I saw that, I did not see it as ASIC saying, `Well, let's get rid of something we  used to do because we like to do other things.' I saw it as them saying, `Now we have got something whereby that particular problem can be dealt with.' I may or may not be right in that regard, but that is how I read it. I know that ASIC have been frustrated by numerous approaches to them which they simply could not deal with. Now this section 236 will allow them to be dealt with.
It has some really terrific features in it. The feature whereby the company will pay the costs for those actions if they get up in court is just fantastic. That is providing ordinary people with a cheap and ready access to justice. That is what I like about it. Then I look at the Labor Party's amendment. This is one interpretation; it may not be yours. My interpretation is that what they are trying to do is say,  `Well, here is a new provision which is good for shareholders, and particularly good for those at the lower end of the scale. Let us add to it by asking ASIC also to have this ability.' In other words, `You have got something good, but we want to improve it.' That is as I understood your recommendation. But when I looked at your recommendation, I was afraid—and I find it difficult to express this, and I hope I can—that the consequence of your amendment may in fact not improve the government's proposal but diminish it, because it would in fact make shareholders less capable of taking responsibility unto themselves to get on with taking action where it was appropriate.
All of us get caught up in the description of mum and dad investors, with the kind of emotional and economic picture that that 
 draws. But I sense that first time or relatively new investors—in this brand new participative world of capitalism that Australia has—are often not the sort of people who go to ASIC or would go to the statutory derivative action procedures anyway, because they are just not attuned yet. I would expect this kind of action to be taken up by informed, motivated and somewhat more experienced investors who would start this thing and then bring the others with them. You cannot in this law take an action which just benefits you as a sole shareholder and that does not affect the rights of every other shareholder in that same class, because obviously it flows on.
My feeling with this—and the judgment we have made—is that this is an improvement to current law and practice. It provides an additional avenue of access for justice. My judgment is again that your motives in trying to introduce this are unquestionably good but it may have a consequence which actually diminishes the purpose of the government's amendment. That is why I am still inclined to vote against it. I do so for the reasons I have tried to express to you. I hope that you understand what I am trying to convey.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-10-13,"—What Senator Murray is saying to us is, `Look, I agree with what the opposition is saying. I want this new ability for shareholders to go across the board so that shareholders, no matter what their size, can exercise it. That is the principle that the opposition is putting forward and I agree with that in principle.' But I understand Senator Murray to be saying, `Look, I say that if you introduce this you are going to diminish the chances of small shareholders because they will go to ASIC and in some way their rights will be diminished or they won't have the ability to do what they will be able to do if ASIC is not there.'
Painting that scenario is, may I say, painting a scenario which is unreal. The opposition, on the likely reality of what will happen, is in a much stronger position than the Democrats. That is where the difference between us lies: not on the point of principle—the principle that everybody should be able to make 
 use of 236 when it comes into operation—but on the factual consequences of that.
If you just think about it for a while, company law can be complex and is often very expensive to run. If I can speak through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, to Senator Murray, it is a good provision, that is true, but the amendment moved by Senator Conroy on behalf of the Labor Party would make it better. No matter what Senator Murray may say, the reality is that, without that amendment, this good provision is not going to be  made as good as it might be because, just on the evidence we have got over the years, if you look at how people with modest means are able to bring actions—say people who are earning, in this context, $80,000 or $100,000 a year—those people will not be able to bring an action under these proceedings because they will not be able to afford it.
It is a bit like asking people to take libel actions. As Senator Conroy said, there is all sorts of terror in that when you have to get leave and you have to go to the action. It is likely that costs will not be awarded until the end. It says that a judge can award costs day by day. That is just an unreal proposition. What concerns me about this whole debate is that this is going to go through, it seems with the Democrats' help, on a number of scenarios as to facts which are just quite unreal and almost absurd.
Everybody agrees on the principle. Even the government agrees on the principle that people should have proceedings available to them now. What is at stake is whether or not these proceedings are going to be available to ordinary people. The way this is set up, they will not be. One way of making that available to people is by putting ASIC in there. ASIC is not going to bring in a rush of litigation. We rely on ASIC as a regulator; why can't we rely on them as a gatekeeper in this respect? It just seems very interesting that we do not.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I would like to respond to Senator Murray but, before I do that, I congratulate Senator Cooney on that contribution, which I thought was very positive and measured. Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, I would say to 
 Senator Murray that I wanted to go to a point Senator Ian Campbell made on section 50, about which they seem to be saying, `It's okay, you've still got section 50.' I have section 50 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act here, and it reads:
Where, as a result of an investigation or from a record of an examination (being an investigation or examination conducted under this Part or a corresponding law), it appears to the Commission to be in the public interest for a person to begin and carry on a proceeding . . . 
The key test that is in here is `in the public interest'. If a little mum and dad investor comes along with a problem and wants to go to ASIC, under the law at the moment it has to pass a public interest test. It is very rare, between a combination of resources and the public interest test, to be able to interest ASIC.
So when the government says that there are these provisions, it needs to be fully understood that there is a number of criteria again that the mum and dad investor must pass before they can actually get the benefit of ASIC's support, participation and interest. I caution the government and those who argue that the existing section 50 is the catch-all that can protect mum and dad investors, because I do not think it is. There is an important criteria in here, which I do support—the question of the public interest—but it should not cloud whether the mum and dad investor can get access to ASIC. Realistically, I do not think that this section allows that.
I want to turn to your argument that the regulatory authority, by being there, possibly diminishes the capacity to undertake this sort of action. I would endorse Senator Cooney's comments that this is a good thing. I do not think it is as good as you do; I do not think it is going to have the impact that you do. As I said earlier, I was at this seminar where it was quite clearly expressed by a senior law firm that it was a joke and that there was nothing for anybody to worry about. I introduced myself to the individual after he made these comments. He went white. I was quite entertained by it.
—Name him!
—No, I would not do that to him. I do not think he realised I was in the audience, to be frank. There is a parallel circumstance with superannuation. There is a low cost complaints tribunal, which is accessible and available. There is equally a legal process that you can go through. People are not diminished by the fact they can get the low cost alternative; people are empowered by the low cost alternative.
While I agree with your assessment that it is a wonderful thing that the company is paying, getting to the starting point is where I have my real concern. If you cannot get to the starting point because you are just a battling mum or dad, or because you are afraid to put your house up, there is a disincentive, a deterrence, that exists. I do not believe it is a deliberate deterrence. I do not believe the government are putting it forward as a deliberate deterrence, but I believe they have put it forward from their blinkered view of the world that everybody can get access to the law. I do not believe that to be the case. I think Senator Cooney and other senators have long argued that an almost two-tiered situation is developing. There is not enough legal aid or understanding. I think that this will be one of those circumstances as well. I am afraid that that two-tiered system will discourage people from pursuing their rights. It is unusual to argue that giving an extra option diminishes the capacity to go forward.
I would put to you, Mr Temporary Chairman Bartlett, as a member of the Democrats, that the task is to educate people so that they are aware of their rights and of statutory derivative action and so that they are confident enough to go on the Internet and call it up and read it, if that is what they want, or go to the library and pull the book out and read it. The education should go to their private capacity and to their knowledge that there is a regulatory authority there so that if they feel they cannot pursue the case they can go to the regulatory authority and have it help them kick it off.
My greatest fear—and I am in no way trying to be critical, except in a generic sense—is that this view of the world that everyone has access because it is there is not 
 true. It is not the case in education, it is not the case in the law and it is not the case in a variety of things in the real world. This parliament has upon it an onus to look at what happens in the real world and the effect on people in the real world, and if there is an in-built disincentive we should recognise that and allow at least the option for an alternative. That is all this amendment is seeking to do: to create the option of an alternative to avoid and perhaps get around that disincentive. What is critical is the education process. True empowerment of the shareholders comes through education. It does not just come through getting a dividend cheque once a year. It comes through understanding their obligations and their rights and what legal avenues are available to them. That is true empowerment. It is not just having a share and getting your dividend; it is about participating, having the understanding to defend your rights and having access to the means to defend your rights.
	 Question put:
	 That opposition amendments (5) and (6) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-13,"—The opposition opposes section 614 and schedule 3, items 283 and 363, in the following terms:
(8)	 Schedule 1, item 5, page 129 (line 9) to page 130 (line 23), section 614, TO BE OPPOSED.
(35)	 Schedule 3, item 283, page 405 (line 26) to page 406 (line 2), TO BE OPPOSED.
(36)	 Schedule 3, item 363, page 418 (lines 12 to 21), TO BE OPPOSED.
The opposition understands the arguments for the mandatory bid proposal, but the arguments against it clearly outweigh the arguments for. As I noted yesterday in my speech on the second reading, the opposition acknowledges that there are economic efficiency reasons for increasing takeover activity or at least the threat of it. But it comes at a cost that is potentially more than the opposition is willing to risk. The cost will come from the subversion of good corporate governance principles such as transparency, accountability and equity. No longer will there be an appropriate competitive regime for corporate control and, despite the proposed safeguards, shareholders will not get a better price than that obtained from an auction process. We will move to omit the mandatory bid rule so as to ensure that transparency in the markets is maintained. We oppose these provisions as we strongly 
 question the need for this new rule. We believe that it would lead to significant disadvantages and few benefits.
What does the government propose with this new rule? The government wants to give takeover bidders control of a target company before the market has been advised of the takeover bid. The government wishes to encourage bidders to try and lock up key blocks of shares before launching their takeover bid. The result of this proposal is that it could grant the bidder effective control of a target company before revealing its intentions. Why would some takeover bidders want the mandatory bid rule? They would have a mechanism to discourage competitors emerging in the takeover process. Under such an arrangement, competitive bidders and directors of target companies would have less time to appropriately respond to takeover bids. Discovery of fair prices would also be restricted, as there would no longer be an auction process.
The mandatory bid rule would not be consistent with the proposed operation of the new takeover panel, except for earlier amendments today giving an exemption on the grounds of unconscionable conduct, because the rule would go against the Eggleston principles, principles on which the proposed takeover panel would consider and making judgment on takeover disputes. It is important to reiterate what those Eggleston principles are. Some people think they are a bit old-fashioned, a bit old hat, but these are the principles that have got us through the Asian crisis and these are the principles that have instilled integrity and confidence in the Australian capital markets. The Eggleston principles require: that shareholders of a takeover target company know the identity of any person that proposes to acquire a substantial interest in the company; that target shareholders and directors have sufficient time to consider the offer; that sufficient material is provided to them to make proper assessment of the offer; and that all shareholders have equal opportunity to participate in the benefits of a takeover offer. The mandatory bid rule breaks these principles. The government is effectively sacrificing a lot in terms of good 
 corporate governance practices for potentially little gain in takeover activity.
Forget the mandatory bid rule. The opposition has indicated that it is willing to support the CGT concession on scrip for scrip takeovers. This, more than the mandatory bid, will raise takeover levels. If the new tax arrangement does not deliver then we might reconsid er opposition on the mandatory bid rule. But right now the arguments put forward on the mandatory bid rule do not wash with this opposition. Let me reiterate: the mandatory bid rule will not benefit shareholders. It will lower the share price of takeover targets; it will simply allow takeover bidders to pay a lower price. The argument that Senator Ian Campbell put forward last night was that what we aim to do is increase the market for corporate control. We want more competition and more pressure to be placed on directors, particularly at the big end of town. I could not agree with Senator Campbell more. That is one of the reasons why we support scrip for scrip. That potential for takeover, that competitive pressure, is critical to the good functioning of Australia's economy and the benefits that come from that.
But Senator Campbell went on to make a range of remarks in his speech which I believe do not reflect well on the intention of this bill. He talks about dopes who say, `I'll ring around and see if I can get a better offer.' There are dopes out there who may say, `I have a potentially controlling interest in a company and I'll take the first offer that comes up.' Senator Campbell, I believe you would be right in many examples. But there are examples where a good analyst can look at a situation and at somebody who controls a parcel of shares and say, `That person is under a bit of financial pressure at the moment. That person has a significant cash flow problem and they might just be willing to part with those shares for less than they would be able to get in the auction process.'
So you can have a situation where a vulnerable shareholder is in a position where they actually sell for less—what you would define as a dope. But, because they are under some pressure for a whole range of other economic circumstances, they may be willing 
 to sell out for less than the control premium might otherwise be analysed for. That would mean that all the other shareholders get that same offer and so, while you may be able to argue that there are not that many dopes out there, this is not a question about dopes; it is a question about whether or not people are in a position where they are vulnerable at certain times of the economic cycle.
If there is a bit of a downturn, you could get a situation where companies need to restructure; they may need to make changes. Individuals may need to change their portfolios for a variety of reasons, and a good analyst will pick this and will be able to move in and get access to the key bundle of shares to transfer control at less than they otherwise would get in an auction process. It is undeniable that the auction process will get a higher price in the circumstances and it is for this reason—as well as for some of the others that I have outlined—that we believe that the intention of this change is good but that the costs to the broader Australian community and to the integrity of the market are too great for us to go down this path.
As I have indicated, we may be willing to have a look at this down the track if this problem continues to be there. As for scrip for scrip, I think the government lauded it when the Ralph report came down. The Ralph report said scrip for scrip could double the amount of takeovers, and more power to it on that front. But, if for some reason that does not eventuate and that is a bit of government hype, then we may be prepared to revisit this issue. But at this stage those of us who want to see that competitive pressure and see takeover activity increasing believe that scrip for scrip is by far the measure that will most lead to that pressure. The mandatory bid has too many negatives to it and therefore we urge the Senate to reject it.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-13,"—I am going to make my remarks relevant to opposition amendments Nos 8, 7, 9 to 16, and 35 and 36, which are all in that block on the sheet, to get it over with and to get the understanding of what we are about. The opposition amendments relate to the deletion of all the provisions relating to the 
 introduction of a mandatory bid rule. At present the law provides that any person who holds less than 20 per cent of the shares in a company cannot acquire more shares if the acquisition of those shares would result in them owning more than 20 per cent of the company, unless they make a public offer to  purchase all of the remaining shares in the company. So, in other words, there is a mandatory bid rule at present which is of a different order.
For example, if you owned 19 per cent of the shares in a company, you could not purchase another 1½ per cent unless you offered to acquire all the remaining shares in the company, and you must make the same offer to all other shareholders. What often results is that, when the announcement is made that a person is offering to take over the company and purchase the remaining 81 per cent, other individuals and companies make counter offers to buy out the rest of the company. This results in an auction for the shares in the company to the highest takeover bidder.
This bill proposes the introduction of a mandatory bid rule. This will allow a person to make a private agreement with another shareholder to purchase their shares which will take them over the 20 per cent limit. When that agreement is concluded, the purchaser is then obliged to make a full takeover offer to purchase all remaining shares in the company. This means that a person could, for example, start off holding 19 per cent of the shares in the company and then reach a private agreement with another shareholder—the first seller—to acquire their 15 per cent holding, taking them to 34 per cent.
It will quite often be the case that a 34 per cent holder—or whatever the percentage may be—has effective control of the company and this will deter any other shareholder or potential shareholder from making a counter offer for shares in the company. The result is that there is not an auction process for control of the company because the takeover bidder has already been able to obtain effective control through the private agreement with the first seller. The argument in favour of the proposed mandatory bid rule is that it makes 
 company takeovers easier because the takeover bidders can secure control of the company privately before launching the full takeover bid. The suggestion is that the increased threat of being taken over applies pressure on managers and directors to perform better.
The government's announcement in relation to capital gains tax rollover relief for scrip for scrip takeover, which the Democrats support, will remove a substantial impediment on takeover activity. I take the view that this will have a much greater impact on takeover activity than the introduction of a mandatory bid rule. At this stage, the Australian Democrats will not support the introduction of the mandatory bid rule, but we may well be prepared to revisit this issue at a future time if it becomes apparent that takeover activity is suffering as a result of the absence of the rule.
Let me make it clear that we believe the government has made a good case. We have also had presentations from such informed professionals as the Australian Securities Institute and we are aware of overseas precedent in this area. However, the arguments against it are such that, at this time, we have decided to take a cautionary stance on this and to be careful about introducing something which may not be necessary additional to the other changes which, in terms of this bill and in terms of the proposed tax rollover relief for scrip for scrip takeover, will significantly increase takeover activity. Parliamentary Secretary, I know that you have a particular passion for this area of the bill. I believe it may be appropriate to revisit this issue after the new bill has bedded down for some time so that we can assess just how these matters are progressing.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-13,"—I want to make some quick remarks. The government, after over two years of very close consideration of this measure, is strongly committed to ensuring alternative mechanisms for putting pressure on directors. This is a measure that finds its most strong opposition 
 from the big end of town and directors who are comfortable in the knowledge that Australia's existing takeover laws do produce the odd auction here and there but more often produce takeovers bogged down in litigation within minutes of any bid coming to fruition as soon as the defence for the takeover cuts  into action. That is why under our regime so little pressure is put on boards in Australia.
The other people who oppose this are the sort of people who Senator Conroy met at that seminar the other day who went white. They are indeed the lawyers who make fortunes—millions of dollars—out of takeover defences. That is why we believe in a mandatory bid, which ensures that, under the Eggleston principles, all shareholders share in the benefit of the premium. We believe that shareholders will receive more offers because there will be more takeover activity. We know that a shareholder who has a stake that is likely to deliver control, no matter if they are under financial pressure, will at least be able to pick up the phone and phone around and seek to get a higher bid. We also know that the auction is not eliminated—that if someone else wants to buy that company, they can come onto the market and bid at a much higher price and seek to attract other shareholders with their bid.
But recognising that I have failed to convince the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party of the benefits of this, I do genuinely accept the Labor Party's view that they are prepared to look at this again. I accept very much that the Democrats have made a decision on balance—that they are not opposed to this, but they are not quite in favour of it. I also put on the record a letter that I have received today from Ted Rofe, the head of the Australian Shareholders Association, saying that they are not opposed to the mandatory bids. So this is the organisation that represents the minority interests saying that they are not opposed to it. They recognise that it may reduce the opportunity for auctions. I will quote from Ted's letter and I thank him personally for putting this on the record. He says:
We believe that the conditions proposed to be applied to the mandatory bid should provide adequate protections for minority shareholders. 

Having said all of that, the government will proceed with this. We would like to have it revisited. We will refer it to the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities so that it can be further considered, and we will bring it back at the earliest possible time because we think it is very much in the interests of minor shareholders and the whole economy.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1999-10-13,"—Tonight I rise to report to the Senate on the rapidly changing situation with BHP steelworks in Newcastle. Last time I spoke we were then right on the cusp of the shutdown of the smelting operations in Newcastle. I did indicate at that time that BHP 
 was now just a small player in the Hunter economy—this was before smelting was shut down. It was at that time employing one per cent of the work force. It was only the third largest employer, following the Hunter Area Health Service and the university. I would  like to emphasise yet again—because this message seems to have been lost across Australia and indeed the world—that we were not shutting down steel production in Newcastle; just smelting. We were still employing 1,100 people in the rolling of steel and if you add in Tubemakers—a subsidiary of BHP—which then uses that product, another 600 again. There are still 1,700 steelworkers in Newcastle in the rod, bar and wire divisions and Tubemakers.
When smelting shut down, 2,100 people were case managed by BHP in five streams through their very successful Job Pathways program. Twenty-five million dollars was injected by BHP, by the New South Wales government and the federal government to assist in the process of moving people who were losing their jobs onto one of these five pathways. At the end of this process, when it comes to looking at how many people are going to have some difficulty finding work, we come down to a figure of 600 direct employees and 100 subcontractors—a total of 700.
Since I made my last matter of public interest speech on this matter, the shutdown has actually occurred. The press really tried to turn this into a bad news story and failed dismally. I was on Sky News, and they were carrying international images of the steelworks, my voiceover and funeral music in the background. But the image on the day was very different as steelmaking in Newcastle was shut down. The image on the day was of the workers coming out of the gate in quite a happy mood—almost a party mood. You must ask, `Why not?' For some of them who had put in 22 years of service in the steel industry, they were walking out with superannuation plus $80,000 in severance pay. This of course is a great financial boost to the Hunter economy.
The mood of the day was best captured on the Channel 9 news report that night. A 
 reporter, obviously trying to get a bad news story, went up to one of the workers and asked, `Where to for you now?' and the worker said, `The Phoenix Club, mate, and it's your shout!' That sort of positive response helped kill the bad news story. BHP are to be congratulated on the management of this process. With such a good outcome, it is obviously an example of world best practice in the management of the downsizing of a work force.
It is a great pity that BHP did not give the same degree of thought or put the same effort into developing similar processes when they moved on to the next stage last week. They hardly let the people of Newcastle catch their breath before they announced, within one week of the shutdown, that they were going to sell off quite a considerable number of their steel assets. They are retaining some steel business. They plan to retain the Port Kembla steelworks, Coated Steel Australia and Asia, Steel Building Products Australia, New Zealand Steel and Steel Building Products Asia. These businesses employ 13,500 people, and they are part of the retained portfolio of BHP. They are divesting the Long Products Division, which is mainly based in Newcastle but has a number of other centres around Australia; Tubemakers; Structural and Pipelines Products; tin mills; Coated Steel Corporation USA; Steel Building Products USA/Pacific; and North Star. There are approximately 9,000 employees there.
When BHP made this announcement, they gave the civic leaders of Newcastle some warning and did call a number of us in to explain what they were doing. I expressed disappointment that they had made the announcement at a time when they did not have a definite buyer, thereby creating uncertainty, and that they were not prepared to stay in a comprehensive steel industry.
Over the last 15 years BHP have upgraded the Port Kembla steelworks. It is now the third most efficient integrated steelworks in the world. They closed down the ageing smelter in Newcastle and they still have a comparative advantage in  Whyalla, with high-grade, quality ore and at least 15 years supply of ore close to the mill. Those three 
 elements I have just mentioned provide the ingredients to rebuild a world-class, comprehensive steel industry. Unfortunately, with that sort of opportunity BHP seem to have lost the will to do that. Of course it is a commercial decision, and BHP have made  that decision in the context of a global steel industry—and they have every right to make that decision. They face intense competition worldwide; falling prices; increasingly demanding customer needs; the emergence of new low capital intensive technologies, particularly arc furnace technology; and the need for a relentless focus on cost reduction. The government cannot change that.
Kevin Maher, the head of the Ironworkers Union in the city, expressed the hope that the next buyer will be more committed to the steel industry. The good news is that BHP does not plan to shut down any of these businesses. What it plans to do is to sell them off. Announcing these initiatives on 6 October, the President of BHP Steel, Bob Every, said:
These changes give effect to the strategic objective of building on the company's strong position in minerals, while taking advantage of niche opportunities in steel. They are an essential part of BHP's evolution if it is to remain a global player.
These changes are not about closing businesses. They aim to focus BHP on operations that are consistent with portfolio objectives and to allow other companies, with different objectives, to bid for businesses that no longer fit the BHP portfolio.
The reason for the loss of will on steel by BHP is to be found in a speech to the Australian Investment Conference by the  Managing Director and CEO of BHP, Paul Anderson. The speech was peppered with phrases like `It will be a company focused on creating value for shareholders', `Focus on these activities that will accelerate growth in shareholder value', `We will continue to reduce employee numbers and strive for efficiency', `Cost will be king', `The response to globalisation is mega consolidation', and `BHP will be a natural resource company with a steel component'.
This shows the driving force behind BHP's quite proper commercial decision. However, I feel that the founders of BHP, Guillaume Delprat and Essington Lewis, would be 
 turning in their graves. They had a vision and they built, through the first half of this century, a vast industrial conglomerate, starting with minerals and then moving into mining and manufacturing. One hundred years later, BHP, the Big Australian, is shrinking back towards its beginnings.
If the new investors had lifted their vision above the short-term bottom line, they could have reignited that original vision. I hold hope that their limited vision of a company with a narrow base does not create long-term value problems for their shareholders. I also hope that their move away from a comprehensive steel industry, which in the future may not include high-tensile rod and bar products, does not create long-term strategic difficulties for Australia. The founders of BHP Steel, Delprat and Lewis, understood its strategic value when they built a comprehensive steel industry between World War I and World War II. It is a pity that this vision has been lost with the passage of time.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Newcastle: Closure of BHP Steelworks</title>,Adjournment,28,1
