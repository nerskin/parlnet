Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (09:01):  by leave—Eleven years ago, under Taliban rule, terrorists trained freely in Afghanistan to kill Australians and to attack our ally the United States. Today, international terrorism finds no safe haven in Afghanistan. The 50 nations of the International Security Assistance Force, the 80 nations engaged in development and governance, the United Nations, our Afghan partners—we are all determined to make sure it never does again.


Today the House, and through it the people, should know what progress we are making in Australia’s mission in Afghanistan—and what this progress means for our commitment in the coming year and in the years ahead. The House and the people should know what the government is doing to help Afghanistan prepare for its future after transition is complete. And the House and the people should resolve not only to remember the 39 Australians who died in Afghanistan but to care for those they left at home and for their mates when they return.


2012 has brought important progress in transition in Afghanistan. Three years ago, at West Point, in December 2009, President Obama announced a new strategy: focused on counter-insurgency and designed to achieve transition. Two years ago, at Lisbon, in November 2010, the nations of NATO, ISAF and the Afghan government agreed to the transition plan: for Afghanistan to take charge of its security by the end of 2014.


These are the facts on the ground in Afghanistan today. Three of the five tranches of Afghan provinces and districts have begun transition. All the provincial capitals and 75 per cent of the country’s population are in areas where the Afghan National Security Forces lead on security. The ANSF are close to their full surge strength of 352,000. They lead on more than 80 per cent of all security operations and make up more than three-quarters of all uniformed personnel in the country.


As transition proceeds, international forces will do less partnering in the field and provide more support through smaller advisory teams. This does not mean the end of combat for international forces, but it does mean, gradually and carefully, international forces are moving to a supporting role. By the middle of next year, when the fifth and final tranche is due to begin, the ANSF will have lead responsibility for security across the whole country.


I met General John Allen, the ISAF Commander, on 14 October, during my visit to Kabul. He is pleased with what he sees as the ANSF continues to demonstrate this increasing capability and capacity. With two years remaining before the end of transition, he is confident that ISAF's mission will conclude with the ANSF well prepared to maintain long-term security in Afghanistan. The Minister for Defence will also update the parliament on detailed developments in Afghanistan.


We can and should conclude that today, across Afghanistan, the process of transition is on track. In Uruzgan province, where Australia’s efforts are centred, transition commenced on 17 July of this year and will follow this model. These are the facts on the ground there.


Transition has commenced and the 4th Brigade is assuming the lead on security operations. The main districts are under government control. The Afghan security presence in outlying districts has expanded over the past two years with the growth of the ANSF. Insurgent attacks have fallen. One of the 4th Brigade’s kandaks is now operating independently and, based on current progress, the other three should commence independent operations by the end of this year.


As transition proceeds in the province, Australia will adjust our military and civilian posture there. Our main focus will be at Brigade Headquarters and the provincial Operations Coordination Centre. The ADF will advise and train the Afghan National Army’s logistics, engineering and other combat support elements. Our Mentoring Task Force will shift to a smaller advisory task force model, we will cease routine partnered operations at the kandak level and our presence will consolidate in the multinational base at Tarin Kot.


Let me emphasise that this shift in posture, likely to occur around the end of the year, is not the end of our combat operations in Uruzgan. Our Special Operations Task Group will continue to operate against the insurgency and our advisory task force will retain a combat-ready capability. This is the course of transition in Uruzgan.


On 18 October, Australia assumed command of Combined Team-Uruzgan. We now oversee the critical phase of transition in the province. We will take account of the conditions on the ground and the evolving capabilities of the 4th Brigade. The shift in our posture will be gradual and measured, closely aligned with the broader ISAF transition strategy and consulting closely with Afghan and provincial authorities. This is the key judgement which will be before us in the year to come: judging the progress of transition and delivering the phases by which it is completed.


When I addressed the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in April, the government’s view was that, once started, transition in Uruzgan should take 12 to 18 months and that, when transition is complete, the majority of our troops will have returned home. Six months on, and three months in to transition, our analysis is that this remains the case. As we begin detailed planning for its final phases, which of course remain some time off, it is likely that we will identify the need for some additional personnel and resources to complete those final phases of practical extraction and repatriation. We will apply the lessons of previous operational drawdowns to ensure stability and security through the whole period. And, when transition in Uruzgan is complete, we will remain committed to the ISAF strategy for nationwide transition, advising the ANSF as they develop their command and logistics capabilities and providing institutional training.


The Australian Federal Police has done important work training the Afghan National Police at the Police Training Centre at Tarin Kot. As transition proceeds, our future effort will focus on leadership training and strategic advisory support at the national level. This will help the Afghan National Police manage their own transition: from paramilitary activity as part of the counterinsurgency, to a constabulary force performing conventional civilian policing roles.


Our development aid effort will continue. Australian aid is making a real difference to the lives of the Afghan people, and helping their nation on the path to development and peace. In Uruzgan, the Australian-led Provincial Reconstruction Team does great work: contributing to a sixfold increase in the number of schools operating, tripling the number of active health facilities and supporting a stronger provincial administration. As transition proceeds in Uruzgan, our aid workers and diplomats will continue their important task. This will be the work of transition through the year ahead.


A new threat to our mission has been emerging in Afghanistan for some time—insider attacks. In my discussions with President Karzai this month, it was clear to me that he understands the threat these attacks pose to our mission. In my discussions with General Allen, he expressed his personal sympathy for Australia’s losses. He was also just as conscious as our own commanders of the need for the right mix of force protection measures.


Australia is not alone. Many of our international partners have also suffered casualties. Overnight, we received reports of an insider attack on British troops in Helmand province. Indeed, insider attacks have targeted Afghan troops in even greater numbers than international troops.


This is how we are protecting our troops. First, in order to know how best to counter the threat, our commanders have analysed the attacks and their circumstances. Each attack has specific motivations and specific circumstances. We must understand them to defeat them.


Second, in the wake of the insider attack on 29 August this year, we reviewed force protection to counter the risks of insider threats. Naturally, we do not publicly detail the nature of these. The government continually reviews the professional advice on force protection measures to ensure the risks of such attacks are minimised: I am confident that we are doing all that we can.


Third, the Afghan government has now been conducting biometric screening and other information gathering for all ANSF recruits for two years. Recruits are subject to an eight-step vetting process, supported by information sharing and overseen by the international force. The Afghan Ministry of the Interior, along with coalition partners, works to identify insurgent sympathisers and subversive elements within the security forces. These are important countermeasures.


We know it would be a strategic mistake to overestimate the enemy’s strengths or achievements. To see an adversary’s hand where it may not exist only enhances the propaganda value of an attack. This difficult military environment and determined insurgent enemy breeds asymmetric threats—spectacular attacks, roadside bombs, insider attacks—often designed to influence international opinion. We know the impact of these attacks on the troops and their units, on their families and on the Australian public is very significant. Australia has suffered four insider attacks in all so far, with seven killed and 12 wounded. The greater strategic threat of insider attacks comes not from the attacks themselves, but from the risk that we respond to them wrongly.


The best evidence that we will prevail against the threat from insider attacks is this: we have not allowed it to disrupt our training and operations with the 4th Brigade. Every day, our troops and police, diplomats and development advisers get on with the job. I saw them during my most recent visit to Kabul and Tarin Kot on 14 October and I can tell the House this: their courage will not fail. They are getting the job done every day. And they are determined to complete their mission of training and transition.


2012 has brought important progress in Afghanistan. It has also brought important decisions on our future course there. As a partner of Afghanistan, as a member of ISAF and now as a member of the UN Security Council, Australia will be an active participant in this planning in the coming year. In May, when President Karzai and I signed a Comprehensive Long-Term Partnership agreement, Australia joined a growing group of countries, including the United States, India and China, who have partnerships with Afghanistan to help consolidate and build on the gains of the past 10 years. The Chicago NATO-ISAF Summit set milestones for transition and agreed to a new NATO training mission post-2014. The Tokyo Conference saw international agreement to an aid and development plan and specific pledges of support.


2013 will now bring important preparations for the period after transition is complete. When transition is complete across Afghanistan at the end of 2014, the government of Afghanistan will have full responsibility for security.


The broad outlines of a comprehensive framework for supporting Afghanistan beyond 2014 are now agreed. There will be substantial international financial support to sustain strong Afghan defence and police forces. The international community is looking to commit US$3.6 billion each year from 2015 to 2017. As I announced in Chicago, Australia is contributing US$100 million in three years. There will be a new NATO-led mission after 2014—not for combat, but to train, advise and assist the ANSF. Australia will make a contribution to this mission including through the Afghan National Army Officer Academy.


To guard against any possibility of a return of international terrorism in Afghanistan, I expect the United States and Afghan governments to discuss possible future arrangements for counter-terrorism training and operations. As I have stated previously, the Australian government is prepared to consider a limited Special Forces contribution, in the right circumstances and under the right mandate.


There will be substantial international development assistance and support for Afghanistan’s economic and social development: the ultimate proof against conflict and instability. At Chicago, I pledged Australian development assistance to Afghanistan will rise from A$165 million in 2011-12 to A$250 million by 2015-16, as part of the international community's commitment to provide US$16 billion over four years from 2014.


Beyond 2014, Australia will still have a national interest in denying international terrorism a safe haven in Afghanistan. It will still be in our national interest to remain part of the broad international effort to support Afghanistan—and to ensure the Afghan government remains an active partner. At Tokyo, Australia joined in the Mutual Accountability Framework, by which the Afghan government made important commitments in this respect.


Through our aid program we will encourage the Afghan government to fulfil its reform commitments. It must strengthen governance, combat corruption, promote the rule of law and uphold the rights and freedoms for Afghan men and women guaranteed in the Afghan constitution.


We will also help the Afghans prepare for the 2014 presidential elections. I welcome the Afghan government’s commitment to announce the elections time line soon. Credible, inclusive and transparent elections, following the presidential elections of 2004 and 2009 and the parliamentary elections of 2005 and 2010, are among the most important signs of Afghanistan’s decade-long transformation. So our aid will support the electoral process.


With Afghanistan firmly responsible for the security of its sovereign state after 2014, international political and diplomatic efforts to support peace and stability in Afghanistan and in its region will be central. We will continue to support an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned process of peace building which protects the gains of the past decade in areas such as democracy and human rights, including the rights of women and children. We support reconciliation and the reintegration of insurgents who are prepared to lay down their arms, renounce violence, cut ties with al-Qaeda and respect the Afghanistan constitution.


The constructive engagement and support of Afghanistan's neighbours, in particular of Pakistan, is also essential over time. For instance, the Istanbul process to strengthen trade links and tackle common security concerns through what is known as the 'Heart of Asia' region is an important international initiative. In a conflict-riven region, there is growing recognition from regional leaders that all have a long-term interest in a secure, stable, self-governing Afghanistan. I welcome the comments of the President of Pakistan that his country respects and supports reconciliation and peace efforts by the government of Afghanistan. I also welcome the Pakistani government’s direct appeal to the Taliban to participate in these reconciliation and peace efforts. We will work with Afghanistan—and with Pakistan—in those areas where our best judgement is that cooperation against terrorism which threatens both states is effective and real. And we will do whatever else we judge best makes a difference in this difficult and sensitive task.


Our progress since 2009, our plans through to 2014 and beyond, should give Australians cause for measured confidence and resolve. We are part of a sound international strategy: transition to Afghan-led security, then support to Afghanistan for development and peace. Our contribution today is proportionate to our own interest and to the contribution of our allies and the world: our troops number around 1,550 out of a 100,000-strong coalition force, supporting a near 352,000-strong ANSF. Our mission in Uruzgan is clear and achievable: to prepare the 4th Brigade for a handover of full security responsibility. Our commitment to Afghanistan is in Australia’s national interest. We are there to deny international terrorism a safe haven, to stand firm with our ally the United States.


In Afghanistan and in Uruzgan, we see progress, but of course it is not perfect. We know this—I know this—and our plans reflect this. Throughout the three years of the new international strategy, the international coalition and the Afghan government have held a very realistic view of the evolving environment and changes in the nature of the insurgent threat.


We know that as Afghan forces increasingly take the lead through 2013, the Taliban will seek to test them. We know that not every valley or village in Uruzgan or Afghanistan will be peaceful or free from insurgency. There will be difficult days ahead, setbacks in the transition process, days when our resolve will be tested. 


We will stand firm. As a nation, we have a job to do. It is a difficult and dangerous one and we are determined to complete it—not to make things perfect, but to ensure that Afghanistan will never again be what it was in 2001: a place where terrorists trained and prepared to attack us. Across Afghanistan, the national government and the Afghan and international forces are making progress in transition. And we are preparing for the future beyond 2014. 


Thirty-nine Australians have been killed in action in our decade in Afghanistan. Each that we lose takes part of us. We have not known loss like this in 40 years. Seven Australians have died since my statement to the parliament on our mission last year. Sergeant Blaine Diddams was killed in a firefight with insurgents on 2 July. Lance Corporal Stjepan Milosevic, Private Robert Poate and Sapper James Martin were killed by an insider attack on 29 August. Private Nathanael Galagher and Lance Corporal Mervyn McDonald were killed in a helicopter crash on 30 August. Corporal Scott Smith was killed by an improvised explosive device on 21 October. His funeral will be held in coming days. 


The poet John Manifold wrote of the 'cairn of words' we build over our silent dead. Yes, we will remember them. And it is right that we give words to our sorrow and pride. But we must do more. Their widows, their children, their wounded mates—these Australians live on, they live amongst us, as we who are left grow old. 


I had the privilege of visiting some of them last week. I was overwhelmed by their determination to overcome, to return from their wounding to supreme physical fitness, to return to their duties. But they will never forget the bomb, the bullet, the helicopter crash. They could not forget, even if they tried. We have an obligation to them too. The next decade will see more young Australian combat veterans live in our community than since the 1970s. This is demanding changes in the way the Department of Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs care for service personnel and veterans. 


Organisations such as Legacy and the RSL have performed nearly a century of service to care for those to whom we owe so much. Their invaluable work goes on. In continuing to provide this support and care for Australian soldiers, these organisations will be seeking to adapt to the changing, younger profile of the Australian veteran. New organisations such as Soldier On have been established to help our wounded service men and women and their families achieve great things despite their wounds. 


Every Australian should know—you can lend a hand. Give generously, buy a badge, visit, become a volunteer. Respect for our soldiers and veterans is precious: please say hello and say thanks. We have known loss in Afghanistan—but we have known more. We have seen astonishing courage. Some Australians have performed acts of the most extreme bravery in the presence of the enemy. Many more demonstrate a quiet courage, in their devotion to duty every day under the strain of war—in the villages, on the airfield, in the workshop. Their service has kept us safer from terrorism. They have given us cause for confidence and an example of resolve. For us, they march down a hard path in Afghanistan. They know that, for our nation, any other path would risk much more. We will support them as they serve us in Afghanistan and when they return. We will see them through.


I thank the House and I present a copy of my statement.

",HoR,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Afghanistan</title>,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,1,1,speech
"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2012-10-31,"



Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (09:30):  I rise to support the comprehensive statement of the Prime Minister and I welcome this chance to express the coalition's support for our continuing military commitment to Afghanistan. After another year of military operations, it is fitting that we in this parliament should recommit to the campaign. Again I place on record the coalition's pride in the magnificent work of the Australian forces there. Their job is difficult and dangerous but they undertake it with great skill and dedication.


We mourn the 39 Australians killed. They are our finest. We honour them and we will never forget them. They join the 60,000 Australians killed in World War I, the 39,000 killed in World War II, the 340 killed in the Korean War, the 521 killed in Vietnam and others on our national roll of honour. We also pay tribute to the 242 who have been wounded in the line of duty. Those who have not recovered fully from their injuries must have the best possible support.


We grieve with the families of the dead and the wounded. The dead, the wounded and the grieving have paid a heavy price but it has not been in vain. The best available assessments are that al-Qaeda has largely lost the capacity to inflict harm on Western countries, if not the will. It remains dangerous and we must remain vigilant, but it is on a path to defeat. In Afghanistan, the best advice is that the International Security Assistance Force and its Afghan partners have continued to make security gains. As the Prime Minister has noted, Afghan security forces now have lead responsibility for all the provincial capitals and for the areas with most of the country's population. But progress is fragile. The Taliban remains difficult to dislodge across significant parts of the country's south and the border with Pakistan, where insurgents continue to find safe haven, remains porous.


Assessments are mixed about whether the Afghan security forces will be ready to cope with taking on prime security responsibility after 2014. There is no certainty that hard-won gains can be held. There was never going to be a clear victory in this war. Still, each village that is no longer subject to extortion, each child whose horizons have been lifted and each girl who is now able to go to school and make her own life constitutes a kind of victory. Every day when life is better than it would otherwise have been is a victory and every day is better thanks to the presence of Australian forces.


Australia went to Afghanistan with our allies and we will leave with our allies. The United States, Britain and other contributors to the International Security Assistance Force have laid out a clear time frame for transition to full Afghan responsibility for combat operations by the end of 2014. All the contributors to the International Security Assistance Force emphasise that Afghanistan will not be abandoned beyond 2014 and I welcome the Prime Minister's commitment to an ongoing training role for our forces and to a likely and important anti-terrorist role for our special forces.


In Uruzgan, our area of prime responsibility, progress has been better than in the country as a whole, according to our own military commanders' assessments. That is why the task force can be smaller and troops can be withdrawn sooner than previously expected. In July, the Afghan government confirmed that Uruzgan was moving to Afghan-led security responsibility. If the transition goes to plan and the Afghan forces there are able to do their job, the bulk of the Australian forces should be able to return by the end of next year.


Our troop numbers are already dwindling. Within weeks the 750-strong 3RAR Task Group will be replaced by a smaller 7RAR Task Group, numbering about 450. Our role will shortly change from 'mentoring' the Afghan forces to 'advising' them. Our infantry will no longer be permanently at any of the current forward operating bases. They will do little, if any, patrolling with the Afghan Army but will, instead, advise them in the conduct of their own independent operations.


Our soldiers should not be in Afghanistan a moment longer than is necessary but should not leave while there is a job to do. If the transition from mentoring to advising to withdrawing leaves behind an Afghan Army capable of managing its own security, that will represent a job well done. In any event, our soldiers will be able to leave with their heads held high and their professionalism universally respected. They will have done all that and more than has ever been asked of them.


Australians were recently reminded of the evil we face in Afghanistan when the Pakistani Taliban attempted to murder a 14-year-old schoolgirl, Malala Yousafzai, for advocating a fair go for women, including girls' rights to education. Thanks to our soldiers' work, more schools are open in Uruzgan and many girls are getting an education for the first time.


Since the departure of the Dutch in mid-2010, the Australian mentoring task force has had a bigger job. With more responsibility has come more danger. This helps to explain the loss of 28 soldiers in the past three years, compared to 11 in the previous eight years of our involvement. I thank the Prime Minister for the very full account she has given of the efforts to protect our soldiers from treacherous allies. Betrayal like this saps our will to fight. That is why the Taliban devote such time to turning Afghan troops. It is reassuring that our own soldiers speak highly of their Afghan allies, most of whom they regard as worthy comrades. Having spoken to our soldiers, I cannot imagine a situation where our opponents have more determination or more warrior cunning than our Australian soldiers.   


The Howard government originally judged that it was in Australia's national interest to help evict the Taliban from power and to secure an Afghanistan that would never again grant sanctuary to al-Qaeda. It is to the credit of the Rudd and Gillard governments that they have maintained their predecessor's commitment and were even prepared to strengthen it following the withdrawal of most Australian forces from Iraq.


First, al-Qaeda represented a direct threat to all Western countries, as the September 11 atrocities demonstrated and as subsequent ones, such as in Bali and London, have confirmed. Al-Qaeda and its associates have murdered 108 Australians. It has also been a deadly threat to our own country from within, as shown by home-grown terrorist plots—all of which, thankfully, have so far been foiled. Second, it is in Australia's enduring national interest to be a reliable ally and friend. It is in our national character not to let down our friends when they need help. It is right that we have made a contribution to the worldwide struggle against Islamist extremism. Third, it is consistent with our best values as a nation to back efforts to remove an oppressive regime and to help establish a freer and fairer society in Afghanistan—especially for women.


I have to say that Afghanistan is unlikely to become a pluralist, liberal democracy any time soon. But that does not mean that Afghans have no wish to be free to choose their own rulers and their own way of life. Of course, after we have expended so much blood and treasure for so long, it is fair enough for Australians to ask why more has not been achieved. Still, the enthusiastic participation of great numbers of Afghans in multiparty elections in 2010, despite lethal intimidation, suggests that the desire for freedom and democracy is not merely a Western conceit.


We must count the cost of our continued commitment, but we must also count the cost of prematurely abandoning that mission. Should the international coalition's mission fail or end too soon, there is a strong risk that Afghanistan would once again descend into feudalism and once again become a base for international terrorism. If the Taliban were able to reassert control in Afghanistan, there would be a high risk that neighbouring Pakistan, a nuclear armed country under great internal pressure from its own extremists, could itself become critically destabilised. That is why this is not a distant struggle that we can safely ignore. I fully understand why many Australians would prefer to have our military forces out of harm's way, but we should be very wary of rushing for the exits and seeing much that has been achieved turn to dust. That would not be the right way to honour the sacrifice of our soldiers. 


Whatever the future holds, there is no doubt that the Australians in Afghanistan have acquitted themselves in the best Anzac tradition. There is no doubt that the experience of Afghanistan has honed the skill and professionalism of our armed forces. We all hope and pray that they will never again have to be put in harm's way, but we would be foolish indeed to expect a world without conflict or to imagine an Australia that does not need powerful armed forces. One day, perhaps, the lion might lie down with the lamb and swords might be beaten into ploughshares. But, until that day comes, we would be unwise not to maintain armed forces fit to intervene wherever Australia's interests and values are at stake.

Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management) (09:44):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I am pleased to introduce legislation to implement important reforms to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Family Court, the Federal Magistrates Court, the Federal Court and the National Native Title Tribunal.


The bill is also an important component of the Gillard government’s wider federal courts reform package, which includes my recent announcement of injecting an additional $38 million in funding across the forward estimates for the federal courts to maintain their services, particularly for regional residents and disadvantaged parties.


This legislation will:


facilitate the transfer of the National Native Title Tribunal’s administrative functions, staff and appropriation to the Federal Court, and


provide for the merger of the administration of the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court.


The bill implements recommendations of the review of small and medium agencies in the Attorney-General’s portfolio, completed by Mr Stephen Skehill and released in June 2012, which recommended changes to the operation, structure and administration of agencies in my portfolio.


While the amendments in this bill are largely of a technical and administrative nature, they will allow the courts to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their administrative structures, and allow court resources to be directed where they matter most: providing services to court users, particularly regional and disadvantaged parties.


This bill implements several Skehill review recommendations relating to the National Native Title Tribunal.


The review recommended both transferring native title mediation functions from the tribunal to the Federal Court and creating corporate efficiencies by removing the tribunal’s classification as a Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 agency and providing for its financing and staffing through the Federal Court.


The reforms will not only generate savings, but also result in a closer relationship between the agencies and promote more cohesive and timely operation of the native title system.


A preliminary transfer of functions has already allowed the tribunal to focus on its core area of strength—its crucial future acts functions—while the Federal Court, with strong results in the area, has been given control of native title mediation. 


This better alignment and allocation of functions builds on the government’s 2009 reforms, which first gave the Federal Court greater involvement in mediation. Those reforms have generated a four-fold increase in the rate of consent determinations, and this means less waiting for claimants and faster certainty for all affected parties.


This bill completes implementation of these reforms by clarifying the agencies’ administrative framework and ensuring that they can work together efficiently.


For example, the bill consolidates the tribunal and Federal Court as a single statutory agency under the Public Service Act 1999. This aligns the staffing and financial responsibilities of the Registrar of the Federal Court, who will now be the head of the consolidated agency for the purposes of both the FMA Act and the Public Service Act. The registrar’s powers are also better defined. These measures provide clarity for agencies and stakeholders.


These reforms also allow the tribunal and Federal Court to work more efficiently. The agencies will now share corporate services related to human resources, finances and information technology. Where possible, staff will work from the same buildings and share the same facilities. The compliance burdens under legislation such as the FMA Act will now also be shared.


The resulting efficiencies of these reforms are expected to generate $19 million in savings over the next four years.


In enabling the tribunal and the court to both operate more efficiently and to achieve better results, these reforms will support the government’s ongoing success in tackling the backlog of outstanding native title claims for the benefit of all stakeholders. 


This is why the changes are widely supported by stakeholders, and why we have organised a staged and ordered transition to make sure no matters currently underway will experience any delays.


As noted by Mr Skehill, the effective merging of the administration of the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court from November 2008 has been a significant achievement in cooperation between the two courts.  


Since 2009, the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court have operated with a single chief executive officer. The Chief Executive Officer of the Family Court has also been the acting Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Magistrates Court. The Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court already share many resources, including staff and facilities.


The amendments for the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court in this bill will clarify and formalise existing administrative structures, rather than fundamentally changing the way the courts operate. This is appropriate, as the two courts have cooperated effectively for several years.


I emphasise that the courts will retain their separate and distinct identities, with the Federal Magistrates Court in the process of changing its name to the Federal Circuit Court of Australia, to reflect the growth in its scope, workload and regional work over the past decade. 


However, formalising the shared administrative arrangements for the courts will allow them to achieve savings and operate more efficiently. 


For example, establishing the courts as a single agency for the purposes of the FMA Act with a single budget appropriation will mean that funds can be shared between the courts as necessary.


This measure will also allow the courts to produce a single set of financial statements for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of the FMA Act, which will eliminate significant duplication of the courts' work.


A range of provisions in the courts' current legislation are not compatible with the courts having a single chief executive officer and operating as a single agency for the purposes of the FMA Act.


This bill amends these provisions and ensures that the courts will be able to work effectively and efficiently under shared administration, unhindered by unnecessary procedural formalities. As such, it is appropriate to conduct this change as efficiently as possible, without creating new and separate legislation to add to the statute book. 


We are also in ongoing discussions with both courts to ensure their internal structures meet the needs of both the judiciary and court users.


This bill forms one part of this government's wider federal courts reform package. 


As noted earlier, the Gillard government is also putting the courts back on a firmer financial footing, by directing an additional $38 million over four years to the courts. The injection of new funds, derived from a change to fee structures, will ensure our courts can continue to deliver key services, including regional circuit work, which are vital for disadvantaged litigants and small businesses.


Other important aspects of this package of reforms include: 


establishing a transparent complaints process against judicial officers—the legislative framework for which was passed by the House earlier this sitting period; 


As noted already, the renaming of the Federal Magistrates Court as the Federal Circuit Court of Australia, and the renaming of federal magistrates as 'judges';


expanding the diversity judicial appointments, to better reflect the Australian community; and


establishing the Military Court of Australia, so that justice is available to Australian Defence Force members.


It is important that our federal courts and tribunals operate efficiently, are accessible to all parties, and provide effective forums for the resolution of disputes.


The bill enables the National Native Title Tribunal and the Federal Court of Australia to work more closely to achieve better native title outcomes.


And it will formalise the administrative structure that has proved successful for the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court since 2009, and will drive further efficiencies for these courts. I commend the bill to the House.


Debate adjourned.

Mr SECKER
 (Barker—Opposition Whip) (10:36):  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Standing order 222(iii) states that the Selection Committee:


… select bills that the committee regards as controversial or as requiring further consultation or debate for referral to the relevant standing or joint committee in accordance with standing order 143.


I advise the House that this occurred at approximately 9.30 pm last night in accordance with standing order 143. My question is: what now is the status of all that Selection Committee determination, as it has not been tabled?

Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter—Chief Government Whip) (10:37):  For the benefit of the House, I might be able to give Mr Secker at least a partial answer. My understanding is that around 9.30 last night a meeting of the Selection Committee was held, although unfortunately as a member of the Selection Committee I was not advised of that meeting. There are privileges issues here of course if it was a formally constituted meeting of the committee because, if that is the case, that report, as Mr Secker indicated, has not been tabled. Indeed, I would need clarification on the exact contents of that report and whether it accurately reflects the matter raised by the honourable member.


I make these points only because, Mr Deputy Speaker, I know that you are in no position to answer the question because you know nothing of the events of last evening and I again make the point that I do not know much more either. So I only rise in the spirit of goodwill to at least attempt to give the honourable member an answer, if only a partial answer, to his question.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (10:39):  I rise on the same point of order. We do need some urgency in clarifying this issue through the Speaker's office. I am a member of the Selection Committee and the processes of this House should not work whereby I find out about a disputed meeting right now that apparently took place at 9.30 last night whilst I was involved in a public hearing in the building and working in another role.


I am surprised to hear this and, if this is behind the machinations this morning—where we are seeing detailed legislation brought into the chamber for the first time, with second readings only half an hour later and with only one speaker on each of these substantial bills—we need to urgently clarify what has happened. We need to get the processes of this chamber back on track as quickly as possible. The safe port in all of this is the standing orders—the known procedures of this chamber. I urge the Speaker and this House to return to that safe port as quickly as possible.

Mr MARTIN FERGUSON
 (Batman—Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (10:40):  Given the issues which have been raised, I suggest that, in accordance with the Notice Paper, we move to item No. 2. As has been requested by a number of members, I suggest that advice be sought from the Speaker's office on the status of the Selection Committee meeting—whether it was properly constituted and what its standing is—and that the House be then appropriately informed. In the meantime, I suggest we press on with the work of the House.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Lyons
):  Debate on the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Unclaimed Money and Other Measures) Bill 2012 has been adjourned to another day. The question is one which should be taken up with the Selection Committee. I am proposing that we move on to the next item of business.

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2012-10-31,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (10:41):  On indulgence, this development in the House this morning is quite unprecedented and I think it requires urgent clarification. I agree with the member for Lyne in that regard. My understanding is that the report from the Selection Committee which recommended that the bill be referred to a House committee for debate and investigation was handed to the chair before the second reading of the bill began. Why is that significant? It is significant because, once the second reading of a bill begins, the bill can go through all stages of the legislative process regardless of the report from the committee. So the government either deliberately or unwittingly ensured that the Selection Committee report was not tabled in the House. 


I understand the member for Lyne was in the chair at the time and I am sure he was unaware of the machinations. Because that report was not tabled in a reasonable time, the bill was called on for its second reading. As a consequence—and I am sure the Chief Government Whip knows this—the Selection Committee's referral to the House committee is now a dead duck. It does not matter what that committee finds; the bill can now go through all the stages of the legislative process. This is an example of the chaos currently gripping the government's management of the parliament. We are getting bills the night before we are expected to pass them in the House of Representatives. It is a matter I am deeply concerned about. 


With respect to this matter, I am very concerned that the parliament has been diddled, has been tricked, and that the proper processes of the parliament for bringing on the second reading of a bill opposed by the opposition have not been followed. This is not just any uncontroversial bill. Sometimes the Leader of the House and I agree for debates to occur, either in this place or in the Federation Chamber, on uncontroversial legislation. We did so yesterday, for example, with the debates that took place between 11 am and 2 pm. This is not uncontroversial legislation. The opposition is opposing this bill. As a consequence, there needs to be an immediate investigation into the events of this morning and the Speaker needs to consider whether what has been done this morning should be undone by the parliament so that a proper referral to the relevant House committee can occur—as the Selection Committee decided. That report can then be given—




Mr Jenkins:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: can I suggest that the Manager of Opposition Business has had his indulgence, and I am starting to cut up rough as a chairman of a parliamentary committee. Every time I try to make my report, there is some chaos going on here. I just ask that standing order 271 apply.




Mr Secker:
  There isn't one.




Mr Jenkins:
  There is not one, but it is common sense, alright? Now could I try to get the call again.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  In relation to this matter, the question is one that should be taken up with the Selection Committee. I am proposing to move on to the next item of business.




Mr PYNE:
  The point, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that this is not just a routine matter that can be brushed aside and that we can be told to take up with the Selection Committee at some unidentified time when they may meet. If you do not indicate that the Speaker will be asked to investigate it and potentially undo what has been done today in what I regard as a fastie to the parliament and the opposition then I will move—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Scullin on a point of order. The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat.




Mr PYNE:
  I would have thought you wanted to get on with the business of the day.




Mr Jenkins:
  I am trying to. I have only been an observer. I think that the discussion puts it back in the hands of the Speaker, and that is now Speaker Burke.




Mr PYNE:
  He's not indicating that, Harry.




Mr Jenkins:
  Yes, but we are helping him. I think that there is nothing in what the Deputy Speaker said, and there is nothing that the committee can do. Everybody knows now that the only person that could intervene, if there is any intervention, is the Speaker, and I am sure that she is fully aware of what is going on.




Mr PYNE:
  I am just seeking a commitment from him.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Thank you for your assistance. I will now refer this matter to the Speaker for her adjudication, and I will now move on to the next item of business.




Mr Randall:
  On a point of order, can I clarify something with you, Mr Deputy Speaker?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Certainly.




Mr Randall:
  The next item of business that you have proposed is government business order of the day No. 2, and I see the member for Scullin wants to make a report. So can we have some adjudication on that? His report to the parliament was put back. Can we get an idea of what the actual business of the House will be?




Mr Martin Ferguson:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, with respect to the issue raised by the opposition member, I think that to be fair there was an understanding with the member for Cook that, following consideration of item No. 1 on the Notice Paper, he was called in from alternative responsibilities to make his contribution. We would then seek to attend to the reports from committees.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  In that case we will move on to the appropriations bills and then go back to reports.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2012-10-31,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (10:47):  Here we have another bill, following the farce we have just seen here in this place, rushed into this parliament. The difference here is that I understand the urgency when it comes to the Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013, which the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship brought into this place yesterday regarding the government's blow-outs on our borders and the budget it needs now to meet those blow-outs. It is because, when it comes to the budget that this government needs to pay for its border failures, it has run out of money. It has run out of money to pay for the blow-outs on our borders, and it has brought in a bill for an additional appropriation of $1.7 billion to pay for the blow-outs that have occurred on our borders and the blow-outs in the budget that have occurred as a result. So I understand the reason why this government wants to rush this bill into the place: because it has run out of money.


As a result, the coalition is not going to be standing in the way of this, because, regardless of how aggrieved we feel about the serious policy failure of this government on our borders—which happens every single day, as more than one boat arrives every single day—these bills are going to have to be paid. Once again, Minister Bowen is putting his hand deep into the pockets of the Australian taxpayers to pay for more of his failures. I found it amazing yesterday that he sought to blame this appropriation bill, in its Orwellesque title, on Angus Houston and the Houston panel. This was extraordinary. Of the $1.7 billion in these appropriation bills, $1.3 billion is because more boats are arriving than this government estimated in their budget back in May.


I have read the Houston report carefully, and I do not remember reading anywhere that Angus Houston said that more boats should come to Australia. But what we have in these bills is more money for more boats coming to Australia. The funding specifically for some of the measures out of the Houston report is a national component of the funds that this government is seeking from this parliament and the Australian taxpayers.


The minister for immigration has stood in this place on other occasions and talked about the national stains of policies put forward by the Howard government to address border issues in this country. I notice that the minister has now backflipped on this in the most spectacular act of hypocrisy, on his own words, today, but the national stain that is occurring here is the following: it is 28,000-plus people turning up on over 480 boats in the last four years; it is over 1,000 people dead, and over 8,000 people being denied a protection visa because they applied offshore and they did not come on a boat under this government's soft policies. It is the riots that occurred in our detention centres—the riots where only one person was denied a protection visa out of the hundreds who burned the place to the ground. One person was denied a visa despite the tough talk of the minister for immigration, saying he was going to apply the character test. He gave permanent protection visas to three people convicted of offences relating to their involvement in those riots. What a joke. This is the national stain—it is the national stain of a decision taken by this Labor government to abolish the measures that worked under the Howard government. That is the national stain that touches every single member on that side of the House. They will have to be accountable for that when they go to the people at the next election. They must account for the stain that they have put on this nation through their weakness and the ease by which they have been taken down a path that would see measures that worked removed, and the result of that national stain is one of cost, chaos and a tragedy on this government's watch. That is what has occurred under this government; that is what they must be accountable for.


This legislation in particular involves border protection budget blow-outs. This is the mother of all budget blow-outs. This year, with these new appropriations, it will cost almost $2.7 billion to run the various programs that are a consequence of boats coming to Australia. That is more than a 2,000 per cent increase on what this government budgeted back in 2009-10; more than $2.5 billion extra per year is now being spent by the Australian taxpayer because this government cannot manage our borders. The rolling blow-out between what they said it would cost and what it was expected to cost before MYEFO was $4.97 billion. That figure is now $5.4 billion up to this financial year, and out over the forward estimates it is $6.6 billion. Just think about those numbers: $6.6 billion in blow-outs because this government decided to get rid of a policy that was working.


The current budget estimate of an extra $1.3 billion is directly related to the increased number of people that the government is now expecting to come by boat this year. The government said in its budget that it would have 450 people arriving, on average, per month in 2012-13. That figure has already been blown by over 6,000 people to date, and we now have on average more than 2,000 people turning up every single month. If the government wants to know where its surplus has gone when the surplus disappears, it will find that it sailed away on a boat.


That is where it went. If they want to go looking for this surplus, they will find it in the detention centres around the country. They have sent the surplus to Nauru and they have sent it there on the backs of the hundreds who will go there, because thousands keep turning up in this country because of this government's failed border protection policies. That is where they will find it. The surplus has been processed offshore. The surplus is disappearing before this government's eyes as it sails away.


The 30-month average is what the government uses to estimate the number of arrivals that are expected to turn up in any given year for the purposes of establishing their budget. That has been confirmed on numerous occasions in Senate estimates by department officials and was most recently confirmed back in February of this year. That is where the figure of 450 arrivals per month came from.


The question I sought to ask the Prime Minister yesterday in this House was: given you have just increased the budget by over $1 billion because of your blow-outs on boats, what are you now basing this figure on? She is going to stand in this place and say to the Australian people that she is going to deliver a surplus. The Prime Minister refused to answer the question. I will go to the department's own policies. I asked the Prime Minister to come into this place and correct me if I had this wrong, or the minister for immigration, if he wants, can come and correct me. But based on their own department's policies, stated before the Senate, it is the 30-month average. Is the 30-month average the 2,075 people who have been arriving this year per month? No. I assume the $1.3 billion extra they are asking this parliament for in this bill is based on a monthly estimate of 713 people. That is almost two-thirds less than have been turning up in this country every single month this financial year.


If that is indeed the estimate, which based on the testimony of department officials one can reasonably assume, unless the government has changed its policy—and if so they should come into this place and say so—then this surplus is totally gone. At that rate of arrivals, this budget will be blown on boats alone. With over 2,000 arrivals occurring, that is what we can expect for the rest of the year, because the problem is getting worse. It is not getting better. The reason it is getting worse is that this government remain in office. They are the problem on our borders and the only way it can be fixed is the removal of this government from the treasury bench.


I also note that the government has put in these bills the capital appropriation for the establishment of the processing centres on Nauru and Manus Island. The figure for 2,100 beds is $268 million. That is an average of $126,000 per bed. That is a lot of money and it is more than the average cost at, say, Curtin or in other places. It cost just over $100,000 per bed to establish those facilities.


But what I find interesting is that in January of this year the minister who is now at the table, Minister Bowen, told us that to develop a facility on Nauru was going to cost us $422,000 per bed. That was his cost back in January, when he said he was not going to reopen the centre on Nauru because it would cost far too much. It was going to cost $422,000 per bed to develop these facilities. The cost he has put in this bill in this place today is $126,000. What that says to me is that this government will trash and demonise the coalition's measures right up until the day that it implements them.


The minister at the table likes to talk about national stains. Well, this is quite a stain. It is a stain on his record and a stain on his credibility. It is a stain because in January, when he did not want to do it, he said it was going to cost $422,000 a bed; today, when he wants to do it, he says it will cost $126,000 a bed.


So the minister, given he is the biggest spending immigration minister in our history, particularly on border blow-outs, is in no position to lecture anybody on anything to do with these costings matters. This minister's hands are so deep in the pockets of the taxpayers of this country that he can almost tie their shoelaces through their pants. That is how deep he is in the pockets of the people of this country who are paying taxes.




Mr Randall:
  They must have long pockets!




Mr MORRISON:
  The member for Canning says they must have long pockets. That is true. They would have to have long pockets to pay for the border blow-outs of this government. The border blow-outs in this government's budget are historic, they are unprecedented and they are a national stain.


I also note that this government in their hypocrisy, as we all know, have implemented offshore processing on Nauru and Manus Island. We welcomed that and provided the support in this place to do exactly that. But, as I have noted on many occasions, the policy in isolation was never the answer. For the policy to be effective, the full suite of measures need to be in place, as the coalition has always said. Under this government's policy, you have about a one in 10 chance of being sent to Nauru. Since the minister first announced this policy, you have a one in 6.8 chance of being sent to either Nauru or Manus Island. As every additional boat arrives, and we have had 41 boats this month and over 2,100 people, the odds get even better for the people smugglers. They know that, because they have this government's measure. They have had this government's measure from day 1.


The Houston panel made a range of recommendations, and those recommendations are now government policy. The minister and the Prime Minister can no longer swan around hiding behind Angus Houston to justify their policies—they are the government's policies. They need to own those policies. They need to make the case for their policies on their own terms and in their own words, because they are their policies; they have adopted them.


They are the same policies that they opposed when in opposition and said were xenophobic. I note the other minister at the table today, Minister Crean. He described the bill, that I understand he is now going to support, for the excision of the Australian mainland as a xenophobic bill. If that is the case, he must be a recent convert to xenophobia. He has argued for the bill and he asks for it to be introduced. He has supported it.



Mr Crean interjecting—




Mr MORRISON:
  He interjects at the table. It is the interjection of hypocrisy, because when they were on this side of the House and we were on the government benches, they accused us of being xenophobes for introducing measures that they now advocate. That hypocrisy is breathtaking, and they can explain that to their own electorates. No-one knows where they stand on this issue; they make it up as they go along.


The Houston panel recommendations are now government policy. The government is working through the process of implementing those policies, and they have had not one breath of obstruction from those on this side of the House to the measures they have sought to introduce—not one breath. The government brought in the bills that dealt with the opening of offshore processing in Nauru and Manus Island, and they got speedy passage from this parliament. On every occasion when the opposition has been asked to deal with these matters, we have dealt with them promptly. We are dealing with these matters promptly today, as requested, and we are happy to do so. I know the minister has run out of money and has had to come back to the parliament for some more. We will have to facilitate that to ensure that at least the basics can be implemented.


I want to touch in the time remaining on some of the other recommendations of the Houston panel which I think the government is struggling to come to terms with and to understand. The one that is particularly troubling and has them in absolute convulsions is the no advantage principle. It is not a hard concept. I think Mr L'Estrange has outlined it well. I understand he was particularly involved in the construction of this measure. The no advantage principle is simply to get a message out to the region that if you come to Australia by boat then you cannot expect to have a greater opportunity to get an assessment or to apply for a protection visa than you would otherwise. It is a pretty straightforward principle, and this government has taken months to try and work out what it means and to try and articulate it in a form which has some meaning.


I was in Jakarta a few weeks ago and I was told by the country manager for the UNHCR, in the presence of embassy officials, that the time you can expect to wait in Indonesia if you get your claim assessed and you are resettled in a third country is around two to three years. That was not surprising; that was consistent with conversations I have had with other people. But he also said that in Malaysia you can expect to wait three times as long. The figures that I have been talking about when it comes to Malaysia of five years waiting time, based on my own discussions in Malaysia, would indicate that the time you would wait in Malaysia normally would be longer than the time you would wait in Indonesia. The government has itself contorted in what should be a fairly straightforward principle. They are saying, 'Well, we want to come up with some calibrated method of putting together your age, your gender, your state of health and a range of other things, and we want to put that all in some voodoo black box and this will pop out some number which will decide how long you wait' et cetera. No-one can understand that for love or money. It is complete bureaubabble. The message which is being sent to the region about the no advantage principle is incomprehensible, totally neutering its effectiveness.


The government is once again not thinking through the consequences of these things. Think about it—if the government is to be held to its word on its statements on the no advantage principle, they are saying that if you arrived as an Iranian in Jakarta with a visa on arrival you should expect to wait around two to three years but if you arrived as an Afghan in Kuala Lumpur it would be five years. What's with that? What are they saying? Are they saying: 'Get yourself to Indonesia—it will be quicker to then get yourself to Australia'?


I am sure the Indonesians are wild about that idea! I can tell you that I do not believe they are. The idea of creating asylum magnets in Indonesia is the policy of this government based on the way they have ham-fistedly tried to explain the no advantage principle, which, frankly, my five-year-old would be able to explain at show-and-tell at preschool. The government would be able to explain it by simply saying, 'If you come to Australia, you can expect to wait around about five years.' That is pretty simple. I am trying to help the minister out in explaining his own policy because he seems so befuddled by the whole thing. He is tying himself in so many knots that he cannot get it out. As a result, the policy just falls flat on the floor like everything this government touches in this area. 


The no advantage principle has been butchered by this government with their own bureaubabble, and as a result they continue to frustrate important measures that the coalition has supported. When we support them they still cannot get it right. I wish they would read the instruction manual on border protection. It was written by a great panel that involved John Howard, Alexander Downer and Philip Ruddock, the Father of the House. That was the expert panel, and this government should be reading their instruction manual. That manual talks about restoring the policies—policies that this government abolished—that worked so effectively under the Howard government.


There is also the refugee and humanitarian program, which this government has said they will increase to 20,000 places a year, from this year. That is an additional 25,000 places over the next four years. In addition to that they are creating an extra 16,000 places for family reunions of people who come here on boats. Do not let the government fool you that they are denying family reunion to people coming on boats. Only temporary protection visas will achieve that outcome. This policy is a con. All they are asking them to do is to line up in another queue. So, rather than filling out this form for family reunion, you have to fill out another form for family reunion and you have to pay a fee—a fee which is actually about 80 per cent less, or thereabouts, than what they are paying the people smugglers. The asylum seekers are prepared to pay the people smugglers $10,000 to get here; I am sure they are going to be prepared to pay a fee to bring their families out under this government's policies—and the government have created the additional places to do exactly that.


But the government, in this bill, is not being upfront about the costs of this. When the minister announced it, he said it would cost $1.3 billion to increase the intake to 20,000. But you will not find that figure in MYEFO. Maybe that figure is on Nauru, as well, with the surplus. You will not be able to find it in MYEFO, but that is the cost that the minister put on this package. In MYEFO he has only detailed the costs to Department of Immigration and Citizenship, which are covered in these bills before us for the current year. But the minister is not telling Australians that it is going to cost them more than $50,000 per place to meet that commitment. 


This government is going to spend $1.3 billion taking an extra 25,000 refugees. That is more than they have committed to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. That tells you something about this government's priorities. The Australian people understand that, I think. I think they understand that, when you look at what the government is prepared to spend on taking additional refugees as opposed to what they are prepared to spend on the National Disability Insurance Scheme, that is a message about this government's priorities. I do not think the Australian people have missed that point. In large part the Australian people have been able to acknowledge that in their own reading of these issues. 


But the increase in the intake is also a con, because under this government the number of offshore humanitarian places has fallen by 5,000 per year. The government, when they announced this the other day, went through and told you where all the placements are going to go. The total number of those places they were prepared to identify was 12,150. Why is that figure important? It is less than the 13,750 that is already provided for. So where are the extra visas going? I can tell you—in large part they are going to people who are coming on boats. The increase in the intake is to ensure that there are enough permanent visas in the system to keep giving permanent visas to people coming on boats. 


Do not be conned about the government's feigned compassion on this. They know that they do not have the places in the program to keep giving permanent visas to people coming on boats. They have two options: they can embrace temporary protection visas today or they can increase the refugee and humanitarian intake at a cost of over $50,000 per person for the Australian taxpayer and keep handing out the permanent visas, which keeps the sugar on the table. 


There is also the issue of the Malaysian people-swap, which I notice the minister has benched this morning. He has given up. He now has the absurd proposition that he is not prepared to go and do what the Houston panel said. That was not a message to the opposition; that was a message to the government. It was their committee. They commissioned it and they received its recommendations. The minister said, this morning, on AM on ABC radio: 


We can't implement the Malaysia agreement without the agreement of the parliament, which means we need a change in position from the Greens party or the Liberal Party. 


He said:


I would want to see some sort of evidence from the opposition that they would do what I've done and the Labor Party has done and said, 'Well, we'll do what it takes to save lives …


We have been doing what it takes to save lives for a decade. If the minister wants to say that he is not going to progress his own policy because he wants a blank cheque, up front, on an agreement he has not made with contents that are not known, he is dreaming. That is the biggest cop out I have seen from this minister so far, and it is a pretty big list of cop outs. 


He knows—because he has told me—that the Malaysian government will not agree to legally-binding protections for people sent to Malaysia. That can happen in two ways. They can sign the convention, which I do not believe they are going to do, or they can put legally-binding protections in their own law, which the minister has told me they will not do. I have told him that the coalition has major concerns and rejects the policy on the basis also of the 800 cap. As we know, 800 people can turn up in a week under this government, and the cap remains a significant problem. The universality of the application of this policy means that it breeds exceptions, which creates products for people smugglers to sell. 


These are the weaknesses of the policy. I have been saying this ever since they announced it and the minister has not sought to change one element of the policy to bring it back here. If the minister has given up on Malaysia, that is his decision. The bar has been set by Houston, and the bar has been set by the opposition. This minister is not even going to have a crack; he will not even try and bring in an improved policy and let it face the test of this parliament, because he knows it is a dog of a policy.


There is also the chronic issue happening at Christmas Island and other places around the country as we speak, which is one of the reasons the government is seeking more money from this parliament. That chronic issue is what is effectively the asylum freeze mark II. We have had 5,700-plus people turn up since the 14 August announcement that people may be subject to transfer to Nauru. As I said, there is only a one in 10 chance of that.


This is more people than we had in the detention network that was subject to the last asylum freeze, which led to riots and burning the place down.


This government just does not learn from its mistakes. It is repeating a policy failure of freezing these applications, leading to tension, cost and the build-up of difficult issues in detention centre. Last time this ended in chaos. The government needs to come clean on what it is going to do with the escalating number of people who are turning up in Australia every single day.


The other issue is that of turn-backs. We stand by every letter and every word of the policy that turns back where it is safe to do so—and the Australian people know it. It is a key ingredient. The Houston panel acknowledged that it can be done and acknowledged its effect on deterrence. This government will not even look at it because it does not have the heart to pursue that type of resolve when it comes to saving lives on these desperate issues. We stand by it.


The government demonstrated this the other day. It turned back 14 Sri Lankans who turned up—these were the alleged pirates. The minister said we could turn them back immediately 'because they had no credible claims'. I asked the minister about the other 2,900 Sri Lankans who have turned up since the beginning of May. Did they all have credible claims? Really? Did they seriously? Of the 2,900-odd who have turned up since the beginning of May, only 14 did not have credible claims. It is a con. The government knows it can send people back. The government knows it can turn around boats where it is safe to do so. Its heart is not in it. That is what the people smugglers know. That is what the Australian people know. That is why the government has come scurrying into this place again to ask for more money—to pay for more failure.

Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (11:18):  I appreciate the opportunity to speak today on these appropriation bills. I think everyone in this country would remember what happened in November 2007—the federal election that saw a change in government. I was fortunate enough to be elected by the people of Cowan on 24 November, against the tide and with quite a reasonable swing. I appreciate the honour and the confidence that has been bestowed on me by the people of Cowan as a result of that election, and subsequently in the last general election as well.


At the time of the 2007 election this country had a strong border protection policy. We had a policy whereby the boats had dwindled to as few as one a year, where the emphasis of the humanitarian program was rightly on those who were stuck behind barbed wire in refugee camps around the world. Around 13,000 refugees were brought to this country under the humanitarian program at that time. This was the right and just thing to do. We offer humanitarian support and we offer a future to those who had no future and to those who had no money to bypass the system. Since then, we have seen a complete reversal of those Howard government policies—the great and humane policies that allow people to come out of refugee camps and to come to this country for a better life. 


I will briefly touch on the three aspects of those policies that were reversed. The policies, whilst rejected by the other side at the end of 2007 and 2008, have continued to be embraced wholeheartedly on this side. First is offshore processing. You will have heard a bit about offshore processing in the last year or so. Offshore processing, as I recall, was ended by the current government. In fact, former minister Senator Chris Evans ended up bragging about how Manus and Nauru islands would fall into disrepair because they had no value because we would have no need of them in the future. That was several years ago. It is amazing how things have turned.


The second aspect of the policy that worked—and why the government continues to have its current problem, its five years of problems with poor border security—is temporary protection visas, which the Labor Party also ended. That has been mentioned on many occasions. The shadow minister has spoken about temporary protection visas on many occasions, I have and anyone on this side of the House who has spoken about these matters has talked about temporary protection visas.


The third pillar of the coalition's policy, a consistent 10-year policy on border protection, is turning the boats back where it is possible to do so.


When this country, under a future government, can return to having a good relationship with Indonesia, we can prosecute that pillar of the coalition's immigration policy as well.


It was interesting yesterday when the Prime Minister, in response to a question put by the shadow minister for immigration, the member for Cook, said very strangely, 'I would also say to the shadow minister it really does strike me as a little bit strange that month after month after month he came into this parliament saying that Nauru was the answer'. Of course, that is not true. The member for Cook has never said and we have never said, that Nauru was the be-all and end-all. Whilst it may be convenient for the Prime Minister to be very revisionist on this—to mislead this place and mislead everybody on this, along with other matters—that was never the case. What she said yesterday was not accurate to any degree. It was certainly said with the intention of not being accurate. The reality is that our policy has always been very clear. There have always been three aspects to it: offshore processing, temporary protection visas and turning the boats back where possible.


It is very clear that there is a real willingness among those opposite to backflip, change and walk away from what many on that side have said. They believe so strongly in calling it a moral issue. They have a depth of feeling about it, yet repeatedly we see them walking back from that. We see them backflipping from that. We see them being inconsistent in these matters. Those opposite stand up in this place, put their hand on their heart and say 'I have a conscience on this, and I cannot do this particular thing'. So many who spoke were so completely against the excising of the Australian mainland; but shortly they will vote for it. That is something they will have to live with in the future. It will keep them up at night if they really believe it. I guess, if it has always been about the politics, then maybe they will sleep well.


These bills are about appropriations. It is little wonder that this government has run out of money. What we have seen in the last month are 41 boats and more than 2,100 people arrive. There were 17 boats just last week with 621 people on board. Last financial year each illegal boat arrival cost an average of $12.8 million. The burden the Australian taxpayer continues to bear under this government is $175,000 per person. Customs and Border Protection, with the government's cutbacks and having to focus so strongly on this—with either the Navy or Customs providing the water taxi service to escort these people into the country—are at breaking point. We have record populations in detention centres, with tents going up even on Christmas Island.


Now we see that Nauru has decided they will up their visa charge from $100 to $1,000 per month for those that this government sends there. As part of that, I note that something like only 6.8 per cent of people that came by boat in recent weeks have been sent to Nauru. It is hard to work out who has been selected to go to Nauru. One of my constituents told me that she had heard that it was just those from Sri Lanka. So those that come from Afghanistan and the Middle East—those people that buy a commercial airline ticket, fly to Indonesia, go and see the people smugglers and then pay the people smugglers to get on a boat before losing their passport in the Timor Sea—are not being required to go to Nauru. It is very selective, and there is a fair bit of smoke and mirrors around the whole Nauru issue. The reality is that Christmas Island is full and continues to be topped up with those that come from the Middle East by boat whilst a small number of those that come from Sri Lanka end up going to Nauru.


I listened to the member for Cook talk about the minister's approach to those that participated in the detention centre riots about a year or so ago. Out in my electorate of Cowan those riots caused a lot of angst. So many people would say to me: 'What is it with these people? We provide them with accommodation, we provide them with three square-meals, we provide them with unfettered internet access apparently, a gym and—in the case of Northern—the best sporting facilities in the state. The federal government provides them with all that, yet still they riot, still they destroy our facilities and still they cost the taxpayers even more money.' It was interesting what the member for Cook said: three people that were actually convicted of the destruction of the taxpayers' property, Australian property, were, by this minister, given permanent protection visas.


One of the things people say consistently about law and order matters out in the suburbs of Australia is that they want accountability for bad behaviour, for criminal behaviour. If people do something wrong they want the person who has done something wrong to be held to account for it. If that is deportation or if that is incarceration then that is exactly what people want. I am sure my constituents will be very disappointed that those three were given permanent visas.


I know I am starting to run out of time now but that I will have another opportunity, maybe later today or tonight or tomorrow, to talk about the federal government's latest backflip. I am glad they have walked away from years of earnestly held views on the excision of the Australian mainland as a policy option. That debate is coming back to the House, and we look forward to that debate.


I would like briefly to go back through some of the additional blowouts. This measure we are debating today will amount to $1.7 billion of additional costs, as I understand it. The government have allocated the blame for that to the panel led by Angus Houston but, in actual fact, so much of that is just because, again, the government budget figures do not work out. They always underestimate everything and overestimate the amount of money that they can save or generate from tax, and now—surprise, surprise!—the boats are arriving at four times the rate the government estimated in the May budget. So they have stuffed it up again, and $1.3 billion of the $1.7 billion was about the failure to get the figures right.


Former minister, Chris Evans, was so happy about how Manus and Nauru facilities are being run down. But now $268 million will be needed to upgrade those facilities. He took such joy in them being run down. Of course, we still have the issue of the cost of the additional 25,000 places for refugee and humanitarian intake over the next four years. As the member for Cook mentioned before, that would amount to about $1.3 billion to cover the cost of those extra places. Here we go again—whether it is the rights in detention centres, the destruction of property or the weak borders that have led to increasing amounts of blowouts of billions and billions of dollars, those extra places amount to $1.3 billion of extra money. That is more than the amount of money that has been allocated to the fairly small trials of the National Disability Insurance Scheme.


It really does say it all about priorities and how this situation has completely gone beyond the control of the government. The only way this is all going to end is when the policies that worked are returned to this place, and the only time that is going to happen—as clearly the Independents are in lockstep with the government on all these matters—will be with a change of government. I think a lot of people in Australia and a lot of people who believe in this country are hoping that that will be at the next election.

"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2012-10-31,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon—Minister for Immigration and Citizenship) (11:33):  I bring the debate on the Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 1) 2012-13 and on the Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 2) 2012-13 to a close. I thank those members who have made a contribution.


These supplementary estimates appropriation bills seek authority from the parliament for the expenditure of money from the consolidated revenue fund to provide additional appropriation to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. The total additional appropriation being sought through these bills is just under $1.7 billion. These bills provide $668.6 million to implement the recommendations of the expert panel on asylum seekers, led by former Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, including funds for capital works and services for regional processing facilities on Nauru and Manus Island in Papua New Guinea.


I turn to note a few things in reply to the comments of those opposite. The member for Cook had quite a bit to say about the cost of opening Manus Island and Nauru—and it is expensive. This government has always said it would be expensive. I remember the shadow minister for immigration saying that it would cost around $10 million. The Leader of the Opposition said that it would require some emergency gardening, and that was all that was required to get the Nauru facility up and running, which was always patently false. The member for Cook engaged some costings, and I have had a fair bit to say about those elsewhere in terms of their veracity. They were patently false as well.


Of course, the government have always recognised that opening Manus Island and Nauru would be expensive. We have taken the view that—given the opposition's refusal to allow the passage of the Malaysia agreement, which was always our preferred policy response and which would be done more cheaply and more effectively—we would open the Manus Island and Nauru detention facilities as part of the suite of measures recommended by the expert panel. But, of course, it was always going to be very, very expensive. Funding sought in these appropriation bills is consistent with MYEFO and already budgeted through that process.


I will also briefly to respond to the member for Cowan, who just spoke. He said a number of things that are not particularly germane to the appropriation bills but, given he raised them, I will respond. He said that only Sri Lankans are being sent to Nauru and that a constituent had told him that. But he could have checked with me, because that is patently false. It is also sending out a very bad message for him to say that in the national parliament. It is sending a message to people who are not from Sri Lanka that they would not be sent to Nauru. For his information, there are currently 19 Iraqis, 24 Iranians, 58 Afghans and 43 Pakistanis on Nauru.


We have also removed more than 70 people from Australia since the announcement that we were implementing offshore processing. During the same time frame, after the Howard government had introduced offshore processing, they had not removed anybody from Australia. So 70 is a relatively small number compared to the number of arrivals—I accept that—but it is more than the Howard government had achieved at the same time and does show and underline the fact that people smugglers are selling lies.


I also want to raise that the member for Cowan criticised—and the member for Cook, I am sure, did as well—the government's decision to increase the humanitarian intake to 20,000. The member for Cowan said it was an additional 25,000 places. It is not. It is 20,000 in total, not an additional 25,000. Nevertheless, he said this was a bad thing. He spoke throughout his speech about consistency and how the opposition was consistent.


He seems to have forgotten his leader, standing at that despatch box and saying that the Liberal Party, if it attained government, would increase the refugee and humanitarian program to 20,000. That was a couple of months ago. The Leader of the Opposition, the member for Warringah, stood at that despatch box and made that commitment, and now the member for Cook and the member for Cowan are saying how terrible it is that the government has increased the humanitarian program to 20,000. Let us not hear this argument about consistency when you have a Leader of the Opposition who stood there and made that commitment a couple of months ago. I understand that they have now ripped that commitment up—it only lasted a day. Nevertheless, I will not have this lecturing from the opposition about consistency in this area.


Finally, the member for Cowan raised the issuing of visas in relation to the Christmas Island and Villawood disturbances. I remind him that this government changed the law to strengthen the character test. Since then, I have denied permanent visas to four people under that character test in relation to offences committed in detention. Having done that, I remind the opposition that they were in office for 12 years and they had riots at Woomera and Baxter and elsewhere. I ask this question of the House: how many permanent visas were denied to people convicted of offences in those riots? I will give the House a clue: it is a round number. It is zero; zero is the number of visas denied by the previous government. I have denied four permanent visas, and there are other people in the courts whose cases will come to me for decision if and when they are convicted. There are more people there to be dealt with under that process.


We heard some particularly inaccurate statements made by honourable members opposite. Nevertheless, I acknowledge the opposition's support for these appropriation bills. They are necessary to implement the recommendations of the Houston panel and because of the increased number of arrivals that we have seen in recent months. I therefore commend the bills to the House.

Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (10:47):  Here we have another bill, following the farce we have just seen here in this place, rushed into this parliament. The difference here is that I understand the urgency when it comes to the Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013, which the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship brought into this place yesterday regarding the government's blow-outs on our borders and the budget it needs now to meet those blow-outs. It is because, when it comes to the budget that this government needs to pay for its border failures, it has run out of money. It has run out of money to pay for the blow-outs on our borders, and it has brought in a bill for an additional appropriation of $1.7 billion to pay for the blow-outs that have occurred on our borders and the blow-outs in the budget that have occurred as a result. So I understand the reason why this government wants to rush this bill into the place: because it has run out of money.


As a result, the coalition is not going to be standing in the way of this, because, regardless of how aggrieved we feel about the serious policy failure of this government on our borders—which happens every single day, as more than one boat arrives every single day—these bills are going to have to be paid. Once again, Minister Bowen is putting his hand deep into the pockets of the Australian taxpayers to pay for more of his failures. I found it amazing yesterday that he sought to blame this appropriation bill, in its Orwellesque title, on Angus Houston and the Houston panel. This was extraordinary. Of the $1.7 billion in these appropriation bills, $1.3 billion is because more boats are arriving than this government estimated in their budget back in May.


I have read the Houston report carefully, and I do not remember reading anywhere that Angus Houston said that more boats should come to Australia. But what we have in these bills is more money for more boats coming to Australia. The funding specifically for some of the measures out of the Houston report is a national component of the funds that this government is seeking from this parliament and the Australian taxpayers.


The minister for immigration has stood in this place on other occasions and talked about the national stains of policies put forward by the Howard government to address border issues in this country. I notice that the minister has now backflipped on this in the most spectacular act of hypocrisy, on his own words, today, but the national stain that is occurring here is the following: it is 28,000-plus people turning up on over 480 boats in the last four years; it is over 1,000 people dead, and over 8,000 people being denied a protection visa because they applied offshore and they did not come on a boat under this government's soft policies. It is the riots that occurred in our detention centres—the riots where only one person was denied a protection visa out of the hundreds who burned the place to the ground. One person was denied a visa despite the tough talk of the minister for immigration, saying he was going to apply the character test. He gave permanent protection visas to three people convicted of offences relating to their involvement in those riots. What a joke. This is the national stain—it is the national stain of a decision taken by this Labor government to abolish the measures that worked under the Howard government. That is the national stain that touches every single member on that side of the House. They will have to be accountable for that when they go to the people at the next election. They must account for the stain that they have put on this nation through their weakness and the ease by which they have been taken down a path that would see measures that worked removed, and the result of that national stain is one of cost, chaos and a tragedy on this government's watch. That is what has occurred under this government; that is what they must be accountable for.


This legislation in particular involves border protection budget blow-outs. This is the mother of all budget blow-outs. This year, with these new appropriations, it will cost almost $2.7 billion to run the various programs that are a consequence of boats coming to Australia. That is more than a 2,000 per cent increase on what this government budgeted back in 2009-10; more than $2.5 billion extra per year is now being spent by the Australian taxpayer because this government cannot manage our borders. The rolling blow-out between what they said it would cost and what it was expected to cost before MYEFO was $4.97 billion. That figure is now $5.4 billion up to this financial year, and out over the forward estimates it is $6.6 billion. Just think about those numbers: $6.6 billion in blow-outs because this government decided to get rid of a policy that was working.


The current budget estimate of an extra $1.3 billion is directly related to the increased number of people that the government is now expecting to come by boat this year. The government said in its budget that it would have 450 people arriving, on average, per month in 2012-13. That figure has already been blown by over 6,000 people to date, and we now have on average more than 2,000 people turning up every single month. If the government wants to know where its surplus has gone when the surplus disappears, it will find that it sailed away on a boat.


That is where it went. If they want to go looking for this surplus, they will find it in the detention centres around the country. They have sent the surplus to Nauru and they have sent it there on the backs of the hundreds who will go there, because thousands keep turning up in this country because of this government's failed border protection policies. That is where they will find it. The surplus has been processed offshore. The surplus is disappearing before this government's eyes as it sails away.


The 30-month average is what the government uses to estimate the number of arrivals that are expected to turn up in any given year for the purposes of establishing their budget. That has been confirmed on numerous occasions in Senate estimates by department officials and was most recently confirmed back in February of this year. That is where the figure of 450 arrivals per month came from.


The question I sought to ask the Prime Minister yesterday in this House was: given you have just increased the budget by over $1 billion because of your blow-outs on boats, what are you now basing this figure on? She is going to stand in this place and say to the Australian people that she is going to deliver a surplus. The Prime Minister refused to answer the question. I will go to the department's own policies. I asked the Prime Minister to come into this place and correct me if I had this wrong, or the minister for immigration, if he wants, can come and correct me. But based on their own department's policies, stated before the Senate, it is the 30-month average. Is the 30-month average the 2,075 people who have been arriving this year per month? No. I assume the $1.3 billion extra they are asking this parliament for in this bill is based on a monthly estimate of 713 people. That is almost two-thirds less than have been turning up in this country every single month this financial year.


If that is indeed the estimate, which based on the testimony of department officials one can reasonably assume, unless the government has changed its policy—and if so they should come into this place and say so—then this surplus is totally gone. At that rate of arrivals, this budget will be blown on boats alone. With over 2,000 arrivals occurring, that is what we can expect for the rest of the year, because the problem is getting worse. It is not getting better. The reason it is getting worse is that this government remain in office. They are the problem on our borders and the only way it can be fixed is the removal of this government from the treasury bench.


I also note that the government has put in these bills the capital appropriation for the establishment of the processing centres on Nauru and Manus Island. The figure for 2,100 beds is $268 million. That is an average of $126,000 per bed. That is a lot of money and it is more than the average cost at, say, Curtin or in other places. It cost just over $100,000 per bed to establish those facilities.


But what I find interesting is that in January of this year the minister who is now at the table, Minister Bowen, told us that to develop a facility on Nauru was going to cost us $422,000 per bed. That was his cost back in January, when he said he was not going to reopen the centre on Nauru because it would cost far too much. It was going to cost $422,000 per bed to develop these facilities. The cost he has put in this bill in this place today is $126,000. What that says to me is that this government will trash and demonise the coalition's measures right up until the day that it implements them.


The minister at the table likes to talk about national stains. Well, this is quite a stain. It is a stain on his record and a stain on his credibility. It is a stain because in January, when he did not want to do it, he said it was going to cost $422,000 a bed; today, when he wants to do it, he says it will cost $126,000 a bed.


So the minister, given he is the biggest spending immigration minister in our history, particularly on border blow-outs, is in no position to lecture anybody on anything to do with these costings matters. This minister's hands are so deep in the pockets of the taxpayers of this country that he can almost tie their shoelaces through their pants. That is how deep he is in the pockets of the people of this country who are paying taxes.




Mr Randall:
  They must have long pockets!




Mr MORRISON:
  The member for Canning says they must have long pockets. That is true. They would have to have long pockets to pay for the border blow-outs of this government. The border blow-outs in this government's budget are historic, they are unprecedented and they are a national stain.


I also note that this government in their hypocrisy, as we all know, have implemented offshore processing on Nauru and Manus Island. We welcomed that and provided the support in this place to do exactly that. But, as I have noted on many occasions, the policy in isolation was never the answer. For the policy to be effective, the full suite of measures need to be in place, as the coalition has always said. Under this government's policy, you have about a one in 10 chance of being sent to Nauru. Since the minister first announced this policy, you have a one in 6.8 chance of being sent to either Nauru or Manus Island. As every additional boat arrives, and we have had 41 boats this month and over 2,100 people, the odds get even better for the people smugglers. They know that, because they have this government's measure. They have had this government's measure from day 1.


The Houston panel made a range of recommendations, and those recommendations are now government policy. The minister and the Prime Minister can no longer swan around hiding behind Angus Houston to justify their policies—they are the government's policies. They need to own those policies. They need to make the case for their policies on their own terms and in their own words, because they are their policies; they have adopted them.


They are the same policies that they opposed when in opposition and said were xenophobic. I note the other minister at the table today, Minister Crean. He described the bill, that I understand he is now going to support, for the excision of the Australian mainland as a xenophobic bill. If that is the case, he must be a recent convert to xenophobia. He has argued for the bill and he asks for it to be introduced. He has supported it.



Mr Crean interjecting—




Mr MORRISON:
  He interjects at the table. It is the interjection of hypocrisy, because when they were on this side of the House and we were on the government benches, they accused us of being xenophobes for introducing measures that they now advocate. That hypocrisy is breathtaking, and they can explain that to their own electorates. No-one knows where they stand on this issue; they make it up as they go along.


The Houston panel recommendations are now government policy. The government is working through the process of implementing those policies, and they have had not one breath of obstruction from those on this side of the House to the measures they have sought to introduce—not one breath. The government brought in the bills that dealt with the opening of offshore processing in Nauru and Manus Island, and they got speedy passage from this parliament. On every occasion when the opposition has been asked to deal with these matters, we have dealt with them promptly. We are dealing with these matters promptly today, as requested, and we are happy to do so. I know the minister has run out of money and has had to come back to the parliament for some more. We will have to facilitate that to ensure that at least the basics can be implemented.


I want to touch in the time remaining on some of the other recommendations of the Houston panel which I think the government is struggling to come to terms with and to understand. The one that is particularly troubling and has them in absolute convulsions is the no advantage principle. It is not a hard concept. I think Mr L'Estrange has outlined it well. I understand he was particularly involved in the construction of this measure. The no advantage principle is simply to get a message out to the region that if you come to Australia by boat then you cannot expect to have a greater opportunity to get an assessment or to apply for a protection visa than you would otherwise. It is a pretty straightforward principle, and this government has taken months to try and work out what it means and to try and articulate it in a form which has some meaning.


I was in Jakarta a few weeks ago and I was told by the country manager for the UNHCR, in the presence of embassy officials, that the time you can expect to wait in Indonesia if you get your claim assessed and you are resettled in a third country is around two to three years. That was not surprising; that was consistent with conversations I have had with other people. But he also said that in Malaysia you can expect to wait three times as long. The figures that I have been talking about when it comes to Malaysia of five years waiting time, based on my own discussions in Malaysia, would indicate that the time you would wait in Malaysia normally would be longer than the time you would wait in Indonesia. The government has itself contorted in what should be a fairly straightforward principle. They are saying, 'Well, we want to come up with some calibrated method of putting together your age, your gender, your state of health and a range of other things, and we want to put that all in some voodoo black box and this will pop out some number which will decide how long you wait' et cetera. No-one can understand that for love or money. It is complete bureaubabble. The message which is being sent to the region about the no advantage principle is incomprehensible, totally neutering its effectiveness.


The government is once again not thinking through the consequences of these things. Think about it—if the government is to be held to its word on its statements on the no advantage principle, they are saying that if you arrived as an Iranian in Jakarta with a visa on arrival you should expect to wait around two to three years but if you arrived as an Afghan in Kuala Lumpur it would be five years. What's with that? What are they saying? Are they saying: 'Get yourself to Indonesia—it will be quicker to then get yourself to Australia'?


I am sure the Indonesians are wild about that idea! I can tell you that I do not believe they are. The idea of creating asylum magnets in Indonesia is the policy of this government based on the way they have ham-fistedly tried to explain the no advantage principle, which, frankly, my five-year-old would be able to explain at show-and-tell at preschool. The government would be able to explain it by simply saying, 'If you come to Australia, you can expect to wait around about five years.' That is pretty simple. I am trying to help the minister out in explaining his own policy because he seems so befuddled by the whole thing. He is tying himself in so many knots that he cannot get it out. As a result, the policy just falls flat on the floor like everything this government touches in this area. 


The no advantage principle has been butchered by this government with their own bureaubabble, and as a result they continue to frustrate important measures that the coalition has supported. When we support them they still cannot get it right. I wish they would read the instruction manual on border protection. It was written by a great panel that involved John Howard, Alexander Downer and Philip Ruddock, the Father of the House. That was the expert panel, and this government should be reading their instruction manual. That manual talks about restoring the policies—policies that this government abolished—that worked so effectively under the Howard government.


There is also the refugee and humanitarian program, which this government has said they will increase to 20,000 places a year, from this year. That is an additional 25,000 places over the next four years. In addition to that they are creating an extra 16,000 places for family reunions of people who come here on boats. Do not let the government fool you that they are denying family reunion to people coming on boats. Only temporary protection visas will achieve that outcome. This policy is a con. All they are asking them to do is to line up in another queue. So, rather than filling out this form for family reunion, you have to fill out another form for family reunion and you have to pay a fee—a fee which is actually about 80 per cent less, or thereabouts, than what they are paying the people smugglers. The asylum seekers are prepared to pay the people smugglers $10,000 to get here; I am sure they are going to be prepared to pay a fee to bring their families out under this government's policies—and the government have created the additional places to do exactly that.


But the government, in this bill, is not being upfront about the costs of this. When the minister announced it, he said it would cost $1.3 billion to increase the intake to 20,000. But you will not find that figure in MYEFO. Maybe that figure is on Nauru, as well, with the surplus. You will not be able to find it in MYEFO, but that is the cost that the minister put on this package. In MYEFO he has only detailed the costs to Department of Immigration and Citizenship, which are covered in these bills before us for the current year. But the minister is not telling Australians that it is going to cost them more than $50,000 per place to meet that commitment. 


This government is going to spend $1.3 billion taking an extra 25,000 refugees. That is more than they have committed to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. That tells you something about this government's priorities. The Australian people understand that, I think. I think they understand that, when you look at what the government is prepared to spend on taking additional refugees as opposed to what they are prepared to spend on the National Disability Insurance Scheme, that is a message about this government's priorities. I do not think the Australian people have missed that point. In large part the Australian people have been able to acknowledge that in their own reading of these issues. 


But the increase in the intake is also a con, because under this government the number of offshore humanitarian places has fallen by 5,000 per year. The government, when they announced this the other day, went through and told you where all the placements are going to go. The total number of those places they were prepared to identify was 12,150. Why is that figure important? It is less than the 13,750 that is already provided for. So where are the extra visas going? I can tell you—in large part they are going to people who are coming on boats. The increase in the intake is to ensure that there are enough permanent visas in the system to keep giving permanent visas to people coming on boats. 


Do not be conned about the government's feigned compassion on this. They know that they do not have the places in the program to keep giving permanent visas to people coming on boats. They have two options: they can embrace temporary protection visas today or they can increase the refugee and humanitarian intake at a cost of over $50,000 per person for the Australian taxpayer and keep handing out the permanent visas, which keeps the sugar on the table. 


There is also the issue of the Malaysian people-swap, which I notice the minister has benched this morning. He has given up. He now has the absurd proposition that he is not prepared to go and do what the Houston panel said. That was not a message to the opposition; that was a message to the government. It was their committee. They commissioned it and they received its recommendations. The minister said, this morning, on AM on ABC radio: 


We can't implement the Malaysia agreement without the agreement of the parliament, which means we need a change in position from the Greens party or the Liberal Party. 


He said:


I would want to see some sort of evidence from the opposition that they would do what I've done and the Labor Party has done and said, 'Well, we'll do what it takes to save lives …


We have been doing what it takes to save lives for a decade. If the minister wants to say that he is not going to progress his own policy because he wants a blank cheque, up front, on an agreement he has not made with contents that are not known, he is dreaming. That is the biggest cop out I have seen from this minister so far, and it is a pretty big list of cop outs. 


He knows—because he has told me—that the Malaysian government will not agree to legally-binding protections for people sent to Malaysia. That can happen in two ways. They can sign the convention, which I do not believe they are going to do, or they can put legally-binding protections in their own law, which the minister has told me they will not do. I have told him that the coalition has major concerns and rejects the policy on the basis also of the 800 cap. As we know, 800 people can turn up in a week under this government, and the cap remains a significant problem. The universality of the application of this policy means that it breeds exceptions, which creates products for people smugglers to sell. 


These are the weaknesses of the policy. I have been saying this ever since they announced it and the minister has not sought to change one element of the policy to bring it back here. If the minister has given up on Malaysia, that is his decision. The bar has been set by Houston, and the bar has been set by the opposition. This minister is not even going to have a crack; he will not even try and bring in an improved policy and let it face the test of this parliament, because he knows it is a dog of a policy.


There is also the chronic issue happening at Christmas Island and other places around the country as we speak, which is one of the reasons the government is seeking more money from this parliament. That chronic issue is what is effectively the asylum freeze mark II. We have had 5,700-plus people turn up since the 14 August announcement that people may be subject to transfer to Nauru. As I said, there is only a one in 10 chance of that.


This is more people than we had in the detention network that was subject to the last asylum freeze, which led to riots and burning the place down.


This government just does not learn from its mistakes. It is repeating a policy failure of freezing these applications, leading to tension, cost and the build-up of difficult issues in detention centre. Last time this ended in chaos. The government needs to come clean on what it is going to do with the escalating number of people who are turning up in Australia every single day.


The other issue is that of turn-backs. We stand by every letter and every word of the policy that turns back where it is safe to do so—and the Australian people know it. It is a key ingredient. The Houston panel acknowledged that it can be done and acknowledged its effect on deterrence. This government will not even look at it because it does not have the heart to pursue that type of resolve when it comes to saving lives on these desperate issues. We stand by it.


The government demonstrated this the other day. It turned back 14 Sri Lankans who turned up—these were the alleged pirates. The minister said we could turn them back immediately 'because they had no credible claims'. I asked the minister about the other 2,900 Sri Lankans who have turned up since the beginning of May. Did they all have credible claims? Really? Did they seriously? Of the 2,900-odd who have turned up since the beginning of May, only 14 did not have credible claims. It is a con. The government knows it can send people back. The government knows it can turn around boats where it is safe to do so. Its heart is not in it. That is what the people smugglers know. That is what the Australian people know. That is why the government has come scurrying into this place again to ask for more money—to pay for more failure.

"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2012-10-31,"



Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (11:18):  I appreciate the opportunity to speak today on these appropriation bills. I think everyone in this country would remember what happened in November 2007—the federal election that saw a change in government. I was fortunate enough to be elected by the people of Cowan on 24 November, against the tide and with quite a reasonable swing. I appreciate the honour and the confidence that has been bestowed on me by the people of Cowan as a result of that election, and subsequently in the last general election as well.


At the time of the 2007 election this country had a strong border protection policy. We had a policy whereby the boats had dwindled to as few as one a year, where the emphasis of the humanitarian program was rightly on those who were stuck behind barbed wire in refugee camps around the world. Around 13,000 refugees were brought to this country under the humanitarian program at that time. This was the right and just thing to do. We offer humanitarian support and we offer a future to those who had no future and to those who had no money to bypass the system. Since then, we have seen a complete reversal of those Howard government policies—the great and humane policies that allow people to come out of refugee camps and to come to this country for a better life. 


I will briefly touch on the three aspects of those policies that were reversed. The policies, whilst rejected by the other side at the end of 2007 and 2008, have continued to be embraced wholeheartedly on this side. First is offshore processing. You will have heard a bit about offshore processing in the last year or so. Offshore processing, as I recall, was ended by the current government. In fact, former minister Senator Chris Evans ended up bragging about how Manus and Nauru islands would fall into disrepair because they had no value because we would have no need of them in the future. That was several years ago. It is amazing how things have turned.


The second aspect of the policy that worked—and why the government continues to have its current problem, its five years of problems with poor border security—is temporary protection visas, which the Labor Party also ended. That has been mentioned on many occasions. The shadow minister has spoken about temporary protection visas on many occasions, I have and anyone on this side of the House who has spoken about these matters has talked about temporary protection visas.


The third pillar of the coalition's policy, a consistent 10-year policy on border protection, is turning the boats back where it is possible to do so.


When this country, under a future government, can return to having a good relationship with Indonesia, we can prosecute that pillar of the coalition's immigration policy as well.


It was interesting yesterday when the Prime Minister, in response to a question put by the shadow minister for immigration, the member for Cook, said very strangely, 'I would also say to the shadow minister it really does strike me as a little bit strange that month after month after month he came into this parliament saying that Nauru was the answer'. Of course, that is not true. The member for Cook has never said and we have never said, that Nauru was the be-all and end-all. Whilst it may be convenient for the Prime Minister to be very revisionist on this—to mislead this place and mislead everybody on this, along with other matters—that was never the case. What she said yesterday was not accurate to any degree. It was certainly said with the intention of not being accurate. The reality is that our policy has always been very clear. There have always been three aspects to it: offshore processing, temporary protection visas and turning the boats back where possible.


It is very clear that there is a real willingness among those opposite to backflip, change and walk away from what many on that side have said. They believe so strongly in calling it a moral issue. They have a depth of feeling about it, yet repeatedly we see them walking back from that. We see them backflipping from that. We see them being inconsistent in these matters. Those opposite stand up in this place, put their hand on their heart and say 'I have a conscience on this, and I cannot do this particular thing'. So many who spoke were so completely against the excising of the Australian mainland; but shortly they will vote for it. That is something they will have to live with in the future. It will keep them up at night if they really believe it. I guess, if it has always been about the politics, then maybe they will sleep well.


These bills are about appropriations. It is little wonder that this government has run out of money. What we have seen in the last month are 41 boats and more than 2,100 people arrive. There were 17 boats just last week with 621 people on board. Last financial year each illegal boat arrival cost an average of $12.8 million. The burden the Australian taxpayer continues to bear under this government is $175,000 per person. Customs and Border Protection, with the government's cutbacks and having to focus so strongly on this—with either the Navy or Customs providing the water taxi service to escort these people into the country—are at breaking point. We have record populations in detention centres, with tents going up even on Christmas Island.


Now we see that Nauru has decided they will up their visa charge from $100 to $1,000 per month for those that this government sends there. As part of that, I note that something like only 6.8 per cent of people that came by boat in recent weeks have been sent to Nauru. It is hard to work out who has been selected to go to Nauru. One of my constituents told me that she had heard that it was just those from Sri Lanka. So those that come from Afghanistan and the Middle East—those people that buy a commercial airline ticket, fly to Indonesia, go and see the people smugglers and then pay the people smugglers to get on a boat before losing their passport in the Timor Sea—are not being required to go to Nauru. It is very selective, and there is a fair bit of smoke and mirrors around the whole Nauru issue. The reality is that Christmas Island is full and continues to be topped up with those that come from the Middle East by boat whilst a small number of those that come from Sri Lanka end up going to Nauru.


I listened to the member for Cook talk about the minister's approach to those that participated in the detention centre riots about a year or so ago. Out in my electorate of Cowan those riots caused a lot of angst. So many people would say to me: 'What is it with these people? We provide them with accommodation, we provide them with three square-meals, we provide them with unfettered internet access apparently, a gym and—in the case of Northern—the best sporting facilities in the state. The federal government provides them with all that, yet still they riot, still they destroy our facilities and still they cost the taxpayers even more money.' It was interesting what the member for Cook said: three people that were actually convicted of the destruction of the taxpayers' property, Australian property, were, by this minister, given permanent protection visas.


One of the things people say consistently about law and order matters out in the suburbs of Australia is that they want accountability for bad behaviour, for criminal behaviour. If people do something wrong they want the person who has done something wrong to be held to account for it. If that is deportation or if that is incarceration then that is exactly what people want. I am sure my constituents will be very disappointed that those three were given permanent visas.


I know I am starting to run out of time now but that I will have another opportunity, maybe later today or tonight or tomorrow, to talk about the federal government's latest backflip. I am glad they have walked away from years of earnestly held views on the excision of the Australian mainland as a policy option. That debate is coming back to the House, and we look forward to that debate.


I would like briefly to go back through some of the additional blowouts. This measure we are debating today will amount to $1.7 billion of additional costs, as I understand it. The government have allocated the blame for that to the panel led by Angus Houston but, in actual fact, so much of that is just because, again, the government budget figures do not work out. They always underestimate everything and overestimate the amount of money that they can save or generate from tax, and now—surprise, surprise!—the boats are arriving at four times the rate the government estimated in the May budget. So they have stuffed it up again, and $1.3 billion of the $1.7 billion was about the failure to get the figures right.


Former minister, Chris Evans, was so happy about how Manus and Nauru facilities are being run down. But now $268 million will be needed to upgrade those facilities. He took such joy in them being run down. Of course, we still have the issue of the cost of the additional 25,000 places for refugee and humanitarian intake over the next four years. As the member for Cook mentioned before, that would amount to about $1.3 billion to cover the cost of those extra places. Here we go again—whether it is the rights in detention centres, the destruction of property or the weak borders that have led to increasing amounts of blowouts of billions and billions of dollars, those extra places amount to $1.3 billion of extra money. That is more than the amount of money that has been allocated to the fairly small trials of the National Disability Insurance Scheme.


It really does say it all about priorities and how this situation has completely gone beyond the control of the government. The only way this is all going to end is when the policies that worked are returned to this place, and the only time that is going to happen—as clearly the Independents are in lockstep with the government on all these matters—will be with a change of government. I think a lot of people in Australia and a lot of people who believe in this country are hoping that that will be at the next election.

"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2012-10-31,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon—Minister for Immigration and Citizenship) (11:33):  I bring the debate on the Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 1) 2012-13 and on the Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 2) 2012-13 to a close. I thank those members who have made a contribution.


These supplementary estimates appropriation bills seek authority from the parliament for the expenditure of money from the consolidated revenue fund to provide additional appropriation to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. The total additional appropriation being sought through these bills is just under $1.7 billion. These bills provide $668.6 million to implement the recommendations of the expert panel on asylum seekers, led by former Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, including funds for capital works and services for regional processing facilities on Nauru and Manus Island in Papua New Guinea.


I turn to note a few things in reply to the comments of those opposite. The member for Cook had quite a bit to say about the cost of opening Manus Island and Nauru—and it is expensive. This government has always said it would be expensive. I remember the shadow minister for immigration saying that it would cost around $10 million. The Leader of the Opposition said that it would require some emergency gardening, and that was all that was required to get the Nauru facility up and running, which was always patently false. The member for Cook engaged some costings, and I have had a fair bit to say about those elsewhere in terms of their veracity. They were patently false as well.


Of course, the government have always recognised that opening Manus Island and Nauru would be expensive. We have taken the view that—given the opposition's refusal to allow the passage of the Malaysia agreement, which was always our preferred policy response and which would be done more cheaply and more effectively—we would open the Manus Island and Nauru detention facilities as part of the suite of measures recommended by the expert panel. But, of course, it was always going to be very, very expensive. Funding sought in these appropriation bills is consistent with MYEFO and already budgeted through that process.


I will also briefly to respond to the member for Cowan, who just spoke. He said a number of things that are not particularly germane to the appropriation bills but, given he raised them, I will respond. He said that only Sri Lankans are being sent to Nauru and that a constituent had told him that. But he could have checked with me, because that is patently false. It is also sending out a very bad message for him to say that in the national parliament. It is sending a message to people who are not from Sri Lanka that they would not be sent to Nauru. For his information, there are currently 19 Iraqis, 24 Iranians, 58 Afghans and 43 Pakistanis on Nauru.


We have also removed more than 70 people from Australia since the announcement that we were implementing offshore processing. During the same time frame, after the Howard government had introduced offshore processing, they had not removed anybody from Australia. So 70 is a relatively small number compared to the number of arrivals—I accept that—but it is more than the Howard government had achieved at the same time and does show and underline the fact that people smugglers are selling lies.


I also want to raise that the member for Cowan criticised—and the member for Cook, I am sure, did as well—the government's decision to increase the humanitarian intake to 20,000. The member for Cowan said it was an additional 25,000 places. It is not. It is 20,000 in total, not an additional 25,000. Nevertheless, he said this was a bad thing. He spoke throughout his speech about consistency and how the opposition was consistent.


He seems to have forgotten his leader, standing at that despatch box and saying that the Liberal Party, if it attained government, would increase the refugee and humanitarian program to 20,000. That was a couple of months ago. The Leader of the Opposition, the member for Warringah, stood at that despatch box and made that commitment, and now the member for Cook and the member for Cowan are saying how terrible it is that the government has increased the humanitarian program to 20,000. Let us not hear this argument about consistency when you have a Leader of the Opposition who stood there and made that commitment a couple of months ago. I understand that they have now ripped that commitment up—it only lasted a day. Nevertheless, I will not have this lecturing from the opposition about consistency in this area.


Finally, the member for Cowan raised the issuing of visas in relation to the Christmas Island and Villawood disturbances. I remind him that this government changed the law to strengthen the character test. Since then, I have denied permanent visas to four people under that character test in relation to offences committed in detention. Having done that, I remind the opposition that they were in office for 12 years and they had riots at Woomera and Baxter and elsewhere. I ask this question of the House: how many permanent visas were denied to people convicted of offences in those riots? I will give the House a clue: it is a round number. It is zero; zero is the number of visas denied by the previous government. I have denied four permanent visas, and there are other people in the courts whose cases will come to me for decision if and when they are convicted. There are more people there to be dealt with under that process.


We heard some particularly inaccurate statements made by honourable members opposite. Nevertheless, I acknowledge the opposition's support for these appropriation bills. They are necessary to implement the recommendations of the Houston panel and because of the increased number of arrivals that we have seen in recent months. I therefore commend the bills to the House.

Mr JENKINS
 (Scullin) (11:40):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights I draw the attention of the House to the committee's sixth report of 2012.


This report reflects the committee's consideration of ten bills introduced during the period 9 to 11 October and 129 legislative instruments registered between 20 September and 16 October 2012.


In tabling this sixth report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights I would like to draw the attention of the House to the approach the committee has taken to limitations on the right to privacy in bills considered in this report.


Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the ICCPR, provides that no-one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation. It provides that everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.


The right to privacy is one of the rights most commonly engaged in the bills considered by the committee to date. It may therefore be helpful if I outline some of the factors the committee has considered in determining whether provisions that limit this right are compatible with the right.


A wide range of government legislation, policies and programs have the potential to limit the right to privacy, including measures that:


involve the collection, storage, disclosure or publication of personal information;


provide for sharing of personal information across or within agencies;


authorise powers of entry to premises or search of persons or premises; and/or


provide for mandatory disclosure or reporting of information.


Such measures all amount to an interference with the right to privacy.


In order for any interference with an individual's privacy to be lawful and not to be 'arbitrary', the interference can only take place on the basis of law and must be for a legitimate objective and be reasonable, necessary and proportionate to that objective.


The relevant legislation must specify the precise circumstances in which interferences with the right to privacy may be permitted and should not give decision makers too much discretion in authorising interferences with privacy.


The legislation should provide proper safeguards against arbitrary interference.


In this sixth report the committee considers three bills that engage the right to privacy. The committee's comments on each of these bills highlight some key considerations that the committee applies to provisions that seek to limit this right.


The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious Drugs, Identity Crime and Other Measures) Bill 2012 includes a range of measures that seek to strengthen the Commonwealth's serious drug offences framework and ensure this framework remains up to date and effective in combating the illicit drug trade.


The bill creates new offences and police powers relating to the use of false identities for the purposes of travelling by air and gives police new powers to request identity information at airports.


The statement of compatibility for the bill acknowledges that this requirement engages the right to privacy and sets out a detailed justification for the necessity of the powers. The statement points to the inclusion of appropriate safeguards to ensure that the powers are connected to the objective and are no more restrictive than necessary.


In this case, the committee concurs that these powers are unlikely to raise issues of incompatibility with the right to privacy, and any interference with privacy would appear to be necessary to achieve the legitimate objective of investigating specific offences under the bill. The committee has noted in its report that the provisions appear to be drafted with sufficient precision and contain appropriate safeguards to ensure that the degree of interference in this case is proportionate to that objective.


The Fair Entitlements Guarantee Bill 2012 provides a scheme for the provision of financial assistance to former employees whose employment has ended as a result of the winding up or bankruptcy of their employer and who have not been fully paid for work done.


This bill provides for the sharing of personal information about an employer or employee between the department and other parties who have a need for the information in relation to the administration of the bill.


The committee considers that the information-sharing provisions in this case appear to be broadly consistent with article 17 of the ICCPR, as the proposed interference with the right to privacy is likely to be necessary to achieve the aim of administering this scheme and the provisions appear to be drafted with sufficient precision to ensure that the degree of interference is proportionate to that objective.


However, the committee notes that information may be disclosed under the bill to persons who are contracted by the Commonwealth for the purposes of passing an advance made under the scheme on to a recipient. The statement of compatibility notes that each specified party or agency to which information will be disclosed has its own legal and professional obligations about the collection, storage and use of personal information under privacy laws.


In addition, the statement claims that persons who are contracted by the Commonwealth will be bound by relevant privacy clauses in their contract. However, the committee notes that this requirement does not appear to be prescribed in the bill. The committee notes that there is no provision for an offence for the unauthorised disclosure of personal information, as is a common feature in legislation that permits the disclosure of personal information for certain purposes.


The committee has therefore written to the relevant minister seeking his advice regarding the desirability of including express privacy obligations for contractors in the legislation and seeking clarification for the decision not to explicitly prohibit the unauthorised disclosure of personal information.


The final bill I draw the attention of the House to today is the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Bill 2012.


This bill establishes a framework of standard regulatory powers exercised by Commonwealth agencies. The key features of the bill include monitoring and investigation powers as well as enforcement provisions through use of civil penalty, infringement notices, enforcement undertakings and injunctions.


The explanatory statement to the bill states that the investigation powers contained in the bill are commonly found across the statute book. The investigation powers provided in the bill include powers to search and seize evidential material as well as inspect, examine, measure and test anything on the premises. The bill provides for the use of civil penalties, infringement notices and injunctions to enforce provisions and the acceptance and enforcement of undertakings relating to compliance with provisions.


To activate the bill's provisions, new or existing Commonwealth laws must expressly apply the relevant provisions and specify other requisite information such as persons who are authorised to exercise the applicable powers.


While the committee appreciates the significance of this bill in potentially simplifying and streamlining the statute book, the committee has found it difficult to determine the operation of the individual provisions and how they may impact on human rights from the level of detail provided in the statement of compatibility.


Because the bill is one of general application, the committee considers that it would be difficult to reach a definitive view on the bill's human rights compatibility. The committee considers that each application of the bill's provisions would need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Indeed the explanatory memorandum to the bill notes that future legislation incorporating provisions in this bill will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and that this ensures that distinct assessments of human rights engagement and compatibility will be apparent in the drafting and scrutiny process.


Nevertheless, the committee considers that the overall compatibility of this bill with the right to privacy might be improved by the inclusion of adequate safeguards to ensure that the relevant powers are, as far as possible, appropriately targeted and circumscribed to minimise the risk that they could be exercised inconsistently with human rights.


In this regard, the committee notes that the bill would appear to apply the full range of powers to each triggering law regardless of their necessity to the particular regulatory scheme.


The committee has therefore written to the Attorney-General to seek further clarification regarding the intended operation of the bill and, in particular, whether consideration has been given in drafting the bill to including safeguards to ensure that the powers will be exercised in a manner that is proportionate to its purpose and whether safeguards for the storage, use and disclosure of any personal information collected through the exercise of these powers have been considered.


My intention in drawing these three examples to the attention of the House today is merely to illustrate how the committee approaches the question of compatibility with the right to privacy and the circumstances in which the committee may determine that further information or clarification from a minister may assist the committee's deliberations. I hope this insight into the committee's approach will be of assistance to the parliament in making use of the committee's reports. I hope that it will be of assistance to ministers and their departments and to members and senators in the consideration of the human rights implications when drafting legislation and preparing statements of compatibility.


I commend the report to the House.

Mr JENKINS
 (Scullin) (11:40):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights I draw the attention of the House to the committee's sixth report of 2012.


This report reflects the committee's consideration of ten bills introduced during the period 9 to 11 October and 129 legislative instruments registered between 20 September and 16 October 2012.


In tabling this sixth report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights I would like to draw the attention of the House to the approach the committee has taken to limitations on the right to privacy in bills considered in this report.


Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the ICCPR, provides that no-one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation. It provides that everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.


The right to privacy is one of the rights most commonly engaged in the bills considered by the committee to date. It may therefore be helpful if I outline some of the factors the committee has considered in determining whether provisions that limit this right are compatible with the right.


A wide range of government legislation, policies and programs have the potential to limit the right to privacy, including measures that:


involve the collection, storage, disclosure or publication of personal information;


provide for sharing of personal information across or within agencies;


authorise powers of entry to premises or search of persons or premises; and/or


provide for mandatory disclosure or reporting of information.


Such measures all amount to an interference with the right to privacy.


In order for any interference with an individual's privacy to be lawful and not to be 'arbitrary', the interference can only take place on the basis of law and must be for a legitimate objective and be reasonable, necessary and proportionate to that objective.


The relevant legislation must specify the precise circumstances in which interferences with the right to privacy may be permitted and should not give decision makers too much discretion in authorising interferences with privacy.


The legislation should provide proper safeguards against arbitrary interference.


In this sixth report the committee considers three bills that engage the right to privacy. The committee's comments on each of these bills highlight some key considerations that the committee applies to provisions that seek to limit this right.


The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious Drugs, Identity Crime and Other Measures) Bill 2012 includes a range of measures that seek to strengthen the Commonwealth's serious drug offences framework and ensure this framework remains up to date and effective in combating the illicit drug trade.


The bill creates new offences and police powers relating to the use of false identities for the purposes of travelling by air and gives police new powers to request identity information at airports.


The statement of compatibility for the bill acknowledges that this requirement engages the right to privacy and sets out a detailed justification for the necessity of the powers. The statement points to the inclusion of appropriate safeguards to ensure that the powers are connected to the objective and are no more restrictive than necessary.


In this case, the committee concurs that these powers are unlikely to raise issues of incompatibility with the right to privacy, and any interference with privacy would appear to be necessary to achieve the legitimate objective of investigating specific offences under the bill. The committee has noted in its report that the provisions appear to be drafted with sufficient precision and contain appropriate safeguards to ensure that the degree of interference in this case is proportionate to that objective.


The Fair Entitlements Guarantee Bill 2012 provides a scheme for the provision of financial assistance to former employees whose employment has ended as a result of the winding up or bankruptcy of their employer and who have not been fully paid for work done.


This bill provides for the sharing of personal information about an employer or employee between the department and other parties who have a need for the information in relation to the administration of the bill.


The committee considers that the information-sharing provisions in this case appear to be broadly consistent with article 17 of the ICCPR, as the proposed interference with the right to privacy is likely to be necessary to achieve the aim of administering this scheme and the provisions appear to be drafted with sufficient precision to ensure that the degree of interference is proportionate to that objective.


However, the committee notes that information may be disclosed under the bill to persons who are contracted by the Commonwealth for the purposes of passing an advance made under the scheme on to a recipient. The statement of compatibility notes that each specified party or agency to which information will be disclosed has its own legal and professional obligations about the collection, storage and use of personal information under privacy laws.


In addition, the statement claims that persons who are contracted by the Commonwealth will be bound by relevant privacy clauses in their contract. However, the committee notes that this requirement does not appear to be prescribed in the bill. The committee notes that there is no provision for an offence for the unauthorised disclosure of personal information, as is a common feature in legislation that permits the disclosure of personal information for certain purposes.


The committee has therefore written to the relevant minister seeking his advice regarding the desirability of including express privacy obligations for contractors in the legislation and seeking clarification for the decision not to explicitly prohibit the unauthorised disclosure of personal information.


The final bill I draw the attention of the House to today is the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Bill 2012.


This bill establishes a framework of standard regulatory powers exercised by Commonwealth agencies. The key features of the bill include monitoring and investigation powers as well as enforcement provisions through use of civil penalty, infringement notices, enforcement undertakings and injunctions.


The explanatory statement to the bill states that the investigation powers contained in the bill are commonly found across the statute book. The investigation powers provided in the bill include powers to search and seize evidential material as well as inspect, examine, measure and test anything on the premises. The bill provides for the use of civil penalties, infringement notices and injunctions to enforce provisions and the acceptance and enforcement of undertakings relating to compliance with provisions.


To activate the bill's provisions, new or existing Commonwealth laws must expressly apply the relevant provisions and specify other requisite information such as persons who are authorised to exercise the applicable powers.


While the committee appreciates the significance of this bill in potentially simplifying and streamlining the statute book, the committee has found it difficult to determine the operation of the individual provisions and how they may impact on human rights from the level of detail provided in the statement of compatibility.


Because the bill is one of general application, the committee considers that it would be difficult to reach a definitive view on the bill's human rights compatibility. The committee considers that each application of the bill's provisions would need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Indeed the explanatory memorandum to the bill notes that future legislation incorporating provisions in this bill will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and that this ensures that distinct assessments of human rights engagement and compatibility will be apparent in the drafting and scrutiny process.


Nevertheless, the committee considers that the overall compatibility of this bill with the right to privacy might be improved by the inclusion of adequate safeguards to ensure that the relevant powers are, as far as possible, appropriately targeted and circumscribed to minimise the risk that they could be exercised inconsistently with human rights.


In this regard, the committee notes that the bill would appear to apply the full range of powers to each triggering law regardless of their necessity to the particular regulatory scheme.


The committee has therefore written to the Attorney-General to seek further clarification regarding the intended operation of the bill and, in particular, whether consideration has been given in drafting the bill to including safeguards to ensure that the powers will be exercised in a manner that is proportionate to its purpose and whether safeguards for the storage, use and disclosure of any personal information collected through the exercise of these powers have been considered.


My intention in drawing these three examples to the attention of the House today is merely to illustrate how the committee approaches the question of compatibility with the right to privacy and the circumstances in which the committee may determine that further information or clarification from a minister may assist the committee's deliberations. I hope this insight into the committee's approach will be of assistance to the parliament in making use of the committee's reports. I hope that it will be of assistance to ministers and their departments and to members and senators in the consideration of the human rights implications when drafting legislation and preparing statements of compatibility.


I commend the report to the House.

"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2012-10-31,"



Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (12:17):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012. It absolutely astounds the coalition that this legislation, which was introduced at I think 4.30 yesterday afternoon, has now appeared on the Notice Paper for debate at the second reading stage. We have had less than 24 hours to consider the ramifications of this bill. It is a bill that will affect each and every employee, independent contractor and employer in Australia, yet this parliament has had so little time to consider it. The minister would have us believe that the process which brings this amendment bill before the House has integrity. I say that it does not. The minister explained it this way in his own second reading speech. He promised a review of the Fair Work Act. He then appointed an independent panel to conduct the review. The independent panel had wide-ranging terms of reference approved by a regulatory office within the Department of Finance and Deregulation. It came up with 53 recommendations and today we are discussing the first tranche of 17 of those recommendations.


That is what the minister said, but the reality is quite different—and I note that, along the way, the minister has been mugged by reality. Having promised this review, which the government could not back away from, the minister hand-picked the three members of the independent panel. I do not want to name those individuals or cast aspersions on them, but anyone can look at their remarks on the public record over a long period of time and make up their own mind as to whether they are independent or not. The minister's office then skewed the terms of reference originally drafted by the department, which probably were quite wide ranging. Freedom of information documents prove that beyond a doubt. The terms of reference having been skewed and, in the process, narrowed—so that they did not include productivity, red tape, flexibility or the effect of union militancy—these narrow terms of reference were then used by this not independent panel to come up with, unsurprisingly, a statement that said the Fair Work Act is working well, meeting its objectives and economic outcomes and is all quite favourable.


But, as I said, the minister was mugged by reality, because among these 53 recommendations that the minister has to take note of are some that he is not taking note of in this legislation today, which he is rushing before the parliament even though we could have a serious and sensible Senate investigation in the three weeks before the parliament rises at the end of the year. Yes, it would be good to get it through in the spring sitting—and we have got four weeks to go—but what we see now is a 24-hour process. I condemn that utterly because it is not reasonable, it is not sensible and it is not in good faith.


The minister was presented with a review into the Fair Work Act back in June. Having strung out the time line lends even more incredibility to the sudden introduction of the legislation into the parliament. The minister was presented with a review in June. It was publicly released in late July or early August. The minister then took until October to deliver his response. He had what he described as genuine consultation. To say it was a sham consultation would probably be a little bit unfair, but a lot of people were not consulted—and have not been consulted on this bill either. The coalition certainly were not consulted, even though we have made ourselves available in good faith as oppositions do from time to time when it comes to important pieces of legislation.


So the response was delivered in October and now we have to consider this legislation within a matter of hours. Rushing it through the parliament does nothing for the integrity of the parliament and it does show disrespect for members.


The first tranche of reforms that the minister brings to the parliament today has some major omissions. In fact, I think what the minister has done is pick the least contentious ones—creating an atmosphere of activity and an agenda that is happening but really picking the least contentious. We think, as a priority, these initial reforms should address the strike first, talk later mentality that has pervaded the more militant unions and has been demonstrated in the JJ Richards case. I want to remind the House of that case because it demonstrated a major inconsistency between the stated Labor government policy on workplace bargaining and the written legislation. The waste disposal provider JJ Richards was unsuccessful in its attempts to overturn a Fair Work Australia decision, a decision that sets the precedent of allowing unions to take strike action without the support of a majority of workers. We would contend that that inconsistency between the government's stated legislative intention and reality, as proved in the Federal Court, is something that—if the minister really does want to address something in a hurry—should be addressed in a hurry. In fact, the justices of the Federal Court said:


… the ability to take protected industrial action 'is to be seen as part and parcel of the statutory regime for bargaining in pursuit of, or in resistance to, the making of such agreements'.


However, they said the drafting of the Fair Work Act (s.443) meant it was simply not possible to construe the Act's requirements in that way.


I am not a lawyer, but I would say that that is a clear indication from the Federal Court that there is a need to change the law to properly meet, and bring legislative clarity to, this area. The hypocrisy of this government is that the legislation does not reflect its previously stated position on the issue of unions taking strike action in circumstances where they cannot muster the support of the majority of workers for such action.


In the first instance, the Federal Court's judgement accepted that the argument advanced was understandable and reasonable but for the specific wording in the Fair Work Act which entitles unions to obtain protected action ballots in circumstances where reasonable people would argue that that should not be allowed. The fact that the minister has refused to even comment on the review recommendation that would fix this up is alarming and could be seen as an indication that this was their original intent—appeasing their union comrades. This is despite the then government leader, Kevin Rudd, promising that the Fair Work Act would not allow the return of strike first, talk later.


Furthermore, there is nothing in these initial reforms to address concerns raised by the High Court in a unanimous judgement in the Barclay v The Board of Bendigo Regional Institute of TAFE case, where it was found that union bosses should not be an untouchable class in the workplace—something also recommended by the Fair Work Act review. Yet the minister himself intervened in this case, on the side of the union boss, Mr Barclay, arguing that it was actually the intention of the Fair Work Act to make union bosses untouchable, even if they did the wrong thing. Regarding this intervention, Justice Heydon said:


… the Minister’s stance before and during the oral hearing was not that of an intervener, but that of a partisan. For example, some of the Minister’s oral submissions were directed to factual material. This is hardly the province of an intervener.


This intervention, by the way, came at a cost of $160,000 to the Australian taxpayer—that is, arguing that it actually was the intention of the Fair Work Act to make union bosses untouchable even if they did the wrong thing. This is a minister who could not leave the judicial process to run its course and reach its conclusions without that demonstratively partisan intervention.


It is important to briefly consider the Fair Work Act review itself. I have touched on a couple of the recommendations that have not been listened to by the minister in this initial round of reforms, but I think we also need to contemplate the terms of reference for the review of the Fair Work Act. There were a number of key omissions, as I said earlier, because the terms of reference did not mention productivity, flexibility, concerns around union boss militancy and red tape. A freedom of information request has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the initial terms of reference submitted by the department to the minister's office underwent significant changes at the hands of the minister's staff. Clearly, they are skewed in a particular direction, and I suspect that considerable union consideration was given to the draft terms. In addition to the terms of reference, we should acknowledge the make-up of the panel, which I alluded to earlier. While the panel claimed to be independent, I consider that their left-leaning credentials coupled with those skewed terms of reference that they were asked to consider demonstrate a blatant attempt by the government to influence the findings.


In total, as I said, the Fair Work Act review proposed 53 reforms to the act. The government has put forward 17 recommendations in this initial tranche. However, these 17 reforms are not much more than tinkering at the edges. For the most part, they are not actually overly contentious. So, in this first wave of reforms, we have seen little real indication of a serious attempt on the part of this government to introduce meaningful, necessary reforms. It must be said that this is a somewhat haphazard attempt at reform, not only dealing with the reform of the act but also including changes to superannuation, plus to Fair Work Australia itself.


It is also interesting to see that the review panel's clear recommendation that Fair Work Australia be renamed and include the word 'commission' and not 'fair work' has been partially rejected. Labor could not bring themselves to get rid of the 'fair work' name. They have stuck to their Orwellian and borderline obsession with the 'fair work' mantra. It is interesting that, along with the panel, the President of Fair Work Australia himself has suggested that the name be changed.


Why? I think members opposite have to acknowledge that the entire 'fair work' brand has been well and truly damaged by the HSU saga, by that tawdry series of events that has not yet played out. If you ask people in the community what issues they might associate with Fair Work Australia, they will bring up the HSU scandal. We do not want that. We do not want the independent, quasi-judicial body Fair Work Australia to have its brand trashed or damaged.


We do not want people not to have confidence and faith in the independent umpire. We have always stated that we have confidence and faith in the independent umpire. We do not have any confidence or faith in the minister, and we make that clear. But why wouldn’t you change the name? I think the reason is that this whole Fair Work mantra belongs to the Prime Minister. It was well and truly her baby, and for that reason it stays. Comments made in the Fair Work review espoused the views of the new President of Fair Work Australia, Justice Iain Ross. It states:


He is also a strong advocate for changing the name of the tribunal, arguing that the current title undermines its independence and creates confusion. He proposed that as a minimum the tribunal be changed to ‘Fair Work Commission’, but said it would be preferable to separate it from the ‘Fair Work’ brand altogether, and rename it the ‘Australian Employment Commission’ or the ‘Australian Workplace Commission’.


That has not happened.


Another concern held by the coalition surrounds the extension of powers to the president of Fair Work Australia. The coalition believes the powers of the president should not be further widened and that it would be better to maintain the current arrangements, by which failures to comply with sections of the Fair Work Act are grounds for termination. Currently there are two vice-presidents, nine senior deputy presidents and five deputy presidents, and there is a line-up of commissioners and panel members that can be called on for particular inquiries and investigations. So the architecture of Fair Work Australia is quite substantial.


There are some elements of the bill which the coalition applauds. For example, on the issue of costs, consideration 'on the papers' and vexatious applicants, the coalition has long advocated for change, with Senator Abetz on the record calling for this. These calls have seen him attacked by Labor and its union bosses, but, when they are stated in a $1 million review, they are praised and adopted by the government. So we do appreciate the adoption of the position that we have been putting for some time on costs and vexatious applicants, but we note that there are other serious inconsistencies.


The bill makes some important steps in the right direction. The coalition strongly supports the alignment of the time limit for unfair dismissal and general protections claims at 21 days. In fact, I believe that brings the situation back to where it was under the previous Workplace Relations Act. It was the coalition that amended the Fair Work Act, with the support of the Independents, to extend the unfair dismissal time limit from seven to 14 days.


Regarding the changes being made to Fair Work Australia, I do not believe that the minister has made suitable justification for the appointment of an additional two vice-presidents. I mentioned the substantial architecture of the membership of Fair Work Australia and the fact that further concentration of power seems to now rest with the president. We do not think that is reasonable. Why couldn't the system operate as it does now, with the vice-presidents effectively managing the workload that the president cannot? The concentration of power at the top of the organisation has to be questioned and then responded to by this government. Two more vice-presidents are to be appointed even though power is going to be concentrated in the president. The scuttlebutt is that the minister wants to appoint a couple of his friends to these positions and that that appointment needs to happen sooner rather than later—evidence, we would say, of further intervention in the operations of an independent Fair Work body.


In addition, the government has made no genuine attempt to address the current closed-shop, anti-competitive arrangements for the selection of default superannuation funds under modern awards through Fair Work Australia. The minister has taken the opportunity to use the Productivity Commission review—which he finally got around to initiating—of superannuation and the default superannuation funds that appear in modern awards to respond to that. But he has not done so satisfactorily.


The current process for the selection of default funds under modern awards, initiated by this government and run by Fair Work Australia, lacks transparency, is littered with inherent conflicts and inappropriately favours union dominated industry super funds. If this bill is passed by parliament, it will see the continuation of a process where conflicted parties within Fair Work Australia continue to select default super funds under modern awards. There will not be genuine competition. There will be an additional layer of government intervention, because, in appearing to address this very real problem—this very real unfairness—the minister has announced that an expert panel will be appointed, that the expert panel will create a shortlist, that the shortlist will go back to the President of Fair Work Australia and that then the president will decide what funds will be inserted into modern awards.


Why can't the employer choose the default funds? Why can't the employer choose from the list of funds that would be ticked off under MySuper so that their governance and their accountability is fine, so that they are good funds and so that those who put their money in them would not be putting their money at risk? They might, of course, be retail funds—that is the problem with the minister's approach. Why can't the employer select them? Instead, we have to go through another expensive, convoluted process: a panel, a shortlist and a decision by the President of Fair Work Australia. What is the decision based on? It is based not on working conditions but on what default super funds sit in modern awards. This smacks of intervention in this area by the government, which we oppose.


The government is also seeking to limit the number of MySuper products in modern awards to just 10, contrary to the clear recommendation of the Productivity Commission which was that there should be an unlimited list of default funds. Given that the government is currently in the process of imposing additional consumer protection requirements to all default superannuation funds, there is no rhyme or reason in restricting the MySuper products in the modern awards to 10. All compliant superannuation funds should be made eligible.


There are further recommendations made by the review that the government has also failed to heed. The Productivity Commission's proposed default superannuation panel will not be created as recommended; it will be subsumed into the existing Minimum Wage Panel.


The new panel is not the final decision maker under this bill, as recommended. The full bench of Fair Work Australia will approve default funds in each award after a recommendation. The process of including funds in awards will only occur every four years, starting in 2014, when modern awards are due for review, as opposed to an ongoing application process. All awards must have default funds; currently there are 13 awards that do not list default funds.


The coalition thinks it is regrettable that the review's recommendations on the name change from Fair Work Australia to Australian Workplace Relations Commission has not been accepted. Despite the Labor's rushing this bill through with such haste and sitting on the review for four months, there has been no excuse from those opposite as to why it is suddenly so urgent. I suspect that there is a sense of urgency to appoint these additional two mates to the vice-presidency roles. I cannot think of any other reason that Labor would take this position. So I ask the minister to rule out those rumours that are flying around in the IR community that people have been promised vice-presidential positions from February next year.


Whilst there a number of elements within this bill that we do support, having had less than 24 hours to consider this bill we make a very strong statement that this is shabby treatment of the parliamentary process and of an opposition that would act, in this instance, in good faith. Had time permitted we would have sought to have drafted a number of substantive amendments. To give some sense to people of the undue haste I can say that the officers involved in the drafting process within the parliament could not have drafted the amendments by the time I rose to my feet today to speak on this bill. So it is not just the opposition that has been treated shabbily; it is the whole process, including the people who would draft the amendments that we would have brought here. Given these time constraints, there has not been time to do the requisite work. We will seek to refer this bill to a Senate committee when it gets to the other place. At this stage we will not be opposing the bill.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2012-10-31,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (12:39):  With all the confected outrage that one might expect in a cheap pantomime performance, the member for Farrer has posed the question: why can't the employer choose where their workers' superannuation goes? She may as well ask: why can't the employer choose which bank their employees put their savings into? Why can't the employer choose what sort of car their employees drive? Why can't the employer choose what school they send their kids to? These questions demonstrate one thing, and one thing alone: those opposite have learnt absolutely nothing from the Work Choices debacle. That demonstrates in a nutshell their views about the relationship between the employees and the employers of this world, because they believe that it is entirely appropriate for an employer to be the one who chooses where their employees put their life savings. I say, and all those on this side of the House say, that that is entirely inappropriate. 


Continuing the confected outrage, the member for Farrer stood here and at one moment claimed that she is a defender of the independence of Fair Work Australia—defending the right of that quasi-judicial institution to independence and defending it from slings and shots—and at the next moment she said that there are somehow conflicted parties within Fair Work Australia who could not make an independent determination about where an employee's superannuation goes. It shows that, when it comes to industrial relations, members of the opposition have not learnt a thing and that they speak out of both sides of their mouths.


This is a good piece of legislation that we have before the House, and I commend the minister for bringing it before the House and responding in such a prompt way to the outcomes of the review by the expert panel. Of course, it stands in line with all the other reforms that our government has introduced since it was elected in 2007—starting with the scrapping of Work Choices, then more recently the support for equal pay for community workers and ensuring that those who drive trucks on our roads are paid safe rates so that they go home safe and that everybody who shares the road with them can do so in a safe manner. Then, of course, we increased superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent. These were all landmark Labor reforms to workplace relations arrangements in this country.


But the matters that I would like to concentrate my attention on are the matters which are referred to as the 'transmission of business' provisions. 'Transmission of business' is shorthand for the arrangements that are put in place when a business is transferred from one legal owner to another legal owner, through whatever means, and the conduct of the industrial relations arrangements—that is, the transfer of employees and their rights and entitlements—throughout that transfer of ownership arrangements.


The provisions have existed in Australian federal law since at least 1914 and been mirrored in similar state legislation since around about the same time. The reasons for the existence of these laws were well summed up in the High Court decision of George Hudson Limited and the Australian Timber Workers Union—a decision of the High Court of Australia in 1923—where Justice Higgins said:


But nothing would be so likely as to prevent agreement as the knowledge, on the part of the unions, that the employer could get rid of at any time of his obligations under it by assigning his business—even by assigning it to a new company having the same shareholders holding shares in the same proportion as in the former company.


The provisions that we are debating today have their history in those 1914 amendments and that 1923 decision, where Justice Higgins stated quite clearly that what we are trying to do with these sorts of provisions is maintain industrial harmony and ensure that for employees, once an agreement is made or an award is struck, the settlement of that dispute and the outcome of those negotiations—the reaching of that agreement—is maintained and assists any transfer of that business or undertaking from one ownership to another or the restructuring of that business from one ownership to another. 


As Justice Higgins would say, nothing is more likely to prolong a dispute or drag out negotiations than the apprehension on one side of the negotiations that, as soon as that agreement is reached, those on the other side of those negotiations might be able to avoid that agreement by corporate rearrangement.


Australia is not the only jurisdiction to have these sorts of provisions. A number of countries regard the maintenance of wages and conditions, in the event of a transmission of an enterprise, as an important part of corporations and industrial relations law. In the European Union, the European directive 77187EEC protects an employee's entitlements where a transmission of business occurs. Many European countries have subsidiary arrangements in place to give effect to that directive. In the United Kingdom, Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 were designed to comply with the European Union's directive and preserve an employee's wages and conditions in the event of a transfer. In Canada, the Canada Labour Code applies a collective agreement to a new employer upon transmission, and even in the United States the National Labour Relations Act protects, to some extent, wages and conditions in a collective agreement when a transmission constitutes a substantial continuity of the company.


This is evidence that what we have in our Australian law is consistent with history and consistent with international practice. The problem is simply this: when an award or agreement exists and binds the employment arrangements within a workplace and the corporate identity of that workplace changes, we need orderly and secure arrangements to ensure that the employees are not left worse off in those arrangements. For most of the last century this problem was dealt with by other means: the existence in the state jurisdiction of common rule awards. These applied across an industry or a calling, so it did not matter if a business was transferred or if the identity of a business changed; the award continued to bind by force of the common rule. In the federal jurisdiction it occurred through the practice of roping-in awards or, more commonly, through constructive industrial relations practices, where employees and their representatives would simply reach agreement to flow the old conditions across to the new employer.


When collective agreements gained primacy in the 1990s the framers of the industrial relations legislation simply transported the old award provisions over to the new collective agreement arrangements. This occurred through the 1993-94 amendments to the industrial relations legislation. Indeed, it even occurred when the Howard government introduced its Workplace Relations Act 1996 reforms and again, with some significant modifications, in the 2007 legislation by this government.


Throughout the greater period of the last century the problem of a transmission of business was dealt with by other means. Dispute and conflict over this issue was re-enlivened by the late 1990s and early part of this century.




Mr Fletcher:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order on relevance: Would the member for Throsby inform the House whether he is speaking about the Fair Work Amendment Bill or the Fair Work Amendment (Transfer of Business) Bill?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Mitchell
):  There is no point of order. The member for Throsby is to continue.




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  The importance of this is that— 




Mr Fletcher:
  Mr Deputy Speaker—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Are you calling another point of order?




Mr Fletcher:
  On a point of order on relevance: the question is whether he is speaking about the bill that is presently before the House.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I am sure that if you listened, as I was listening, you would have heard that he is speaking about the bill before the House. It has been wide ranging. There have been other speakers who have drifted away from the bill on your side whom we have allowed to go through, so you should show the member for Throsby the same respect that you would expect to be shown to you and others.




Mr Fletcher:
  With due deference, Mr Deputy Speaker, the simple point I make is that there is a bill—two bills later on—that deals with transfer of business and, as I have listened to the member, the issues he has been talking about have been about transfer of business.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  As I said, there is no point of order. The member for Throsby will continue.




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  As I was saying, these matters were re-enlivened throughout the 1990s and the earlier part of the last decade as awards were replaced by collective agreements, as the gaps between wages contained in collective agreements and awards grew, as restructuring and corporatisation ensued, as fragmentation around traditional understandings of industries occurred and through the opening up of our economy and the public sector to competition and contestability.


These provisions have a long history. The reforms that we find ourselves debating before the House today have a long history. This legislation is important because it applies and extends the legislation to current state system employees. It matters a lot because there is currently a lot of action in this space. We see state governments—currently, state conservative governments—who are taking very aggressive action. In your state, Mr Deputy Speaker, we see the Baillieu government sacking state public servants and corporatising state public entities and ensuring that the long-settled wages and conditions of state system employees are now under threat.


This legislation is important because it provides some security to those public sector employees and others. They know that, if there is some change to the ownership or legal entity of their employer, they have some security of their wages and conditions and the comfort of knowing that these will be protected by federal law in the event of such a transfer.


With those brief comments, I commend the package of legislation to the House. 


I think it is good legislation. It is legislation in keeping with those reforms I outlined before: the riddance of the dreaded Work Choices legislation, the introduction of equal pay for community sector workers, the introduction of safe rates for transport industry workers and the improvement in superannuation arrangements—all of which, I might say, were hotly contested by those opposite. Further to that, there is a willingness to ensure that, when issues do arise and we do need to refine the law—when we consult with business, when we consult with unions and when we talk to employees—we are ready, willing and able to make the appropriate modifications to ensure that they are continuously fit for purpose. I commend the legislation to the House.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (12:52):  It is a pleasure to rise to speak on the Fair Work Amendment Bill and to follow the member for Throsby. As it happens, I find myself following a former union official—but that is not a statistically unlikely thing to happen when one stands up to speak following a Labor member of this place. However, it is somewhat unlikely to find oneself following a member who was actually speaking about the wrong bill and who spent some 13 minutes telling us about the transfer of business provisions, which are not dealt with in this bill at all. They are dealt with in a bill which is to be debated two bills later on. But I suppose he would argue that it is 'the vibe'.


I do want to speak about the bill that is before the House this afternoon. In particular, I want to focus on the provisions in this bill which supposedly reform the arrangements under which modern awards specify default superannuation funds. The provisions in this bill dealing with those matters are a classic example of this government looking after its mates in the union sector—union officials who run superannuation funds at the expense of the broader community and going in completely the opposite direction to that which sensible procompetitive economic reform would dictate.


In the time that is available to me I want to make three points. Firstly, the current default arrangements for default superannuation funds are a cosy and anti-competitive racket. Secondly, the present introduction of the low-cost, generic MySuper product is a perfect opportunity to introduce more competition by saying that any MySuper product can be a default fund. Thirdly, the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation has in this bill squibbed the chance to introduce increased competition. In fact, he has made the process less competitive. He has handed even greater power to the cosy club of retired union officials who run Fair Work Australia.


Let me turn firstly to the proposition that the current arrangements for default superannuation funds are a cosy and anti-competitive racket which serves the interests of a cabal of union officials. The superannuation system has grown enormously. There are now some $1.4 trillion under management in that system. In 2011-12 some $90 billion of funds flowed into the sector largely because of the compulsory superannuation arrangements. Of this, nearly two-thirds went into two classes of funds: industry funds and public sector funds. These two classes of funds generally use the so-called equal representation model, with half of the directors appointed by a union and half by an employer association. If you look at the statistics put out by APRA, the industry regulator, you find that in February 2012 there were 76 funds listed as industry or public sector for the 2010-11 financial year. If you analyse the annual reports of all of those funds, what you find is there was a total of 575 directors on the boards of whom 180 were appointed by unions.


The Labor Party over many years has consistently used the compulsory superannuation system to increase the power, influence and financial position of the union movement and its key personnel. Indeed, the current Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations is a former secretary of one of the largest unions in the country, the Australian Workers Union, and a former director of the largest industry superannuation fund, AustralianSuper. The default fund arrangements—or, I should say, the union involvement in superannuation—were specifically designed into the superannuation fund system when it was set up by the Hawke and Keating governments in the early 90s. Today the boards of industry super funds are stuffed with union bosses including: AWU boss, Paul Howes; Queensland ALP heavyweight and AWU strongman, Bill Ludwig, who is the father of the present minister for agriculture; TWU secretary Tony Sheldon and; until recently, Health Services Union officials Kathy Jackson and Michael Williamson.


Under the Fair Work Act, the so-called modern awards must contain a clause specifying the superannuation fund into which the employer must pay the employee's superannuation contributions. To be nominated as a default fund under a modern award is very valuable because it guarantees a stream of contributions. The current process for the selection of default funds lacks transparency, is littered with inherent conflicts and quite inappropriately favours union-dominated industry superannuation funds. Analysis conducted by the Institute of Public Affairs in 2010 found that across 166 modern awards approved by Fair Work Australia, there were a total of 566 superannuation funds specified. Of these, 513 were industry funds or public sector funds. AustralianSuper was specified as a default fund in over 70 awards.


Why is it that Fair Work Australia so readily signs off on modern awards which entrench the flow of contributions to union-friendly superannuation funds? It might be that Fair Work Australia is stacked with ex-union officials. Between December 2009 and December 2011, 10 people were appointed as Fair Work Australia commissioners by the Rudd-Gillard government and, of these people, eight had union backgrounds. These arrangements give the unions a degree of control of superannuation which goes much further than the small and shrinking share of the workforce who are union members. Union membership is now down to about 18 per cent of the workforce and around 12 per cent of the private sector workforce. But these arrangements serve the interests of unions very well because, amongst other things, it means a large number of well-paid directorships to be allocated amongst the union mates. The annual report of one industry fund, Cbus, revealed that two directors—presumably one was the chair—received over $90,000 a year and that several other directors received more than $50,000 a year. In some cases these fees are pocketed by the individual union nominated directors; in other cases the fees are paid to the union. But in either case the arrangements suit the union movement very nicely.


The Cooper review into superannuation recommended that the current equal representation model should be comprehensively reformed. Curiously, former union official Bill Shorten has ignored that particular recommendation.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr FLETCHER:
  That is an extraordinary surprise, as my colleague points out. Let me turn, therefore, to the opportunity which the introduction of MySuper products offered to introduce more competition. MySuper was recommended by the Cooper review, and the notion is to have low-cost, default superannuation products designed to meet the needs of those Australians who are not actively engaged with their own superannuation and do not make an active choice.


The government is currently in the process of legislating the consumer protection requirements, which it considers important in a default fund product, through the various pieces of MySuper legislation. These products are going to be very widely offered, including by retail superannuation funds. There is no reason at all that every product which qualifies as a MySuper product should not be able to compete freely in the default fund market. After all, if the policy objective is to ensure that somebody who defaults into a fund—that is, somebody who does not make an active choice but simply ends up in the fund specified by the modern award which covers his or her industry—ends up in a fund which is low-cost and tailored to his or her needs as a customer with low engagement, then by definition any MySuper product should fit the bill nicely. But the minister has a very different policy objective. His objective is to ensure that the current cosy arrangements stay in place so that the industry and public sector funds continue to get the lion's share of contributions—and they are doing so, of course, at the expense of people whose money is taken by force of legislation. That money is being used to contribute to the size and scale of economic entities largely controlled by union officials.


The Labor Party promised in 2010 that it was going to do something about this. It paid lip service to the principle of allowing greater competition and the choice of funds. Its 2010 policy contained a promise to introduce an open, transparent and competitive system with a process to select default funds under modern awards. Bill Shorten dragged his heels for as long as he could before reluctantly proceeding with this. Since that time—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Mitchell
):  Order! The member knows to use people's correct titles.




Mr FLETCHER:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The minister has taken every opportunity to white ant, undermine and ignore the recommendations of the Productivity Commission. When the draft report was released earlier this year suggesting as one possibility the establishment of a new body independent of Fair Work Australia with the sole purpose of selecting and assessing the funds to be listed in modern awards, the minister promptly rushed out a press release on 22 August 2012 stating that the Gillard government would preserve the role of Fair Work Australia in selecting default funds.


With the final report now released and the legislation now before us, it is clear that this government has ignored much of what the Productivity Commission has recommended in framing the provisions of this bill. For example, this bill will impose a limit on the number of MySuper products in modern awards of just 10, contrary to the clear recommendation of the Productivity Commission that there should be an unlimited list of default funds. The Productivity Commission proposed a default superannuation panel. That will now not be created as recommended; instead it will be subsumed into the existing minimum wage panel. The new panel is not the final decision maker under this bill, as was recommended by the Productivity Commission; rather, the full bench of Fair Work Australia will approve default funds in each award after a recommendation from the expert panel.


The process of including funds in awards will only occur every four years, starting in 2014 when modern awards are due for review as opposed to an ongoing application process. The bill will now require that all awards have default funds, whereas currently there are 13 awards that do not list default funds and are therefore open to competition. That is clearly a serious oversight, and the minister has not wasted any time in fixing that up to make sure the interests of his mates are looked after. Instead of ensuring genuine competition, this bill will impose an additional layer of government intervention into the default fund market. There is absolutely no justification for doing this and for imposing the additional cost, complexity and delay which comes with that additional intervention.


Let us be absolutely clear in the House this afternoon. This bill, despite the rhetoric, has absolutely nothing to do with delivering a more competitive process for choosing default superannuation funds. On the contrary, it makes the process less competitive and hands even greater power to the retired union officials who run Fair Work Australia. This is nothing short of a grubby stitch-up by Minister Shorten and the Gillard Labor government to look after their mates in the union movement and put a distant second the interests of the millions of Australians who are compulsory investing in super.


If this bill is passed it will see the continuation of a process under which conflicted parties within Fair Work Australia continue to select default super funds under modern awards. The minister has been so desperate to protect the vested interests of his friends in the union movement that he has lost sight of his responsibility as a minister of the Crown to act in the public interest. What we are reminded of by these developments is the very close relationship between the industry superannuation sector and the parliamentary Labor Party. Let me just remind the parliament that there are four former directors of Australian Super who have become federal Labor parliamentarians or candidates—the minister, Greg Combet, Doug Cameron and Cath Bowtell.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! Again, the member for Bradfield will once again be reminded to refer to members by their correct title as is required under standing order 64.




Mr FLETCHER:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. You are doing a sage job of trying to defend these current arrangements. This government is clearly not doing what needs to be done when it comes to ensuring that employers and employees in default superannuation can benefit from genuine competition in that market.


It is deeply disappointing that the coalition has been given no time to consider this legislation in detail or to have detailed consultations with stakeholders on this bill. It is clear that the arrangements for this bill coming into the House—the process—do nothing to improve the confidence that the House might have in the merits of the policy that we are considering today. The coalition is therefore gravely concerned about the provisions in this bill. We are certainly reserving our right to move amendments in the Senate. I also make the point that if it is clear that the government is not going to do what needs to be done to improve competition in the field of default superannuation then, if the coalition is elected to government at the next election, we will take the actions that need to be taken to improve competition in this area.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2012-10-31,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (13:07):  I speak in support of the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012. The member for Bradfield overnight has not had a road to Damascus conversion experience, because he, along with his colleagues and comrades opposite, opposed protecting worker entitlements last night and here he goes again, railing against the representatives of millions of Australians in the workplace. There is no doubt about it: the coalition instinctively votes against or opposes every bill with the word 'fair' in it. Last night, we had the situation in which we passed legislation to protect the entitlements of workers who were at risk due to the liquidation or bankruptcy of their employers. The coalition opposed that.


Here today, in response to the independent review panel and the Productivity Commission, they are still responding in a negative way, recklessly opposing this legislation—or that is what people listening to the member for Bradfield would believe. If you listened to the member for Farrer before, she was saying that they will pass it through the House. So you have to wonder what their position is. But their position has been a negative one since the electorate had a look at them in 2007 and voted down their position on Work Choices. We on this side are in favour of Fair Work; those on that side are in favour of Work Choices. It is clear from listening to speeches like that one by the member for Bradfield that that is what they are all about.


The background to this particular legislation is that we have been crystal clear about workplace reform, our policies and our plans. What about the coalition? The Leader of the Opposition is currently in witness protection on that particular policy, because he does not want to talk about it at all. What we are talking about here is making changes recommended to us by the Fair Work review panel following consultations with unions, small business, large business and a range of other stakeholders. Many of these changes in this first tranche of amendments are technical, structural, procedural or clarifying changes to the unfair dismissal framework. For example, these changes give Fair Work Australia the power to strike out award variation applications not made in accordance with the act if they are frivolous or vexatious. Any tribunal, court or quasi-judicial body should have that power. They are also given the power to make amendments to applications made by parties to vary or revoke a modern award to make sure that, if there are ambiguities or uncertainty in those applications, they can be changed by Fair Work Australia.


These changes also better align Fair Work legislation with other laws relating to unfair dismissal, extending the time period to 21 days, another sensible provision. They will give the president of Fair Work Australia the power to require applicants to provide more information about the circumstances of dismissal—further and better particulars. That is an important change also. These changes will also make sure that, if a lawyer or a paid agent misbehaves or does the wrong thing after they have been given leave by Fair Work Australia to represent a party, costs can be ordered against them. This bill also changes the name of Fair Work Australia to the Fair Work Commission. That is important as well.




Ms Ley:
  That's a big one!




Mr NEUMANN:
  There are a lot of amendments here that are important and that those opposite belittle. But industry in fact supports these changes. On many occasions, representatives from industry have been party to consultation undertaken by the minister. They have been at the table when these amendments have been discussed and have made submissions to the panel that have been adopted in whole or in part. There are also amendments putting in place the recommendation to appoint acting deputy presidents and acting commissioners for specified periods. There are many changes that provide pathways for judicial complaint, similar to what we see in courts such as the Federal Magistrates Court or the Family Court. This bill makes many sensible changes that will have a big impact.


If you listened to speakers opposite, you might come to the belief that there are a very small number of people associated with this system. But we are talking about Fair Work Australia having approved 16,000 enterprise agreements covering 2.2 million employees. About seven million Australians are currently protected from unfair dismissal. Those provisions were brought forward by this side of politics and were steadfastly opposed by the Liberal Party, because it is in their blood and bones to oppose these sorts of things. More than 810,000 jobs have been created under this government's watch.


We have brought forward reform after reform in workplace relations to protect the entitlements of workers and to assist them. These include reforms to protect those working in the textile and clothing industry and reforms to the road safety remuneration system. We have acted to particularly protect the 120,000 women who work in the social and community sector, who will now get wage award increases of between 23 per cent and 45 per cent in the next decade. But those opposite have consistently opposed every reform that I have talked about. We are lifting up Australian low- and middle-income workers.


We said that we would undertake a review into the Fair Work Act. Guess what the panel decided? I bet that you will not hear this from those opposite, but the panel, which extensively approached industry and small and large businesses, found that the Fair Work Act is working well and meeting its objectives. The economic outcomes under the Fair Work Act have been favourable to Australia's continuing prosperity. There has been no dramatic wages blowout and no drastic increase in industrial disputes. The IR armageddon predicted by those opposite has not occurred. Notwithstanding that, the panel recommended 53 changes, and the government has taken up the response to that, and this is what the legislation before the House is.


We have also picked up the Productivity Commission's inquiry into the superannuation industry. The Productivity Commission found that existing default fund arrangements resulted in net returns generally exceeding those for non-default funds. Over the eight years to 2011, default funds in modern awards have on average an after-tax return of 6.4 per cent, compared with 5.5 per cent on non-default funds. So, what we are doing here is making some changes.



Mr Fletcher interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Mitchell
):  The member for Bradfield will stay quiet and is warned.




Mr NEUMANN:
  But those opposite leap, moan, carp and whine and undertake some sort of anti-union, anti-worker tirade, like you heard from the member for Bradfield.


Under the changes in this bill all funds under a generic MySuper product will be able to apply for selection as a default fund, on an equal basis. Those opposite seem to take the view, constantly, that workers should be dictated to by bosses, that workers' superannuation should be dictated to and that their wages and conditions should be entirely set without negotiation. The expert panel looked into this—an expert panel within the Productivity Commission. I wonder why those opposite say they support the Productivity Commission sometimes and they oppose it on other occasions?


An expert panel within the Fair Work Commission will assess funds on the basis of the legislative criteria, which are based on those proposed by the Productivity Commission. The Productivity Commission is not a bunch of bleeding-heart, left-wing, socialist ideologues. The Productivity Commission is full of people who those opposite would probably think were on their side of politics when it comes to economic issues. A full bench of the Fair Work Commission will then determine what particular funds from the default superannuation list are best suited for inclusion in each modern award, with the best interests of those employees covered by that particular award as their overarching consideration.


This process will occur every four years to align with four-year reviews of modern awards. What we are going to do in relation to this particular legislation is respond in a positive way, not like those opposite. We have heard the member for Bradfield go on and on in a typical Work Choices tirade against unions—they are naming people and constantly going on like this. That is one of many speeches we have heard in the last few years and will continue to hear from those opposite in relation to this.


This is good legislation. It responds to inquiries. It responds to the Productivity Commission. It responds to the expert review panel. It takes up the reforms and it makes a difference. It is legislation that should be supported, and I note that those opposite, despite what they say today in this debate, will actually pass this legislation. I look forward to seeing whether or not they will call a division on it, because the member for Farrer forecast the fact that they would support it.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,9,1,speech
"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2012-10-31,"



Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (13:17):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012. I note that the member for Blair managed to get through about nine minutes of his contribution on this bill, so important was this bill, which was tabled with urgency last evening by the minister for industrial relations. The procedures of the House had to be overturned—the normal procedure of the bill sitting on the table had to be overturned—because these matters were so urgent that they needed to be spoken on today.


For most of his nine minutes, the member for Blair did not actually address anything to do with the substance of the bill, which at least is better than the member for Throsby, who, in the rush to get into the House, was given the wrong talking points. You would expect a little bit better from a bunch of former union officials who are in this place to represent their vested interests. The member for Throsby came in and gave a speech on the wrong bill. But this bill is so urgent that we have to debate it today ahead of all other business on this government's so-called agenda.


I have a suspicion as to why we are debating this bill in such a rush. I will not cover the ground that the member for Bradfield so carefully and thoroughly covered in his contribution in respect of the default superannuation issues, because he did it so well. I will focus on the Fair Work Australia provisions in this bill, because I think there are very serious charges against this minister in relation to the provisions in this bill. He has some significant issues to address in his summing-up remarks other than the bit of political fluffery in his second reading speech, which does not answer and explain why it is that this parliament is urgently debating this bill.


The reason, I understand, for the urgency is that the minister says these are the most urgent matters out of the Fair Work Australia report he had done. It is a skewed report based on skewed terms of reference and skewed panel members. Mr Deputy Speaker Mitchell, you well know that one of those panel members in particular, Professor Ron McCallum, is one of the most partisan actors in Australian industrial relations. Professor McCallum is out and proud about his support of the Australian Labor Party, so much so that in August this year he was on the record supporting the Labor opposition leader in Victoria and predicting the end of the Baillieu government in two years time. We should note that. Professor McCallum is entitled to his political views, but people should be aware that he is a partisan actor. That is why we have great suspicion of a skewed report based on skewed terms of reference by skewed panellists.


But, if you are to believe the minister that these are the most urgent matters we should be dealing with out of that report, let us work through why that would be the case. The first issue is the default superannuation provisions, which, as the member for Bradfield so rightly pointed out, are more to do with favouring vested interests, yet again, in the industry super funds area. It is not about actual reform. There is not a significant provision at all in the report, and it is contrary to the Productivity Commission report.


Then we get to the provisions relating to the changes in the structure of and powers of Fair Work Australia, which has been subjected to some quite serious debate in recent months, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would be aware. One issue that has not been subjected to debate is the appointment of two new vice-presidents.


That is not an area in which I have heard there has been criticism of Fair Work Australia. In fact, if you look through the report—it is reasonably substantive, albeit skewed, and the member for Melbourne will be pleased that I have printed it on both sides—there is not a mention of appointment of two new vice-presidents. What would that cost the taxpayer? There is nothing in the bill about costs at all. It says the impact is nil. Well, let us work though that. A vice-president appointed by Fair Work Australia is paid at least $350,000 a year, putting aside on-costs—higher superannuation, cars. They have a special office arrangement within Fair Work Australia, as I understand. Sources within Fair Work Australia have given me a heads-up that there are special office arrangements. They get two appointed assistants, counsels, who are paid around $90,000 a year—again, without their super and without other conditions.


We are talking about a million bucks a year—conservatively—for each of these appointments. That is $2 million a year and $8 million over the estimates, for those who cannot keep up. That is an $8 million decision made on the basis of no evidence at all. Can you imagine what the parliamentary secretary for regional services could do with $8 million out in regional Australia? I certainly can, and I know the member for Farrer knows what she would do with eight million bucks. There is nothing in this report at all, yet the second main reason we are urgently debating this bill is the appointment of two new vice-presidents. Is it because the current two are too busy? The member for Melbourne will be interested to know that one of the current two is Mr Michael Lawler—who, we know, the Labor Party has some issues with, and the President of Fair Work Australia has some issues with. Mr Michael Lawler's partner is Kathy Jackson. Kathy Jackson, of course, revealed so much information about the $20 million of rorting that occurred in the HSU, found by a report—ironically—from Fair Work Australia.


So we have Mr Michael Lawler, who has been sidelined in Fair Work Australia, based on information I have received—completely sidelined. He is far from busy, as I understand. And then we have Mr Graeme Watson. Mr Graeme Watson has two sins. The first is that he comes from Freehills, a legal organisation that largely represents employer organisations. I know the member for Melbourne knows Mr Watson and would not agree with many of Mr Watson's views. But what the member for Melbourne would not do is discriminate against him on that basis. That is the first of Mr Watson's sins that the President of Fair Work Australia is not pleased with. The second is that Mr Watson had the temerity to suggest that after all the scandal relating to HSU, after all the failure in relation to the investigation by Fair Work Australia, after all the scandal and muck that came out about the failure of that organisation to do its job, it should change its name. And the President of Fair Work Australia was not very happy. Mr Ross was not very happy at all. Mr Watson, since that time, has regretted giving that speech, because professionally he is underutilised at this point in time.


So we have two vice-presidents who are there, not particularly busy. Sure, they are not flavour of the month for the current president. But then a piece of legislation pops up into this parliament, out of nowhere—no recommendations in this review, not a single line in well over 300 pages—recommending that $8 million of taxpayers' money, at least, be spent on two new vice-presidents for no good reason. You have to wonder why. Then you look at the bill, and the bill empowers the two new vice-presidents to be more powerful than the current two sitting vice-presidents. It empowers them to be more senior. And you, Mr Deputy Speaker Mitchell, know very well that the way Fair Work Australia—the old Industrial Relations Commission—works is that seniority is very important when handing out full-bench cases. When handing out full-bench cases, seniority rules the day. In this bill, the two yet unnamed—and that is a very important point here—new vice-presidents, which will cost taxpayers at least $8 million over the forward estimates, will be more powerful than the two out-of-favour current vice-presidents in Fair Work Australia. Two are out of favour, so appoint two new ones and give more power to the president to give them more work—because they may just have similar views, dare I say, to those of the current president and the current government.


We know that the current president, Mr Ross, and the minister have been close for a very long time. There is nothing wrong with that; Australian industrial relations is quite a small gene pool, as we know. They have been so close, in fact, that in 2006 the two of them appeared on the stage at a protest against—you guessed it—the former Howard government. The minister, at that point in time a candidate—I am not sure if he was still the AWU secretary—and on a superannuation industry board, along with Mr Ross, an ACTU official, were at a protest together against the Howard government, trying to overturn the laws. They are now working together to empower Mr Ross to be more powerful in respect of—and here is another provision in the bill, which I am sure you are also aware of, Mr Deputy Speaker—decisions for applicants to appeal when a member of Fair Work Australia has been allocated to a case and an applicant, let us say the CFMEU, is not happy with the commissioner who has been allocated. They will be able to appeal to the president to have a full-bench case. Whacko! Guess what you have just done? You have given two new vice-presidents, who just might come from a similar background to what you want, with new powers for the president to allocate cases to them. Are you following me yet? This is what this is about. This has been debated urgently because this minister is trying to future-proof Fair Work Australia.


These are not the two most urgent matters relating to Fair Work Australia—not at all. Having a look at why it took them years and years to investigate what happened with the HSU might be a matter that is urgent; that might be a matter that needs some reform. Do we need two new vice-presidents for Fair Work Australia, when the report does not say a word about it, when the current two incumbents are hardly busy and are capable of doing far more than they are? But what we see, what we know and what we hear on the industrial relations grapevine is that these two positions are being created for none other than Mr Josh Bornstein, a long-time union lawyer, famously depicted in the ABC's balanced take on the waterfront dispute in 1998, a recent op-ed writer, who also represented a member of parliament in a recent dispute, as we are aware.


The second one is Mr Jeff Lawrence. We understand Mr Lawrence has finished up as President of the ACTU. He has a bit of time on his hands, is looking around for new opportunities—and guess what pops up? There we are: vice-president of Fair Work Australia. It pays pretty well—$350,000 to $360,000 a year with a car, superannuation, a nice office, two associates. A million bucks from the taxpayer? That's not much. It is a disgrace. This minister does not mention a word of it in a second reading speech on an urgent bill, where we have changed the procedures of this House to introduce it, and I say to this minister that I charge him with a very serious contempt of this place. This is using legislative power—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! The member will withdraw the word 'contempt' of the parliament.




Mr BRIGGS:
  I will withdraw the word and change it to 'abuse' of this place, Mr Deputy Speaker—abuse of legislative instruments to give curry to the minister's vested interests in the Australian industrial relations environment, to the union movement. That is what this bill is about: creating two new taxpayer funded positions, to the extent of at least $8 million over the forward estimates, to allow this government to future-proof Fair Work Australia and its operations.


The minister should come in, in the summing up of this debate, before this parliament gives consideration and before this bill passes, and explain: what is the urgent need? There is capacity with the two current vice-presidents to pick up the load. The report itself, the bill upon which we are debating—even though he has had this since June, in the dying days of this year we are debating this bill in an urgent manner, overriding the normal procedures, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you well know. This bill has not been sitting on the table for the required length of time, giving the opposition just hours to consider its position. Thankfully, with the assistance of outside parties, we have been made aware of some of these issues, and the parliament should give consideration to them.


This minister should explain himself. He should explain where this recommendation comes from, what he is trying to achieve, why he is creating $8 million of taxpayer funded positions over the next eight years for an organisation whose biggest issues are not its staffing capacity. By far and away its biggest issues are not its staffing capacity. We know that from what we have seen from the HSU scandal. We know that from what people are telling us within Fair Work Australia. This is a disgrace; it is a scandal. And the minister should explain himself. They are trying to force this through prior to the potential government changing early next year, so they have future-proofed Fair Work Australia, and the minister should answer it. He should answer why he is using $8 million worth of taxpayers' money, and the parliament should not pass this bill until the minister has given a reasonable explanation about why this is being used to assist not the Australian public or its economy but the Labor Party and its friends.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2012-10-31,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (13:33):  It is with a wry smile that I listen to members of the coalition complain about appointments to Fair Work Australia. During the period of the Howard government, when it was the Industrial Relations Commission—



Mr Briggs interjecting—




Mr BANDT:
  I am sure that the member for Mayo will interject if I have the numbers wrong, but there were something in the order of 20 new appointments made during that time, of which about two came from a union background. So I think those who live in glass houses should not throw stones about this question of appointment. I think there has been a fair bit of traducing from both sides of the tradition that had existed previously in Australian industrial relations of an even balance between employers, employees and people who had come from other backgrounds, including government. I note that the member for Mayo leaves without correcting my figures, and I think they are about right: of the 20-odd new appointments under the Howard government, about 18 came from employer backgrounds.


We are here debating the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012, a bill to amend the Fair Work Act to give effect to a review that was conducted and some changes that are said to be necessary to the act. There are indeed a number of changes that need to be made to the act, and I will come to those in a moment. But perhaps I could just come back and finish on one point about the question of members of Fair Work Australia. Whatever the merits of the member for Mayo's charge regarding the vice-president positions, which I note the coalition is going to support through the passage of this bill, we can put those to one side—that is a potentially a legitimate claim that is being raised there. But I do take issue with the statements that were made just then by the member for Mayo about the President of Fair Work Australia, Justice Iain Ross. I think it ought to be recalled that Justice Ross's pedigree is one of previously being a Supreme Court judge and the head of VCAT in Victoria. As well as his having worked for the ACTU I know that he also ended up working for a law firm that represents employers more often than not. I know that because, in my previous capacity, I appeared opposite him. I think we should be careful in this place, especially when people outside have the status of a judge of the Federal Court of Australia, of not overstepping the mark and suggesting, as one could interpret the previous member's comments, that somehow the current head of Fair Work Australia would not act appropriately. I think that is a more serious charge than the one that the member sought to level and one that should not be made using privileges that attach to debate that goes on in this chamber. That would be a misuse of those privileges.


With regard to the changes that do need to be made to the Fair Work Act, there are many. One would have hoped that, in a bill that has been brought in quickly and that presumably the government identifies as being the most urgent changes that need to be made—and ones that need to be made before the end of the year—we would have seen changes addressing a number of very important areas. The Fair Work Act needs to be amended to give people better work-life balance. At the moment under the Fair Work Act, you have the right to go and ask your employer, in certain circumstances, for flexible working arrangements to go and look after your kid or certain others in your family, but it is an unenforceable right.


The employer can say no and, if they say no, there is no way that you can appeal it. That matter urgently needs to be amended. The Greens have said this, the ACTU has said this and various other groups concerned about making sure people have a proper work-life balance have said this. Unfortunately, there is nothing in this bill that gives people a better work-life balance and, surely, we should be using this parliament to see reform in this area.


Secondly, in some very concrete ways state public sector workers—and I have had firsthand experience of this in Victoria—face some pretty big difficulties in bargaining under the Fair Work Act. Nurses, for example, saw their dispute prolonged for months and months—and we know this from leaked cabinet documents in Victoria—because the employer's strategy was to string out the negotiations, to force the nurses out of sheer frustration to then start taking industrial action and to use that to get to Fair Work Australia where their claim would be arbitrated. The reason the employer wanted to do that is that it knew that for constitutional, technical and legal reasons one of the key claims of the nurses—namely, nurse-patient ratios—would not find its way into the final decision. In other words, if it could get to Fair Work Australia through this subterfuge, then the government would win on the question of nurse-patient ratios and there would not be any. So the nurses were forced for months and months to bargain in good faith. They met stonewalling from the government, because that was part of their industrial legal tactic.


We saw a repeat of this behaviour in some version with teachers in Victoria, where you have a government that knows how to use the Fair Work Act and how to exploit the holes that exist in it.


When Qantas grounded its entire fleet and essentially held a gun to the nation's head, it did so, again, for technical and legal advancement under the Fair Work Act. Qantas knew that, if it could provoke a storm and provoke industrial action to be terminated, it would get to arbitration. It also knew that if it got to arbitration it would win on the job security clauses that the employees were attempting to negotiate, similar to what we saw with the nurses.


We have seen very powerful employers under the watch of this government work out the holes in the Fair Work Act and how to use them to stop employees legitimately bargaining for things that really matter, such as job security and nurse-patient ratios. That could be fixed. The Greens have got bills in parliament that would fix those loopholes, but we do not see that in this government's bill. Apparently, this matter is not urgent enough that it needs to be fixed by the end of the year. Everyone who is working in the state public sector should continue to suffer under an unfair act that tilts bargaining away from being a level playing field to, very clearly, being in the employer's favour.


Hearing some of the government members speak, you would think that Work Choices was dead and buried. Anyone who works in this area would know that almost all of the provisions relating to bargaining and industrial action that were instituted in Work Choices have been kept in the Fair Work Act. Indeed, one union I spoke to said they did a comparison between the Fair Work Act and Peter Reith's Workplace Relations Act and felt they would have been better under Peter Reith's Workplace Relations Act because it more closely complied with international standards on how one should bargain.


So there is some unfinished business of repealing those last bits of Work Choices that hang over in the Fair Work Act, and that should be considered as urgent. This government should use this parliament to fix that. There are many important reforms to the Fair Work Act that we could get through now that would protect people's rights at work and that would insulate the Australian public from a potential change of government. So many areas of the Fair Work Act need to be tidied up. Unfortunately, what we have here is a rather tepid bill that contains a mixed bag of proposals, but in our view the case for reform of some of those proposals has not been made out. For example, on the question of costs, if you read the review there is, I would suggest, pretty thin evidence that suggests that somehow a lack of stronger costs provisions in the unfair dismissal jurisdiction is causing any real problem. In fact, there is very little evidence.


From my experience, having worked in that jurisdiction, it was always the case that you would advise applicants very carefully about prosecuting or not taking settlement offers in unfair dismissals because they would find themselves potentially at risk of a costs order. The most recent authorities on this point make it very clear that, in fact, if you act unreasonably in unfair dismissals you can get costs ordered against you. So I do not see the need—and it is not made out in the report—for imposing additional disincentives on people to exercise their rights, and that is what this bill will do.


I am also concerned about the potential adverse consequences of—again without any proper evidentiary basis—putting additional obligations on lawyers who practise in the jurisdiction by potentially making them personally liable. The reason for that is not that there is no room for lawyers to improve; of course there is. But when you say to a lawyer, 'You are now personally at risk of costs, unless you do X,' you introduce conflicting interests for that lawyer. Are their obligations to best represent the person whom they are representing? Or—and this is my concern—will they find themselves more often in this area representing someone who might have been unfairly dismissed because they were pregnant or just because the employer did not like them, and is a lawyer now going to turn around and say to them, 'Actually, you really should accept this offer that is on the table because I myself am concerned about being proceeded against for costs'? In other words, is the lawyer going to put their own interests of potentially not being liable for a costs order ahead of their client, and will that affect the advice that is given to people who are pursuing their legitimate rights? It also does not appear from the review that the 60-day time limit and general protections are being abused, either.


There are also some questions that need to be asked regarding superannuation and the changes regarding industrial action. For the purposes of allowing passage through the House the Greens will be supporting the bill, but that is without prejudice to our position in the Senate and our right to move amendments in the Senate, especially in respect of those areas that I have identified.


I would urge the government not to be too middle-of-the road about this but instead make a clear choice about what reforms it wants to see to the Fair Work Act during the life of this parliament. There is an opportunity to insulate against a return to Work Choices, and instead of being timid we should be bold and make those reforms that are very definitely needed.


Debate interrupted.

"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2012-10-31,"



Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (12:17):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012. It absolutely astounds the coalition that this legislation, which was introduced at I think 4.30 yesterday afternoon, has now appeared on the Notice Paper for debate at the second reading stage. We have had less than 24 hours to consider the ramifications of this bill. It is a bill that will affect each and every employee, independent contractor and employer in Australia, yet this parliament has had so little time to consider it. The minister would have us believe that the process which brings this amendment bill before the House has integrity. I say that it does not. The minister explained it this way in his own second reading speech. He promised a review of the Fair Work Act. He then appointed an independent panel to conduct the review. The independent panel had wide-ranging terms of reference approved by a regulatory office within the Department of Finance and Deregulation. It came up with 53 recommendations and today we are discussing the first tranche of 17 of those recommendations.


That is what the minister said, but the reality is quite different—and I note that, along the way, the minister has been mugged by reality. Having promised this review, which the government could not back away from, the minister hand-picked the three members of the independent panel. I do not want to name those individuals or cast aspersions on them, but anyone can look at their remarks on the public record over a long period of time and make up their own mind as to whether they are independent or not. The minister's office then skewed the terms of reference originally drafted by the department, which probably were quite wide ranging. Freedom of information documents prove that beyond a doubt. The terms of reference having been skewed and, in the process, narrowed—so that they did not include productivity, red tape, flexibility or the effect of union militancy—these narrow terms of reference were then used by this not independent panel to come up with, unsurprisingly, a statement that said the Fair Work Act is working well, meeting its objectives and economic outcomes and is all quite favourable.


But, as I said, the minister was mugged by reality, because among these 53 recommendations that the minister has to take note of are some that he is not taking note of in this legislation today, which he is rushing before the parliament even though we could have a serious and sensible Senate investigation in the three weeks before the parliament rises at the end of the year. Yes, it would be good to get it through in the spring sitting—and we have got four weeks to go—but what we see now is a 24-hour process. I condemn that utterly because it is not reasonable, it is not sensible and it is not in good faith.


The minister was presented with a review into the Fair Work Act back in June. Having strung out the time line lends even more incredibility to the sudden introduction of the legislation into the parliament. The minister was presented with a review in June. It was publicly released in late July or early August. The minister then took until October to deliver his response. He had what he described as genuine consultation. To say it was a sham consultation would probably be a little bit unfair, but a lot of people were not consulted—and have not been consulted on this bill either. The coalition certainly were not consulted, even though we have made ourselves available in good faith as oppositions do from time to time when it comes to important pieces of legislation.


So the response was delivered in October and now we have to consider this legislation within a matter of hours. Rushing it through the parliament does nothing for the integrity of the parliament and it does show disrespect for members.


The first tranche of reforms that the minister brings to the parliament today has some major omissions. In fact, I think what the minister has done is pick the least contentious ones—creating an atmosphere of activity and an agenda that is happening but really picking the least contentious. We think, as a priority, these initial reforms should address the strike first, talk later mentality that has pervaded the more militant unions and has been demonstrated in the JJ Richards case. I want to remind the House of that case because it demonstrated a major inconsistency between the stated Labor government policy on workplace bargaining and the written legislation. The waste disposal provider JJ Richards was unsuccessful in its attempts to overturn a Fair Work Australia decision, a decision that sets the precedent of allowing unions to take strike action without the support of a majority of workers. We would contend that that inconsistency between the government's stated legislative intention and reality, as proved in the Federal Court, is something that—if the minister really does want to address something in a hurry—should be addressed in a hurry. In fact, the justices of the Federal Court said:


… the ability to take protected industrial action 'is to be seen as part and parcel of the statutory regime for bargaining in pursuit of, or in resistance to, the making of such agreements'.


However, they said the drafting of the Fair Work Act (s.443) meant it was simply not possible to construe the Act's requirements in that way.


I am not a lawyer, but I would say that that is a clear indication from the Federal Court that there is a need to change the law to properly meet, and bring legislative clarity to, this area. The hypocrisy of this government is that the legislation does not reflect its previously stated position on the issue of unions taking strike action in circumstances where they cannot muster the support of the majority of workers for such action.


In the first instance, the Federal Court's judgement accepted that the argument advanced was understandable and reasonable but for the specific wording in the Fair Work Act which entitles unions to obtain protected action ballots in circumstances where reasonable people would argue that that should not be allowed. The fact that the minister has refused to even comment on the review recommendation that would fix this up is alarming and could be seen as an indication that this was their original intent—appeasing their union comrades. This is despite the then government leader, Kevin Rudd, promising that the Fair Work Act would not allow the return of strike first, talk later.


Furthermore, there is nothing in these initial reforms to address concerns raised by the High Court in a unanimous judgement in the Barclay v The Board of Bendigo Regional Institute of TAFE case, where it was found that union bosses should not be an untouchable class in the workplace—something also recommended by the Fair Work Act review. Yet the minister himself intervened in this case, on the side of the union boss, Mr Barclay, arguing that it was actually the intention of the Fair Work Act to make union bosses untouchable, even if they did the wrong thing. Regarding this intervention, Justice Heydon said:


… the Minister’s stance before and during the oral hearing was not that of an intervener, but that of a partisan. For example, some of the Minister’s oral submissions were directed to factual material. This is hardly the province of an intervener.


This intervention, by the way, came at a cost of $160,000 to the Australian taxpayer—that is, arguing that it actually was the intention of the Fair Work Act to make union bosses untouchable even if they did the wrong thing. This is a minister who could not leave the judicial process to run its course and reach its conclusions without that demonstratively partisan intervention.


It is important to briefly consider the Fair Work Act review itself. I have touched on a couple of the recommendations that have not been listened to by the minister in this initial round of reforms, but I think we also need to contemplate the terms of reference for the review of the Fair Work Act. There were a number of key omissions, as I said earlier, because the terms of reference did not mention productivity, flexibility, concerns around union boss militancy and red tape. A freedom of information request has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the initial terms of reference submitted by the department to the minister's office underwent significant changes at the hands of the minister's staff. Clearly, they are skewed in a particular direction, and I suspect that considerable union consideration was given to the draft terms. In addition to the terms of reference, we should acknowledge the make-up of the panel, which I alluded to earlier. While the panel claimed to be independent, I consider that their left-leaning credentials coupled with those skewed terms of reference that they were asked to consider demonstrate a blatant attempt by the government to influence the findings.


In total, as I said, the Fair Work Act review proposed 53 reforms to the act. The government has put forward 17 recommendations in this initial tranche. However, these 17 reforms are not much more than tinkering at the edges. For the most part, they are not actually overly contentious. So, in this first wave of reforms, we have seen little real indication of a serious attempt on the part of this government to introduce meaningful, necessary reforms. It must be said that this is a somewhat haphazard attempt at reform, not only dealing with the reform of the act but also including changes to superannuation, plus to Fair Work Australia itself.


It is also interesting to see that the review panel's clear recommendation that Fair Work Australia be renamed and include the word 'commission' and not 'fair work' has been partially rejected. Labor could not bring themselves to get rid of the 'fair work' name. They have stuck to their Orwellian and borderline obsession with the 'fair work' mantra. It is interesting that, along with the panel, the President of Fair Work Australia himself has suggested that the name be changed.


Why? I think members opposite have to acknowledge that the entire 'fair work' brand has been well and truly damaged by the HSU saga, by that tawdry series of events that has not yet played out. If you ask people in the community what issues they might associate with Fair Work Australia, they will bring up the HSU scandal. We do not want that. We do not want the independent, quasi-judicial body Fair Work Australia to have its brand trashed or damaged.


We do not want people not to have confidence and faith in the independent umpire. We have always stated that we have confidence and faith in the independent umpire. We do not have any confidence or faith in the minister, and we make that clear. But why wouldn’t you change the name? I think the reason is that this whole Fair Work mantra belongs to the Prime Minister. It was well and truly her baby, and for that reason it stays. Comments made in the Fair Work review espoused the views of the new President of Fair Work Australia, Justice Iain Ross. It states:


He is also a strong advocate for changing the name of the tribunal, arguing that the current title undermines its independence and creates confusion. He proposed that as a minimum the tribunal be changed to ‘Fair Work Commission’, but said it would be preferable to separate it from the ‘Fair Work’ brand altogether, and rename it the ‘Australian Employment Commission’ or the ‘Australian Workplace Commission’.


That has not happened.


Another concern held by the coalition surrounds the extension of powers to the president of Fair Work Australia. The coalition believes the powers of the president should not be further widened and that it would be better to maintain the current arrangements, by which failures to comply with sections of the Fair Work Act are grounds for termination. Currently there are two vice-presidents, nine senior deputy presidents and five deputy presidents, and there is a line-up of commissioners and panel members that can be called on for particular inquiries and investigations. So the architecture of Fair Work Australia is quite substantial.


There are some elements of the bill which the coalition applauds. For example, on the issue of costs, consideration 'on the papers' and vexatious applicants, the coalition has long advocated for change, with Senator Abetz on the record calling for this. These calls have seen him attacked by Labor and its union bosses, but, when they are stated in a $1 million review, they are praised and adopted by the government. So we do appreciate the adoption of the position that we have been putting for some time on costs and vexatious applicants, but we note that there are other serious inconsistencies.


The bill makes some important steps in the right direction. The coalition strongly supports the alignment of the time limit for unfair dismissal and general protections claims at 21 days. In fact, I believe that brings the situation back to where it was under the previous Workplace Relations Act. It was the coalition that amended the Fair Work Act, with the support of the Independents, to extend the unfair dismissal time limit from seven to 14 days.


Regarding the changes being made to Fair Work Australia, I do not believe that the minister has made suitable justification for the appointment of an additional two vice-presidents. I mentioned the substantial architecture of the membership of Fair Work Australia and the fact that further concentration of power seems to now rest with the president. We do not think that is reasonable. Why couldn't the system operate as it does now, with the vice-presidents effectively managing the workload that the president cannot? The concentration of power at the top of the organisation has to be questioned and then responded to by this government. Two more vice-presidents are to be appointed even though power is going to be concentrated in the president. The scuttlebutt is that the minister wants to appoint a couple of his friends to these positions and that that appointment needs to happen sooner rather than later—evidence, we would say, of further intervention in the operations of an independent Fair Work body.


In addition, the government has made no genuine attempt to address the current closed-shop, anti-competitive arrangements for the selection of default superannuation funds under modern awards through Fair Work Australia. The minister has taken the opportunity to use the Productivity Commission review—which he finally got around to initiating—of superannuation and the default superannuation funds that appear in modern awards to respond to that. But he has not done so satisfactorily.


The current process for the selection of default funds under modern awards, initiated by this government and run by Fair Work Australia, lacks transparency, is littered with inherent conflicts and inappropriately favours union dominated industry super funds. If this bill is passed by parliament, it will see the continuation of a process where conflicted parties within Fair Work Australia continue to select default super funds under modern awards. There will not be genuine competition. There will be an additional layer of government intervention, because, in appearing to address this very real problem—this very real unfairness—the minister has announced that an expert panel will be appointed, that the expert panel will create a shortlist, that the shortlist will go back to the President of Fair Work Australia and that then the president will decide what funds will be inserted into modern awards.


Why can't the employer choose the default funds? Why can't the employer choose from the list of funds that would be ticked off under MySuper so that their governance and their accountability is fine, so that they are good funds and so that those who put their money in them would not be putting their money at risk? They might, of course, be retail funds—that is the problem with the minister's approach. Why can't the employer select them? Instead, we have to go through another expensive, convoluted process: a panel, a shortlist and a decision by the President of Fair Work Australia. What is the decision based on? It is based not on working conditions but on what default super funds sit in modern awards. This smacks of intervention in this area by the government, which we oppose.


The government is also seeking to limit the number of MySuper products in modern awards to just 10, contrary to the clear recommendation of the Productivity Commission which was that there should be an unlimited list of default funds. Given that the government is currently in the process of imposing additional consumer protection requirements to all default superannuation funds, there is no rhyme or reason in restricting the MySuper products in the modern awards to 10. All compliant superannuation funds should be made eligible.


There are further recommendations made by the review that the government has also failed to heed. The Productivity Commission's proposed default superannuation panel will not be created as recommended; it will be subsumed into the existing Minimum Wage Panel.


The new panel is not the final decision maker under this bill, as recommended. The full bench of Fair Work Australia will approve default funds in each award after a recommendation. The process of including funds in awards will only occur every four years, starting in 2014, when modern awards are due for review, as opposed to an ongoing application process. All awards must have default funds; currently there are 13 awards that do not list default funds.


The coalition thinks it is regrettable that the review's recommendations on the name change from Fair Work Australia to Australian Workplace Relations Commission has not been accepted. Despite the Labor's rushing this bill through with such haste and sitting on the review for four months, there has been no excuse from those opposite as to why it is suddenly so urgent. I suspect that there is a sense of urgency to appoint these additional two mates to the vice-presidency roles. I cannot think of any other reason that Labor would take this position. So I ask the minister to rule out those rumours that are flying around in the IR community that people have been promised vice-presidential positions from February next year.


Whilst there a number of elements within this bill that we do support, having had less than 24 hours to consider this bill we make a very strong statement that this is shabby treatment of the parliamentary process and of an opposition that would act, in this instance, in good faith. Had time permitted we would have sought to have drafted a number of substantive amendments. To give some sense to people of the undue haste I can say that the officers involved in the drafting process within the parliament could not have drafted the amendments by the time I rose to my feet today to speak on this bill. So it is not just the opposition that has been treated shabbily; it is the whole process, including the people who would draft the amendments that we would have brought here. Given these time constraints, there has not been time to do the requisite work. We will seek to refer this bill to a Senate committee when it gets to the other place. At this stage we will not be opposing the bill.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2012-10-31,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (12:39):  With all the confected outrage that one might expect in a cheap pantomime performance, the member for Farrer has posed the question: why can't the employer choose where their workers' superannuation goes? She may as well ask: why can't the employer choose which bank their employees put their savings into? Why can't the employer choose what sort of car their employees drive? Why can't the employer choose what school they send their kids to? These questions demonstrate one thing, and one thing alone: those opposite have learnt absolutely nothing from the Work Choices debacle. That demonstrates in a nutshell their views about the relationship between the employees and the employers of this world, because they believe that it is entirely appropriate for an employer to be the one who chooses where their employees put their life savings. I say, and all those on this side of the House say, that that is entirely inappropriate. 


Continuing the confected outrage, the member for Farrer stood here and at one moment claimed that she is a defender of the independence of Fair Work Australia—defending the right of that quasi-judicial institution to independence and defending it from slings and shots—and at the next moment she said that there are somehow conflicted parties within Fair Work Australia who could not make an independent determination about where an employee's superannuation goes. It shows that, when it comes to industrial relations, members of the opposition have not learnt a thing and that they speak out of both sides of their mouths.


This is a good piece of legislation that we have before the House, and I commend the minister for bringing it before the House and responding in such a prompt way to the outcomes of the review by the expert panel. Of course, it stands in line with all the other reforms that our government has introduced since it was elected in 2007—starting with the scrapping of Work Choices, then more recently the support for equal pay for community workers and ensuring that those who drive trucks on our roads are paid safe rates so that they go home safe and that everybody who shares the road with them can do so in a safe manner. Then, of course, we increased superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent. These were all landmark Labor reforms to workplace relations arrangements in this country.


But the matters that I would like to concentrate my attention on are the matters which are referred to as the 'transmission of business' provisions. 'Transmission of business' is shorthand for the arrangements that are put in place when a business is transferred from one legal owner to another legal owner, through whatever means, and the conduct of the industrial relations arrangements—that is, the transfer of employees and their rights and entitlements—throughout that transfer of ownership arrangements.


The provisions have existed in Australian federal law since at least 1914 and been mirrored in similar state legislation since around about the same time. The reasons for the existence of these laws were well summed up in the High Court decision of George Hudson Limited and the Australian Timber Workers Union—a decision of the High Court of Australia in 1923—where Justice Higgins said:


But nothing would be so likely as to prevent agreement as the knowledge, on the part of the unions, that the employer could get rid of at any time of his obligations under it by assigning his business—even by assigning it to a new company having the same shareholders holding shares in the same proportion as in the former company.


The provisions that we are debating today have their history in those 1914 amendments and that 1923 decision, where Justice Higgins stated quite clearly that what we are trying to do with these sorts of provisions is maintain industrial harmony and ensure that for employees, once an agreement is made or an award is struck, the settlement of that dispute and the outcome of those negotiations—the reaching of that agreement—is maintained and assists any transfer of that business or undertaking from one ownership to another or the restructuring of that business from one ownership to another. 


As Justice Higgins would say, nothing is more likely to prolong a dispute or drag out negotiations than the apprehension on one side of the negotiations that, as soon as that agreement is reached, those on the other side of those negotiations might be able to avoid that agreement by corporate rearrangement.


Australia is not the only jurisdiction to have these sorts of provisions. A number of countries regard the maintenance of wages and conditions, in the event of a transmission of an enterprise, as an important part of corporations and industrial relations law. In the European Union, the European directive 77187EEC protects an employee's entitlements where a transmission of business occurs. Many European countries have subsidiary arrangements in place to give effect to that directive. In the United Kingdom, Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 were designed to comply with the European Union's directive and preserve an employee's wages and conditions in the event of a transfer. In Canada, the Canada Labour Code applies a collective agreement to a new employer upon transmission, and even in the United States the National Labour Relations Act protects, to some extent, wages and conditions in a collective agreement when a transmission constitutes a substantial continuity of the company.


This is evidence that what we have in our Australian law is consistent with history and consistent with international practice. The problem is simply this: when an award or agreement exists and binds the employment arrangements within a workplace and the corporate identity of that workplace changes, we need orderly and secure arrangements to ensure that the employees are not left worse off in those arrangements. For most of the last century this problem was dealt with by other means: the existence in the state jurisdiction of common rule awards. These applied across an industry or a calling, so it did not matter if a business was transferred or if the identity of a business changed; the award continued to bind by force of the common rule. In the federal jurisdiction it occurred through the practice of roping-in awards or, more commonly, through constructive industrial relations practices, where employees and their representatives would simply reach agreement to flow the old conditions across to the new employer.


When collective agreements gained primacy in the 1990s the framers of the industrial relations legislation simply transported the old award provisions over to the new collective agreement arrangements. This occurred through the 1993-94 amendments to the industrial relations legislation. Indeed, it even occurred when the Howard government introduced its Workplace Relations Act 1996 reforms and again, with some significant modifications, in the 2007 legislation by this government.


Throughout the greater period of the last century the problem of a transmission of business was dealt with by other means. Dispute and conflict over this issue was re-enlivened by the late 1990s and early part of this century.




Mr Fletcher:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order on relevance: Would the member for Throsby inform the House whether he is speaking about the Fair Work Amendment Bill or the Fair Work Amendment (Transfer of Business) Bill?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Mitchell
):  There is no point of order. The member for Throsby is to continue.




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  The importance of this is that— 




Mr Fletcher:
  Mr Deputy Speaker—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Are you calling another point of order?




Mr Fletcher:
  On a point of order on relevance: the question is whether he is speaking about the bill that is presently before the House.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I am sure that if you listened, as I was listening, you would have heard that he is speaking about the bill before the House. It has been wide ranging. There have been other speakers who have drifted away from the bill on your side whom we have allowed to go through, so you should show the member for Throsby the same respect that you would expect to be shown to you and others.




Mr Fletcher:
  With due deference, Mr Deputy Speaker, the simple point I make is that there is a bill—two bills later on—that deals with transfer of business and, as I have listened to the member, the issues he has been talking about have been about transfer of business.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  As I said, there is no point of order. The member for Throsby will continue.




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  As I was saying, these matters were re-enlivened throughout the 1990s and the earlier part of the last decade as awards were replaced by collective agreements, as the gaps between wages contained in collective agreements and awards grew, as restructuring and corporatisation ensued, as fragmentation around traditional understandings of industries occurred and through the opening up of our economy and the public sector to competition and contestability.


These provisions have a long history. The reforms that we find ourselves debating before the House today have a long history. This legislation is important because it applies and extends the legislation to current state system employees. It matters a lot because there is currently a lot of action in this space. We see state governments—currently, state conservative governments—who are taking very aggressive action. In your state, Mr Deputy Speaker, we see the Baillieu government sacking state public servants and corporatising state public entities and ensuring that the long-settled wages and conditions of state system employees are now under threat.


This legislation is important because it provides some security to those public sector employees and others. They know that, if there is some change to the ownership or legal entity of their employer, they have some security of their wages and conditions and the comfort of knowing that these will be protected by federal law in the event of such a transfer.


With those brief comments, I commend the package of legislation to the House. 


I think it is good legislation. It is legislation in keeping with those reforms I outlined before: the riddance of the dreaded Work Choices legislation, the introduction of equal pay for community sector workers, the introduction of safe rates for transport industry workers and the improvement in superannuation arrangements—all of which, I might say, were hotly contested by those opposite. Further to that, there is a willingness to ensure that, when issues do arise and we do need to refine the law—when we consult with business, when we consult with unions and when we talk to employees—we are ready, willing and able to make the appropriate modifications to ensure that they are continuously fit for purpose. I commend the legislation to the House.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (12:52):  It is a pleasure to rise to speak on the Fair Work Amendment Bill and to follow the member for Throsby. As it happens, I find myself following a former union official—but that is not a statistically unlikely thing to happen when one stands up to speak following a Labor member of this place. However, it is somewhat unlikely to find oneself following a member who was actually speaking about the wrong bill and who spent some 13 minutes telling us about the transfer of business provisions, which are not dealt with in this bill at all. They are dealt with in a bill which is to be debated two bills later on. But I suppose he would argue that it is 'the vibe'.


I do want to speak about the bill that is before the House this afternoon. In particular, I want to focus on the provisions in this bill which supposedly reform the arrangements under which modern awards specify default superannuation funds. The provisions in this bill dealing with those matters are a classic example of this government looking after its mates in the union sector—union officials who run superannuation funds at the expense of the broader community and going in completely the opposite direction to that which sensible procompetitive economic reform would dictate.


In the time that is available to me I want to make three points. Firstly, the current default arrangements for default superannuation funds are a cosy and anti-competitive racket. Secondly, the present introduction of the low-cost, generic MySuper product is a perfect opportunity to introduce more competition by saying that any MySuper product can be a default fund. Thirdly, the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation has in this bill squibbed the chance to introduce increased competition. In fact, he has made the process less competitive. He has handed even greater power to the cosy club of retired union officials who run Fair Work Australia.


Let me turn firstly to the proposition that the current arrangements for default superannuation funds are a cosy and anti-competitive racket which serves the interests of a cabal of union officials. The superannuation system has grown enormously. There are now some $1.4 trillion under management in that system. In 2011-12 some $90 billion of funds flowed into the sector largely because of the compulsory superannuation arrangements. Of this, nearly two-thirds went into two classes of funds: industry funds and public sector funds. These two classes of funds generally use the so-called equal representation model, with half of the directors appointed by a union and half by an employer association. If you look at the statistics put out by APRA, the industry regulator, you find that in February 2012 there were 76 funds listed as industry or public sector for the 2010-11 financial year. If you analyse the annual reports of all of those funds, what you find is there was a total of 575 directors on the boards of whom 180 were appointed by unions.


The Labor Party over many years has consistently used the compulsory superannuation system to increase the power, influence and financial position of the union movement and its key personnel. Indeed, the current Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations is a former secretary of one of the largest unions in the country, the Australian Workers Union, and a former director of the largest industry superannuation fund, AustralianSuper. The default fund arrangements—or, I should say, the union involvement in superannuation—were specifically designed into the superannuation fund system when it was set up by the Hawke and Keating governments in the early 90s. Today the boards of industry super funds are stuffed with union bosses including: AWU boss, Paul Howes; Queensland ALP heavyweight and AWU strongman, Bill Ludwig, who is the father of the present minister for agriculture; TWU secretary Tony Sheldon and; until recently, Health Services Union officials Kathy Jackson and Michael Williamson.


Under the Fair Work Act, the so-called modern awards must contain a clause specifying the superannuation fund into which the employer must pay the employee's superannuation contributions. To be nominated as a default fund under a modern award is very valuable because it guarantees a stream of contributions. The current process for the selection of default funds lacks transparency, is littered with inherent conflicts and quite inappropriately favours union-dominated industry superannuation funds. Analysis conducted by the Institute of Public Affairs in 2010 found that across 166 modern awards approved by Fair Work Australia, there were a total of 566 superannuation funds specified. Of these, 513 were industry funds or public sector funds. AustralianSuper was specified as a default fund in over 70 awards.


Why is it that Fair Work Australia so readily signs off on modern awards which entrench the flow of contributions to union-friendly superannuation funds? It might be that Fair Work Australia is stacked with ex-union officials. Between December 2009 and December 2011, 10 people were appointed as Fair Work Australia commissioners by the Rudd-Gillard government and, of these people, eight had union backgrounds. These arrangements give the unions a degree of control of superannuation which goes much further than the small and shrinking share of the workforce who are union members. Union membership is now down to about 18 per cent of the workforce and around 12 per cent of the private sector workforce. But these arrangements serve the interests of unions very well because, amongst other things, it means a large number of well-paid directorships to be allocated amongst the union mates. The annual report of one industry fund, Cbus, revealed that two directors—presumably one was the chair—received over $90,000 a year and that several other directors received more than $50,000 a year. In some cases these fees are pocketed by the individual union nominated directors; in other cases the fees are paid to the union. But in either case the arrangements suit the union movement very nicely.


The Cooper review into superannuation recommended that the current equal representation model should be comprehensively reformed. Curiously, former union official Bill Shorten has ignored that particular recommendation.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr FLETCHER:
  That is an extraordinary surprise, as my colleague points out. Let me turn, therefore, to the opportunity which the introduction of MySuper products offered to introduce more competition. MySuper was recommended by the Cooper review, and the notion is to have low-cost, default superannuation products designed to meet the needs of those Australians who are not actively engaged with their own superannuation and do not make an active choice.


The government is currently in the process of legislating the consumer protection requirements, which it considers important in a default fund product, through the various pieces of MySuper legislation. These products are going to be very widely offered, including by retail superannuation funds. There is no reason at all that every product which qualifies as a MySuper product should not be able to compete freely in the default fund market. After all, if the policy objective is to ensure that somebody who defaults into a fund—that is, somebody who does not make an active choice but simply ends up in the fund specified by the modern award which covers his or her industry—ends up in a fund which is low-cost and tailored to his or her needs as a customer with low engagement, then by definition any MySuper product should fit the bill nicely. But the minister has a very different policy objective. His objective is to ensure that the current cosy arrangements stay in place so that the industry and public sector funds continue to get the lion's share of contributions—and they are doing so, of course, at the expense of people whose money is taken by force of legislation. That money is being used to contribute to the size and scale of economic entities largely controlled by union officials.


The Labor Party promised in 2010 that it was going to do something about this. It paid lip service to the principle of allowing greater competition and the choice of funds. Its 2010 policy contained a promise to introduce an open, transparent and competitive system with a process to select default funds under modern awards. Bill Shorten dragged his heels for as long as he could before reluctantly proceeding with this. Since that time—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Mitchell
):  Order! The member knows to use people's correct titles.




Mr FLETCHER:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The minister has taken every opportunity to white ant, undermine and ignore the recommendations of the Productivity Commission. When the draft report was released earlier this year suggesting as one possibility the establishment of a new body independent of Fair Work Australia with the sole purpose of selecting and assessing the funds to be listed in modern awards, the minister promptly rushed out a press release on 22 August 2012 stating that the Gillard government would preserve the role of Fair Work Australia in selecting default funds.


With the final report now released and the legislation now before us, it is clear that this government has ignored much of what the Productivity Commission has recommended in framing the provisions of this bill. For example, this bill will impose a limit on the number of MySuper products in modern awards of just 10, contrary to the clear recommendation of the Productivity Commission that there should be an unlimited list of default funds. The Productivity Commission proposed a default superannuation panel. That will now not be created as recommended; instead it will be subsumed into the existing minimum wage panel. The new panel is not the final decision maker under this bill, as was recommended by the Productivity Commission; rather, the full bench of Fair Work Australia will approve default funds in each award after a recommendation from the expert panel.


The process of including funds in awards will only occur every four years, starting in 2014 when modern awards are due for review as opposed to an ongoing application process. The bill will now require that all awards have default funds, whereas currently there are 13 awards that do not list default funds and are therefore open to competition. That is clearly a serious oversight, and the minister has not wasted any time in fixing that up to make sure the interests of his mates are looked after. Instead of ensuring genuine competition, this bill will impose an additional layer of government intervention into the default fund market. There is absolutely no justification for doing this and for imposing the additional cost, complexity and delay which comes with that additional intervention.


Let us be absolutely clear in the House this afternoon. This bill, despite the rhetoric, has absolutely nothing to do with delivering a more competitive process for choosing default superannuation funds. On the contrary, it makes the process less competitive and hands even greater power to the retired union officials who run Fair Work Australia. This is nothing short of a grubby stitch-up by Minister Shorten and the Gillard Labor government to look after their mates in the union movement and put a distant second the interests of the millions of Australians who are compulsory investing in super.


If this bill is passed it will see the continuation of a process under which conflicted parties within Fair Work Australia continue to select default super funds under modern awards. The minister has been so desperate to protect the vested interests of his friends in the union movement that he has lost sight of his responsibility as a minister of the Crown to act in the public interest. What we are reminded of by these developments is the very close relationship between the industry superannuation sector and the parliamentary Labor Party. Let me just remind the parliament that there are four former directors of Australian Super who have become federal Labor parliamentarians or candidates—the minister, Greg Combet, Doug Cameron and Cath Bowtell.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! Again, the member for Bradfield will once again be reminded to refer to members by their correct title as is required under standing order 64.




Mr FLETCHER:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. You are doing a sage job of trying to defend these current arrangements. This government is clearly not doing what needs to be done when it comes to ensuring that employers and employees in default superannuation can benefit from genuine competition in that market.


It is deeply disappointing that the coalition has been given no time to consider this legislation in detail or to have detailed consultations with stakeholders on this bill. It is clear that the arrangements for this bill coming into the House—the process—do nothing to improve the confidence that the House might have in the merits of the policy that we are considering today. The coalition is therefore gravely concerned about the provisions in this bill. We are certainly reserving our right to move amendments in the Senate. I also make the point that if it is clear that the government is not going to do what needs to be done to improve competition in the field of default superannuation then, if the coalition is elected to government at the next election, we will take the actions that need to be taken to improve competition in this area.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2012-10-31,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (13:07):  I speak in support of the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012. The member for Bradfield overnight has not had a road to Damascus conversion experience, because he, along with his colleagues and comrades opposite, opposed protecting worker entitlements last night and here he goes again, railing against the representatives of millions of Australians in the workplace. There is no doubt about it: the coalition instinctively votes against or opposes every bill with the word 'fair' in it. Last night, we had the situation in which we passed legislation to protect the entitlements of workers who were at risk due to the liquidation or bankruptcy of their employers. The coalition opposed that.


Here today, in response to the independent review panel and the Productivity Commission, they are still responding in a negative way, recklessly opposing this legislation—or that is what people listening to the member for Bradfield would believe. If you listened to the member for Farrer before, she was saying that they will pass it through the House. So you have to wonder what their position is. But their position has been a negative one since the electorate had a look at them in 2007 and voted down their position on Work Choices. We on this side are in favour of Fair Work; those on that side are in favour of Work Choices. It is clear from listening to speeches like that one by the member for Bradfield that that is what they are all about.


The background to this particular legislation is that we have been crystal clear about workplace reform, our policies and our plans. What about the coalition? The Leader of the Opposition is currently in witness protection on that particular policy, because he does not want to talk about it at all. What we are talking about here is making changes recommended to us by the Fair Work review panel following consultations with unions, small business, large business and a range of other stakeholders. Many of these changes in this first tranche of amendments are technical, structural, procedural or clarifying changes to the unfair dismissal framework. For example, these changes give Fair Work Australia the power to strike out award variation applications not made in accordance with the act if they are frivolous or vexatious. Any tribunal, court or quasi-judicial body should have that power. They are also given the power to make amendments to applications made by parties to vary or revoke a modern award to make sure that, if there are ambiguities or uncertainty in those applications, they can be changed by Fair Work Australia.


These changes also better align Fair Work legislation with other laws relating to unfair dismissal, extending the time period to 21 days, another sensible provision. They will give the president of Fair Work Australia the power to require applicants to provide more information about the circumstances of dismissal—further and better particulars. That is an important change also. These changes will also make sure that, if a lawyer or a paid agent misbehaves or does the wrong thing after they have been given leave by Fair Work Australia to represent a party, costs can be ordered against them. This bill also changes the name of Fair Work Australia to the Fair Work Commission. That is important as well.




Ms Ley:
  That's a big one!




Mr NEUMANN:
  There are a lot of amendments here that are important and that those opposite belittle. But industry in fact supports these changes. On many occasions, representatives from industry have been party to consultation undertaken by the minister. They have been at the table when these amendments have been discussed and have made submissions to the panel that have been adopted in whole or in part. There are also amendments putting in place the recommendation to appoint acting deputy presidents and acting commissioners for specified periods. There are many changes that provide pathways for judicial complaint, similar to what we see in courts such as the Federal Magistrates Court or the Family Court. This bill makes many sensible changes that will have a big impact.


If you listened to speakers opposite, you might come to the belief that there are a very small number of people associated with this system. But we are talking about Fair Work Australia having approved 16,000 enterprise agreements covering 2.2 million employees. About seven million Australians are currently protected from unfair dismissal. Those provisions were brought forward by this side of politics and were steadfastly opposed by the Liberal Party, because it is in their blood and bones to oppose these sorts of things. More than 810,000 jobs have been created under this government's watch.


We have brought forward reform after reform in workplace relations to protect the entitlements of workers and to assist them. These include reforms to protect those working in the textile and clothing industry and reforms to the road safety remuneration system. We have acted to particularly protect the 120,000 women who work in the social and community sector, who will now get wage award increases of between 23 per cent and 45 per cent in the next decade. But those opposite have consistently opposed every reform that I have talked about. We are lifting up Australian low- and middle-income workers.


We said that we would undertake a review into the Fair Work Act. Guess what the panel decided? I bet that you will not hear this from those opposite, but the panel, which extensively approached industry and small and large businesses, found that the Fair Work Act is working well and meeting its objectives. The economic outcomes under the Fair Work Act have been favourable to Australia's continuing prosperity. There has been no dramatic wages blowout and no drastic increase in industrial disputes. The IR armageddon predicted by those opposite has not occurred. Notwithstanding that, the panel recommended 53 changes, and the government has taken up the response to that, and this is what the legislation before the House is.


We have also picked up the Productivity Commission's inquiry into the superannuation industry. The Productivity Commission found that existing default fund arrangements resulted in net returns generally exceeding those for non-default funds. Over the eight years to 2011, default funds in modern awards have on average an after-tax return of 6.4 per cent, compared with 5.5 per cent on non-default funds. So, what we are doing here is making some changes.



Mr Fletcher interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Mitchell
):  The member for Bradfield will stay quiet and is warned.




Mr NEUMANN:
  But those opposite leap, moan, carp and whine and undertake some sort of anti-union, anti-worker tirade, like you heard from the member for Bradfield.


Under the changes in this bill all funds under a generic MySuper product will be able to apply for selection as a default fund, on an equal basis. Those opposite seem to take the view, constantly, that workers should be dictated to by bosses, that workers' superannuation should be dictated to and that their wages and conditions should be entirely set without negotiation. The expert panel looked into this—an expert panel within the Productivity Commission. I wonder why those opposite say they support the Productivity Commission sometimes and they oppose it on other occasions?


An expert panel within the Fair Work Commission will assess funds on the basis of the legislative criteria, which are based on those proposed by the Productivity Commission. The Productivity Commission is not a bunch of bleeding-heart, left-wing, socialist ideologues. The Productivity Commission is full of people who those opposite would probably think were on their side of politics when it comes to economic issues. A full bench of the Fair Work Commission will then determine what particular funds from the default superannuation list are best suited for inclusion in each modern award, with the best interests of those employees covered by that particular award as their overarching consideration.


This process will occur every four years to align with four-year reviews of modern awards. What we are going to do in relation to this particular legislation is respond in a positive way, not like those opposite. We have heard the member for Bradfield go on and on in a typical Work Choices tirade against unions—they are naming people and constantly going on like this. That is one of many speeches we have heard in the last few years and will continue to hear from those opposite in relation to this.


This is good legislation. It responds to inquiries. It responds to the Productivity Commission. It responds to the expert review panel. It takes up the reforms and it makes a difference. It is legislation that should be supported, and I note that those opposite, despite what they say today in this debate, will actually pass this legislation. I look forward to seeing whether or not they will call a division on it, because the member for Farrer forecast the fact that they would support it.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,9,2,speech
"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2012-10-31,"



Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (13:17):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012. I note that the member for Blair managed to get through about nine minutes of his contribution on this bill, so important was this bill, which was tabled with urgency last evening by the minister for industrial relations. The procedures of the House had to be overturned—the normal procedure of the bill sitting on the table had to be overturned—because these matters were so urgent that they needed to be spoken on today.


For most of his nine minutes, the member for Blair did not actually address anything to do with the substance of the bill, which at least is better than the member for Throsby, who, in the rush to get into the House, was given the wrong talking points. You would expect a little bit better from a bunch of former union officials who are in this place to represent their vested interests. The member for Throsby came in and gave a speech on the wrong bill. But this bill is so urgent that we have to debate it today ahead of all other business on this government's so-called agenda.


I have a suspicion as to why we are debating this bill in such a rush. I will not cover the ground that the member for Bradfield so carefully and thoroughly covered in his contribution in respect of the default superannuation issues, because he did it so well. I will focus on the Fair Work Australia provisions in this bill, because I think there are very serious charges against this minister in relation to the provisions in this bill. He has some significant issues to address in his summing-up remarks other than the bit of political fluffery in his second reading speech, which does not answer and explain why it is that this parliament is urgently debating this bill.


The reason, I understand, for the urgency is that the minister says these are the most urgent matters out of the Fair Work Australia report he had done. It is a skewed report based on skewed terms of reference and skewed panel members. Mr Deputy Speaker Mitchell, you well know that one of those panel members in particular, Professor Ron McCallum, is one of the most partisan actors in Australian industrial relations. Professor McCallum is out and proud about his support of the Australian Labor Party, so much so that in August this year he was on the record supporting the Labor opposition leader in Victoria and predicting the end of the Baillieu government in two years time. We should note that. Professor McCallum is entitled to his political views, but people should be aware that he is a partisan actor. That is why we have great suspicion of a skewed report based on skewed terms of reference by skewed panellists.


But, if you are to believe the minister that these are the most urgent matters we should be dealing with out of that report, let us work through why that would be the case. The first issue is the default superannuation provisions, which, as the member for Bradfield so rightly pointed out, are more to do with favouring vested interests, yet again, in the industry super funds area. It is not about actual reform. There is not a significant provision at all in the report, and it is contrary to the Productivity Commission report.


Then we get to the provisions relating to the changes in the structure of and powers of Fair Work Australia, which has been subjected to some quite serious debate in recent months, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would be aware. One issue that has not been subjected to debate is the appointment of two new vice-presidents.


That is not an area in which I have heard there has been criticism of Fair Work Australia. In fact, if you look through the report—it is reasonably substantive, albeit skewed, and the member for Melbourne will be pleased that I have printed it on both sides—there is not a mention of appointment of two new vice-presidents. What would that cost the taxpayer? There is nothing in the bill about costs at all. It says the impact is nil. Well, let us work though that. A vice-president appointed by Fair Work Australia is paid at least $350,000 a year, putting aside on-costs—higher superannuation, cars. They have a special office arrangement within Fair Work Australia, as I understand. Sources within Fair Work Australia have given me a heads-up that there are special office arrangements. They get two appointed assistants, counsels, who are paid around $90,000 a year—again, without their super and without other conditions.


We are talking about a million bucks a year—conservatively—for each of these appointments. That is $2 million a year and $8 million over the estimates, for those who cannot keep up. That is an $8 million decision made on the basis of no evidence at all. Can you imagine what the parliamentary secretary for regional services could do with $8 million out in regional Australia? I certainly can, and I know the member for Farrer knows what she would do with eight million bucks. There is nothing in this report at all, yet the second main reason we are urgently debating this bill is the appointment of two new vice-presidents. Is it because the current two are too busy? The member for Melbourne will be interested to know that one of the current two is Mr Michael Lawler—who, we know, the Labor Party has some issues with, and the President of Fair Work Australia has some issues with. Mr Michael Lawler's partner is Kathy Jackson. Kathy Jackson, of course, revealed so much information about the $20 million of rorting that occurred in the HSU, found by a report—ironically—from Fair Work Australia.


So we have Mr Michael Lawler, who has been sidelined in Fair Work Australia, based on information I have received—completely sidelined. He is far from busy, as I understand. And then we have Mr Graeme Watson. Mr Graeme Watson has two sins. The first is that he comes from Freehills, a legal organisation that largely represents employer organisations. I know the member for Melbourne knows Mr Watson and would not agree with many of Mr Watson's views. But what the member for Melbourne would not do is discriminate against him on that basis. That is the first of Mr Watson's sins that the President of Fair Work Australia is not pleased with. The second is that Mr Watson had the temerity to suggest that after all the scandal relating to HSU, after all the failure in relation to the investigation by Fair Work Australia, after all the scandal and muck that came out about the failure of that organisation to do its job, it should change its name. And the President of Fair Work Australia was not very happy. Mr Ross was not very happy at all. Mr Watson, since that time, has regretted giving that speech, because professionally he is underutilised at this point in time.


So we have two vice-presidents who are there, not particularly busy. Sure, they are not flavour of the month for the current president. But then a piece of legislation pops up into this parliament, out of nowhere—no recommendations in this review, not a single line in well over 300 pages—recommending that $8 million of taxpayers' money, at least, be spent on two new vice-presidents for no good reason. You have to wonder why. Then you look at the bill, and the bill empowers the two new vice-presidents to be more powerful than the current two sitting vice-presidents. It empowers them to be more senior. And you, Mr Deputy Speaker Mitchell, know very well that the way Fair Work Australia—the old Industrial Relations Commission—works is that seniority is very important when handing out full-bench cases. When handing out full-bench cases, seniority rules the day. In this bill, the two yet unnamed—and that is a very important point here—new vice-presidents, which will cost taxpayers at least $8 million over the forward estimates, will be more powerful than the two out-of-favour current vice-presidents in Fair Work Australia. Two are out of favour, so appoint two new ones and give more power to the president to give them more work—because they may just have similar views, dare I say, to those of the current president and the current government.


We know that the current president, Mr Ross, and the minister have been close for a very long time. There is nothing wrong with that; Australian industrial relations is quite a small gene pool, as we know. They have been so close, in fact, that in 2006 the two of them appeared on the stage at a protest against—you guessed it—the former Howard government. The minister, at that point in time a candidate—I am not sure if he was still the AWU secretary—and on a superannuation industry board, along with Mr Ross, an ACTU official, were at a protest together against the Howard government, trying to overturn the laws. They are now working together to empower Mr Ross to be more powerful in respect of—and here is another provision in the bill, which I am sure you are also aware of, Mr Deputy Speaker—decisions for applicants to appeal when a member of Fair Work Australia has been allocated to a case and an applicant, let us say the CFMEU, is not happy with the commissioner who has been allocated. They will be able to appeal to the president to have a full-bench case. Whacko! Guess what you have just done? You have given two new vice-presidents, who just might come from a similar background to what you want, with new powers for the president to allocate cases to them. Are you following me yet? This is what this is about. This has been debated urgently because this minister is trying to future-proof Fair Work Australia.


These are not the two most urgent matters relating to Fair Work Australia—not at all. Having a look at why it took them years and years to investigate what happened with the HSU might be a matter that is urgent; that might be a matter that needs some reform. Do we need two new vice-presidents for Fair Work Australia, when the report does not say a word about it, when the current two incumbents are hardly busy and are capable of doing far more than they are? But what we see, what we know and what we hear on the industrial relations grapevine is that these two positions are being created for none other than Mr Josh Bornstein, a long-time union lawyer, famously depicted in the ABC's balanced take on the waterfront dispute in 1998, a recent op-ed writer, who also represented a member of parliament in a recent dispute, as we are aware.


The second one is Mr Jeff Lawrence. We understand Mr Lawrence has finished up as President of the ACTU. He has a bit of time on his hands, is looking around for new opportunities—and guess what pops up? There we are: vice-president of Fair Work Australia. It pays pretty well—$350,000 to $360,000 a year with a car, superannuation, a nice office, two associates. A million bucks from the taxpayer? That's not much. It is a disgrace. This minister does not mention a word of it in a second reading speech on an urgent bill, where we have changed the procedures of this House to introduce it, and I say to this minister that I charge him with a very serious contempt of this place. This is using legislative power—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! The member will withdraw the word 'contempt' of the parliament.




Mr BRIGGS:
  I will withdraw the word and change it to 'abuse' of this place, Mr Deputy Speaker—abuse of legislative instruments to give curry to the minister's vested interests in the Australian industrial relations environment, to the union movement. That is what this bill is about: creating two new taxpayer funded positions, to the extent of at least $8 million over the forward estimates, to allow this government to future-proof Fair Work Australia and its operations.


The minister should come in, in the summing up of this debate, before this parliament gives consideration and before this bill passes, and explain: what is the urgent need? There is capacity with the two current vice-presidents to pick up the load. The report itself, the bill upon which we are debating—even though he has had this since June, in the dying days of this year we are debating this bill in an urgent manner, overriding the normal procedures, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you well know. This bill has not been sitting on the table for the required length of time, giving the opposition just hours to consider its position. Thankfully, with the assistance of outside parties, we have been made aware of some of these issues, and the parliament should give consideration to them.


This minister should explain himself. He should explain where this recommendation comes from, what he is trying to achieve, why he is creating $8 million of taxpayer funded positions over the next eight years for an organisation whose biggest issues are not its staffing capacity. By far and away its biggest issues are not its staffing capacity. We know that from what we have seen from the HSU scandal. We know that from what people are telling us within Fair Work Australia. This is a disgrace; it is a scandal. And the minister should explain himself. They are trying to force this through prior to the potential government changing early next year, so they have future-proofed Fair Work Australia, and the minister should answer it. He should answer why he is using $8 million worth of taxpayers' money, and the parliament should not pass this bill until the minister has given a reasonable explanation about why this is being used to assist not the Australian public or its economy but the Labor Party and its friends.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2012-10-31,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (13:33):  It is with a wry smile that I listen to members of the coalition complain about appointments to Fair Work Australia. During the period of the Howard government, when it was the Industrial Relations Commission—



Mr Briggs interjecting—




Mr BANDT:
  I am sure that the member for Mayo will interject if I have the numbers wrong, but there were something in the order of 20 new appointments made during that time, of which about two came from a union background. So I think those who live in glass houses should not throw stones about this question of appointment. I think there has been a fair bit of traducing from both sides of the tradition that had existed previously in Australian industrial relations of an even balance between employers, employees and people who had come from other backgrounds, including government. I note that the member for Mayo leaves without correcting my figures, and I think they are about right: of the 20-odd new appointments under the Howard government, about 18 came from employer backgrounds.


We are here debating the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012, a bill to amend the Fair Work Act to give effect to a review that was conducted and some changes that are said to be necessary to the act. There are indeed a number of changes that need to be made to the act, and I will come to those in a moment. But perhaps I could just come back and finish on one point about the question of members of Fair Work Australia. Whatever the merits of the member for Mayo's charge regarding the vice-president positions, which I note the coalition is going to support through the passage of this bill, we can put those to one side—that is a potentially a legitimate claim that is being raised there. But I do take issue with the statements that were made just then by the member for Mayo about the President of Fair Work Australia, Justice Iain Ross. I think it ought to be recalled that Justice Ross's pedigree is one of previously being a Supreme Court judge and the head of VCAT in Victoria. As well as his having worked for the ACTU I know that he also ended up working for a law firm that represents employers more often than not. I know that because, in my previous capacity, I appeared opposite him. I think we should be careful in this place, especially when people outside have the status of a judge of the Federal Court of Australia, of not overstepping the mark and suggesting, as one could interpret the previous member's comments, that somehow the current head of Fair Work Australia would not act appropriately. I think that is a more serious charge than the one that the member sought to level and one that should not be made using privileges that attach to debate that goes on in this chamber. That would be a misuse of those privileges.


With regard to the changes that do need to be made to the Fair Work Act, there are many. One would have hoped that, in a bill that has been brought in quickly and that presumably the government identifies as being the most urgent changes that need to be made—and ones that need to be made before the end of the year—we would have seen changes addressing a number of very important areas. The Fair Work Act needs to be amended to give people better work-life balance. At the moment under the Fair Work Act, you have the right to go and ask your employer, in certain circumstances, for flexible working arrangements to go and look after your kid or certain others in your family, but it is an unenforceable right.


The employer can say no and, if they say no, there is no way that you can appeal it. That matter urgently needs to be amended. The Greens have said this, the ACTU has said this and various other groups concerned about making sure people have a proper work-life balance have said this. Unfortunately, there is nothing in this bill that gives people a better work-life balance and, surely, we should be using this parliament to see reform in this area.


Secondly, in some very concrete ways state public sector workers—and I have had firsthand experience of this in Victoria—face some pretty big difficulties in bargaining under the Fair Work Act. Nurses, for example, saw their dispute prolonged for months and months—and we know this from leaked cabinet documents in Victoria—because the employer's strategy was to string out the negotiations, to force the nurses out of sheer frustration to then start taking industrial action and to use that to get to Fair Work Australia where their claim would be arbitrated. The reason the employer wanted to do that is that it knew that for constitutional, technical and legal reasons one of the key claims of the nurses—namely, nurse-patient ratios—would not find its way into the final decision. In other words, if it could get to Fair Work Australia through this subterfuge, then the government would win on the question of nurse-patient ratios and there would not be any. So the nurses were forced for months and months to bargain in good faith. They met stonewalling from the government, because that was part of their industrial legal tactic.


We saw a repeat of this behaviour in some version with teachers in Victoria, where you have a government that knows how to use the Fair Work Act and how to exploit the holes that exist in it.


When Qantas grounded its entire fleet and essentially held a gun to the nation's head, it did so, again, for technical and legal advancement under the Fair Work Act. Qantas knew that, if it could provoke a storm and provoke industrial action to be terminated, it would get to arbitration. It also knew that if it got to arbitration it would win on the job security clauses that the employees were attempting to negotiate, similar to what we saw with the nurses.


We have seen very powerful employers under the watch of this government work out the holes in the Fair Work Act and how to use them to stop employees legitimately bargaining for things that really matter, such as job security and nurse-patient ratios. That could be fixed. The Greens have got bills in parliament that would fix those loopholes, but we do not see that in this government's bill. Apparently, this matter is not urgent enough that it needs to be fixed by the end of the year. Everyone who is working in the state public sector should continue to suffer under an unfair act that tilts bargaining away from being a level playing field to, very clearly, being in the employer's favour.


Hearing some of the government members speak, you would think that Work Choices was dead and buried. Anyone who works in this area would know that almost all of the provisions relating to bargaining and industrial action that were instituted in Work Choices have been kept in the Fair Work Act. Indeed, one union I spoke to said they did a comparison between the Fair Work Act and Peter Reith's Workplace Relations Act and felt they would have been better under Peter Reith's Workplace Relations Act because it more closely complied with international standards on how one should bargain.


So there is some unfinished business of repealing those last bits of Work Choices that hang over in the Fair Work Act, and that should be considered as urgent. This government should use this parliament to fix that. There are many important reforms to the Fair Work Act that we could get through now that would protect people's rights at work and that would insulate the Australian public from a potential change of government. So many areas of the Fair Work Act need to be tidied up. Unfortunately, what we have here is a rather tepid bill that contains a mixed bag of proposals, but in our view the case for reform of some of those proposals has not been made out. For example, on the question of costs, if you read the review there is, I would suggest, pretty thin evidence that suggests that somehow a lack of stronger costs provisions in the unfair dismissal jurisdiction is causing any real problem. In fact, there is very little evidence.


From my experience, having worked in that jurisdiction, it was always the case that you would advise applicants very carefully about prosecuting or not taking settlement offers in unfair dismissals because they would find themselves potentially at risk of a costs order. The most recent authorities on this point make it very clear that, in fact, if you act unreasonably in unfair dismissals you can get costs ordered against you. So I do not see the need—and it is not made out in the report—for imposing additional disincentives on people to exercise their rights, and that is what this bill will do.


I am also concerned about the potential adverse consequences of—again without any proper evidentiary basis—putting additional obligations on lawyers who practise in the jurisdiction by potentially making them personally liable. The reason for that is not that there is no room for lawyers to improve; of course there is. But when you say to a lawyer, 'You are now personally at risk of costs, unless you do X,' you introduce conflicting interests for that lawyer. Are their obligations to best represent the person whom they are representing? Or—and this is my concern—will they find themselves more often in this area representing someone who might have been unfairly dismissed because they were pregnant or just because the employer did not like them, and is a lawyer now going to turn around and say to them, 'Actually, you really should accept this offer that is on the table because I myself am concerned about being proceeded against for costs'? In other words, is the lawyer going to put their own interests of potentially not being liable for a costs order ahead of their client, and will that affect the advice that is given to people who are pursuing their legitimate rights? It also does not appear from the review that the 60-day time limit and general protections are being abused, either.


There are also some questions that need to be asked regarding superannuation and the changes regarding industrial action. For the purposes of allowing passage through the House the Greens will be supporting the bill, but that is without prejudice to our position in the Senate and our right to move amendments in the Senate, especially in respect of those areas that I have identified.


I would urge the government not to be too middle-of-the road about this but instead make a clear choice about what reforms it wants to see to the Fair Work Act during the life of this parliament. There is an opportunity to insulate against a return to Work Choices, and instead of being timid we should be bold and make those reforms that are very definitely needed.

"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2012-10-31,"



Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (13:45):  I rise in support of freedom and democracy in Vietnam. There is a campaign called Million Hearts, One Voice which is campaigning for democracy in Vietnam and calling for the release of all political dissidents from prison. This campaign was launched over a week ago and is being supported by many pro-democracy organisations and groups. Some 40,000 people have already signed the petition, and the target is 100,000 by International Amnesty Day on 10 December 2012. The Vietnamese community in Western Australia is joining the campaign, and groups within Western Australia are actively supporting it. I am pleased to offer my support for this campaign and I have recently signed the petition as well.


The petition seeks international investigation of the situation of arbitrary detention, inhumane prison conditions and a lack of legal process in Vietnam. It also demands that the Vietnamese government respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and repeal vague national security laws such as articles 79 and 88 of the Vietnamese penal code which are often the pretext for arbitrary arrest and detention. Finally, it urges the Vietnamese government to immediately release all political prisoners.


The situation in Vietnam is not good. Many people are detained because of their views on freedom of speech and freedom of religion. This petition goes some way towards highlighting arbitrary detention and the brutality of the regime. I call upon all present here, and everyone in Australia who would like to support Vietnam, to sign the petition.

 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:02):  My question is to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister of her pre-election promise that there would be 'no carbon tax under a government I lead'. I also remind her that the very next day she promised that the budget would be in surplus this year, saying, 'no ifs no buts, it will happen'.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:03):  From the Leader of the Opposition we see another new height in creativity as he tries to re-gear his carbon tax campaign, which even members of his own backbench know is running out of puff. On the question of the budget surplus, which apparently the opposition stumbled upon for the first time yesterday, having not bothered really with the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook at all, I say to the Leader of the Opposition: if he genuinely cares about budget accounting then he may want to explain to the Australian people why, during the whole time he has been Leader of the Opposition, he has not put out one properly costed policy, not one policy properly checked by Treasury—not once, not ever.


If he wants to be taken seriously on the question of the budget surplus then there is no better time than today to say that the opposition will fully comply with the Charter of Budget Honesty; that, instead of producing dodgy figures as they did at the last election, with an $11 billion black hole in their centre, they will get their figures properly costed. We know that what is holding them back is the $70 billion plan for cuts to services that they are currently hiding—



The SPEAKER:  The Prime Minister will return to the question before the chair. The Prime Minister has the call, and she will be relevant to the question.




Ms GILLARD:
  On the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, I answered it yesterday. We have just delivered the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. What that shows is that we have built on the billions of dollars of savings realised so far with more billions of dollars of savings. What the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook shows is a surplus. We stand by the figures in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook and we are on track to deliver the surplus that the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook has contained within it.

  My question is to the Prime Minister. Given the near-halving of Murray-Darling agriculture and the reality of North Queensland having 60 per cent of Australia's water virtually unused, could the PM reaffirm her post-election policy of five North Queensland micro-irrigation projects? Further, Mayor Daniels and I have formed a cooperative. Will her government and Queensland partner this Cloncurry project? Finally, will the Prime Minister reaffirm her support for a major scheme west of Townsville and receive the deputation for this major Pentland-Charters Towers project?

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:20):  I thank the member for Kennedy for his question, and I know how concerned he is about these issues of water use not only in Queensland but also across the nation. He and I have had an opportunity to speak about them in the past, and he is raising them in the parliament today because they are matters of passionate concern for him. I say to the member for Kennedy that I certainly will be pleased to receive a deputation with him and with community members to talk about the Pentland-Charters Towers project that he referred to in his question.


The member for Kennedy and I have, in the past, talked about micro-irrigation projects in North Queensland and I will be pleased to talk about those matters too. I know that they are of concern to him, and I know that he has been working strongly with local government. He referred to Mayor Daniels and referred to the formation of a cooperative and the Cloncurry project. I will be very happy to pursue discussions with the member for Kennedy on those questions too.


To the member for Kennedy: the government is working hard on water reform. We have been speaking today in this parliament—as we did yesterday and the day before—about our delivery on the weekend of a plan for the nation's future. We live in a century of change and growth. We live in a time when Australia is uniquely positioned to seize these opportunities, and so I was pleased and proud to deliver that plan for the nation's future. But immediately before delivering that plan, working with the minister for water, I made an announcement about the Murray-Darling, and I know that the member for Kennedy follows this closely. That announcement is about ensuring that we can get good environmental outcomes in the Murray-Darling. 


This basin matters to the whole nation. It matters to the people of South Australia, where I grew up. I know that the member for Kennedy is keenly following this reform agenda and would have followed the announcement we made on Friday. He would know that there is legislation before the parliament dealing with 450 gigalitres being released through infrastructure work. He is also following the delivery of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. So I will be happy to talk through all of these questions with the member for Kennedy. I thank him for his question and for his continued passion for irrigation and water reform.

I remind the Prime Minister that the former federal president of the Labor Party, Michael Williamson, has been charged with fraudulently misappropriating $600,000 in funds collected from low-paid union members. Did the Prime Minister place any provisions in the Fair Work Act, which she used to boast she had written, to enable the recovery of funds stolen by corrupt union officials? If not, why not?

"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2012-10-31,"



Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:46):  As I have explained to this parliament in the past, when we replaced Work Choices and its dreadful rip-offs of working people, when we replaced the fact that people could be dismissed for no reason, when we replaced the industrial laws that had hurt working women the most, when we replaced those vile laws from those opposite, the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition generally, what we did was create the Fair Work Act and fairness and decency at work. What we also did in relation to the provisions for registered organisations was effectively bring them from the former legislation into new legislation—that is, there was no substantive change to the provisions for registered organisations.


The offences in Work Choices were against working people. They were about working people having their penalty rates ripped off, they were about working people being unfairly dismissed, they were about working women being unable to secure equal pay, and the list went on and on. So we fixed all of that, but, as for the registered organisations provisions, they appear in the Fair Work legislation—or they did appear in the Fair Work legislation—effectively in the same terms as under the former Howard government. Then, of course, in the recent period—




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Speaker, on a point of order: the Prime Minister was asked whether she put provisions in there to recover misappropriated funds from corrupt union officials, and she has not yet even tried to answer that question.



The SPEAKER:  The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The Prime Minister has the call.




Ms GILLARD:
  I am pointing out to the member for Sturt that the provisions were in the same terms as the provisions that he supported when he was a member of the government. So it would seem to me incredibly negative for him to suddenly be opposed to them when he supported them every day in government.


Since then, and in the light of some recent issues, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has brought into the parliament, and the parliament has passed, new laws for registered organisations, particularly relating to transparency. So the answer to the member for Sturt's question is that initially the laws were in substantively the same form as the Howard government's and since then this government has chosen to tighten them up.

Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (15:11):  Madam Speaker, I have now decided to raise a matter of breach of privilege. I wish to raise a matter of breach of privilege in question time today, which is contempt of the parliament. In question time today the member for Mayo asked a very straightforward question to the Treasurer about a $550,000 grant to an organisation in Kenya to design a national carbon accounting system in Kenya. The Treasurer then said in a subsequent answer to a question that in fact the Clinton Foundation grant was approved by Alexander Downer, during the Howard government. He made no mention of $25 million. That was an entirely false statement. The Leader of the House then also breached the privileges of the House by misleading the parliament by tabling this document, which was supposed to prove that in fact the grant was made by Alexander Downer, during the former Howard government. In fact, it was a grant for 'Australia and Clinton Foundation join in Asia-Pacific fight against HIV/AIDS'. The $25 million—



Government members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  Order! Do you wish to hear the Manager of Opposition Business or not?




Mr PYNE:
  was to be used over four years, from 2006 to 2010, with a focus on funding in Papua New Guinea, Vietnam and China. There is no mention either in this press release or in fact in the program that was established by the Howard government of any money for carbon accounting in Kenya. The Treasurer has therefore grievously misled the House and then did so again when he sought to add to that answer by pretending that he had mentioned the $25 million grant in his previous answer, which he did not.


So both the Leader of the House and the Treasurer should be referred to the Privileges Committee for misleading the parliament and therefore holding it in contempt.

(b) there is no cure for CMT and while most sufferers live a normal lifespan, many do so with severe disabilities;


(c) estimates are that around one in every 2,500 Australians is affected by CMT;


(d) while CMT is more common than diseases such as Muscular Dystrophy, there is a low level of community awareness of CMT, particularly amongst Indigenous Australians;


(e) genetic counselling and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis means that those carrying the CMT gene can now conceive without the 50 per cent risk of passing CMT to their offspring; and


(f) despite the advances, detection and genetic counselling, low awareness and detection of CMT means that this disease is still spreading to future generations, when it could be stopped; and


(2) notes the need for more investment for research into the cause, care and cure of CMT; and

Entsch
: to move:


That this House:


(1) notes the


(a) uniqueness of the relationship between Australia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) given the physical proximity of the Western Province to the Torres Strait, and the familial and cultural ties; and


(b) Torres Strait Treaty with PNG (ratified in 1985) that provides for Torres Strait Islanders and the coastal people of Papua New Guinea to carry on their traditional way of life, allowing for traditional people from both countries to move freely (without passports or visas) for traditional activities in the Torres Strait Protected Zone;


(2) acknowledges that an increased level of obligation from within existing resources is required to work towards improving the health and well-being of our closest international neighbours;


(3) recognises that:


(a) there is an ongoing crisis in the Western Province region, particularly in relation to the incidence of tuberculosis and other highly-contagious diseases; and


(b) while the Government has pledged $8 million over 2011-12 to 2014-15 for the South Fly District Tuberculosis Management program, it is evident that sufficient medical support and financial resources are not reaching services on the ground;


(4) calls for a review of administration of AusAID funding for the provision of South Fly District Tuberculosis Management;


(5) calls on the Australian Government to ensure it is working closely with representatives from the PNG Government and the PNG Treaty Village Association towards establishing a long term solution;


(6) reviews priorities within the AusAID budget to enable full funding to be restored to the Saibai and Boigu clinics, to provide necessary support until such time as capacity has been established in the 13 Treaty villages; and


(7) recognises that if current policy is to continue unchanged, the health and safety of Torres Strait Islanders and other Australians will be in jeopardy, as evidenced by the recent arrival at Cairns Base Hospital of the first case of multi drug-resistant tuberculosis.

(4) calls for a review of administration of AusAID funding for the provision of South Fly District Tuberculosis Management;


(5) calls on the Australian Government to ensure it is working closely with representatives from the PNG Government and the PNG Treaty Village Association towards establishing a long term solution;


(6) reviews priorities within the AusAID budget to enable full funding to be restored to the Saibai and Boigu clinics, to provide necessary support until such time as capacity has been established in the 13 Treaty villages; and


(7) recognises that if current policy is to continue unchanged, the health and safety of Torres Strait Islanders and other Australians will be in jeopardy, as evidenced by the recent arrival at Cairns Base Hospital of the first case of multi drug-resistant tuberculosis.

The adverse impact on the budget of the Government’s failure to control our borders.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2012-10-31,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (15:16):  The immigration minister has his hands in the pockets of Australian taxpayers again. I note that, once again, the minister is not in the chamber today to respond to this matter of public importance. Once again he has resumed his global search for Captain Emad out there beyond this place and he has sent his deputy the Minister for Home Affairs, my friend and colleague the member for Blaxland. I look forward to his contribution, but I would really like it if the minister for immigration would stand in this place for once and actually answer for the accountability of his public policy failings, because that is the subject of this matter of public importance debate today.


This minister has run out of money again. He came into this place yesterday and asked for another $1.7 billion from Australian taxpayers when he presented an Orwellianly titled appropriation bill to fund the implementation of the Houston report. Of the $1.7 billion in that appropriation bill, $1.3 billion was for the increase in the number of arrivals this year in excess of the government's estimate back in May. That is a misrepresentation, I think, to the Australian people, as I referred to earlier today, about the purposes for which this minister is seeking more money. This minister has run out of money because he has failed on our borders like no immigration minister ever before. His record of failure is without peer when it comes to these matters.


The budget will be blown on boats alone when it comes to the surplus. If the government want to know where their surplus is, they will find it as it recedes into the night on the boats that come to this country on a more than daily basis. They will find that surplus frittered away in detention centres at Christmas Island, at Curtin near Derby, up near Weipa in North Queensland and on Nauru as well. That is where the surplus has gone. This surplus will disappear into the night simply on the issue of boat blow-outs on our border alone. This surplus will prove more elusive to the government than Captain Emad when it comes to accounting for the significant blow-outs in costs they have occurred as a result of their budget failures.


The blow-outs on our borders will blow out the budget to the tune of $2.7 billion this year. That is a 2,000 per cent increase on what the government had put in its budget annually in 2009-10—a 2,000 per cent increase. Before MYEFO the blow-out was $4.9 billion over three years; today that blow-out over four years is $6.6 billion. That is the price of border failure in financial terms from this government.


But the government are still saying they are going to achieve a $1.2 billion surplus. In this place yesterday we asked the Prime Minister, as we have asked the minister each day, to explain what the new figure in the budget is based on. How many people are they expecting to turn up this year? In the budget they said it would be 450 per month. That was based on the 30-month average, which is the standing policy of the department of immigration and the department of finance when estimating the number of arrivals they anticipate in a given year. The Prime Minister refused to answer the question. The minister has refused the opportunity to respond to this question every time he has stepped up to a microphone anywhere in this country.


But I am going to help the minister out. On the 30-month average that has been adopted by the department, the 30-month average to the end of September is 713 arrivals per month. If this budget is based on 713 arrivals per month, they are out by a country mile because we are averaging 2,075 per month every month this year. So go the boats, so goes the surplus, and the government will never deliver a surplus so long as they cannot control our border. If they cannot control the border, they cannot control the budget. We have seen the figures blow out month after month, year after year, totalling a massive $6.6 billion over four years and out into the estimates. This is a history of failure that knows no peer.


That $1.7 billion included $268 million for the building of the Nauru and Manus Island facilities. I noted earlier today that, in January of this year, when the government said, 'We're opposed to building Nauru,' they said it would cost $422,000 per bed. That is what they said in January, when they did not want to do it. Now they are doing it—guess what? It costs $126,000 per bed. The thing I have learnt about the government is that they will demonise border policies that were successful under the coalition until the day they adopt them. That is what has happened here. They have adopted the Nauru and Manus Island policies. It took them years and they had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the table. We welcome that, but they have a long, long way to go. That is why the boats keep coming—because the government refuse to restore the full measures that worked under the Howard government.


We also know that there was a bill introduced today which seeks to effectively excise the Australian mainland from the migration zone. It is the same bill that came into this place in 2006. The member for Berowra will remember that well and he will remember the debates, I am sure. In those debates, it was said that this measure was 'a stain on our national character' and that it offended decency, by our now minister for immigration; that it was shameful and xenophobic, by the former Leader of the Opposition, Mr Crean; and that it was lunacy, indecent, inhumane and gutless, by another current minister. Yet today they bring it into the House and vote for it.


You can be confident that those who sit on this side of the House will vote in a way that is consistent with the way they have voted before on these matters. On that side of the House, all you have is hypocrisy, and that hypocrisy is the stain that sits on this government when it comes to its failures on borders and the stain it has put on the budget with the blow-outs that know no peer. This is a government that continues to make it up as it goes along when it comes to our borders. This is a government that has failed in every respect to come to terms with the magnitude of the error of its decision to abolish the policies that worked.


The 'stain on our national character' today is not what the now minister for immigration said all those years ago in 2006—and, looking back on representations of ourselves six years ago, we have all weathered a bit since then. What is clear is that the real stain on the national character is the one that has been inflicted by the government in relation to our borders. The stain that marks every member that sits opposite is the stain of cost, chaos and tragedy when it comes to their failures on our borders. It is the stain of over 28,000 people turning up on over 480 vessels; the stain of those who have been lost at sea; the stain of denying protection visas to over 8,000 people in this country because of this government's policies—



Mr Danby interjecting—

  because they did not come on a boat.

Mr MORRISON:
  That is the stain that the member for Melbourne Ports will have to explain to his electorate.




Mr Danby:
  I'll explain it! You explain the stain of—




Mr MORRISON:
  That is the stain that he will be accountable for. That is the hypocrisy when he votes for the bill that he has supported when it comes into the House. That is the stain he is going to have to explain. The stain you will have to explain is your failure on our borders—



Mr Danby interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Melbourne Ports is warned!




Mr MORRISON:
  That is the stain that members opposite will have to live with. And it will not wash off. It will not wash off with political spin. It will not wash off with clever press conferences. It will not wash off with smoke and mirrors. It will not wash off with Angus Houston. It will only wash off when you acknowledge the fact that you got it wrong and you need to fix that error by restoring policies that work. This minister for immigration is the biggest spending immigration minister in our history. He has his hands so far into your pockets that those pockets stretch all the way down to your bootlaces. This is a minister—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Cook should be very careful about the word 'you'.




Mr MORRISON:
  I will, Madam Speaker. This minister for immigration has dipped his hands into the pockets of Australian taxpayers like no other. The Australian people need deep pockets to pay for this government's failures, and not just on border protection. We know of the government's cost blow-outs right across the board. But, in particular, on border protection, we know that it is the Australian taxpayer who is going to have to pay for the blow-outs on our borders.


The baby bonus has been turned into a boat bonus for people smugglers, because that is how the government are going to pay for it. How are they going to pay for the blow-outs? We saw it in the MYEFO. There is the baby bonus reduction for second and subsequent children—$505.9 million. In private health insurance, there is both the abolition of the rebate on premium increases above CPI and the removal of the rebate on Lifetime Health Cover; that is $1 billion. There is the great super swipe, coming in and swiping your super after 12 months; that is $800 million. Then there are the increases to government charges, with a levy on self-managed super—$319 million. That is what is paying for the boat blow-out. That is what is paying for this government's inability to manage our borders, because when you cannot manage your borders you cannot manage the budget. That is what we are seeing as every financial update and budget is brought into this place. The graph only goes one way, just like the number of boats: up—and up and up.


Not content with levying taxpayers and families to make them pay for the blow-outs on our borders, the government have also decided to levy those who are coming to Australia through the front door. They have decided, with a $500 million increase to visa charges, to say, 'You've got to pay,' to those who want to come to Australia the right way—that is, those coming the right way have to pay for those who are seeking to come the wrong way because the government cannot control our borders.


I am not surprised that migrant communities across Australia are outraged by this. They are sick and tired of seeing how this government has allowed the borders to be blown wide open—the unfairness and injustice of their having to work hard in the Australian community, being invested and involved in contributing to their community day after day.


They see the openness of this government on borders for those who would seek to illegally come to Australia and seek permanent residency in Australia by that method. It is just not fair, and they know it is not fair. That is why they are angry with this government for what it has done when it comes to its failures on our borders.


There is a way to end the chaos, the cost and the mess that this government has made of our borders and of our budget. The way to do that is to restore what this government has abolished. But that will not be enough, because we know that this government has so stained its credibility on our borders that it has lost the authority to be able to send the message to those who would seek to come and risk their lives in this way that this government will not be a soft touch. That is what it has proven to be. This government makes all sorts of bold claims and boasts but, when it comes to the policies, resolve and delivery on the ground and at sea, this government has simply not proved to have the mettle to do it. The costs will continue, the blow-outs will continue and the boats will continue so long as this government sits on those benches.


The only message that people smugglers will understand when it comes to stopping the boats coming to Australia is a change of government. This is what will be before the Australian people at the next election. At the next election, there is a chance to get this right again. There will be the opportunity to vote for policies that are proven, that worked and that will be backed up by the resolve of a government who believe in what they say, will do what they believe and will carry this through every single day until this madness, chaos and carnage on our borders is stopped.

"Clare, Jason, MP",ALP,2012-10-31,"



Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel) (15:31):  In December last year, only a few days into this job, I had the responsibility of telling the Australian people that a boat had capsized off the coast of Java and that 200 people had died. The events of that day have driven my actions in this area ever since. Both sides of politics are very critical of the people who put these people onto boats. This is why. In this case, 200 people died. Almost as many people died that day as died on the day of the Bali bombings. That is why I think it is fair to say that these people are mass murderers. They are mass murderers who make enormous profits—sometimes more than $1 million a boat—feeding off the misery of other people.


I said after the tragedy, and I have said it since, that we as a parliament need to work together to stop this from happening. I say the same thing to the parliament again today. The people of Australia are sick of the bickering, fighting, yelling and politics on this issue. This has been going on now for 11 years. It has been going on since the Tampa arrived over 11 years ago, and people have had a gutful. They want us—Labor Party and Liberal Party—to work together. While ever we do not, while ever we keep fighting, people smugglers get rich and more people die. Working together means you need to compromise. It means doing a bit of what we want and doing a bit of what the opposition want in order to do something and in order to get something done. That is what the government have done. We have been trying to broker a compromise. We have been trying to work together.


It is worth, for the purposes of this debate, going back for a moment and remembering what we have been fighting about. The government's preferred plan is not Nauru; it is Malaysia. Nauru is the opposition's plan. Because we want to stop people dying, last year we said, 'Let's do both. We'll do the government's plan of Malaysia and we'll do the opposition's plan of Nauru.' It was a compromise, but it was a compromise that was rejected by the opposition. So the government compromised again. We agreed to start with Nauru without Malaysia. Why? It is because it is the only thing that the Liberal Party would ever let through this parliament and because the alternative to that is doing nothing. If you do nothing then more people die. We have done all of this—changed our position and compromised—because people want us to work together on this wretched problem.


We want to work together but there are people in the Liberal Party who do not. There are people in the Liberal Party who want to play politics with this issue. If you want proof of that then you only have to look at the diplomatic cables that are reported in David Marr's recent article in the Quarterly Essay. If you go to page 36 of this essay, it says:


WikiLeaks told us how keen the Coalition is to exploit the boats. In late 2009, in the dying days of Malcolm Turnbull's leadership of the Opposition, a ""key Liberal party strategist"" popped in to the US embassy in Canberra to say how pleased the party was that refugee boats were, once again, making their way to Christmas Island. ""The issue was 'fantastic,"" he said. ""And 'the more boats that come the better."" But he admitted they had yet to find a way to make the issue work in their favour: ""his research indicated only a 'slight trend' towards the Coalition.""


This is very telling. This is very revealing. A senior Liberal Party strategist went to the United States embassy saying that they think this issue is fantastic, the more boats the better and how disappointed they are that it has not worked well enough for them yet. This is what people talk about when they talk about the dark side of politics. It is not about people; it is about politics. It is not about boats; it is about votes. That is exactly what is wrong with this debate.


It is politics that has poisoned this debate for over a decade. Politics is the reason that the opposition has decided consistently to oppose the Malaysia plan. It has nothing to do with the fact that Malaysia has not signed the UN refugee convention. That is just a political excuse that has been made up to hide behind. If this were a real concern then the Liberal Party would have to explain why they were prepared to send people to Nauru from 2001 to 2007 when Nauru was not a signatory to the UN convention. This was not a concern then, but it is now—a made up, false excuse to hide behind because some key Liberal Party strategist tells the US embassy the more boats the better.


This debate is too important for that. While we fight, people die. That is why we have compromised. That is why we have changed our position. You change your position when the facts change, and the Liberal Party has done that too. Don't believe the argument that one side of politics has had a consistent position on this issue for over a decade. They have not. Both sides of politics have changed their views. Three years ago the Liberal Party supported the closure of Nauru and they supported the closure of Manus Island. This is what Sharman Stone, the former shadow minister for immigration, said on Lateline in April 2009:


We don't need the Pacific Solution now, that's Nauru Island and Manus Island, because we have the Christmas Island centre … So we don't need alternatives to Nauru and Manus island, we have Christmas Island.


The former shadow minister said the same thing when she appeared on the Insiders program with Barrie Cassidy in October 2009:


No we don't need the Pacific Solution with Nauru, Manus Island now because of course we built Christmas Island as an offshore detention facility.


That was Liberal Party policy three years ago. They said that we should close Nauru. So don't let anyone believe that one side of politics has been pure or consistent here. Both parties have changed their policies. But they have changed their policies because the facts have changed and because of a determination to stop people dying.


The Liberal Party policy goes something like this. We need to do three things: Nauru, temporary protection visas and turning back boats. We have the Houston report. We commissioned a report from some esteemed experts, led by Angus Houston, the former Chief of the Defence Force. He provided us with a report that gives us a course to chart our way through this wretchedly difficult policy area. There are 22 recommendations and we need to implement all of them. We need to implement every single one of them.


The report looks at the opposition's policies. It agrees to one and rejects the other two. It supports Nauru and rejects TPVs and rejects turning back boats. The report says that it is not possible to turn a boat back unless the sovereign state that you wish to turn that boat back to is agreeable to that. At page 53 of the report Angus Houston is clear. He says here:


The State to which the vessel is to be returned would need to consent to such a return.


That is right. Indonesia would need to consent in order for us to turn a boat back. So what does Indonesia say about this? Indonesia has been very clear. The foreign minister of Indonesia, Marty Natalegawa, said in March of this year that 'simply pushing back boats to where they have come from would be a backward step'. In the same month he went further. He said that this would be impossible. He said:


From that kind of mindset, naturally, it would be impossible and not advisable even, to simply shift the nature of the challenge from one end of the continuum to the other.


The Indonesian Ambassador to Australia has made exactly the same point, perhaps even more strongly. He said this in March:


… if you take that policy—


that is, turning back boats—


it means that you bring all the burdens to Indonesia and what about our cooperation?


So you have there from the Indonesian foreign minister and the Indonesian Ambassador to Australia very clear statements that they do not support this policy. What Angus Houston says very clearly in this report is that, unless you have the approval of Indonesia, you cannot turn boats back. The Liberal Party have refused to accept this. They refused to accept what Angus Houston has said. Why? Why did they refuse to accept what Angus Houston said? The answer is this. This is not just any Liberal Party policy; this is the policy. In January the Leader of the Opposition made this very clear in an interview with Paul Kelly from the Australian. He said this:


It is time for Australia to adopt turning the boats as its core policy.


If the Leader of the Opposition accepts what Angus Houston has said or what the Indonesian foreign minister has said, then its core policy cannot happen. It cannot be done. It cannot be implemented. That explains why, when the Leader of the Opposition visited Indonesia only two weeks ago, he did not raise this issue. He did not raise the issue because he knew if he raised this issue with the Indonesian President the Indonesian President would have politely said no. When he said that word the opposition's core policy, to stop the boats, would be in tatters. That is why he stayed silent—because it facilitated him to return to Australia and to continue to tell the Australian people that he would stop the boats by turning them around, even though he knows that that cannot happen.


It is all about politics. Surely by now we all realise that this issue is more important than that. It is more important than politics. In 11 months we have had 400 or more people die, drowning in the seas off Indonesia. We have to work together to implement the recommendations of the Houston report—all 22 of them. That means Nauru and it means Manus Island, but it also means Malaysia. As I have said in this place before, Nauru and Manus Island are a good start but Nauru, Manus Island and Malaysia is even better. If we are serious about this issue, if we are serious about stopping people dying, then we need to implement all 22. We have to implement all of the recommendations of the Houston report.


Not only that, we have to stop talking like the conversation in this cable from the United States Embassy back to Washington that took place in 2009 between a senior Liberal Party strategist and US officials. Those opposite can contradict this if they like, but it means they are saying that the United States Embassy in Australia is not telling the truth. If this is true and this is what happened—a key Liberal Party strategist went to the US Embassy in 2009 and said 'More boats coming to Christmas Island is fantastic, and the more boats that come, the better,' and then complained that it only led to a slight trend towards the coalition—then that speaks volumes. That tells you that this is all about politics. 


This is more important than politics. People expect that politicians are going to come into this building and fight. They do not like it but they expect it. They expect that there will be brawls in this place about lots of issues. They expect that the Liberal Party is going to cut money from health and education and that the Labor Party is going to fight to stop it. They expect that the Liberal Party is going to try to cut workers compensation, like we see in New South Wales, and they expect the Labor Party to stand up for workers, to stop that, to get rid of laws like Work Choices. But, on matters of life and death, they expect better of us. They expect us to put down our swords. They expect us to work together. They do not expect to hear senior people in the Liberal Party saying, 'The more boats, the better.' They want us to stop fighting. They want us to work together. This is what they expect and, frankly, this is what the Australian people deserve.

"Alexander, John, MP",LP,2012-10-31,"



Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (15:46):  There is a famous proverb dating back over 2,000 years to the poetry of Virgil that teaches us 'the path to hell is paved with good intentions'. This saying has stood the test of time because it is born of a deep knowledge of human nature: that well-meaning people may do things to appease a situation only to then discover that they have actually created a worse outcome.


When we look back to more recent times, just six years ago, in the battle for the hearts and minds of the people of Australia, a young man presented as being all things to all people: supercapable, superintelligent, all the answers to all of our problems—he could even change the weather and he had a heart bigger than Texas to boot. The picture was painted that he, in good conscience, could not stand by and watch desperate people seeking asylum subjected to the conditions they were under the Howard government's border protection policies. It is of no importance whether this position was formed through a generous and kind nature or whether it was a cunning, aspiring politician wanting to appeal to the sympathetic nature of the electorate.


Well intentioned as the changes may have been to the successful policies that had stopped desperate people risking their lives on the high seas and jumping ahead of genuine refugees, the fact is that there has been a dreadful cost—a cost in terms of lives needlessly lost, needless suffering and needless waste of our taxpayers' money. It is a matter of historical fact that, in the six-year period leading up to this policy shift, under the much demonised suite of Howard era policies, a total of 272 asylum seekers risked their lives on 16 boats. That equates to fewer than four people each month over six years.


In contrast, in just the past week since the government released MYEFO, we have seen 17 boats arrive with 620 people—far greater than their budgeted projection of 450 people per month and contributing to ongoing budget blow-outs like the $1.2 billion listed in the MYEFO papers. There is no substitute for experience—experience hard-earned. The suite of policies that had been developed by the Howard government, and the experience, the know-how, to implement those policies, meant they worked; they achieved the goal that had been set to stop the senseless loss of life and squandering of our nation's wealth.


Effective government results achieved efficiency, and this policy area was just one of many instances that allowed the $96 billion of debt we inherited from the previous Labor government to be paid back. Now we see history repeating itself. The Labor government has already exceeded $96 billion in debt, despite starting off with sizable savings. This particular policy failure is so important because it should be part of our human nature— whether in government, opposition or for the people of Australia—to learn from our mistakes.


The definition of insanity is to do something repeatedly and expect a different result. Well-intentioned policies that have failed have been the hallmark of this government, and this may well be because of a lack of management experience in any number of their initiatives. As the topic of this MPI highlights, these failures have an ongoing adverse impact on our nation's budget. Just like a business, balancing a government budget is largely built on stability, on certainty in management practices and policies. On this issue of border protection, the government's flip-flopping has had a direct adverse impact on our nation's budget. 


This total lack of consistency is easily seen in the speeches six years ago on the excision of Australian territories from our migration zone—the Howard government policy that the Labor Party is now so keen to embrace. The current Leader of the House said in this place:


The Labor Party supports border protection but does not accept that excising the whole of Australia is an effective means of border protection. You do not deal with boat arrivals by pretending that you do not have sea borders or by pretending that, if you arrive by one particular mode of arrival—boat—you do not arrive in Australia at all. 


The current Minister for Employment Participation said:


I would like to talk about the sheer lunacy of this legislation. As of 13 April 2005, all Australians arriving by boat will be treated as though they arrived in an excised place. This will effectively excise the whole of Australia from our immigration zone. The government's approach is ridiculous. It is absolutely absurd. We cannot approach border protection by pretending that we have absolutely no borders at all. So let us be perfectly honest about this: this legislation is stupid.




Even the current Minister for Immigration 
and Citizenship, Mr Bowen, 
labelled the


border protecti
on policy that he now supports as '
hypocritical
'
, 
'
illogical
'
 and 
'
a stain on our national character
'
.







And t
he list goes on.


The adverse impact on the budget of the 
g
ov
ernment's failure to control our
 borders is also clearly evident in their oth
er recent policies in this area. 
First we had the Malaysia 
d
eal, where our Prime Minister's supreme negotiation skills 
led to 
a deal that saw us send 600 asylum seekers 
and $300 million to Malaysia in return for 3,000 refugees. What a bargain!







Then, when the humanitarian intake was increased, the 
m
inister said it w
ould cost '
a
round $150 million with a potential cost impact of $1.3 billion over the forward estimates.
' 
Yesterday
, the m
inister demanded an extra $268 million to build facilities at Nauru and Manus Islan
d. That is just over $125,000 a bed—a most expensive bed that is. 
Now Nauru is reportedly applyi
ng a special visa at 
$1
,
000 per person we send there
 and charging for it each and every month
. Under the 
g
overnment's plan
,
 up to 1
,
500 asylum seekers can be housed 
on Nauru for up to five
 years. The 
t
otal
 estimated 
impact on the budget of this small part of the 
g
overnment's border protection policy
 is, therefore,
 $90 million.







And t
he list goes on.


These experiences show that
, even when back
flipping to a policy that worked
—
a policy
 they should never have revoked and one that comes with
 a roadmap
 setting out 
how to execute 
it
 effectively and prudently
—this g

Mr DANBY

 (
Melbourne Ports
) (
15:55
):


Since 31 August 2011, when the High Court rejected this government's Malaysia proposals, we have faced the prospect of a surge in boats full of irregular arrivals to this country. Although we have now adopted the only policy we could get the coalition to sign on to, the member for Cook comes in here lamenting the effects of adopting those very policies he demanded we adopt. He does that after having delayed the Malaysia proposals, which would have given us some capacity to handle this surge of irregular arrivals, for more than a year. This is the man who demanded the re-opening of Manus and Nauru, yet he is now in here complaining about the cost of it. What a farce! The member for Cook is crying crocodile tears about the effect on the surplus of irregular boat arrivals after having blocked, together with his mates in the Greens, the very legislation aimed at providing a policy solution.





The parliament cannot forget, or let slip down the memory hole, the point made by the Minister for Home Affairs, the member for Blaxland. The member for Murray, Dr Sharman Stone, on behalf of the coalition—
and I was present here in the parliament and at the meeting of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration when she did it—supported the closure of Manus and Nauru. That is why they were closed down then. She told radio station 2SM:





The closure of Nauru and Manus Island … they had basically—what shall we say—outlived their need … I don't think we need to have Nauru and Manus Island operating, because we've got of course Christmas Island.





I do 
not blame the member for Murray
,


because events
 have changed in the meantime.





Events
 changed and many of us in the government have had to face the issue of these increasing boat arrivals. The issue is not just the dollar cost, the sort of narrow accounting attitude demonstrated by the previous speaker, but the cost of human lives, the cost of humanity, the cost of people drowning at sea. Those costs weighed much more heavily with me. I stood up in this parliament and I said that, as far as Malaysia was concerned, I had been wrong. I had been wrong about not processing asylum seekers offshore—this was a way of deterring them. But
,
 now that we have adopted the very things the opposition have suggested, they are in here whingeing that we are doing it and that it costs money—after having delayed us on our Malaysia approach for more than a year and costing the taxpayer hundreds of millions of dollars through that delay. 





After the tragedy at Christmas Island, in reaction to people like me who were concerned principally not with the accounting of this issue but with the people who died at sea, and in explanation of the Greens' alliance with the coalition in opposing legislation to solve the problems caused by the High Court decision of August last year, Senator Hanson-Young of the Greens said:





Tragedies happen, accidents happen.



This is a terrible attitude. Coalition support for the compromise put up by the government would have been great. Now we have increased our annual intake to 20,000 people, and this is a big plus for those who take a humanitarian view of these things. I hope the number of people will increase even further than that.


If you ask me, this is the Liberal Party's last political card, with a change in the opinion polls. We have seen the carbon tax bedded down, and xenophobia is their answer. The member for Cook talked about madness, carnage and the chaos on our borders. We have adopted the very policy that they wanted, and he describes it like that. Where was the Leader of the Opposition when twice in Indonesia he had the opportunity to explain to the Indonesians the policy of adopting the full suite of measures that the member for Bennelong now wants us to implement—including dragging people back to sea? I would like to see the effect of that on the Indonesians. The minister very capably outlined what the Indonesian foreign minister and the Indonesian ambassador have said about this. 


Sometimes I think members of the coalition think they live in a bubble created by the talkback shonks and cranks in Sydney. That is not the only world we live in—the people of Indonesia will not accept boats being dragged back into Indonesian waters. We have very good relations with Indonesia and those relations have been worked on very hard, including by previous coalition governments. Do those opposite really want to make a conflict with the Indonesians by dragging these boats back? Of course we cannot do that. It would be policy madness. Do they want conflict with Indonesia; do they want war with Indonesia? 


Those in the coalition are simply not thinking about this seriously. They laugh and they cackle because they know nothing about Indonesian attitudes on these things. They have not spoken to anyone in the Indonesian parliament. When I was in Jakarta recently I had the guts to take this issue up with the Indonesian foreign policy assembly and asked them what they would do if we started doing this kind of thing. They gave the precise answer that the Indonesian foreign minister and the Indonesian ambassador gave. Those opposite want to drag boats back into Indonesian waters without their support—but they do not have the guts to raise it with the Indonesian President when they have the opportunity.


The Houston report made 22 recommendations. One of them was to be consistent in border classification and legislation so that the people smugglers do not try to take people beyond Christmas Island or Ashmore Reef to the shores of Australia so that they can earn their evil fees. Some of them are making $1 million or $2 million per boat. We have to make sure that their goals are not achieved, and that is why we have passed legislation. As the minister said, the Malaysia arrangement is part of the compromise that the Houston report canvassed as a possible way of dealing with these matters. I know the member for Bennelong said that this was not a way of dealing with them. Apart from the educational rights and the health rights that were negotiated by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, these people would have the ability to work in Malaysia. It is much harder to have people use their productive energy in Manus in Papua New Guinea, where such work does not exist. 


These people are all brushed aside; they are of no real interest to the coalition. When Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister we had regional processing offshore in places like Malaysia, where we could maturely deal with sometimes desperate people in conjunction with our friends and allies in Canada, the United States and Europe who might be willing to take these people. This was canvassed very extensively by the Houston report and I am hoping that the government will continue to pursue that.


The carbon price is bedded down and now the boat people are the principal card of those opposite. The coalition is hoping this dog whistle to the Howard battlers in Queensland and New South Wales will save their political hide. That is the real motivation behind all of this. I do not dispute that there are many genuine people in the coalition who do not go along with the strategy, but it is all revealed here in the Marr article and the WikiLeaks transcript of what someone told a senior level person in the coalition—



Mr Alexander interjecting—




Mr DANBY:
  The unintended consequence of WikiLeaks—yes, sometimes things said even in WikiLeaks can be true. I am certainly no fan of Mr Assange, but some of the material revealed about Saudi Arabia and its attitudes to other countries in the Middle East were absolutely accurate and I think this is absolutely accurate too. It goes to the evil heart of politics that is behind all of this. Stop all the crocodile tears about spending money on the very policies that you want; stop all the crocodile tears about these measures affecting the budget surplus. We know what lies behind this.

"Griggs, Natasha, MP",CLP,2012-10-31,"



Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (16:05):  I rise to speak on this very important matter of public importance: the adverse impact on the budget of the government's failure to control our borders. It is important because my constituents in Solomon, living in Darwin and Palmerston, are concerned about this government's inability to deal with both the Australian economy and Australia's borders. This terrible government is indeed a typical Labor government. It is addicted to spending, it has no self-control and it has failed the Australian people on so many important issues. It is a government full of hypocrisy and broken promises.


 Since the Labor government reversed the Howard government's suite of Pacific solution policies, 480 boats have arrived illegally, carrying over 28,000 people. It is estimated that over 1,000 people have died taking the dangerous journey. We know that over 8,000 people have been denied protection visas. And why is this? Because this terrible Labor government decided to get rid of what was working. It got rid of proven policies that worked. This Labor government thought that implementing only some of the Howard government policies was going to work—despite the shadow minister, the Leader of the Opposition and many others on this side warning that the full suite of policies needed to be implemented by the Labor government in order to fix border protection. Implementing just bits and pieces of the policy was not going to work. Last financial year each illegal boat arrival cost an average of $12.8 million—that is, almost $13 million a boat. This is something that the government could have prevented, but instead it rolled out the red carpet and now Australians are paying the price. Labor gave the people smugglers a product to sell. 


I am sure if you asked people in my electorate if they had an opportunity to spend just one allocation of $13 million in our electorate, they would probably want to spend the money on things like flood-proofing roads in the northern suburbs of Darwin, so that the CBD is not cut off from Royal Darwin Hospital during our monsoonal downpours. Or perhaps they would have put some of the money towards funding the NDIS. 


In today's Northern Territory News the Northern Territory Minister for Health, Dave Tollner, is quoted as saying that the Northern Territory is billions of dollars in debt and hundreds of millions in deficit. This is courtesy of the former Northern Territory Labor government, who, like their federal Labor bosses opposite, seem to have no grasp of sound economic management. They also like to spend like a drunken sailor, with little care, making unfunded promises all over the country. It is because of this typical Labor government ineptitude that the promised new Palmerston hospital is now in doubt. In the same Northern Territory News article, shock jock Pete Davies says: 


We've got the fastest growing jurisdiction in Palmerston and the rural area, we can't keep going backward … this thing needs to be built.


Pete Davies is 100 per cent right—the hospital does need to be built. I acknowledge that the federal Labor government pledged some funding for this much needed project, but just think how much more it could have contributed if it did not have a $1.3 billion budget blow-out courtesy of their appalling lack of responsibility in managing our borders.


The Labor government's record on hospitals in my electorate is quite shocking. I have said many times in this place that this federal Labor government has built more detention centre beds than hospital beds in my electorate. This is not just true in my electorate; in fact, it is true in many electorates around Australia. This government is more concerned about detention beds than hospital beds. My electorate is one of the most multicultural in Australia. We are proud of our multicultural community. What we are not proud of is how this Labor government and the former Territory Labor government spend money like drunken sailors, maxing out the public credit card. No-one trusts Labor with credit cards and no-one believes that this Labor government will deliver a surplus. As we know, my colleague the member for Longman has never seen Labor deliver a surplus, not in his lifetime. 


There is no doubt this terrible Labor government has lost control of our borders and the budget and will not deliver a surplus. This Labor government has its priorities all wrong. It is using the Houston report to hide its fiscal and economic incompetence—an extra $1.3 billion in costs because of this Labor government's unprecedented and staggering border protection failure and budget blow-out.  


It amazes me and many people in my electorate why this Labor government just cannot get a handle on border protection. I am often asked, 'Why don't they return to John Howard's policies? They worked. We all know they worked.' Others comment that federal Labor would rather spend money they do not have on detention centres than face up to their responsibilities to secure our borders. I am often asked, 'Why can't federal Labor spend more money providing houses?' There is a perception that this Labor government's priorities are illegal arrivals—a problem of their own making—rather than everyday Australians. I am often reminded that in the 2010 election the former Labor member for Solomon, with the support of the Territory Labor government, promised to build 1,200 homes to be used in its affordable housing scheme. It was bad enough that this was a rehash of a 2007 election promise, but it is worse when we see that to date fewer than 130 houses have been delivered. What a terrible track record. It is typical of Labor—overpromise and underdeliver.


The people of Solomon want to know why it is that this Labor government has delivered fewer than 130 affordable houses. Is this because of budget blow-outs? Don't people in my electorate deserve the houses Labor promised to build? Can't this government afford to follow through on its election promises to the people of Darwin and Palmerston? It is not only border protection and the budget that this Labor government has lost control of; it has lost control on building affordable houses. This government is only focused on delivering detention centre beds! Perhaps in 2013 the promise of more affordable houses will be another rehashed promise Labor will trot out in my electorate. Or will it be another broken Labor promise? 


We recently saw at the Territory election Territory Labor promising to extend the Tiger Brennan highway with federal Labor government funding of $70 million, but so ashamed are they of the Labor brand that they did not want Territorians to know it was a promise from the Gillard Labor government. I suspect, now there is a $1.3 billion budget black hole, that the promised $70 million cheque from Julia Gillard will bounce—if written at all! Will it be another broken promise to Territorians, all because this terrible Labor government has lost control of its budget, lost control of its borders and lost control of its spending and promises? 


Today is Halloween, the day people dress up in scary costumes, among other things. Normally I am not easy to scare, but this Labor government petrifies me. The absolute failure to execute one of its primary functions as a government—protecting our borders—really concerns me. It scares me because since this Labor government scrapped the Howard government policies, more than 1,000 people have died at sea, having taken the very risky and dangerous journey. Hundreds of boats have made the journey and this month alone 41 boats have arrived with 2,100 people on board. This makes an absolute mockery of the Labor government budget estimates of 450 people a month—a clear budget blow-out!


In conclusion I would like to say that this Labor government continues to make a raft of promises around the country, many of which appear to be unfunded. How can this be? This Labor government has an unprecedented blow-out because of its failed border protection policies. These failures impact not only my electorate but also all electorates across Australia. This government stands condemned for its fiscal and economic irresponsibility. If it cannot manage its borders, how can it manage the budget? How can the Australian people trust the government to do what is right?

"Lyons, Geoff, MP",ALP,2012-10-31,"



Mr LYONS
 (Bass) (16:15):  It is no secret that the cost of accommodating and processing asylum seekers is high. Yesterday the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship introduced two bills to the parliament requesting the appropriation of the funds needed to implement the recommendations of the Houston report, a total of $1.67 billion in 2012-13. We all know that the only way to reduce that cost is to have fewer boats arriving in Australia, and the Australian Labor government is acting to reduce the number of asylum seekers arriving by boat.


We are implementing every recommendation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers—the Houston report—something that both the Liberals and the Greens have refused to do. There should be no question of the Labor government's commitment to stopping the boats and putting people smugglers out of business. The report recommended that Australia's humanitarian program be increased. The Labor government has increased Australia's humanitarian visa program from 13,750 places to 20,000 places in 2012-13. This increase is targeted at those asylum seekers who are most in need: those vulnerable people offshore, not those getting on boats. By increasing the size of our humanitarian visa program and allocating specific places for asylum seekers from Indonesia, the government has shown that there are established pathways for asylum seekers in our region to seek protection in Australia, rather than risking their lives on dangerous and perilous boat journeys at the hands of unscrupulous people smugglers.


The panel also recommended:


… that the Migration Act 1958 be amended so that arrival anywhere on Australia by irregular maritime means will not provide individuals with a different lawful status than those who arrive in an excised offshore place.


We have seen legislation to this effect introduced into the House today. This amendment will mean that arrival anywhere in Australia by sea in these circumstances makes the person subject to regional processing arrangements, subject to specific exclusions.


Through implementing the recommendations of the expert panel the Australian Labor government is taking decisive action to break the people smugglers' business model and stop people dying at sea. The Liberals' answer to boat arrivals in Australia is to turn the boats around and send them to back to Indonesia. Their leader has claimed that he will work with Indonesia as a 'candid friend' to achieve such a result. However, the Leader of the Opposition had not one but two opportunities to raise the asylum seeker issue with the President of Indonesia and failed to do so both times. How does the Leader of the Opposition expect to even implement such a policy, if he ever gets the chance, if he cannot even bring up the issue in a meeting with the very country he needs on side? The coalition's turn-back policy is both dangerous and unworkable—that is according to Navy personnel, Indonesian officials and, now, South-East Asian diplomats. The government is not prepared to recklessly endanger the lives of Navy personnel to score political points.


The opposition should drop its dangerous turn-back policy and instead focus on a durable regional solution to the problem of people smuggling and irregular migration, as the government is doing. But that is the problem with the opposition: they are not concerned with sensible, forward-thinking solutions, because they are stuck in the past. It was the Leader of the Opposition who said, 'If you want to look at the direction for the future, you've got to look in the past.' This is not the sort of statement you would expect to hear from a visionary would-be Prime Minister. It is, however, the sort of statement you would expect to hear from someone who is solely concerned with the past and with opposition for opposition's sake.


The opposition appear unable to see the positives of any situation—for example, the issue at hand of asylum seekers. When I think of refugees, I think of all the fantastic things they have offered to my community and my country. Often when I am asked about this issue I tell the story of one of the surgeons at the Launceston General Hospital. This particular surgeon is a specialist who has saved countless lives. The contribution that Dr Hung Nguyen has made to the medical community and the greater communities of Launceston and Tasmania cannot be measured in economic terms. Hung came to Australia on a boat from Vietnam when he was a child.


There is a significant economic cost involved with accommodating and processing asylum seekers, but we should not forget that there is potentially much to be gained from assisting those who make the treacherous journey by boat to Australia. Australia has emerged as a multicultural nation. Its refugee communities have made a significant contribution to what it means to be Australian in terms of food, music, art, sport, culture, science, medicine, religion and society in general.


On ABC Radio in Perth the Leader of the Opposition described asylum seekers as being un-Christian for trying 'to come in by the back door'. I do not think it is un-Christian to try and achieve a better life for your family, as the opposition leader claimed. Does this mean that he does not value what refugees can offer to our nation? It would appear so. Wasn’t Jesus Christ a refugee? Of course, as a proud Tasmanian I have come to hope that statements made by Leader of the Opposition in Perth have little meaning. But it was there that he pledged to modify the GST to a per capita system, which would effectively devastate the Tasmanian economy with the loss of at least $600 million.


The opposition leader went on to make more misleading claims, this time about the electricity bill of a Western Australian pensioner. He told the House that there was an $800 increase in just one bill, of which 70 per cent was due to the carbon tax. But when you examine this bill it is clear that the proportion of the increase which is due to the carbon price is a small fraction of his claimed 70 per cent. This is lazy. This is deceitful. This treats pensioners disrespectfully, as nothing but fodder for a political scare campaign. If the opposition leader really cared about pensioners, he would have established the facts about this bill rather than rushed in here to distort it for political ends. 


But the Leader of the Opposition's complete disregard for Tasmania is not the issue here; nor is his use of pensioners for political gain. The issue is the cost of managing boat arrivals and accommodating and processing asylum seekers. As I have said, managing boat arrivals is expensive. The only way to reduce these asylum seeker costs is to have fewer people arriving by boat. If the coalition was really concerned about the cost of processing and accommodating boat arrivals, it would not for so long have stood in the way of offshore processing legislation.


As the expert panel's report pointed out, while the cost of processing arrivals is substantial, as the recommendations are implemented we will see these costs decrease. These recommendations must be implemented for many reasons, not least of which is that it is the economically responsible thing to do. But all we hear from the opposition on this matter is negativity—no feasible alternative solutions, just destructive negativity. The Australian people can see through that. They are looking to us to come up with real solutions. They are looking forward to a bright future, with an economically responsible Labor government, not an opposition offering nothing but negativity and unfunded promises.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2012-10-31,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (16:24):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance: the adverse impact on the budget of the government's failure to control our borders. Probably no other issue better summarises just how bad this government is. If history has shown us anything about Labor governments, it has shown us that Labor governments are incapable of managing a budget and incapable of managing our borders. These are fundamental functions of government and fundamental failings of this government.


But where these two failings meet it is like a massive collision of disasters; like a hurricane colliding with a snowstorm. Caught in the middle is the human toll: the toll of those who do not survive the dangerous journey that this government has encouraged, the toll of those genuine refugees in camps who cannot afford to travel through five countries and pay $10,000 to a people smuggler and the toll on Australian household budgets and services. The price Australia pays for a failed border policy—the price we pay for a government too proud to admit that it got it wrong—is not paid by the Labor party. The price for that pride and ignorance is paid by Australian families, because it is their money that is being wasted.


According to the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook last week, those Australian families will see an additional $1.2 billion coming out of their pockets and being wasted on this issue—$1.2 billion! That is such a large sum of money that it is difficult to get your head around. I think most people in my electorate would have trouble coming to grips with the enormity of the budget blow-out. Just as an aside: these people in my electorate are the same people that the member for Melbourne Ports cast aspersions on when he talked of dog-whistling, insinuating that somehow they are racist. I say to the member: if you are going to make such assertions—if you are going to talk about dog-whistling—then just come out and say what you really mean. The voters in Queensland and New South Wales whom he just disparaged will say something at the election to him.


North Queenslanders understand boats. Fishing is great and so is the weather, so they love their boats up in North Queensland. So does the Labor Party. They love boats too; they cannot seem to get enough of them! They have been collecting them from the people smugglers at a rate of more than one a day since June. How many this month?—41. Again, more than one a day. We have seen more than 200 illegal boats arrive this year alone—and that is just so far. I can tell you that Mackay has a fine very fine marina up in North Queensland and that a couple of hours ago it only had 240 boats in it. So by the end of the year we will probably see a Mackay marina-full of boats that have come into this country illegally.


North Queenslanders probably have a better understanding of the scale of the number of people involved. So far this year, we have had more than 13,000 people on those 240 boats. It costs a lot of money to take care of that many people, which is why this government, earlier this year, was asking Australians to take an illegal immigrant into their own homes. According to the 2011 census there are only 10,299 homes in North Mackay, South Mackay, West Mackay and East Mackay combined. So it is easy to comprehend the number of boats and the number of people involved here. 


But every boat and every illegal entry comes at a cost. Last financial year, each illegal boat arriving in Australia cost an average of $12.8 million to the Australian taxpayer. In the first 10 months of this year, we have had more than 200 boats and more than 13,000 people. Compare that with arrivals under John Howard's successful border protection policy. In 2002 one boat arrived and one person; in 2003 one boat arrived with 53 people for the entire year; in 2004 one boat arrived with 15 people; in 2005 four boats arrived with 11 people; and in 2006 six boats arrived with 60 people. What was the impact of those border control policies on the budget? They had very little impact. What was the impact of those border control policies on genuine refugees who could then come to Australia?. It was very great.



Mr Windsor interjecting—




Mr CHRISTENSEN:
  I am going to pull up the member for New England, who is interjecting with little barking noises. He is another person who is insinuating that voters out there are racist, that we are somehow dog-whistling and that this is not a genuine concern. He should apologise to those people. The people in his electorate will certainly be barking at him come election day. 


The fact that a Labor government could tear down those policies and call them inhumane—policies that enabled genuine refugees who genuinely feared for their lives to find safe haven in Australia—is an absolute disgrace. Only a Labor government could destroy a perfectly good solution and create a problem for them to waste money on. Only a Labor government could find a whole new method of wasting money. Only a Labor government could be so pig headed as to then refuse to admit that it got it wrong. 


This Labor government preferred to continue throwing money into the ocean rather than admit that the Liberal-National coalition is right. The immigration minister should not only hang his head in shame but also hand in his resignation. How can the Prime Minister allow this minister to tear billion-dollar holes in a budget already in tatters and not call for his resignation? I can tell you how she can allow it: she condones it. She condones the waste, she condones people smuggling, she condones people paying $10,000 for the privilege of risking their lives. The fact that hundreds of people died in the process did not outweigh that pride.


The Prime Minister and the immigration minister outsourced their jobs and had to get an expert panel to tell them the same thing the Australian people have been telling them for years. If you are going to outsource your job then do it properly—resign and let someone who has the guts to do the job roll up their sleeves and do it. Australians are sick of seeing a weak and divided government that is focused only on staying in power. They are sick of seeing their hard earned tax money going down the drain while they struggle to make ends meet and put up with a lack of services and infrastructure and even a lack of food on the table.


Here is an easy way for people in my electorate to understand just how much impact this government's border control failure is having on the budget. The budget blow-out on border protection is another $1.2 billion this year. Coincidentally, $1.2 billion is exactly how much the federal government's commitment would need to be to address all of the issues on the Bruce Highway in Mackay, the Whitsundays and Bowen. They are big issues. The federal government's share, $1.2 billion, would see the Mackay ring-road started and finished. It would pay for the duplication of the Peak Downs Highway, from Sarina to Mackay, one of the most dangerous stretches of the national highway in this country. 


It would pay for the Hay Point intersection, a crucial piece of infrastructure to support the mining boom. It would pay for upgrades to the dangerous Bruce Highway intersection with Shute Harbour Road in the Whitsundays. It would pay for a solution to the flood-prone Goorganga Plains near Proserpine, which cuts off the Whitsunday coast airport from the Whitsunday coast every time there is heavy rain. Every time another boat comes through the revolving gate to our north, it is another project on the Bruce Highway that goes unfunded. 


To be fair, not all Australians want to see the entire $1.2 billion spent on the Bruce Highway, so what would it mean if we put that kind of money into something useful across the entire country? The member for Bass raised the idea, so let us talk about it. I talk with a lot of age pensioners in my electorate. They highlight to me in no uncertain terms just how hard it is to get by on the pension—and they are right. It is hard. Every dollar counts and every dollar is spent very carefully by them. What if we implemented an increase to the age pension, not a fake increase that the Labor Party gives with one hand and takes back with the carbon tax? What about a real increase? Increasing the age pension and veterans' service pensions by $20 a fortnight would cost approximately $970 million compared to the $1.2 billion that Labor is wasting because they have lost control of our borders. Even allowing for the fact that a Labor government would find a way to waste $100 million in the process, it still comes in at less than the blow-out in the border control budget.


If those opposite want to argue about their economic credentials or the need to waste $1.2 billion on the lost control of our borders, perhaps they could explain to pensioners why the Labor Party's pride is more important than a pensioner's dinner. I will quote from a letter I received from a pensioner in my electorate. Arthur Withers lives in Townsville—in Annandale—and is acutely aware of how costly it is to live in a regional centre. He also has connected the dots between waste on border control and what pensioners are missing out on. He writes:


You are giving money overseas and to the boat people as if it was laid on. They get things like phones, cigarettes, food, medical aid and use of computers and other things. They also have three good meals a day. Yet pensioners have to live on second grade meat and vegies and anything else we can get cheap. We who have paid taxes all our life get very little help.



Mr Windsor interjecting—




Mr CHRISTENSEN:
  And here is the member for New England, making barking noises at the pensioner Arthur Withers who lives in Annandale. When those opposite ask for more money to be appropriated for their failures they should consider Arthur's final comment in his letter. He says:


If only we could buy a boat and sail back into Australia as an illegal immigrant we would be treated like Kings and Queens instead of starving to death.


Each illegal immigrant costs Australian taxpayers an average of $170,000 each year. This government has blown it this year—up to $1.2 billion in a cost to our budget. We could be using that money for better things if the government would only swallow its pride and adopt the full suite of measures. Not just Nauru; bring back TPVs, turning around the boats where appropriate and negotiating with Indonesia and doing it with some gusto. Instead the government is weak and insipid. The problem continues and the money continues to be wasted. Bring on an election to fix this problem.

(14) the provisions of this resolution, so far as they are inconsistent with the standing orders, have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the standing orders; and


(15) a message be sent to the Senate acquainting it of this resolution and requesting that it concur and take action accordingly.


I move this motion to establish a joint select committee to enquire further into constitutional recognition of local government. This is an amended version of the motion I placed on the Notice Paper on 11 October. Since that first notice of motion I have had discussions with the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for local government. I thank both of them for their engagement and support for this process. The government has also had constructive discussions with the Leader of the Australian Greens. The process of getting this motion to the chamber has been one of bipartisanship and cooperation.


As a consequence, we have amended the original motion to now include an opposition member as deputy chair of the committee and have increased the membership to 12 to include one Greens senator. My original motion also contained words referring the committee to examine 'the level of support within the Commonwealth parliament'; however, given the discussions I have had with the opposition, and the Leader of the Opposition in particular, I am convinced that we can achieve strong bipartisan support in this parliament for the majority view of the Spiegelman expert panel—that is, financial recognition of local government. Indeed, in the terms of reference we have asked the committee to focus on that finding and assess the likelihood of its success should it be put to a referendum.


The support of this parliament itself will not be sufficient to carry the referendum. For that it also requires the state and territory governments to embrace bipartisanship, and local government must play a more activist role both through and beyond this committee process to lobby their respective state and territory governments for that support.


Consideration by a parliament committee was also one of the preconditions outlined in the Spiegelman panel report. The committee will be able to inquire into that majority finding of the expert panel and assess the likelihood of success of a referendum, including the level of support and the potential consequences of an amendment to the Constitution.


We have asked the committee to aim to provide a preliminary report by the end of the year and a final report to parliament by the end of February 2013.


We do have to recognise that the recognition of local government in the Constitution is an issue of national importance, given the vital role local government now plays in Australian communities as the third tier of government and given the expanded role and crossover activities that local government is involved in in the delivery of services—be they state, federal or a combination of both.


I have found in my role as minister for regional development that there is also an increasing expectation, because of this overlap, that the three levels of government work together more effectively in creative ways to deliver outcomes for their communities. But if that is to be achieved we need to create a secure financial environment in order to grow and sustain partnership initiatives and to deliver that expanded role.


From our point of view, the government has not wavered in its commitment to constitutional recognition of local government. Indeed, I would observe that both major parties have committed themselves to this in their policy platforms. The committee will be an important mechanism for gathering further support for a referendum, and the Australian Local Government Association is fully supportive of a parliamentary committee to further inquire into this issue. Indeed, it was a specific recommendation in their submission to the expert panel.


Previous referenda on this issue were put in 1974 and 1988, both promoted by Labor governments. They were not carried, because they lacked a bipartisan commitment, being opposed by those who were then opposite in this chamber and some states. Now that the Spiegelman report is out we are acting on a key recommendation in a bipartisan manner through this motion. The challenge is for the proponents of the referendum to make their case, both inside and outside the committee.


I commend the motion to the House.


Question agreed to.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2012-10-31,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (18:40):  It gives me great pleasure to rise tonight to talk on the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012, because it really shows this government up for what it is: a tricky and untrustworthy government. The first point of proof on this fact is the way the government has rushed this bill into this place. It has not given the opposition or the Independent members any time to carefully examine and look at the detail—because it does not want the detail looked at when it comes to this bill, even though the minister has had the time to look at the detail, to examine it. He has obviously had the report sitting on his desk for a long time. Then, bang—just whip the legislation in and try to get it off the table so we do not get the scrutiny of what the government is up to in presenting this bill.


If anything belled the cat in this regard, it was what happened today in this chamber with the member for Throsby. The member for Throsby was rushed in to speak on this bill. So hurried was he that he grabbed the wrong talking points, and he spoke on a different bill for his whole time, even though members from this side were interjecting and saying, 'You're talking about the wrong bill!' There are embarrassing things you can do in this chamber. I am sure all of us at some stage will do some embarrassing things, and we will say, 'I wish I hadn't gone down that path.' You would think that if you spoke for five minutes on a different bill and the opposition was telling you that you were talking about the wrong bill you would say: 'Hell, what am I going to do here? I'd better change direction.' But no, the member for Throsby went for 15 minutes, the whole way. It is as though he drove down a wrong-way road, in the wrong direction, for 15 minutes, with people saying to him, 'Turn around; you're going the wrong way.'




Mr Briggs:
  The workers' representative!




Mr TEHAN:
  The workers' representative—this is him. I pity the workers! This is the calibre of their representation. A former member of the ACTU is about to depart—and I think he wants to depart because he does not want to hear any more about the performance of the member for Throsby.


But it is not his fault, in all essence, because it is the minister's fault. The minister should not treat this place with such contempt. He should not put members on that side in that predicament. He should not have them rushing into this place not knowing what the bill is, not knowing what they are talking about. Worse than that, he is trying to sneak things through this parliament without the proper exposure.


I commend the member for Mayo in this regard, because he belled the cat on this; he belled the cat quite clearly on what this minister was up to—about how he was creating more jobs for the boys. We know where the minister comes from. His heart and soul are still with the AWU and the union movement, and he wants to make sure that continues.


So he is sneaking in, in this legislation, the creation of two extra positions. Now, who will those positions go to, I wonder. One might think that, on past history, you might want to be able to say that there would be some balance in those appointments. But we know, when we look at the history of recent appointments, that there will be no balance, that it will be jobs for the boys, that it will be the union mates who are looked after. And such is the rush that this is being done with that we do not even know how these two new positions are going to fit with the existing vice-president positions. We know they will have a position of privilege above those other positions, but how it all neatly fits together no-one is clear on. But, for the minister, that is irrelevant, because what is important to him is to make sure that the jobs for the boys can continue.


We only have to look at the process which has brought us here tonight to see that that is what will happen. Let us take a few steps back. Let us look at how the review of the Fair Work Act was conducted. If you want to do a review that will come up with exactly the recommendations that you want, that you require, what is the best way to ensure that happens? You appoint people to your review panel who you know will give you what you want, and that is exactly what the minister did in putting the panel together to review the act. He put three people on there who, when you look on their record and everything they have said, in no way can be seen to be impartial. All of them are on the record as saying that, in essence, the union movement should be front and centre of any workplace relations arrangements. That is what they are on the record as saying, and that is what their review has done.


The irony is that those recommendations where there might have been a little bit more balance put in have been disregarded by the minister in this bill. He has just taken those recommendations which he thinks will cement the unions, front and square, in the centre of our workplace arrangements and brought them in. And he has disregarded a real opportunity to make sure that people can get employed in this country. He has made sure that long-term unemployment will continue to rise. He has made sure that youth unemployment will continue to rise. I know this because I wrote to this minister, asking him to include, as part of this process, an assessment of whether the way that the three-hour minimum rule was introduced, dealt with and then wound back could be assessed, because the time it took for that three-hour minimum engagement for after-school work to become 1½ hours again was over 18 months and required three court decisions—and a length of time that meant that the people who originally sparked the case had left school and missed 18 months of gaining valuable work experience and income. And what was the minister's response to that? He completely ignored it and said it was irrelevant and did not need to be looked at. What he did, in essence, was say that, if you have an issue with the Fair Work Act and the way it deals with things, then he is quite happy for the process to end up in the courts, for it to take over a year and a half to be dealt with, and he couldn't care less what happens in that period of time. The real damage that will be done is to unemployed youth and the long-term unemployed, because they are the people who always suffer when the union movement are put front and centre and are the only consideration in the way that the workplace relations legislation and arbitration system works in this country.


There are other aspects of this bill that we also need to look into. Another one is how the default process will work for superannuation within awards. Once again, we have had excellent speeches by members on this side on this issue. In particular, I would like to commend Mr Fletcher, the member for Bradfield. He has really belled the cat on what the government is about with this issue. He went chapter and verse through what the Productivity Commission recommended to the minister in this regard. It quite clearly showed that the default position should be that, if an employee wants to choose a super fund which is not an industry super fund, which is a retail super fund, then they should be able to make that choice. But what has the minister done? The minister has been tricky. There is no other word for it: the minister has been tricky. And the sad thing here is that I think what we are seeing is that the Prime Minister's trickiness is starting to rub off on the frontbench of the government—



Mr Frydenberg interjecting—




Mr TEHAN:
  Well, maybe that's true! Maybe it's the other way around, because in many ways I suppose the minister did put the Prime Minister there, so maybe I'm being a little bit unfair on the minister. Whatever it is, we have seen trickiness when it comes to saying one thing before an election and one thing after when it comes to the carbon tax. We have seen trickiness when it comes to saying one thing on a budget surplus and then doing another thing after it. And what we are seeing here is trickiness again.


We have seen the Productivity Commission make quite clear recommendations to the minister as to how this issue should be treated. And what has the minister done? The minister has ignored it and once again made sure that his union mates will be looked after, because it is his union mates who benefit from sitting on these industry super fund boards. It is his union mates who are the beneficiaries of the huge incomes they get from sitting on these boards.




Mr Frydenberg:
  That's what he was!




Mr TEHAN:
  And he knows about this, as the member for Kooyong rightly points out, because, before he came into this place, he was a beneficiary of this jobs-for-the-boys regime.


Industry super funds have their place. Let us not confuse the issue; they have their place, but we have to ensure that they are not the only place where default funds go. We have to ensure that there is choice in this sector because the superannuation system and industry in this country are too important for the future of Australians to have them played around with and manipulated. Yet, sadly, it seems that is what this government is intent on doing.


I say to the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation that, when he looks at default funds in modern awards, it is not too late to say: 'I've got this wrong. I am manipulating the industry here. I am showing a deliberate bias towards retail funds and I need to correct this.' Let us not forget what the minister has already put the superannuation industry through, through his so-called reforms which have done nothing but create red tape and more red tape for that sector. Now he wants to punish them and penalise them again. Minister, these are the future savings of Australians that you are playing with here. They are not something that should be toyed with. You should change your mind on this, and we on this side will be doing everything we can to make sure that you do.


In summary, this is a bad bill, a tricky bill and a rushed bill. The reason it is being rushed is that the government does not want it to have the scrutiny that it should have, because the government is trying to rush things through to get away with blue murder. We will hold the government to account for this. It is not good enough. This is not the way you govern a country.


As a matter of fact, the Australian people are sick of being governed in this way. What they want to see is good governance, integrity in government and high-calibre people delivering policies which are there for all members of the Australian community and which do not benefit privileged sectors of the community that ministers owe their allegiance to and owe their position in this place to. We need a better government for this country. My hope is that those on the other side will finally recognise this and have the courage to go to an election because, if they keep putting through this place pieces of legislation like this, they will harm the long-term interests of this nation, and the repair job in fixing it will be enormous. This is a bad bill. It has been rushed in, and it should be opposed.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (18:55):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012 and, in so doing, I follow some excellent speeches by my colleagues. I would like to pay tribute to the member for Wannon, the member for Mayo, the member for Farrer and of course the member for Bradfield, who has done, as the member for Wannon said, some very important work both publicly and in this House in shining a light on this union dominated racket that we call our superannuation funds.


I was recently asked what I most dislike about the Labor Party. At the top of my mind was economic mismanagement. Then I thought about the class warfare that they embark on. Then I thought that what really irks me most about the Labor Party is that they are beholden to the union movement. Only 12 per cent of the private sector workforce and about 18 per cent of the total Australian workforce are members of a union. But do you know what? One hundred per cent of the frontbench of those opposite are members of a union and 70 per cent of the caucus are members of a union. The minister for industrial relations—the fox in charge of the henhouse—was a former secretary of one of our major unions. You do not call that democracy; you call it a union dominated Labor agenda. We have seen it played out so many times—for example, the decision to lift compulsory superannuation from nine to 12 per cent, which will see $8 billion a year plough its way back to industry super funds. Out of the 10 appointments that were made to Fair Work Australia between December 2009 and December 2011, eight had union backgrounds. You do not call that democracy; again, you call it a union dominated agenda.


In today's bill before this House the Labor Party are seeking to deny the Productivity Commission's recommendation that they should open up default super beyond industry superannuation funds to retail funds and other funds—again, another example of a union dominated Labor agenda.


The superannuation industry in Australia is huge—$1.4 trillion is under management. In 2011-12, $90 billion of new money flowed into superannuation. The industry super funds are the giants among the superannuation industry. In 2011 they had $250 billion under management. In 2009-10 industry super funds received 31 per cent of the $78 billion that was contributed to super funds, not including self-managed funds, during this period. And AustralianSuper, which, as we know, the minister has had a personal relationship with, is also a major fund.


The Institute of Public Affairs, a very reputable organisation, has undertaken a study. It found that, across 166 modern awards approved by Fair Work Australia, 513 of the 566 super funds were industry or public sector funds. They were the default funds for millions and billions of dollars. These industry super funds, typically, choose up to half of their directors from unions. The unions get to nominate up to half of their directors.


I ask you the question: why should more than 10 million people in these industry funds have to pay directors' fees to half of those directors who come from union backgrounds, when the unions have only just over one million members across the country?


This is a closed shop; it is anticompetitive. It lacks transparency and it lines the pockets of union members. In the 30 seconds I have left, I promise you that on this side of the House we have an alternative. (Time expired)

The reason it is being rushed is that the government does not want it to have the scrutiny that it should have, because the government is trying to rush things through to get away with blue murder. We will hold the government to account for this. It is not good enough. This is not the way you govern a country.


As a matter of fact, the Australian people are sick of being governed in this way. What they want to see is good governance, integrity in government and high-calibre people delivering policies which are there for all members of the Australian community and which do not benefit privileged sectors of the community that ministers owe their allegiance to and owe their position in this place to. We need a better government for this country. My hope is that those on the other side will finally recognise this and have the courage to go to an election because, if they keep putting through this place pieces of legislation like this, they will harm the long-term interests of this nation, and the repair job in fixing it will be enormous. This is a bad bill. It has been rushed in, and it should be opposed.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (18:55):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012 and, in so doing, I follow some excellent speeches by my colleagues. I would like to pay tribute to the member for Wannon, the member for Mayo, the member for Farrer and of course the member for Bradfield, who has done, as the member for Wannon said, some very important work both publicly and in this House in shining a light on this union dominated racket that we call our superannuation funds.


I was recently asked what I most dislike about the Labor Party. At the top of my mind was economic mismanagement. Then I thought about the class warfare that they embark on. Then I thought that what really irks me most about the Labor Party is that they are beholden to the union movement. Only 12 per cent of the private sector workforce and about 18 per cent of the total Australian workforce are members of a union. But do you know what? One hundred per cent of the frontbench of those opposite are members of a union and 70 per cent of the caucus are members of a union. The minister for industrial relations—the fox in charge of the henhouse—was a former secretary of one of our major unions. You do not call that democracy; you call it a union dominated Labor agenda. We have seen it played out so many times—for example, the decision to lift compulsory superannuation from nine to 12 per cent, which will see $8 billion a year plough its way back to industry super funds. Out of the 10 appointments that were made to Fair Work Australia between December 2009 and December 2011, eight had union backgrounds. You do not call that democracy; again, you call it a union dominated agenda.


In today's bill before this House the Labor Party are seeking to deny the Productivity Commission's recommendation that they should open up default super beyond industry superannuation funds to retail funds and other funds—again, another example of a union dominated Labor agenda.


The superannuation industry in Australia is huge—$1.4 trillion is under management. In 2011-12, $90 billion of new money flowed into superannuation. The industry super funds are the giants among the superannuation industry. In 2011 they had $250 billion under management. In 2009-10 industry super funds received 31 per cent of the $78 billion that was contributed to super funds, not including self-managed funds, during this period. And AustralianSuper, which, as we know, the minister has had a personal relationship with, is also a major fund.


The Institute of Public Affairs, a very reputable organisation, has undertaken a study. It found that, across 166 modern awards approved by Fair Work Australia, 513 of the 566 super funds were industry or public sector funds. They were the default funds for millions and billions of dollars. These industry super funds, typically, choose up to half of their directors from unions. The unions get to nominate up to half of their directors.


I ask you the question: why should more than 10 million people in these industry funds have to pay directors' fees to half of those directors who come from union backgrounds, when the unions have only just over one million members across the country?


This is a closed shop; it is anticompetitive. It lacks transparency and it lines the pockets of union members. In the 30 seconds I have left, I promise you that on this side of the House we have an alternative. (Time expired)

"Hawke, Alex, MP",LP,2012-10-31,"



Mr HAWKE
 (Mitchell) (19:00):  I rise tonight to speak on the very important issue of homeownership following a visit from a constituent of mine, Howard Ryan, who has written to me and visited me on many occasions. I come from an electorate with one of the highest proportions of families in Australia and a vibrant building industry. My electorate is home to Homeworld, at Kellyville, and it is one of the fastest-growing sections of Sydney. Homeownership and building are one of the great Australian dreams that we see realised every day in my electorate. Homeownership is an aspiration, but especially in my electorate, with first home owners and new families buying in housing developments in and around north-western Sydney, we find that the regulatory standards for building are not keeping pace with development.




Howard Ryan is
 a small business owner in my local community who specialises in 
property inspection and how to best guard properties against what he describes as 
the 
'deadly effects affecting Australian properties'.
 He has put together a document on what he sees as the seven deadly effects affecting Australian properties today: asbestos; gas and carbon monoxide; termites, wood decay and mould; plumbing and electrical; site drainage; swimming pool fence safety; and strata insolvency. Without going into the detail today, obviously a national occupational licensing project is an essential component of moving forward in this area in Australia.




Howard Ryan has a book of stunning examples of things that go hideously wrong in this area and produce great pain for Australian families. I will quickly read out some examples. He cites an elderly couple with a house in Bellevue Hill who found out they would suffer $300,000 in legal fees due to a Supreme Court claim against the pest and building inspector. That claim was for over $1 million. The matter ended up being settled with the insurers for around $600,000


after 2½ years. A couple in Penrith who used one of the cheaper alternative property inspectors ended up paying over $80,000 in legal costs and having a claim in court for over $150,000—and that is still not settled. A young couple who moved to Menai obtained a pest and building inspection from an inspector who was referred to them by their conveyancer. The conveyancer read the report and told the purchasers that all was okay. Twelve months later, when the couple decided to do some renovations, they found over $200,000 in termite damage. The damage was mentioned in the reports, but the conveyancer failed to identify this fact and the couple bought the property. So far, two years later, they have spent over $100,000 in legal costs and the matter is continuing. And the examples go on and on and on.




In 2006, Howard 
Ryan 
started the Pre-Purchase Inspectors 
National 
Registry to
 allow prospective homeowners pea
ce of mind when 
they have
 a house inspected before purchase.
 He has a great business where he now trains people in pest and building inspection to ensure that they are properly trained and qualified. However, a national occupational licensing scheme would enhance what is going on here—not just from Howard's private building perspective but in the sense that we need to do something to address this critical problem which is impacting on so many families


in Australia. Some people would say this is a matter for the offices of fair trading in the states. But one of the challenges is that, with different state regulations and different state schemes, it is hard to ensure a consistent standard across the states for trainers to ensure that pest and building inspections are done properly and indeed that the building standards are written properly. So Howard is of course a great advocate of the COAG process and the national occupational licensing scheme, a project which has been underway for some time now.



With the brief for the Minister for Fair Trading in New South Wales, it is encouraging to see that New South Wales is now considering, through COAG, a national occupational licensing system task force, ensuring that they do move on this in a reasonable time frame. Given that the seven deadly dangers that Howard has identified can affect anybody, it is vital that we do something in Australia today to ensure there are proper and sound standards for homebuyers so that they can purchase a property sound in the knowledge that it is not affected by one of those seven areas.


I am certainly a big supporter of this. Aussie Home Loans director John Symond said in the Daily Telegraph in 2011 that the vendor of a property should be required to obtain a pest and building inspection before the property can be listed for sale. That is a suggestion for one reform that could make a big impact. In the same article, Rapid Solutions, a major supplier of professional indemnity insurance, stated that upwards of 30 per cent of those completing these inspections are uninsured. There definitely is a need for higher standards in this industry. It is something that affects homeowners around the country. The lack of professional standards and training and proper accountability for this vital area affects all homeowners and potential homeowners. I thank Howard for the work he has done in bringing this issue to the fore. I encourage COAG to continue this process quickly so that we can get to a better standard in Australia today.

"Frydenberg, Josh, MP",LP,2012-10-31,"



Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (19:32):  This bill from this government is about a closed shop. It is anticompetitive. It is putting the workers last and politics first. Let's face it: those on the other side have 100 per cent of their front bench who are members of the union. Seventy per cent of their caucus are members of the union. At a Labor conference 50 per cent of the votes go to the union. But in Australia only 12 per cent of the private sector workforce are members of the union and only 18 per cent of the general workforce are members of the union. 


Why will you not give the workers of Australia a free choice about who their default super fund will be? Industry super funds are in the pockets of the union. Who knows this best? The Minister for Industrial Relations and Workplace Relations. He knows this best, because he was a director himself of an industry super fund and now he is the fox in charge of the henhouse. 


The Productivity Commission has made a recommendation that this government extend default super funds much more broadly than it currently does with industry super funds. We on this side know that if we get our chance in government we will extend default super funds to any MySuper-compliant super fund. This is about allowing the market to determine where the workers choose to place their super funds. We have $1.4 trillion in superannuation in this country. That is a massive amount of money. The workers of Australia should have the right, the choice and the freedom to determine where their money goes. 


Choice and freedom are essential to the Liberal Party's DNA. It does not matter whether it is in health, where private health insurance is being cut by the government. It does not matter whether it is in education, where you seek to deny funding to private schools, independent and Catholic. It does not matter whether it is in workplace relations and the superannuation industry.


Many of my colleagues on this side have spoken passionately and with conviction about the rort that is currently taking place before our very eyes—a rort that is in the interest only of the union movement and not of the workers of Australia and a rort that is against the Productivity Commission's very recommendations. With some important legislation before this House you would think there would be proper scrutiny. You would think that we would have weeks to look at the legislation and to consult the stakeholders. We were given less than 24 hours to look at this legislation. Shame on you! Shame on the member for Maribyrnong! Our parliamentary draftsmen did not even have time to draft the amendments that we wanted to bring forward. 


Why are you hiding from scrutiny? You know why the member for Maribyrnong is hiding from scrutiny. He does not want the Australian people to know about this cover-up. He does not want the Australian people to know that it is his mates in the union movement who are the ones who will benefit. You do not want members of the Australian public—or indeed more than $10 million people who are in industry super funds—to know that industry super funds typically ask for more than 50 per cent of their directors to come from the unions, to be nominated by the unions so that these directors can supplement their incomes with a directorship of these industry super funds.


We know that Fair Work Australia has been discredited because of the Thomson affair. We know that of the last 10 appointments to Fair Work Australia, between December 2009 and December 2011, eight had union backgrounds. 




Mr Tehan:
  How many?




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  The member for Wannon asked me how many had union backgrounds. Eight out of ten appointed to Fair Work Australia between December 2009 and December 2011 had union backgrounds. The member for Maribyrnong may want to know why the government has increased compulsory super from nine per cent to 12 per cent. The reason is that this will see more than $8 billion annually go into industry super funds. Who are the big beneficiaries in industry super funds? It is the unions—the unions that dominate the Labor Party and dictate the policy of the Labor Party.


Let me remind the House and all those that are listening around Australia to this telecast that only 12 per cent of Australians working in the private sector workforce are members of unions. In the general Australian workforce only 18 per cent are in a union. But on the front bench—and I am looking at you, the member for Maribyrnong—100 per cent are members of unions. In the caucus, 70 per cent are members of a union. One hundred per cent of the front bench are members of a union and 70 per cent of the caucus are former union officials. We talk about the gene pool of the Labor Party shrinking before our eyes. We know why: the unions are dominating the membership of the other side.


More and more members of the Australian workforce are giving up the union ticket because they want to have a say where their money goes. They want flexibility in the workplace. They want you to change your unfair dismissal laws. You owe it to them to loosen up your unfair dismissal laws. We want to get the regulation off the back of small business. We want to see some freedom in the workplace rather than just the unions dominating the show. Why did you increase super from nine per cent to 12 per cent? You did it because you wanted to see $8 billion a year flow back into the industry super funds. Member for Maribyrnong, why do 50 per cent of the votes at your federal conference automatically go to the Labor Party? Why have eight out of the 10 appointments to Fair Work Australia gone to people with union backgrounds?




Mr Tehan:
  Why don't pie shop workers have choices?




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  The member for Wannon asks: 'Why don't pie shop workers have choices?' Even those who cannot even warm a pie should have choice. Those who serve a cold pie and those who serve a warm pie should have choice. The problem is that in every aspect of workplace relations on your watch we have seen a reregulation of the labour market. This has cost jobs, this has sent up wages and this has seen lower productivity.


The CEO of Santos, David Knox, said on the front page of the Financial Review that if he was to open a gas facility in the Gulf of Mexico it would be one third of the price of opening a similar facility in Australia. Why? It is because wages are out of control in this country. Productivity, by any international standard, is falling in this country. We have more than five million Australians employed in more than two million small businesses, and they complain every day to me about the unfair dismissals and the penalty rates that the other side has introduced.


We need to get a smarter, more efficient and more effective workforce. We will not do that by letting the unions dictate the policies. Fair Work Australia is discredited under this government. Productivity has come down, wages have gone up and we have not seen an improvement in the bottom line of companies. When we look around the world we see the economic troubles that are facing Europe, the United States and elsewhere. What has this government decided to do? It has decided to re-regulate the workforce and send productivity down and wages up with no commensurate gain for the Australian people.


On this particular legislation before this House we are seeing those opposite play a sop to the union movement. Their union masters are dictating the policy that they bring into this House. This is a bad outcome for the workers of Australia because the Productivity Commission, an independent body which so often provides intelligent information for this House to consider, has found that you need to broaden out the default super funds beyond the industry super funds alone.


The industry super funds are a reflection of the vested interests of the union movement. This goes back to the Hawke and Keating years in the 1990s, when they sought to put industry super funds at the centre of our workplace relations system. Why do more than 50 per cent of the directors on the industry super funds come from the union movement when the union movement represents only 12 per cent of the private sector workforce and about 18 per cent of the general workforce? The number of people who are prepared to pay their union money has gone down year after year. People are voting with their feet.


I say to the members on this side of the House that we will take a tough, strong stance against the union dominated Labor Party, which is producing bad policy for the people based on politics alone. Default super funds deserve to be expanded beyond just industry funds and that is why we on this side will support changes in government and we on this side will not tolerate bad legislation from this government.

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (19:44):  I thought I was going to grow horns and a tail there for a while, because I was a union rep in my younger days and it seems that they are the epitome of all evil. Let me tell the previous speaker that I have a lot of union officials who are friends of mine. They are presidents of our P&Cs, they sell raffle tickets at our local shows, they stand out in the hot sun selling tickets for our local shows, they run our rugby league and they run our voluntary fire brigade boards. They are not people with horns and tails as the previous speaker—who is laughing and thinks it is funny that people should do those things—says. I suppose he does so because he has never in his life such things. His sort of mentality was abroad in this place 100 years ago when we went down the mines. One in 31 of us never came back up again with that sort of mentality abroad in this place. Unlike him I have a record for standing up to unions when there was a time to stand up. I did not notice any Liberals standing beside us when we stood up in Queensland when they turned the lights out. We were the only government in Australian history that actually confronted them. I did not notice you blokes. You were hiding. You were lucky the lights were out so they could not see you. We could not find you. There is a time when there are excesses.


The reason I rise to speak is that numbskulls on my right here and also on the left—I do not want to let them off—are continuing to back the superannuation funds in Australia. I want to speak in praise of some of the trade union members on those superannuation funds.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr KATTER:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to speak here instead of the Liberal Party taking over.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! The member for Kennedy will resume his seat. The member for Mitchell, the member for Kooyong and the member for Wannon are conducting a private conversation. They could do it outside the chamber or return to their seats.




Mr Hawke:
  I just wanted to get on TV.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Mitchell will resume his seat. I call the member for Kennedy.




Mr KATTER:
  I want to speak in praise of some of the union appointees on the superannuation boards in Australia because three of them have come to see me. They have pointed out—



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr KATTER:
  I would like you to tune in, fella; you might learn something. You are sitting there like a giggling idiot, so I suppose I am not likely to get on your wavelength—that is for sure.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Kennedy will withdraw.




Mr KATTER:
  I withdraw those remarks unequivocally. I praise those people who have come to me and said that all of the superannuation moneys are going into real estate and shares. We are just blowing up the balloon. If you keep blowing up the balloon it will burst. We have the most unaffordable housing prices in the world because the superannuation funds are being pumped into those areas. Under the great leadership in this place of people like Jack McEwen there was a 60-40 rule, and 60 per cent of your superannuation money was put into government securities where they were used to build things. It is not a concept that the Liberal Party understands; probably the Labor Party does not understand it either. They were used to build things such as railway lines to get our coal out, ports to get our coal out and transmission lines to take electricity into these areas and to open them up. They were government guaranteed.


We now have a superannuation system where there is no government guarantee on the retirees' funds and we know that they are all going into a hyper-volatile balloon about to explode in real estate and in the share market. I speak with authority because, unfortunately and sadly, I represent a lot of people who were prime losers in the collapse of Storm in Northern Australia. There were no union representatives on Storm, I can assure you. It seemed to go down pretty spectacularly. There have been a number of other organisations that have gone down spectacularly, and there were no union representatives there.


I ask sincerely that the people in this place listen to me when I say and when I communicate to you what those union members said to me. They said that all of that money is going into real estate and the stock market. It is not productive, it is not producing wealth in the long term. It is producing inflation. It is blowing up a balloon that is absolutely guaranteed to explode. When this place was much more successful than it is these days, we had people like Jack McEwen who ensured that 60 per cent of that money was protected. We had absolute protection for those people and government guarantees on the money. The money was used to go into productive resources instead of speculation. I venture to submit that all of that 23 thousand million of hard-earned savings in Australia is simply being pumped into speculation. None of it is going into production and into the facilities that we need for that production. Unfortunately and sadly, it is at great risk because it is going into inflationary areas.


Finally, I want to put on record my request to the minister that the financial consultants or planners be included in the list—which was my old business. I would very much like to see those people put on a list. Then, if you are an employee and you have a list of recommended superannuation funds, you also have a list of the local people that you know you can go along to and talk about where your money should be invested. So, whilst the minister has not agreed to put it in the bill, I would ask him to please consider this proposal further down the track. These people live in our local communities. They are well known, well liked and well trusted, and 99 per cent of them, from my experience, have done the right thing by the people that they do business with. If they did not, they could not survive in their suburbs or their small communities in which we know and like them. I would like to see those sorts of people in that recommendation as well as the superannuation recommendation from the fairness tribunal.


On the condemnation of trade union officials and making them out to be monsters: my friend, your great granddaddy went down a mine, and one in 31 of his mates never came back up again. The only reason that does not exist today is the work of those trade union officials. So just be a bit careful of the graves that you are spitting on.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (19:52):  I thank the honourable member for Kennedy for his contribution. I also thank the government members for their contributions to the debate on the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012. This bill delivers another part of the government's workplace relations and superannuation agenda. It is another step in ensuring a balanced, workable, simple and flexible workplace relations system for Australia, it is another step in the evolution of the national workplace relations tribunal—the new Fair Work Commission—and it is another step in improving the operation of the superannuation system to boost the retirement incomes of Australians into the future.


This bill is a further example of the government's cooperative and consultative approach to workplace relations. The bill implements recommendations from an independent expert review of our legislation that has been on the record since mid-July. We have announced a clear policy and approach in response. We have developed policy and legislation in consultation with the National Workplace Relations Consultative Council, with small business and with the superannuation industry. Both union and employer stakeholders agree that the bill is non-contentious. I repeat: both union and employer stakeholders agree that the bill is non-contentious. They want to get on to discussing other policy matters in workplace relations that are important to them, and I agree.


This is not the last step in workplace relations reform. I am committed to continuing to work with the serious stakeholders on making appropriate amendments to the Fair Work Act where there is clear policy justification and where they reflect the government's clear policy frameworks. I retain an open mind on all remaining recommendations from the Fair Work Act review panel. None of them have been ruled in or out. Yet the opposition's current workplace relations policy, despite their huff and their puff, remains a well-kept secret.


In relation to superannuation, there is one thing that we do know: the opposition will raise taxes on 3.6 million Australians earning up to $37,000 per year by slashing the Gillard government's low-income superannuation contribution. Around one in three workers will pay up to $500 a year more in tax because of the coalition's plans to slash any programs that are linked to the mining resource rent tax. Sadly, the coalition's destructive negativity means that they would rather reduce the wealth of 3.6 million workers than take money from those who can afford to pay. It is clear that some things have not changed for the opposition.


Their overriding principles in workplace relations were on show again last night when they voted to reduce the protections for worker entitlement and yet again even in the House today when they continued to speak against legislation that will boost the superannuation savings of workers. The opposition have publicly said that they support the overwhelming majority of the recommendations of the independent review panel. Given that this bill reflects the non-contentious aspects of the panel's recommendations, includes measures to improve the operations of Fair Work Australia and delivers an improved process for choosing default superannuation funds in modern awards, I trust that the opposition will support the bill and assist its passage through the parliament.


I must turn very briefly to some of the remarks made about industry funds and superannuation. I submit to the House that the opposition are long on rhetoric and short on facts. It is a fact that the Productivity Commission found that the existing default fund arrangements have resulted in net returns generally exceeding those of non-default funds. Over the eight years to 2011, default funds in modern awards have averaged an after tax return of 6.4 per cent compared with 5.5 five per cent for non-default funds. It is a fact that the Gillard government reforms will deliver a more contestable and transparent selection process than ever existed under those opposite.


The member for Wannon said that superannuation is too important to be played around with. We agree with that part of his contribution. The opposition play with superannuation when they selectively quote the Cooper review. They do not mention that recommendation 1.4 of the Cooper review concluded that the Productivity Commission should complete its review of default super and awards by 2012. The Gillard government has met this commitment. They did not mention that they have opposed other Cooper recommendations when it has suited them. They did not mention that they seek to abolish the tax concession that we are providing low-paid workers. Indeed, I have to say that they have criticised some on this side of the House for having industry experience and having had involvement with industry funds. The member for Kooyong described industry funds as giants. In any other industry the Liberal Party would be genuflecting when they talked about industry giants. But when organisations have equal member representation, it is too much for the opposition to stomach and it triggers their bias against equal representation in superannuation funds.


There is a clear reason that we departed from one of the Productivity Commission's recommendations. Unlike those opposite, who are interested only in attacking unions and industry funds—and we heard some of that bigotry spew forth tonight—the Gillard government was very mindful of a solution that is workable for all parties in superannuation, including employers. Those opposite ask why any MySuper product cannot be a default fund superfund, and they ask why we need to have between two and 10 funds listed. I submit that an outcome where there are over 100 funds for employers to choose from in an award is not efficient—certainly the employers agree with us. It creates red tape, especially for small businesses, who will face considerable search costs in determining which fund to choose. Unlike those opposite, we listen to big and small businesses who use the award system. We have modified the final Productivity Commission recommendation while retaining the essence of an open and transparent process.


While listening to those opposite debate the superannuation aspects of the bill, it struck me how infrequently they mentioned employers and their needs and how frequently they sneered at the contribution that employers make on the industry funds of Australia. It struck me how little they understand or respect the contribution of industry funds to delivering good retirement outcomes for Australians. I believe that all too often we see too much simplification from those opposite about industrial relations and indeed industry funds. I trust that the opposition will assist the passage of this constructive bill through the parliament. I commend the bill to the House.

At a Labor conference 50 per cent of the votes go to the union. But in Australia only 12 per cent of the private sector workforce are members of the union and only 18 per cent of the general workforce are members of the union.

Our parliamentary draftsmen did not even have time to draft the amendments that we wanted to bring forward. 


Why are you hiding from scrutiny? You know why the member for Maribyrnong is hiding from scrutiny. He does not want the Australian people to know about this cover-up. He does not want the Australian people to know that it is his mates in the union movement who are the ones who will benefit. You do not want members of the Australian public—or indeed more than $10 million people who are in industry super funds—to know that industry super funds typically ask for more than 50 per cent of their directors to come from the unions, to be nominated by the unions so that these directors can supplement their incomes with a directorship of these industry super funds.


We know that Fair Work Australia has been discredited because of the Thomson affair. We know that of the last 10 appointments to Fair Work Australia, between December 2009 and December 2011, eight had union backgrounds. 




Mr Tehan:
  How many?




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  The member for Wannon asked me how many had union backgrounds. Eight out of ten appointed to Fair Work Australia between December 2009 and December 2011 had union backgrounds. The member for Maribyrnong may want to know why the government has increased compulsory super from nine per cent to 12 per cent. The reason is that this will see more than $8 billion annually go into industry super funds. Who are the big beneficiaries in industry super funds? It is the unions—the unions that dominate the Labor Party and dictate the policy of the Labor Party.


Let me remind the House and all those that are listening around Australia to this telecast that only 12 per cent of Australians working in the private sector workforce are members of unions. In the general Australian workforce only 18 per cent are in a union. But on the front bench—and I am looking at you, the member for Maribyrnong—100 per cent are members of unions. In the caucus, 70 per cent are members of a union. One hundred per cent of the front bench are members of a union and 70 per cent of the caucus are former union officials. We talk about the gene pool of the Labor Party shrinking before our eyes. We know why: the unions are dominating the membership of the other side.


More and more members of the Australian workforce are giving up the union ticket because they want to have a say where their money goes. They want flexibility in the workplace. They want you to change your unfair dismissal laws. You owe it to them to loosen up your unfair dismissal laws. We want to get the regulation off the back of small business. We want to see some freedom in the workplace rather than just the unions dominating the show. Why did you increase super from nine per cent to 12 per cent? You did it because you wanted to see $8 billion a year flow back into the industry super funds. Member for Maribyrnong, why do 50 per cent of the votes at your federal conference automatically go to the Labor Party? Why have eight out of the 10 appointments to Fair Work Australia gone to people with union backgrounds?




Mr Tehan:
  Why don't pie shop workers have choices?




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  The member for Wannon asks: 'Why don't pie shop workers have choices?' Even those who cannot even warm a pie should have choice. Those who serve a cold pie and those who serve a warm pie should have choice. The problem is that in every aspect of workplace relations on your watch we have seen a reregulation of the labour market. This has cost jobs, this has sent up wages and this has seen lower productivity.


The CEO of Santos, David Knox, said on the front page of the Financial Review that if he was to open a gas facility in the Gulf of Mexico it would be one third of the price of opening a similar facility in Australia. Why? It is because wages are out of control in this country. Productivity, by any international standard, is falling in this country. We have more than five million Australians employed in more than two million small businesses, and they complain every day to me about the unfair dismissals and the penalty rates that the other side has introduced.


We need to get a smarter, more efficient and more effective workforce. We will not do that by letting the unions dictate the policies. Fair Work Australia is discredited under this government. Productivity has come down, wages have gone up and we have not seen an improvement in the bottom line of companies. When we look around the world we see the economic troubles that are facing Europe, the United States and elsewhere. What has this government decided to do? It has decided to re-regulate the workforce and send productivity down and wages up with no commensurate gain for the Australian people.


On this particular legislation before this House we are seeing those opposite play a sop to the union movement. Their union masters are dictating the policy that they bring into this House. This is a bad outcome for the workers of Australia because the Productivity Commission, an independent body which so often provides intelligent information for this House to consider, has found that you need to broaden out the default super funds beyond the industry super funds alone.


The industry super funds are a reflection of the vested interests of the union movement. This goes back to the Hawke and Keating years in the 1990s, when they sought to put industry super funds at the centre of our workplace relations system. Why do more than 50 per cent of the directors on the industry super funds come from the union movement when the union movement represents only 12 per cent of the private sector workforce and about 18 per cent of the general workforce? The number of people who are prepared to pay their union money has gone down year after year. People are voting with their feet.


I say to the members on this side of the House that we will take a tough, strong stance against the union dominated Labor Party, which is producing bad policy for the people based on politics alone. Default super funds deserve to be expanded beyond just industry funds and that is why we on this side will support changes in government and we on this side will not tolerate bad legislation from this government.

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (19:44):  I thought I was going to grow horns and a tail there for a while, because I was a union rep in my younger days and it seems that they are the epitome of all evil. Let me tell the previous speaker that I have a lot of union officials who are friends of mine. They are presidents of our P&Cs, they sell raffle tickets at our local shows, they stand out in the hot sun selling tickets for our local shows, they run our rugby league and they run our voluntary fire brigade boards. They are not people with horns and tails as the previous speaker—who is laughing and thinks it is funny that people should do those things—says. I suppose he does so because he has never in his life such things. His sort of mentality was abroad in this place 100 years ago when we went down the mines. One in 31 of us never came back up again with that sort of mentality abroad in this place. Unlike him I have a record for standing up to unions when there was a time to stand up. I did not notice any Liberals standing beside us when we stood up in Queensland when they turned the lights out. We were the only government in Australian history that actually confronted them. I did not notice you blokes. You were hiding. You were lucky the lights were out so they could not see you. We could not find you. There is a time when there are excesses.


The reason I rise to speak is that numbskulls on my right here and also on the left—I do not want to let them off—are continuing to back the superannuation funds in Australia. I want to speak in praise of some of the trade union members on those superannuation funds.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr KATTER:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to speak here instead of the Liberal Party taking over.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! The member for Kennedy will resume his seat. The member for Mitchell, the member for Kooyong and the member for Wannon are conducting a private conversation. They could do it outside the chamber or return to their seats.




Mr Hawke:
  I just wanted to get on TV.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Mitchell will resume his seat. I call the member for Kennedy.




Mr KATTER:
  I want to speak in praise of some of the union appointees on the superannuation boards in Australia because three of them have come to see me. They have pointed out—



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr KATTER:
  I would like you to tune in, fella; you might learn something. You are sitting there like a giggling idiot, so I suppose I am not likely to get on your wavelength—that is for sure.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Kennedy will withdraw.




Mr KATTER:
  I withdraw those remarks unequivocally. I praise those people who have come to me and said that all of the superannuation moneys are going into real estate and shares. We are just blowing up the balloon. If you keep blowing up the balloon it will burst. We have the most unaffordable housing prices in the world because the superannuation funds are being pumped into those areas. Under the great leadership in this place of people like Jack McEwen there was a 60-40 rule, and 60 per cent of your superannuation money was put into government securities where they were used to build things. It is not a concept that the Liberal Party understands; probably the Labor Party does not understand it either. They were used to build things such as railway lines to get our coal out, ports to get our coal out and transmission lines to take electricity into these areas and to open them up. They were government guaranteed.


We now have a superannuation system where there is no government guarantee on the retirees' funds and we know that they are all going into a hyper-volatile balloon about to explode in real estate and in the share market. I speak with authority because, unfortunately and sadly, I represent a lot of people who were prime losers in the collapse of Storm in Northern Australia. There were no union representatives on Storm, I can assure you. It seemed to go down pretty spectacularly. There have been a number of other organisations that have gone down spectacularly, and there were no union representatives there.


I ask sincerely that the people in this place listen to me when I say and when I communicate to you what those union members said to me. They said that all of that money is going into real estate and the stock market. It is not productive, it is not producing wealth in the long term. It is producing inflation. It is blowing up a balloon that is absolutely guaranteed to explode. When this place was much more successful than it is these days, we had people like Jack McEwen who ensured that 60 per cent of that money was protected. We had absolute protection for those people and government guarantees on the money. The money was used to go into productive resources instead of speculation. I venture to submit that all of that 23 thousand million of hard-earned savings in Australia is simply being pumped into speculation. None of it is going into production and into the facilities that we need for that production. Unfortunately and sadly, it is at great risk because it is going into inflationary areas.


Finally, I want to put on record my request to the minister that the financial consultants or planners be included in the list—which was my old business. I would very much like to see those people put on a list. Then, if you are an employee and you have a list of recommended superannuation funds, you also have a list of the local people that you know you can go along to and talk about where your money should be invested. So, whilst the minister has not agreed to put it in the bill, I would ask him to please consider this proposal further down the track. These people live in our local communities. They are well known, well liked and well trusted, and 99 per cent of them, from my experience, have done the right thing by the people that they do business with. If they did not, they could not survive in their suburbs or their small communities in which we know and like them. I would like to see those sorts of people in that recommendation as well as the superannuation recommendation from the fairness tribunal.


On the condemnation of trade union officials and making them out to be monsters: my friend, your great granddaddy went down a mine, and one in 31 of his mates never came back up again. The only reason that does not exist today is the work of those trade union officials. So just be a bit careful of the graves that you are spitting on.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (19:52):  I thank the honourable member for Kennedy for his contribution. I also thank the government members for their contributions to the debate on the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012. This bill delivers another part of the government's workplace relations and superannuation agenda. It is another step in ensuring a balanced, workable, simple and flexible workplace relations system for Australia, it is another step in the evolution of the national workplace relations tribunal—the new Fair Work Commission—and it is another step in improving the operation of the superannuation system to boost the retirement incomes of Australians into the future.


This bill is a further example of the government's cooperative and consultative approach to workplace relations. The bill implements recommendations from an independent expert review of our legislation that has been on the record since mid-July. We have announced a clear policy and approach in response. We have developed policy and legislation in consultation with the National Workplace Relations Consultative Council, with small business and with the superannuation industry. Both union and employer stakeholders agree that the bill is non-contentious. I repeat: both union and employer stakeholders agree that the bill is non-contentious. They want to get on to discussing other policy matters in workplace relations that are important to them, and I agree.


This is not the last step in workplace relations reform. I am committed to continuing to work with the serious stakeholders on making appropriate amendments to the Fair Work Act where there is clear policy justification and where they reflect the government's clear policy frameworks. I retain an open mind on all remaining recommendations from the Fair Work Act review panel. None of them have been ruled in or out. Yet the opposition's current workplace relations policy, despite their huff and their puff, remains a well-kept secret.


In relation to superannuation, there is one thing that we do know: the opposition will raise taxes on 3.6 million Australians earning up to $37,000 per year by slashing the Gillard government's low-income superannuation contribution. Around one in three workers will pay up to $500 a year more in tax because of the coalition's plans to slash any programs that are linked to the mining resource rent tax. Sadly, the coalition's destructive negativity means that they would rather reduce the wealth of 3.6 million workers than take money from those who can afford to pay. It is clear that some things have not changed for the opposition.


Their overriding principles in workplace relations were on show again last night when they voted to reduce the protections for worker entitlement and yet again even in the House today when they continued to speak against legislation that will boost the superannuation savings of workers. The opposition have publicly said that they support the overwhelming majority of the recommendations of the independent review panel. Given that this bill reflects the non-contentious aspects of the panel's recommendations, includes measures to improve the operations of Fair Work Australia and delivers an improved process for choosing default superannuation funds in modern awards, I trust that the opposition will support the bill and assist its passage through the parliament.


I must turn very briefly to some of the remarks made about industry funds and superannuation. I submit to the House that the opposition are long on rhetoric and short on facts. It is a fact that the Productivity Commission found that the existing default fund arrangements have resulted in net returns generally exceeding those of non-default funds. Over the eight years to 2011, default funds in modern awards have averaged an after tax return of 6.4 per cent compared with 5.5 five per cent for non-default funds. It is a fact that the Gillard government reforms will deliver a more contestable and transparent selection process than ever existed under those opposite.


The member for Wannon said that superannuation is too important to be played around with. We agree with that part of his contribution. The opposition play with superannuation when they selectively quote the Cooper review. They do not mention that recommendation 1.4 of the Cooper review concluded that the Productivity Commission should complete its review of default super and awards by 2012. The Gillard government has met this commitment. They did not mention that they have opposed other Cooper recommendations when it has suited them. They did not mention that they seek to abolish the tax concession that we are providing low-paid workers. Indeed, I have to say that they have criticised some on this side of the House for having industry experience and having had involvement with industry funds. The member for Kooyong described industry funds as giants. In any other industry the Liberal Party would be genuflecting when they talked about industry giants. But when organisations have equal member representation, it is too much for the opposition to stomach and it triggers their bias against equal representation in superannuation funds.


There is a clear reason that we departed from one of the Productivity Commission's recommendations. Unlike those opposite, who are interested only in attacking unions and industry funds—and we heard some of that bigotry spew forth tonight—the Gillard government was very mindful of a solution that is workable for all parties in superannuation, including employers. Those opposite ask why any MySuper product cannot be a default fund superfund, and they ask why we need to have between two and 10 funds listed. I submit that an outcome where there are over 100 funds for employers to choose from in an award is not efficient—certainly the employers agree with us. It creates red tape, especially for small businesses, who will face considerable search costs in determining which fund to choose. Unlike those opposite, we listen to big and small businesses who use the award system. We have modified the final Productivity Commission recommendation while retaining the essence of an open and transparent process.


While listening to those opposite debate the superannuation aspects of the bill, it struck me how infrequently they mentioned employers and their needs and how frequently they sneered at the contribution that employers make on the industry funds of Australia. It struck me how little they understand or respect the contribution of industry funds to delivering good retirement outcomes for Australians. I believe that all too often we see too much simplification from those opposite about industrial relations and indeed industry funds. I trust that the opposition will assist the passage of this constructive bill through the parliament. I commend the bill to the House.


Question agreed to.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (09:30):  Meals on Wheels is a familiar name to all Australians and it is at the heart of many communities across the country, including the Ryan electorate. Meals on Wheels has been active across Australia for more than 50 years, helping the frail and elderly, and younger people with disabilities and their carers, stay in the comfort and security of their own homes. That is the organisation's main aim.


Meals on Wheels volunteers go beyond just providing a nutritious meal for clients. A friendly smile every day, a chat about the weather or simply knowing someone will drop by to say hello can make a real difference to the lives of many Australians who would otherwise have limited contact with others in the community. But it is not just the clients who value this contact; ask any Meals on Wheels volunteer and they will tell you that reaching out and brightening someone else's day makes their day better too.


Independence is something we all value, and to have that taken away through not being able to go to the shops for groceries or to cook regular meals should not be an obstacle to autonomy. As someone who remembers doing meals on wheels in the school holidays with my mother, I was delighted to attend the 40th anniversary celebrations for the Mitchelton Meals on Wheels, with local state members Tim Mander and Dale Shuttleworth, Brisbane City councillor for Enoggera Ward Andrew Wines and Moreton Bay regional councillor Brian Battersby. 


Mitchelton Meals on Wheels delivers meals to more than 200 people across the north-west of the Ryan electorate. With an extensive catchment area, the fantastic volunteers at Mitchelton Meals on Wheels deliver, on average, 125 meals a day across nine delivery runs, Mondays to Fridays, including most public holidays. Six volunteers work in the kitchen each morning assisting the full-time kitchen manager. As a result of a group of exceptionally skilled kitchen managers, Mitchelton Meals on Wheels is able to provide quality meals for only $7 per meal for their clients.


Mitchelton Meals on Wheels is one of the most highly regarded volunteer organisations in their community. From humble beginnings with a handful of volunteers delivering meals to 10 clients out of premises in Wakefield Street, Alderley, the organisation has grown into one whose achievements have been recognised in the Quest Business Achiever Awards over many years, and they have now reached the highest level possible, having been inducted into the Gold Hall of Fame after winning the award eight times.


The organisation's recent celebration was a great opportunity for volunteers past and present to come together and discuss their 40 years of service to the community. It was inspiring to hear just how far they have come over the past four decades and to listen to anecdotes from Rosemary Costello about some of their early challenges. It was a privilege to join with the volunteers in their Mitchelton Meals on Wheels 40th anniversary celebrations. I commend the work of the management committee under the watch of president Harold Brown and treasurer Anne Huggett, who are moving the organisation from strength to strength. Mitchelton Meals on Wheels are just one of many outstanding community volunteer organisations at the heart of the Ryan electorate. I congratulate them on their 40 years of service to the Ryan community and wish them well for the next 40 years.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (10:01):  Gordon Neil Bilney, who died on Sunday aged 73, was a straightshooter and someone with whom you knew where you stood. So said Noel Hicks from Griffith this morning when I telephoned him to talk about the Australian Labor Party's late member for Kingston, to whom we appropriately pay tribute again today. Mr Hicks was the National Country's and the National Party's member for Riverina from 1980 to 1998, spanning the time that Mr Bilney was in the federal parliament. 'I got on well with him,' Mr Hicks recalled. 'Even though we were on opposite sides of politics, I had the greatest respect for him. He was down to earth and he represented the people he served very well. His diplomatic experience was an asset when he came to parliament.'


Gordon Bilney was born in Renmark, South Australia, on 21 June 1939. His first career was as a dentist before becoming a diplomat. He served as the deputy permanent representative of Australia to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development from 1975 to 1978 and as the Australian High Commissioner to the West Indies from 1980 to 1982. Elected to federal parliament for the South Australian seat of Kingston at the 1983 election, the sixth person to serve that electorate, which was formed in 1949, Mr Bilney won all subsequent elections until defeated by the Liberal candidate Susan Jeanes at the 1996 election.


While in parliament, Mr Bilney served as the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel from 1990 to 1993. During his time as minister he lifted the ban on homosexuals in the ranks of the Defence Force. From 1993 to 1996 he served as the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs—the first time a minister had been specifically dedicated to this position. Mr Hicks served with Mr Bilney, who chaired the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade during the 1980s and recalled his colleague as 'always being on top of the subject and one who contributed very well'. Mr Hicks asked me to extend his sincere condolences to Gordon's wife, Sandra, children, Carolyn, Sarah and Nicholas, and grandchildren, Madeleine, Charlotte, Beatrice, Adele and Emma. May he rest in peace.

Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (10:03):  It is a great honour to speak on the condolence motion for Gordon Bilney. When we talk about those who have passed, we obviously cast our own minds back to our memories and it reminds me of when I first joined the party in the years of the Keating government. When I first started in the party it was the apex of Gordon Bilney's career. He was minister for the Pacific Islands at the time and part of that great group of Centre Left thinkers in the Labor Party—people like Mick Young, Bill Hayden, Chris Schacht and others, who really were a force to be reckoned with in the Hawke and Keating years. They were not just a political force but an intellectual force. Certainly that group of men and women were to be admired. Rosemary Crowley was also part of that group. The group originated in South Australia and there was a distinctive style about them all. Gordon was an even more colourful part of that colourful tradition.


When we look at his career, he went from dentist to diplomat and was a marginal seat candidate, politician, character, mate of Mick Young's, forthright, intelligent, robust and ebullient—a dedicated character who was not afraid to put his case and make an articulate presentation. But, as we have heard from the member for Riverina, he was respected by his opponents. It was still that rare time in politics where you could have great battles but great friendships as well. I know from my own time on the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee how important the Pacific is. I remember Gordon as the first minister to make a real impact in the area, raising Australia's influence in and care for that area and putting our involvement in that area front and centre in government affairs. As we just heard, he made a distinctive contribution as Minister for Defence Science and Personnel in removing discrimination. At that time discrimination, both civil and otherwise, was rife in the community towards gay and lesbian people. Gordon was one of those people who applied intellect and he applied the great Labor tradition of fairness and applied that in practice—he had the courage to apply that in legislation.


I had a limited amount to do with Gordon—I was at the opposite end of the great city of Adelaide, in the northern suburbs, trying to re-elect men like Neal Blewett and others, including Martyn Evans—but many of my friends worked on Gordon's campaigns and we heard rather interesting and sometimes wild stories about campaigning down there. It was a very marginal seat in those days and I am glad to say the current member for Kingston has made it safe, in Gordon's memory.


Gordon was rare because he did not just have to fight off Liberals—he had to fight off Janine Haines from the Democrats, who was a formidable candidate in South Australia at that time. It should not be forgotten that some years later the Democrats got about 23 per cent state-wide in South Australia, so they were a powerful middle force and drew from the traditional base of both parties—they drew from the small business base of the Liberals and from Labor's base as well. To fight off that challenge took a great deal of energy, colour, wit and intelligence. 


I remember visiting Gordon's office and there was a wall full of black-and-white bromides, back in the days when you had to have black-and-white photos—or bromides—for your pamphlets. Gordon was in each one of them at a community event or at a school. Such is the life of a marginal seat MP. I vividly remember one of Gordon on his hands and knees planting a small tree with some kids at a local school or a local park. While we might focus on his life as a minister, as a raconteur and as a diplomat, we should not forget that he did not mind getting his hands dirty.


Gordon was very much a colourful voice of the south. He was a great campaigner and I think my generation learnt a great deal off him, particularly my friend John Bistrovic, who was mentioned in Senator Farrell's speech—a speech that I think captured some of the colour of Gordon's political career.


I know he learnt off Gordon a great deal of what he knows about campaigning. Some of those stories of the 1996 campaign when Gordon was defeated—not on the basis of his own candidacy but perhaps he was swept away in the tide against Labor after 13 years of government—I suspect should remain unsaid. 


I never realised that Gordon was a dentist. I guess he went, in the life of a marginal seat-holder, from pulling other people's teeth to pulling his own. He really was representative of a time in Australia where people had very varied careers before they entered this place, and they brought all of that with them—and they brought all of the colour with them, at a time when we were not afraid to have people who were representing us in the very highest levels of civil society—people like diplomats and dentists—in our parliament. I do not think the political parties are rejecting these people; I think that, more and more, people see the conflict in politics and the demands it makes on your life—and in particular on your family's life—and are rejecting it as a career. I think that is a sad thing because the more Gordon Bilneys we have, the more colour this building has and the more life it has in it. 


Gordon's career is a testament to the Labor movement, to all of its colour and to the dynamic and robust and occasionally cantankerous nature of the Labor movement. He will be sorely missed, I know. It is with great sadness that we mourn his passing. My condolences go to his family, and to his partner Sandy. Vale.

Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh—Second Deputy Speaker) (10:12):  It is with great sadness that I rise to speak about Gordon Bilney in this condolence motion—sadness that he has passed away and we will never again be able to enjoy those colourful conversations with him; those discussions about politics or about the latest book he has read or about a good drop of red wine and the region it came from. It is also a time to reflect on his life and the many contributions he made to public life and to his friends—some of which my colleague the member for Wakefield has mentioned. 


As we heard, Gordon was married to Sandy Colhoun and he had two daughters, Caroline and Sarah, and a son, Nicholas. They will no doubt miss him far more than most, being his closest family. As we heard yesterday from the Prime Minister and others, Gordon was born in Renmark and he was the son of schoolteachers, so he had education running through his veins. I suppose that is where he got his politics from as well—that sense of fairness and opportunity for all from his schoolteacher parents. He was educated at Norwood High School and Prince Alfred College, and then entered Adelaide University to do dentistry, following which he became a practising dentist. He started his career as a dentist but then went back to school. He had a keen interest in foreign affairs. Right up to the last years of his life he was keen on discussing foreign affairs and knowing what was happening in the world and various regions. He went back to university to study this area and then went into the department that he wanted to work in, the Department of Foreign Affairs. 


As the member for Wakefield said, Gordon was a very colourful character. We had many characters in the Labor Party. He came from that era of the Mick Youngs and the Chris Schachts and the Bill Haydens, and the Bob Hawke era. He was one of many of those colourful characters that came from a particular part of the ALP—the Centre-Left, which was very prominent both in state parliament in South Australia and state politics in the Labor Party, and up here in the House of Representatives and the Senate.


Gordon became an adviser to Gough Whitlam. Gough hand-picked him to be an adviser on foreign affairs because of his key knowledge and expertise in this area. He later served as Deputy Permanent Representative of Australia to the OECD from 1975 to 1978 and as the Australian High Commissioner to the West Indies from 1980 to 1982. While he was serving in Kingston, Jamaica, as a diplomat in 1981, he was asked to stand for the federal seat of Kingston. After some thought, he did decide to become the Labor Party candidate for that seat. In 1983 he defeated the incumbent Liberal MP, Grant Chapman, who went on to become a senator. Gordon was re-elected to the same seat in 1984, 1987, 1990 and 1993. He was defeated by a very thin margin in the 1996 landslide. It had nothing to do with his performance as a member of parliament; it was just the big swing away from the then Labor government to the Liberals.


There is a very interesting story which made the front page of our local paper in South Australia, the Advertiser, at that time. Gordon was invited to go to the opening of a community centre or something by a particular community group in his electorate. Gordon had worked tirelessly over many years to secure funding for the group and they eventually managed to build this community centre or whatever it was—only for Gordon to find the head of this particular group writing an endorsement for his opponent in the 1996 election. The invitation to the opening had come in before that election, although the event was not until after the election. Despite having lost the seat, Gordon still turned up and they thanked him. He got on the podium and said thank you to everyone, but then—and we heard this yesterday—he said that one of the great things about no longer being an MP was:


… I need no longer be polite to the nincompoops, bigots, curmudgeons and twerps who infest local government bodies and committees such as yours.


And he pointed out the head of the group. That was the character of the man. That was what we saw in Gordon. 


In 1998 I ran for the seat of Hindmarsh for the very first time. It was supposed to be an unwinnable seat for Labor, requiring an 8.1 per cent swing. I ended up being in front by about 600 votes on polling night, although the count went on for a few days afterwards. On one of those few days, I went out to dinner with my former boss, Senator Bolkus, and we bumped into Gordon in one of the restaurants at the top end of Rundle Street. He was so excited that we had nearly won Hindmarsh and were still in with a chance. He came up to me and told me what a great job I had done as a candidate, gave me some advice and spoke about a whole range of other things. I told him that we had a particular person—mentioned earlier—who had worked on his campaign working on my team. He said, 'That makes a lot of sense; that is why you did so well.'


He was always keen to talk about politics. He was always keen to know what was going on here in the House. I saw him from time to time. Occasionally I attended lunch with a group of prominent ex-politicians, known as the Hagar group, at the T Chow restaurant in Adelaide. Gordon was a regular at the Hagar lunches. He was always keen to hear about what was happening and what was going on and he was right up to date with everything. Last time I attended, they had asked me to be there as a guest speaker to talk a bit about what was taking place up here. Gordon was right up to date with all the policies, all the legislation and, in fact, the in-house machinations of our political party. 


Gordon was a prolific reader. He loved reading. The books he referred me to were always great reads. I always knew that, if Gordon referred me to a book, it was a ripper of a read. I will never forget one book he referred me to. I saw him at the ALP Christmas show a few years back and he said to me, 'I have to talk to you.' I went up to him and he said, 'I have this great book that I have just finished reading; you must read it.' I put it in the back of my head and forgot about it. A few weeks later, I saw him again and he asked, 'Have you read the book?' I apologised and said, 'No, I haven't.'


At that point I wrote it down. It was a book by Jeffrey Eugenides called Middlesex. He was right. He gave me a book which he knew I would absolutely love. This book is about the history of the Greeks, a novel about a family which left Asia Minor at the turn of the last century for the United States after they had been ousted from Asia Minor. This goes to show the type of person Gordon was. He connected me and my background to this book. You can just imagine him reading this book thinking, 'This is a great book for Georganas; he'll love it.' It was a great book and I had great pleasure in talking with him many times about this wonderful book, which won the Booker prize back then.


We are all going to sorely miss Gordon, especially at the Hagar lunches, at which I would be present once or twice a year, together with many other people from South Australian such as Colin McKey; Chris Schacht; Ralph Clark; John Hill; Rosemary Crowley, who was a regular attender; Terry Groom; and my good friend Kevin Vaughn, whose electorate office was right next door. He speaks about signs appearing in the 1993 campaign. They were unauthorised signs about the GST, and he tells me they had no idea who was putting them up, but we have suspicions about where they came from. He told me that story this morning. 


Gordon was a wonderful, colourful character, a friend of many in South Australia, a friend of many Labor Party members and a friend of many South Australians, especially in the southern suburbs, whom he represented with pride for many years. He was a great member of parliament, as we have heard, and not just on the ministerial side. To win so many times in a wafer-thin marginal seat shows the calibre of the man and how he connected with the people in the south. Our condolences go to Sandy, to his two daughters and son, and to his family. Gordon will be sorely missed by everyone in South Australia who had anything to do with him and his colourful discussions, debates and intellect.
