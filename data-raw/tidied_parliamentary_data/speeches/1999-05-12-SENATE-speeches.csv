"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-05-12,"—I want to make some comment on this matter. The question here is whether these bills should be exempted from the cut-off before winter. As the Senate knows, we already have a very long list of legislation which cannot possibly be dealt with before the winter break, and I would have thought that we should have a better explanation from the minister as to why these pieces of legislation should be dealt with at this stage.
It becomes clear here that, if these pieces of legislation are to be dealt with, having been introduced at this stage, other pieces of legislation which have been on the agenda for quite a long time will have to make way for them. I do not know that the government has adequately explained why these pieces of legislation have taken until now to be introduced, important as they are, and why they are supplanting the government's previous priority list at this stage.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-12,—There was a series of questions that the minister was going to respond to when we resumed debate today. We are waiting to hear from him on that basis.,SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—Let me respond to 
 some of the questions raised. This refers to what is an Australian government agency. It is defined in the 1997 Income Tax Act. The definition is actually very broad: it means the Commonwealth, state or territory or an authority of the Commonwealth, state or territory. Government business enterprises are not expected to be covered by this definition. For example, it is not expected that Telstra and other GBEs will be covered by the definition of an Australian government agency. As I mentioned yesterday, the ATO will be issuing a ruling which will give more detail on the application. I hope that provides a response to satisfy the senator.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

[cultural organisations]
These amendments before us are designed to deal with the issues raised with us by charitable organisations. Before I embark upon an outline of the amendments, I wish to draw attention to an approach which I hope the government will adopt in examining our amendments.
We have put before you, Minister, something like 120 amendments to date. We would expect each to be dealt with on its merits, because they are in response to concerns which have been expressed through the Senate committee process. It is important to our future relationship with this government how seriously you treat these amendments. My party and I would regard it as singularly unhelpful if the government were to take the approach that only your amendments matter and are worthy of support and that our amendments do not matter. That is a general shot across your bows, if you like, because after 30 June you will want to bring forward business tax proposals and other tax proposals. You will expect them to be considered on their merits.
In this GST debate, by and large, the Labor Party have dealt themselves out by failing to put up amendments and by failing to deal with amendments which are necessary and appropriate, in our view. Therefore, if we have to carry the bulk of the load of those people who want changes to your package, we would hope that your attitude would be appropriately deliberative.
—As always.
—You certainly understand the underlying message I am giving 
 you. Minister, the first of these amendments is to clause 9-15, page 14, which is to add:
(4)	 For the avoidance of doubt, the provision of a *government grant or *sponsorship to a *cultural organisation is not the provision of consideration.
Amendment No. 7 states:
. . . after the definition of  creditable purpose , insert:
 cultural organisation  has the meaning given by section 30-300 of the *ITAA 1997.
Amendment No. 8 states:
. . . after the definition of  goods , insert:
 government grant  means a payment made by an *Australian government agency (whether of money or other property) to a *cultural organisation for the purposes of supporting the operations or functions of that organisation.
Amendment No. 10 states:
 sponsorship  means a gift of money or other property to a *cultural organisation for the purposes of supporting the operations or functions of that organisation but does not include a gift for which the supplier receives consideration or other benefits such as advertising which promotes the supplier or the supplier's goods or services.
All of those amendments, as you would note, are designed to introduce additional certainty and, if you like, to straighten out some of the lines in definitional matters and understanding concerning this area. I will leave my general remarks at that and defer to Senator Allison, who will outline the detail of the amendments.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-05-12,"—These amendments are very important. They seek to clarify what the government says is the case but will not actually properly confirm—that is, that the GST will not apply to grants to cultural organisations `for the purposes of supporting the operations or functions of those organisations'. Furthermore, they seek to clarify what forms of sponsorship will be regarded as GST free as a donation.
This was one of the Democrat recommendations which I made in the report on the GST by the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee. It follows on from the very serious concerns of a large number of arts organisations which submitted to the inquiry 
 that the grants which keep their companies alive will be in peril under the GST.
The arts will be harder hit than most industries by the GST, a point which was confirmed by studies carried out by the Australian Major Performing Arts Group, AMPAG, and by Econtech for the Australia Council. Econtech calculated that the seven per cent increase in arts prices forecast by Treasury would result in falls in sales of 10 to 12 per cent for artistic entertainment, including nine per cent for music and theatre productions, eight per cent for performing arts venues and four per cent for creative arts.
This modelling suggests that many arts organisations and companies which are already in a parlous economic state would see their viability very seriously affected. Indeed, research in the Australia Council's Major Organisations Fund report shows that the performing arts have lost a collective $12 million over the last four years. The GST will come into play when the reserves of these organisations are extremely low.
The Entertainment Industry Employers Association told the committee that the entertainment industry is in the middle of a marked downturn in sales and production. Indeed, AMPAG told the inquiry that only 11 of the 22 companies they represented were in surplus and that a five per cent fall in sales would cost $7.1 million, forcing 14 companies into deficit, and a 10 per cent fall would push 18 companies into deficit.
Between six and eight of the companies would be facing bankruptcy. This could include some of Australia's flagship cultural icons, such as the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Opera Australia, the Australian Ballet and the Sydney Dance Company. All of this would be exacerbated if grants and sponsorships were taxable. Australian companies give about $65 million a year to the arts, mostly in corporate sponsorship. Imposing a GST on all forms of sponsorship would have a particularly adverse effect, especially on finance companies which were unable to claim input tax credits.
Sponsorship makes up 20 per cent of the revenue of the major companies, with grants adding a further 20 per cent. These are very 
 important parts of the financing of our cultural icons, I am sure my colleagues would agree. The Australia Council told the committee that it was not clear in the draft legislation that grants were GST free, in spite of the minister's assurances to the contrary. It called for clarification of the proposed legislation so that the status of grants was not open to interpretation, therefore avoiding unnecessary concerns and appeals.
Many arts organisations were very critical of the government's failure to adequately consult with arts organisations in particular in drawing up its legislation to define what is a grant and GST free. This amendment seeks to put that issue beyond all doubt and allow companies to start planning on the basis of certainty, at least about government grants. Sponsorship too, as I have already said, is of great concern. This is particularly so given that around a third of corporate sponsorship comes from financial institutions which will not be able to claim input tax credits if a GST is imposed on sponsorship.
What really galls the Democrats in looking at the government's treatment of sponsorship, particularly of not-for-profit organisations, is that it is incredibly stingy compared with the treatment in other GST regimes like Canada and the UK. In the UK sponsorships are exempt from the GST if the sponsor receives no benefit in kind other than acknowledgment of the sponsorship. Advertising in a charity brochure is also largely exempt, and membership fees providing only minimal services are exempt as well. In Canada the rules introduced by the Liberal government there in 1997 are even more generous. Sponsorships are generally exempt, depending on the service provided. Naming rights are certainly exempt. Donations are exempt, even including the donation component of attending events like charity balls. In Ireland the supply of cultural, theatrical and musical services is exempt if provided to a cultural body. So in comparison Australia looks pretty puny.
Our amendment seeks to ensure that corporate sponsorship is treated in much the same way as it is in Canada and the UK—that is, sponsorship other than the actual payment of services such as free tickets or advertising 
 will be GST free. In moving this amendment, it is our intention that it be interpreted widely to ensure that the widest possible category of sponsorship is picked up and that the only part that is excluded is the part which is clearly a payment in kind for services such as free tickets, hospitality or commercial advertising.
This amendment will help ensure that companies maintain the full benefit of corporate sponsorship but that that sponsorship is not used to avoid paying tax on actual services. In short, that part of the sponsorship which is really a kind of donation, albeit one that carries with it the right to be acknowledged or to have a logo used or even to have the sponsor's name attached to an event, will be GST free. I commend these amendments to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-05-12,"—I can see the concerns that are being expressed here. I was on the other end of the phone when a number of the organisations expressing concern to the committee were putting their case. You could see that to the people involved and to those employed in this sector, given the tough times they have had recently, the impost of a GST was of great concern, in particular the collection costs and the potential impact on sponsors. Therefore I can see the reasons behind this amendment.
This amendment provides that government grants to or sponsorship of a cultural organisation are not the provision of consideration—that is, are not subject to the GST system. Cultural organisations are defined in section 30-300 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. A government grant is defined as:
. . . a payment made by an Australian government agency (whether of money or other property) to a cultural organisation for the purposes of supporting the operations or functions of that organisation.
Sponsorship, as we have heard, is defined as money or other property provided:
. . . to a cultural organisation for the purposes of supporting the operations or functions of that organisation but does not include a gift for which the supplier receives consideration or other benefits such as advertising which promotes the supplier or the supplier's goods and services. 

The question that springs to mind is whether the definition or the change of definition pulls out of sponsorship the very essence of sponsorship. If there is no publicity, advertising or acknowledgment, would not the so-called sponsorship be a donation? With regard to the bit about the supplier receiving consideration or other benefit such as advertising, the dictionary definition of sponsor or sponsorship is that which brings back some benefits. There is obviously a commercial benefit.
The definition of sponsorship also creates problems of income tax deductibility. Currently, corporations or businesses can sponsor a charity or a group and claim tax deductibility in one of two ways. Firstly, if the entity is a gift deductible entity, then the amount of sponsorship will be tax deductible. Secondly, if the entity is not a gift deductible entity, then the sponsor can claim tax deductions under section 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act if they can argue that the promotion of their business is an activity which contributes to earning assessable income. Under section 51, anything which contributes to earning assessable income is a tax deductible expense.
For instance, a law firm may sponsor a function held by a new student organisation called Women and the Law, which is set up to lobby the law faculty in a university to be more sensitive to gender specific issues. The law firm could argue that their sponsorship is tax deductible, as they are gaining publicity and marketing themselves to bright young women lawyers. However, if their name was not displayed in the function or on the invitations or mentioned by the organisers, they would not be able to substantiate the case for tax deductibility.
In section 51.1 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, part of it, 8.1(1)(b), says that you can deduct from your assessable income any loss or outgoing to the extent that it is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing your assessable income. As I said, I can understand why we have been stuck in this position by the government. However, I am concerned that the outcome is that the Democrat amend 
 ments seem to create a double bind. Firstly, sponsorships are GST free and therefore the recipient organisations will not have to ask the sponsor for 10 per cent more or skim off 10 per cent of the sponsorship to remit to the ATO. However, sponsorships themselves are less attractive if they are not directed to a gift deductible entity and there is no income tax offset available. My feeling is that that may involve more money loss than the loss due to the payment of the GST. So gift deductible entities win but other not-for-profit organisations lose, and the Greens are concerned about this situation on the basis of equity between similar organisations. Much like our other amendment aimed at the not-for-profit sector, we are trying to ensure that we do not end up with a two-tiered system relating to not-for-profit organisations. I will be interested in hearing about this further in the debate, but at this stage for us these amendments are a little problematical.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—A fundamental misunderstanding seems to have occurred here. First of all, the amendments relate to government grants; they are not to do with some of the issues raised by Senator Margetts which were dealing with the private sector arrangements. So the amendments that have been moved by the Democrats, as I understand it from Senator Allison, are only about grants and sponsorships by government and do not deal with private legal firms or what have you. I think the debate has strayed far away from what the amendments are.
Just to make it clear: the problem, Senator Allison, with what you have raised is that I think what the Democrats have moved would actually be to the detriment of the bodies you are seeking to help. In effect, you are denying them a cash flow benefit. If these amendments were passed, I daresay within a short period of time the government would be approached by organisations seeking to revert to the original arrangement, because you would have denied them the cash flow benefits. Let me expand on that. It is important to bear in mind that where such payments are taxable, they will not result in any detriment to the cultural organisation. Where they are 
 taxable, the government or sponsor will need to pay a GST inclusive amount but will receive an input tax credit for the GST paid. In practice, the credit to the government will offset the GST they have paid for the price of a grant or a sponsorship.
This is the debate we had yesterday, and I went through an example. Say there is a grant which is $100,000. If that is a taxable type grant, the government will give $110,000, the organisation will remit $10,000, the net payment is $100,000 and the government is entitled to a $10,000 input tax credit. So what we are seeing here is that on the recipient side, the registered recipient will need to remit the GST to the ATO but they will have the cash flow benefit of holding on to the GST until they are required to remit it. We do not believe it would be appropriate to deny them this benefit. The government has been keen to meet with a range of arts bodies to explain its position, and my understanding is that in some recent meetings there has been a recognition and a better understanding of the bill, and the organisations are typically far happier as a result of this when this is explained to them.
In summary, and this covers a bit of the debate we had yesterday, Senator Allison, if the Democrats amendments were passed, it is my belief it would be to the detriment of the organisations you are in fact trying to help, because they would not receive the cash flow benefit of holding on to the GST until they have to remit it to the tax office. The government will be opposing the amendments.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-12,"—I would like the minister to just flesh out his response a little more. Let us start with amendment No. 1. That amendment affects subdivision 9A which is to do with taxable supplies. Within that there is the explanation of what `consideration' is, with three clauses. We have added a fourth clause. The fourth clause we have added says:
For the avoidance of doubt, the provision of a *government grant or *sponsorship to a *cultural organisation is not the provision of consideration.
In other words, it is not a taxable supply. It does not affect their cash flow—they would have received the grant, they would have 
 received the sponsorship. To start with amendment No. 1, in what respect would your answer in terms of a cash flow consideration at all invalidate the proposal? What we have sought to do is to make it clear what is not a taxable supply.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—If it is not a taxable supply, you do not get the $10,000 which you keep until you have to remit it to the tax office. That is the position. We have been through this, and I have given another example this morning. What happens is that, if the grant was $100,000, if it is a taxable grant that grant is $110,000. The organisation keeps the $10,000 until it has to remit it to the tax office, so there is a tax flow benefit. The net effect is the same but there is a cash flow benefit by holding on to the cash until you have to remit it to the tax office.
I understand exactly what you said, Senator, because you are conveying a view that a number of arts organisations originally put to the government and they have obviously put the same case to you. My understanding, particularly from some recent briefings with some of the larger arts bodies, is that they now understand the government position and the argument that I am putting.
We think what you are doing here will give a detriment to the organisations, not a benefit, and that detriment is that they lose their cash flow benefit. Therefore we will not be supporting the amendment and, frankly, if it went through we would be under pressure to restore the original clause.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-12,"—Let us focus on a government grant. I understood you to have said yesterday that it is not the intention of government, which formerly gave this $100,000, to now give $110,000 and then the $10,000 is given back. I understood you to say yesterday that you are still going to be granting $100,000. How is there a benefit? You are not giving somebody $10,000 to take back $10,000—from what you said yesterday.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—We have given $110,000 and the government is entitled to claim the credit of $10,000. The organisation 
 receives the additional $10,000 and we will claim the input tax credit. I gave an example yesterday and an example this morning. If we currently give $100,000 and it is taxable then the $100,000 will be $110,000. The organisation will remit $10,000, so the net payment is $100,000 and the government is entitled to a $10,000 input tax credit. So the government is no worse off and the organisation is no worse off, but the organisation has a cash flow benefit while it keeps the $10,000 before it is remitted to the Australian Taxation Office. The situation is that you are denying an organisation that cash flow benefit. Organisations which have understood this now appreciate that this is not a problem and their earlier concerns have been dealt with.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-12,"—Minister, you said yesterday that an organisation which got $100,000 before the introduction of the GST will still be granted $100,000 after the introduction of the GST—it will not be granted $110,000. Are you telling us that the government is going to increase all these grants by 10 per cent? Let us have a yes or no answer on that and then we can understand where we go from there.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—Yes. In order to deal with the taxable issue, the GST has to be covered. I think that would be understood if you read the answer I gave yesterday. I will recheck the Hansard , but as I was reading from the same notes I would be very surprised if the Hansard  did not say this. The net cost to the government is the same because the government gets a credit. Remember the ceteris paribus assumptions that we had—everything else remaining the same? In other words, the government has not changed its programs or priorities. The net cost to the government is the same. That is the point I am making. A $100,000 grant is still a $100,000 grant but the initial payment would have the $110,000 and then the government claims the $10,000 so the net effect to the government pocket is the same.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-12,"—Put aside the government and talk about the cultural organisation that we 
 are referring to. If they get a government grant of $100,000 pre GST, and post GST they still get a government grant of $100,000, there is no change to their cash flow. The cash flow will be affected if they get that same grant of $100,000 and then 10 per cent is lopped off and they have to pay it back to the government. As I understand it, that is not what you were saying yesterday. Where is the cash benefit to the organisation if before this happens they receive $100,000 and after it happens they receive $100,000?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—This is what I said yesterday; I have the Hansard  here. I think my answer was to Senator Margetts. I said:
You wanted an example. If the government gives a grant of $100,000 to a particular organisation and that is taxable, the government gives $110,000 and the organisation gets $110,000. It remits the GST, which is $10,000, and the net payment is $100,000.
—It is $11,000.
—No, it's not.
—What is 10 per cent of $110,000?
—This is exactly what I said, Senator:
That is what we mean when we say `net out effects'. The government gets an input tax credit of $10,000 so the net cost to the government is $100,000.
That is what I said yesterday; that is what I said today. There has been no change from what I said yesterday. The argument which we ran yesterday is essentially the same argument that I think Senator Allison is seeking clarification of this morning. Where it is taxable, the government grant has the GST applied. I have been quite consistent, let me assure you.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-05-12,"—Apart from the nonsense of the government giving with one hand and taking away with the other, there is the question that Senator Margetts raised of this being, in the case that you cited, not a GST of $10,000 but of $11,000. Leaving that aside, what sort of assurances are there that the government's grants program will be increased by 10 per cent in the arts budget, or are we talking about Treasury topping up the arts budget for 
 the purposes of the GST? How is this juggling act going to go on within government?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—Let me make this clear. The 10 per cent applies to the GST exclusive value. In this case, the GST exclusive value is $100,000. This $100,000 with a 10 per cent GST equals $110,000. The GST represents one-eleventh of GST inclusive value. The GST inclusive value is $110,000. That is how the mathematics work. It is perfectly consistent with what everybody else has said. The net cost is the same. A taxable grant of $100,000 now, with the GST applied, becomes $110,000. Because the government gets an input tax credit, the net cost to the government is the same. That is the position.
Does government give with one hand and take away with another? I guess an analogy would be our salary. The government gives us a salary—people will argue whether it is too high or too low, but it gives us a salary—income tax is applied and it takes money away. The government giveth and the government taketh away.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-05-12,"—The government may giveth and taketh away, but here we have a situation where, from my question yesterday, the government did not promise that they would giveth. I asked, `Will the government make the commitment that it will pay the extra 10 per cent on top of grants that are deemed subject to the GST?' We did not get a straight answer at the time, and I am sure that is what is behind a lot of the questions that the Australian Democrats are asking now. It is not actually in the legislation that that will happen. Of course, it does not cover—
—Nor is it in the budget.
—Nor is it in the budget, as Senator Murray indicated. If that is the case and it is not indicated in the clear as mud, accrual budgeting process, perhaps the minister can let us know when and where that commitment is written. How does this relate to the private grants or sponsorships? Where would they get the extra money to cover them for this particular time, or will they have a cashflow problem themselves?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—The amendments deal with government grants. I think we should confine ourselves to the issue of government grants. We have to confine ourselves to the amendment which is before the chair or we will never finish. I have explained to you the net cost to the government. If there is a taxable grant of $100,000 and the government continues that program, continues that grant to the organisation, the government will pay $110,000. That will include the 10 per cent GST. But the net cost to the government will be $100,000 because it will be claiming back an input tax credit.
Government will always set priorities. If the government currently gives a grant of $100,000 to Senator Margetts's arts foundation, or an appropriate agency entitled to receive such a grant, and it believes the organisation continues to be worthy of such a grant and it continues the same priorities, that organisation will receive $110,000. But the net cost to the government will be $100,000. That is the point I am making. This does not impose, in this particular example, an additional cost on the government, but it does provide a cashflow benefit to the organisation that you are seeking to assist.
I think that point is understood now. I think this amendment reflects an earlier discussion, which of course I am aware of because I guess the same people in the Treasury have seen you. That is why I say that what you are seeking to do here, and I do not doubt with the best of intentions—I am not arguing that position, because I am sure it is with the best of intentions—in our view, would be to the detriment of the organisations that you are seeking to assist.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1999-05-12,"—You had me almost convinced a little while ago. Senator Kemp, I think you are doing quite well this morning actually. Let me compliment you. You were going well, but then you threw me completely. You threw me completely by using the illustration of parliamentary salaries, because in fact the argument breaks down completely if you use that little illustration. What we are talking about is a grant to an organisation which includes 
 $10,000 additional so they can pay the GST. That $10,000 then becomes cash in hand and enables them to have a cashflow. I thought it would be very good if the government were going to do that.
The minister then used an illustration and said, `It is like a parliamentary salary.' The problem is that when we are paid our parliamentary salary, we never get the tax amount in hand. We simply get the salary less the tax, net. If the analogy to the grant is exactly analogous to what we receive when we receive our salary, there is no cash benefit. As parliamentarians, we do not receive salary plus tax and have a period where we have the tax in our pockets to enable our cashflow to be improved and then some time later pay it back. We never receive the tax. Can you see the problem that your illustration has caused me? I am now very anxious about the assurances you were giving, because I thought you had me convinced. Now you have lost me.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—If you would remain convinced if I were to withdraw it, I withdraw it. The simple point I was making is about whether the government gives money and the government takes away money—it was not to push the metaphor in every sense. I think Senator Allison or Senator Margetts wondered about this concept of the government giving and the government taking, and I was just drawing an analogy. You rightly drew attention to the cashflow benefits. I assure you that the cashflow benefits are there. The analogy was simply, on the debate we had: the government giveth and the government taketh away.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-05-12,"—I was actually chided a little while ago—and, of course, I was shocked and upset about this—for mentioning private sponsorship. Actually, the Democrats amendment specifically relates to private sponsorship, so I would refer the minister back to that. We have talked about the churning in relation to government grants and departments. The tax office will say that it will churn it back to that area so that they have substantially the same situation. But if the grant recipients have a cashflow benefit, one 
 of the things we have to look at is that government departments will have a cashflow problem. If they are having to churn through 10 per cent more each time, they are always going to have a cashflow loss of about 10 per cent, having paid out more than they normally would.
Given that, we still have a situation where the Democrats' amendment which is before us—I know the minister is very keen to deal with amendments which are before us—deals with the issue of sponsorship. I am still asking the question: how do we deal with sponsors in that situation? What is the ability to compensate for the fact that the sponsors themselves are in a difficult situation or may be reticent to pay that extra 10 per cent because they are not going to be churned, or are they?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-05-12,"—Mr Temporary Chairman, at this juncture it might be an appropriate time, without disrupting the flow of questions, to declare the Labor Party's attitude to this amendment of the Democrats. It is a simple statement to make. I have expressed the Labor Party's view of this legislation at many points prior to now. Let me simply restate that we are opposed to a GST; therefore we are opposed to this legislation; therefore we will be voting it down.
This amendment, to some extent, accepts that a GST is inevitable and therefore seeks to amend the package. We do not want to put the handcuff of a GST on the Australian people. Therefore, we are not going to be party to a debate which decides whether the handcuffs should have fleecy lining or should simply be raw metal. It seems to us that that is to modify the principle in some way. The principle is wrong, so we will not be supporting this amendment by the Australian Democrats and we will be voting against this legislation at the conclusion of the committee stage.
To the arguments: if we were, for example, supporting the principle of a GST—which we are not—the arguments advanced by the Democrats have considerable merit. The explanations given by the government are a 
 load of old cobblers. The contact I have had with organisations in the arts area does not suggest to me at all that they are in any way chastened or quietened by the explanations given to them by the government on this point. Having said that, I signify to the chamber that we will not be supporting the amendment.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-05-12,"—I want to return to the question before getting onto sponsorship, and Senator Margetts is correct to say that these amendments do go to that question of private sponsorship as well as government grants. It seems to me that we cannot proceed with this question until the government gives the commitment that grants to arts organisations are going to be increased by 10 per cent. I do not see how we can be satisfied with the answer. I am not sure that the arts organisations which will have the benefit of cashflow described by the minister—by virtue of the amount of money they can hang onto for three months before paying back to the government—are going to be at all reassured if, at the beginning of the process, their grants are not increased by that amount.
I understand there are going to be great difficulties, as I appreciate, because the quantum of grants changes from one year to the next. For instance, let us look at the current budget. Does it build in a 10 per cent increase in grants? How do grants organisations know that this has been built in? Will it not just be another opportunity for the government to cut costs and reduce the amount of the grants by at least that amount?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—Senator, we are probably re-covering some ground. If the government has a commitment to make a grant to an eligible arts organisation of $100,000, the government will pay $110,000; the government will get an input tax credit of $10,000, and so the net effect to the government will be the same—$100,000. That is how it will work. If you are entitled to a grant of $100,000, that grant is a taxable type grant. The government will then pay you $110,000. The government will be entitled to an input tax credit of $10,000, so the relevant appro 
 priation will show $100,000, but the arts organisation will have the $10,000 on hand until it is required to remit it, providing the organisation with a cashflow benefit.
I think that answers your question, but I take your guidance. Our reading of your amendment was that it did not apply to private organisations. If you tell me your amendment does, obviously it is your amendment so we will have that debate. If it is a sponsorship, if it is a taxable supply, the business, if it is a relevant business, will get an input tax credit. If it is an input taxed body, it will not get that, but on the other hand it will be in exactly the same position as other alternative sponsorship arrangements. We do not see that this will be detrimental to private sponsorships. We think, overall, the amendments that you have moved are not to the advantage of the organisations you are seeking to help.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-05-12,"—Coming back to the question of government grants, perhaps the minister could point to the clause in the legislation which would guarantee that 10 per cent on top of the existing grant and a line item in the budget. Can you draw that to our attention so we can be reassured?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—The reassurance is: the government understands its legislation and, if it makes a grant which is a taxable grant, it will have to pay GST on that grant. But the government well knows that it will get an input tax credit so that the net cost to the government is the same.
I do not want to keep repeating myself, but that is the principle. I have stated the principle. I have my advisers here and I have looked around to check whether I have put a word out of place and they all say that it is fine. I am sure that the explanation you have been given is the correct explanation, and I urge the chamber to oppose this amendment moved by the Democrats.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-12,"—Through the chair: Minister, we understand the principle and that principle has been spelt out. What we have not got from you is the commitment. The commitment 
 would be, in the legislation or in the budget, that there would be an extra 10 per cent paid—which the government would then take away—to the organisation. Otherwise there is no cash benefit whatsoever. There can be no cash flow benefit. The only ways you receive a cash flow benefit are if you either receive additional money or if you are allowed to keep money, which you would otherwise lose, for a longer period than otherwise pertains. Nothing in your answer has indicated that there is additional money, or a longer time, in the hands of the organisation. On the other hand, if you were saying they are going to be granted $100,000 and 10 per cent is going to be taken away, but you will delay the taking away of that 10 per cent for a couple of months, that is a cash flow benefit for the period it is not taken away—but it is not a cash benefit.
The principle is understood, but the fear that lies behind these amendments and our questioning of you is that cultural organisations are going to be short-changed. Nothing in your answers to date—including the somewhat amusing summary by Senator Cook of your answers—has satisfied that. That is why we want you to draw our attention to a specific clause or a specific commitment, either in the budget or in this legislation, which satisfies that principle.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—We understand the principle, so we have moved forward. The final point is: if the government has a commitment to a grant of $100,000 and there is a GST applicable to that grant, the government will pay $110,000. It will claim an input tax credit so the net effect to the government is $100,000. Where it is a taxable grant, the government will pay $110,000 when the GST is applied. That is the assurance that I am giving you.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-12,"—If the government has a commitment, it will appear as a financial outlay in its statements, regardless of the fact that it is going to get it later on. If the government commits itself to paying a parliamentarian's salary of $83,000 but is going to take back a significant percentage of that in tax, it has an 
 outlay of $83,000 even though it is going to be taking back $30,000 or $40,000 in tax. That is how it works. If you have a commitment to raise an organisation's grant by 10 per cent, it has to appear in the budget as an outlay. It does not appear in the budget as an outlay, and that is the problem with your description to us.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—I think we are going around in circles, but I can give you some comfort on how the budget works. I am advised that, in an accrual framework, the input tax credit comes to account at the time the grant is made, and so the amount that you are seeking does not appear in the appropriation. This is how accrual budgeting works. The input tax credit comes to account when the grant is made. I can assure you that we follow proper accounting standards and rules. The assurances I have given you are plenty. I can repeat them again: if you are entitled to a $100,000 grant, the government will pay you $110,000 if it is a taxable grant and immediately claim an input tax credit. The net cost to the government is $100,000, but the organisation gets a $10,000 benefit.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-05-12,"—We are clearly not getting very far with this question and I am sure that arts groups are not going to be comforted by the minister's words. I do not think there is any sign that their budgets will be increased by 10 per cent in order for them to be decreased by 10 per cent.
However, I will just move on to the question of assurances. The minister referred to some subsequent consultations he had had with arts organisations. As the chair of the committee that dealt with this question, it was quite clear  from what those arts organisations said to us that they did understand that whatever amount it was would not have to be refunded for a period of three months. So I am surprised that they have suddenly seen the light and see this as a positive instead of a negative.
Minister, can you give us a little more detail about which organisations said to you that they are now happy with this arrangement? Was it the Australia Council, for 
 instance? Did they put anything in writing? As chair of that committee, we heard their concerns and we saw them on paper, and I have not heard anything from them since to say, `We don't want you to go ahead with those amendments because now we are happy with what the government says.' I think it is imperative that you provide us with whatever you have in terms of a new approach by arts organisations to this question.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—What I said was a fair summary, as we have had discussions with some arts organisations. As a result of the explanations, I think we were able to address some of their concerns. These are consultations with the Treasury. If I wish to reveal those consultations, I would prefer that we dealt with the organisation directly and got their permission so that we do not have a blazing row over what someone said.
I have been advised by the Treasury in good faith that these issues have been explained. I do not say that every organisation—of course, the arts is a huge community—is falling over saying that this is fantastic. I am not suggesting that at all. But I am suggesting that, where we have had the opportunity to explain the position, we think the concerns have been addressed. If it is appropriate for me to table a list I will do that, but I think I would need to check further.
To finalise the earlier point, the accrual framework reflects the reality of the net cost to government. That is how the accrual framework operates. I do not know if I can go  any further on that. I think we have dealt with the general principle which, I understand from what Senator Murray said, is now accepted. We have dealt with how the government would work this in practice, and I have dealt with the example of the $100,000 grant. We have now turned to the budgetary side—how this appears in the budget—and we have addressed that particular issue. I can see some shaking of heads, so I can see that I have not entirely persuaded at least three people in the chamber, but that is the government's position. Frankly, if this amendment were passed it would deny a cash flow benefit to organisations that you are trying to assist.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-05-12,"—Minister, first of all, I have listened carefully to the wording you used in relation to how happy the organisations were. I noticed that you carefully chose your words when you said that `some' of the organisations have had `some' of their issues addressed, and then earlier you said they were much happier. It occurred to me, having listened to the hearings, that the word `devastated' could be a description of the feeling a number of the groups were expressing. Much happier than devastated still leaves you pretty unhappy, I would think. It is interesting, Minister, that you never have any problem spraying it all over the chamber when you have something in writing, so I assume that you do not actually have anything in writing to indicate how very happy the organisations are.
One of the reasons I can see behind the Democrats' amendment is to not require this ridiculous ping-pong game. The enormous compliance costs associated with the government paying someone's tax that they are going to ask for back is a ridiculous nonsense just so you can keep some kind of ideological purity to your scheme. The issue remains—and I think the issue behind the Democrats' amendment still remains—with the nonsense compliance costs which have not been addressed.
Can the minister guarantee, with all of this and how very happy the organisations are, what specific resources—and do not come to us with the $500 million, because we know how little that is going to do—are going to be available to these arts organisations to deal with the time, effort and compliance costs associated with this ridiculous tax ping-pong?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—We have had a long discussion on compliance issues and the net cost per registrant. I do not plan to revisit that.
Senator Margetts interjecting—
—We mentioned the net cost per registrant. The RIS, which is attached to the bill, looks at the registration issues, and I cannot add anything further on that particular matter.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-12,"—Minister, I am going to finish off my remarks on Democrats' amendment No. 1 simply by saying to you that I have been dealing with accrual accounting systems for 30 years. If there is a physical transfer of money from the government to an organisation, it would have to be at the gross level and not the net level to achieve the effect that you outline. You keep referring in your accrual remarks to the net consequence, not to the gross consequence.
Anyway, I want to move on from there. You have taken a broad process of opposition which I think focuses on amendment No. 1, but I want to ask you why you would oppose amendment 7. Amendment 7 simply provides a definition for cultural organisations. It says:
cultural organisation  has the meaning given by section 30-300 of the *ITAA 1997.
We know that there is certainty in the taxable community at present which arises from convention, custom, case law, definitions and rulings. What the cultural organisations are seeking is certainty within this legislation as to their definition—the way in which they are viewed by the tax commissioner.
To summarise, we think this gives them that certainty and understanding within an existing framework, one which they are familiar with and are comfortable with. I would like to understand why the government would oppose the definition we have proposed in amendment 7.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—We do not need to extend it. The activities of cultural organisations are already an enterprise for the purposes of the GST. It is well known in governments what a cultural organisation is. It is defined in rulings and other things, so we do not see any need for this amendment. We do not think it adds to certainty, and so we would be opposing it, Senator.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-12,"—Minister, are you saying it is inaccurate or that it is accurate and unnecessary?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—We think it is 
 redundant. We have defined it broadly and we do not see that this is necessary. It is redundant and on those grounds, therefore, we would not be supporting it.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—At 9-20 we define enterprises. Because a cultural organisation will fit under that particular clause, because it is a creditable enterprise, it is covered in that particular clause 9-20.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-12,"—On the same line of questioning, I read 9-20 but I cannot find `cultural organisation' spelt out there.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—It could also fit into D, I am subsequently advised, as well. We think that a charitable or cultural organisation would fit into any of those three.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-05-12,"—I would like to go back to a previous element of my original concerns in relation to the Democrats' amendment. Can I ask whether a sponsoring organisation, if they received acknowledgment but not necessarily advertising in lieu of their sponsorship, would still be able to qualify for tax deductibility?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—There is no change in the legislation to income tax deductibility. If you are an income tax deductible organisation, you remain an income tax deductible organisation. This legislation does not change that.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-05-12,"—I am talking about private sponsors, not tax deductible entities. I want to check whether a private business sponsoring a cultural organisation would be able to access tax deductibility if it could not show that there was a specific service—and this relates back to what Senator Ellison was saying; it was the intention of the Democrats' amendment—and whether it would be able to prove sufficiently to the Australian Taxation Office that that sponsorship was a business expense if there was not some sort of service that came back. If they simply got acknowledgment for their donation, would that be sufficient to enable them to access tax deductibility, or would there have to be some other service, such as advertising or other specific service, provided?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—That is an income tax act test. This does not alter it. If an activity is tax deductible now, it will be tax deductible whether this goes through or not. This does not change that aspect. We are talking about income tax law here.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-05-12,"—On that question of sponsorship, I wonder if the minister can respond to the criticisms that arts organisations had of the fact that $65 million comes to arts organisations—probably higher than that; that was 
 in 1993-94—in the form of sponsorship. Almost 60 per cent of that was from corporate sponsorship and, of that, 32 per cent was provided by finance and insurance businesses. Those are the companies under this legislation which would not be able to claim input credits. Our amendment would change that. I wonder if the minister can advise what they see to be a way in which those companies, those finance organisations, would not reduce their sponsorship contributions by that amount and why they think that the arts organisations can simply absorb the loss of 10 per cent on what is many millions of dollars currently flowing through to the arts community. Why not adjust that so that there is no GST paid by finance organisations and you do not get any decline in the sponsorship support of those groups to the arts?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—If organisations of the nature you have mentioned have to choose between sponsorship of a variety of organisations, we do not see that this biases that decision. The system is established. With some bodies—the financial ones you have mentioned—particular rules apply, but as far as their sponsorships are concerned, presumably if they make sponsorships now they will continue to want to make sponsorships in the future. This does not provide any bias against the arts or sport or any other organisation. They will obviously choose their priorities as to how they wish to sponsor organisations but we do not see that this will bias their decision.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-05-12,"—Perhaps the minister can explain why he thinks that is the case. We are talking here about somewhere between $15 million and $20 million. It is not a small amount. If those organisations are not able to claim any credit, why would they simply increase their sponsorship amounts by 10 per cent? What is the incentive for them to do that?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—I think it is probably worth just putting on the record that if you are an input tax body you do not get credits. I think that is well understood. The point I am making is that this does not bias their deci 
 sion between sponsorship or other forms of advertising. These organisations will wish to advertise. No-one claims that they will stop advertising. They advertise because they clearly see they get a benefit out of advertising, out of sponsorships. Therefore, the point I am making is that what we have in this case does not bias their decision against one of the issues you are running—cultural organisations. If they wish to sponsor sporting organisations or environmental organisations, then they will not get an input tax credit for that.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-05-12,"—Our amendment on sponsorship recognises that to remove a GST altogether from sponsorship might open the way for abuse of such a situation. For this reason we made it clear that payment in kind for services such as free tickets, hospitality and commercial advertising would continue to attract a GST. I would argue that this is a very reasonable position, because I do not think the minister has been able to satisfy us about the overall problem for organisations that have sponsors that it is not going to be that a GST will be paid by those organisations on that contribution. A bit like what the government is telling us about its grants to arts organisations, there is no certainty that they will be increased by that 10 per cent in order to cover them, so that the arts organisations at the end of the day will get 10 per cent less. This is the problem we face here. As I said, our amendment is a very reasonable one in terms of what would still be caught up, so abuse of the system would be dealt with. Arts organisations are very concerned about this. Perhaps the minister can tell the Senate what his more recent discussions with arts bodies resulted in in terms of whether or not, once they had it explained to them, they saw this as a benefit just like the question of government grants.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—The earlier discussion related to government grants. I think the Howard government grants worked. Once we explained that—at least from the experience of my Treasury officials—organisations had less concern about that. I do not argue that there is not a vigorous debate on the sponsorship issue. We do not happen to agree with 
 the position that is being put. I think the earlier debate related to how government grants worked. I think there was an agreement that we understood the principle. Then we looked through the security and the accounting. That was the issue I was raising in relation to arts organisations. I think there is still concern on the sponsorship issue—I do not deny that—but what I am saying is that we do not agree with the position that is being put. We think that where bodies wish to provide sponsorship, where they wish to seek to advertise their name, they will continue to wish to do that. In making that business decision, there is no bias against cultural bodies. After this legislation goes through, they will continue to have their own priorities and this will not bias their decision between sponsorship or advertising of particular bodies.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-12,"—Minister, the Democrats, frankly, are confused by the government. Here is a government which, through the Prime Minister, has initiated a proposal that has received considerable business support. Of course, they are almost sycophantic with this government but in this case it is an initiative worthy of support—that is, the Prime Minister's initiative, coupled with proposed tax concessions, to encourage charitable donations and community involvement by companies. Sponsorships to arts organisations and cultural organisations are exactly in that broad field and yet the government seeks to introduce a much harsher regime than is typical of other civilised Western democracies such as Canada which treat their sponsorship regime better than you intend to. I think there is a conflict in the way in which you are approaching this matter.
The Democrats proposal in item 10 draws on the evidence given to the committee. I am referring to the report of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee in March 1999. The Australia Council, for instance, told the committee that 11 per cent of Australian companies give $65 million to the arts. Other witnesses suggested that sponsorship volumes could fall by the propor 
 tion of GST levies on them. The committee concluded by saying that there were real grounds for concern about the impact of the new tax system on corporate sponsorship. It is corporate donations to charitable institutions which the government is seeking to promote. Why on earth would you seek to limit it for cultural organisations?
The effect of the Democrats' amendment, whilst it would have some revenue consequences for the government, is far more in line with the Prime Minister's initiative and his approach to the charitable side than your response to this amendment. It seems out of key to us. I predict that your government will be obliged to return to this because you will discover the unfortunate consequences of the policy that you are proposing. I am exceptionally disappointed that you can see no value whatsoever in any of those amendments.

[creditable purpose]
These amendments concern the export of financial supplies to a branch. Exports are GST free and input tax credits relating to exports are available even if the export is a supply that would otherwise be input taxed. These amendments seek to ensure that certain transfers made to an offshore branch give rise to an entitlement to input tax credits.
Under the provisions as they currently stand, a transfer of goods or services from a branch located in Australia to an offshore branch of that entity may not be entitled to GST-free export treatment because the transfer occurs within the same entity. There is no supply that is a GST-free export. In most cases this will not matter as no GST will be payable on the transfer and the entity will be entitled to claim its input tax credits.
However, if such a transfer is related to the provision of input tax to services, the entity would be disadvantaged as it would not claim a credit that would be available for a competing input tax entity for an export in a similar circumstance. This disadvantage could be overcome by separately registering the local and overseas branches of the entity. It is not appropriate to have a different treatment depending on whether or not an entity registers its branches. This request would allow input tax credits for transfers made to an offshore branch.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-05-12,"—It appears that these amendments make financial services that are exported to a branch of the same entity overseas GST free on the basis that the supply is an export—that is, a creditable acquisition—and therefore you could gain an input credit. This is supposed to fix up the anomaly that there would be different treatment of input tax supplies depending on whether the entity separately registers their branches.
I would like to ask the minister—and I am sure other people have separate questions as well—whether or not this leaves open the potential for double dipping, remembering that entities receive an advantage already by 
 registering as single entities. That is, all supplies between branches are outside the GST regime as they are transfers within an entity; consequently there can be significant compliance cost savings. It seems that large multinational financial firms are wanting to double-dip here. They want to be able to register and operate as single entities in order to cut down on compliance costs. But, if they win on compliance, as the situation currently stands they will lose the ability to claim input credits on the export of financial supplies to overseas branches.
Would it also potentially create a windfall? It seems clear that financial institutions will receive a windfall if they are able to claim input credits on interbranch transfers where they otherwise would not be able to. And what is the impact on cash flow? Financial institutions may receive significant cash flow advantages from this amendment. The Australian branch would be able to claim input credits as soon as the supply was made. I would like to get some answers to some of these questions and hear some of the responses. Maybe they will link in with what I have been asking.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-05-12,"—I have a couple of questions about the government's amendments. I preface my questions by saying these are amendments which the government is making to its own bill—there are 128 amendments to its own legislation—dealing with exports. I understand what the amendments propose to do, to the extent that they have been explained to the chamber.
In looking at this general area of services exports, let us look at a service that is exported offshore. For example, legal advice formulated in Australia exported by transmission to the New York office of the same law company is an export and therefore is GST free under the government's proposal. But in this whole area where we are dealing with the export of that sort of advice, I think there are loopholes in this legislation through which you could drive the Spirit of Progress. There are loopholes in this legislation that sly lawyers and sharp accountants can take 
 advantage of to escape the GST, while Australian battlers have to pay it.
I think there are loopholes in this legislation which mean that those who are wealthy, who have got discretionary income and who can afford to retain sharp lawyers and smart accountants can escape their obligations while wage earners who have to pay every red cent in tax for what they get in their wages—and will now, if a GST comes in, have to pay it at the counter when they buy goods or services—cannot escape it. This is an area in which, once again, this legislation favours those who are well off and penalises those who are not. It is not this loophole, particularly, that I think best demonstrates that. When we come to particular areas of the bill, I will take some time to explain where I think the government has left the door open for the big end of town and shut it in the face of Australian battlers.
—Try supporting some of our amendments.
—I take that interjection. I have explained the position of the Australian Labor Party. The position is simply, again, that we do not support a GST. A GST is not fair. It penalises people. We will not support a GST which is softened and therefore the degree of penalty is slightly less, but the penalty still remains. We want to throw this legislation out. At the end of the committee stage, we hope to obtain a majority vote in this chamber so to do.
—Then oppose the government amendments, too.
—What will be sitting before this chamber at the end of the committee stage is the bill that the government wants. The bill which this chamber will have to decide on is what the government wants, in all of its unfairness, resplendent in all of its differential treatment. But that is a matter for the debate as it progresses.
With regard to the matter that is before the chair at the moment, there is something that I do not understand. Maybe the minister can explain it; let me add it to the question asked by Senator Margetts, because she asked a question similar to something that concerns 
 me as well. If you are, say, an Australian bank, and you have an office, say, in New York, and you want some particular advice for your Australian operations and you have your New York office request that, and your Australian office sends the advice to New York, it is GST free under this amendment. The advice still is in the system and could be used in Australia, but the service, which is being taxed for the first time, is GST free. How do you counter confected arrangements where overseas subsidiaries of Australian operations seek advice, which they actually do want in Australia, for some sham reason for their overseas operations, escape the GST by deeming it to be an export but use that advice in Australia? That is the question I have for the minister.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—There were a number of questions from Senator Margetts and Senator Cook. Senator Margetts, you cannot take advantage of both the grouping provisions and the branching provisions. The advice I have received is that the two forms of registration are mutually exclusive—that is, there is no double dipping or no possibility of a windfall in that sense.	 The amendment simply provides equity for financial suppliers who are not separately registered for overseas branches. I think you made that point, but your concerns related to double dipping and windfalls.
Senator Cook raised an issue. Division 84 of the bill deals precisely with the issue which he raised. It taxes on reimportation. Senator Cook was worried that this might be a loophole. We believe that division 84 of the bill covers the precise concerns that Senator Cook raised.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-12,"—As I understand it, these four amendments expand the ability to deal with exports. Division 11 deals with an entitlement to input tax credits. An entitlement arises essentially where an entity makes a creditable acquisition. The basis of a creditable acquisition is the acquisition of anything solely or partly for a creditable purpose. Something is acquired for a creditable purpose if it is acquired in carrying on your enterprise, as in 
 clause 11-15 on page 22 of the bill. The acquisition is not for a creditable purpose if it relates to making supplies that are input taxed or if the acquisition is of a private or domestic nature.
Amendment No. 4 amends clause 11-15 to make it clear that acquisitions in relation to the making of financial supplies through an enterprise that a person carries on outside Australia are not treated as relating to the making of supplies that are input taxed. The explanatory memorandum provides that the reason for the amendment is that, if an entity that operates its branches acquires something through a branch in Australia and transfers it to a branch outside Australia, that transfer is akin to an export. Exports are GST free and these types of acquisitions should also be GST free, even if they would otherwise be input taxed.
The bill does not currently treat such transfers to overseas branches as exports because it is a supply entirely within an entity. This amendment will mean that these acquisitions are for a creditable purpose so that, even if the transaction occurs entirely within one entity, the entity will be entitled to an input tax credit for the acquisition. Your amendment No. 6 makes the same amendment in relation to creditable importations and for the same reason. Your amendment No. 56 makes the same amendment in relation to creditable acquisitions that are pre-establishment acquisitions and creditable importations that are pre-establishment importations which occur before a company comes into existence. Amendment No. 74 makes the same amendment in relation to adjustments for acquisitions and importations.
I am interested in a number of things here. It is always useful to know who has asked for these changes in legislation. We gather, from the reference to financial suppliers and branches, that it would be banks. That would be appropriate, but we wish to know whether it would benefit any other kinds of financial institutions at large or if there would be any limitations to only one kind of financial institution. My assumption is that it is global: in other words, anyone who falls within the 
 definition of a financial services provider would benefit.
The second question I have relates to a principle. It seems to me that in approaching this in this manner you are opening the door to our own later amendment to make inbound tourism GST free. What you are saying is that an effective export should be treated as such. That is what you have done here. You have said that, when you move funds from one branch to a branch outside Australia, it is an effective export and it should be treated as such. We would agree with that principle, but why would you make a distinction between the effective exports which are attached to inbound tourism packages?
The third question I have to ask is: in what instances would pre-establishment acquisitions or importations occur for financial institutions rather than other industries as a whole? I can clearly see it might happen with, say, a mining venture or something of that sort. But I would find it difficult to envisage a financial supplies provider not being incorporated first, because you have licensing and capital adequacy provisions and all sorts of other rules and regulations to follow before you can get registered.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—In relation to who raised the issue, the International Banking and Securities Association did through the consultation process for applying the GST to financial services. Your second question was: is it global? Yes—anyone who falls within that definition of supplies too. With regard to inbound tourism, I guess we are going to have that debate a bit later on. I appreciate your flagging it and will look forward to that debate. One is onshore and one is offshore, so I think we can have a good debate on that. I am not sure that it establishes the principle you are seeking here. In relation to the last question you raised, there is no special treatment here for pre-establishment costs. The bill generally allows credits for pre-establishment costs.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-05-12,"—I am sure Senator Murray has some follow-up questions, but I will ask for further clarification of the responses the 
 minister gave to me in the meantime. In relation to my questions on double dipping, I am not sure that your response actually dealt with what we asked. We know that it is possible for organisations to register as one entity, but what we are suggesting is that organisations can reduce their compliance cost by registering as one entity but can also claim input credits at the same time. Is that not the case? We were not talking about the grouping provisions; we were talking about the ability to gain benefit in more than one way as a result of this amendment.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—This gives genuine exports credit. We do not want to bias the entity structure. I discussed with you the grouping provisions and the branching provisions, and there are two sorts of registrations that are mutually exclusive. We do not see that this is a problem. You have put the question to us but it is not one that we feel will lead to what you are concerned about in the area of double dipping or whatever.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-05-12,"—I recall being on the inquiry to look at Australia's service exports. One of the things that came through clearest of anything was that we actually have very little idea about the range, extent and even revenue flow involved in Australia's service exports. It is one of those difficult things. We also know that within and between companies it is almost impossible. I know from the Greens (WA) point of view and from some of the responses from the Australian Democrats that the situation of transfer pricing—the slippery situation of transfer pricing—shows how easy it is for companies to be able to reduce their costs, their taxation requirements and so on in and between entities, especially when you have something that is not solid like a solid export. So you have not actually addressed our problem. We know you have not done much modelling on this, but have you any idea of the costing on what the potential is for loss of revenue as a result of this amendment?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—This was the government's intention. Clearly the bill, on consultation, did not meet what was the 
 government's intention. We have clarified the bill so that there is no cost to the forward estimates as a result of this. On transfer pricing, I think that is a different issue. It is an issue that the tax office is very much aware of. There has been a great deal of work done in recent years on this issue. There are a whole range of compliance requirements for countries. Transfer pricing is a serious issue but it is one that the tax office is particularly aware of and is addressing.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-12,"—Minister, in relation to my question, I understood your short answers but I thought they were inadequate. I return to two of my questions. Firstly, in what respect does this principle of acknowledging an anomaly in the act and moving to allow the provision of services to be export classified, whereas formerly they were not, differ from inbound tourism? In both cases you have a good which is used in Australia but has an interaction with a foreign branch or a foreign sales office. The second area in which I thought your response was very short was on the pre-establishment importations and acquisitions area. Perhaps you could expand a little on that reply for me to satisfy me as to that.
I want to move on to a further area. It is fashionable, and rightly so, for there to be a great deal of government, parliamentary, business and community interest in the area of electronic commerce. The banks and financial institutions have been up to their necks in electronic commerce for decades. They are the pre-eminent users of electronic commerce by virtue of the nature of the transactions they conduct. It really relates to the revenue question of Senator Margetts. Are these amendments in a sense motivated by an inevitable difficulty in seeking to tax in any way the electronic commerce transactions that arise at an instantaneous rate between financial institutions, both offshore and onshore? Are you merely accepting reality by introducing this, or is this in fact a motivational device which will have the effect of enhancing, improving and increasing Australia's ability to be a financial services centre? The heart of my question is: is this reactive, just accepting the facts of the world and the 
 difficulties of dealing with electronic commerce, or is this proactive, designed to improve and increase the export potential of the industries affected?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-05-12,"—While you are taking that question, Minister, I thought I would explore one step further the question I asked you earlier. You referred me to section 84 of the bill. I have looked at that section again and I have looked at the explanatory memorandum dealing with the section. On the basis of seeing your point of view on that, though, can I go back to my example. You have an American company in Australia that wishes to buy an Australian company and would normally go to an Australian lawyer to seek legal advice on how best to do that. To avoid the GST, it requests the advice of the subsidiary of the Australian law firm in New York from its New York office. So the Australian law firm in Australia provides the advice to its New York office and thus it does not pay a GST. The New York office provides to the American parent in New York that advice, the New York parent company supplies to its American subsidiary in Australia that advice, and they therefore act on it. Looking at this section, essentially you say that they will get caught. My question is: how?
To take another example, an Australian bank is asked by its New York subsidiary for some advice. It provides that. That is a service and that is taxable, but it goes overseas and it is deemed an export, so it is not taxable. It provides the advice to the New York subsidiary of the Australian bank and that bank turns the advice around and sends it back to Australia to one of the Australian clients of that bank. Under this section, that ought to then attract GST, and that is what the section of the bill says. But the same question arises: how? How will the tax office know that this has occurred to be able to identify the transaction and tax it? How will the tax office have that degree of penetration of these types of arrangements which can, as Senator Murray indicated, go over the Internet in the flash of an eye and occur at a million miles an hour every day, every second of 
 every day? What capacity does the Australian Taxation Office have to detect that and prevent it from being a way in which the big end of town can avoid paying tax once again?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—There are a number of questions there and I will deal with them. I am always happy to expand, but I am exceedingly conscious that we have been in this debate now for approaching 40 hours and we have a long road to travel. Whereas I do not seek to deny any information to the—
—It is a very important tax package.
—It is a very important tax package and we will certainly beat the world record as far as the Federation is concerned for the length of time it is debated, but it is on all of us to see how we can deal with this in as expeditious a manner as possible.
On the tourism issue, I think we should deal with that when your tourism amendment comes up. We will have a long debate on tourism and we should deal with that issue when that occurs.
—What is the principle?
—One is onshore and one is offshore. To me there is a clear difference. All I am saying is: let us deal with that when we come to it. We can run this debate then. It makes sense to do it in that context.
Your second question was on pre-establishment costs. Pre-establishment costs rules in division 60 allow a person to claim input tax credits for purchases they make in starting a business. This rule is needed because these purchases are often made before, for example, a company is incorporated. The amendments allow the same treatment for financial suppliers. They are making financial suppliers consistent with the rest of the bill. There is not a special deal for financial suppliers.
You raised an interesting issue on the difficulties of dealing with electronic commerce. A great deal of work is being done—as you would be aware as you have an interest in this—in the OECD and in other areas looking at the whole issue of electronic commerce. The motivation for this was to actually 
 give effect to the intention of the bill and to improve the drafting arrangements. Of course, exports are treated favourably under the bill and that is what we seek to achieve.
In relation to Senator Cook's issue, and it is an interesting question, the advice I have is that 84-15(c) covers the situation that you raise. The advice to be given to Australia is a taxable transfer. You asked: how? Normal audit procedures. Companies are subject to normal audit procedures. I understand that it is not dissimilar—without pushing the analogy too far—to dealing with transfer pricing within the same companies. What is required there are the audit procedures and steps that the Australian Taxation Office takes. We believe we have covered the situation that you have raised.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-12,"—Minister, your answers have not satisfied me. Perhaps I have not made myself clear enough. I really wish to know whether this is one of three possibilities: are you merely correcting an anomaly and according with the principle of making exports GST free; were you reacting to a situation where it may be impossible for you to deal with these kinds of transactions any other way simply because you cannot police electronic commerce transactions in the financial supplies area; or were you encouraging a proactive regime of the kind that was announced by the Treasurer last night where the government is seeking to promote the financial services sector, and this measure would contribute to that?
My other question related to the pre-establishment acquisitions and pre-establishment importations. I do not know if it is appropriate for the finance industry. Both the previous government and this government have adopted—properly, I think—a regime of very tight and very close regulation of financial institutions because of the important part they play in the Australian economy. It is only when they are incorporated that they can be appropriately regulated by APRA and that they have the appropriate licences, appropriate capital adequacy provisions and all the other protections which are essential in the proper management of prudential regulation. That is 
 why I asked whether the pre-establishment acquisitions and pre-establishment importations put the community at any risk if they apply to financial institutions. I cannot envisage a situation where a financial institution would get into that situation. I would imagine that they would have to be incorporated first. I just do not know whether this opens up any regulatory loopholes, if you like. It was not an idle question; it went to the probity of your regulatory system, which could be breached through this.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—We do not see that this leads to a loophole in the regulatory arrangements. It applies to anyone who makes a taxable supply and that may well apply to a corporate company rather than a bank. All we are trying to do here is provide amendments to allow for the same treatment of financial supplies. We are simply trying to make the bill consistent. We are bringing it into line with other treatment in the bill. We do not see that there is a regulatory issue involved here. We have a great deal of measures, as you say, to make sure financial institutions are appropriately prudentially supervised.
I thought I answered your question. You gave me a number of options. The answer is that we are trying to correct an anomaly in the bill in relation to a service which is clearly an export service. I think that was the second of your three options.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1999-05-12,"—Senator Kemp, I do take your point that the inbound tourism issue is for a later debate. I did have a series of questions on that which I will defer to a later time. There is just one, and if you could perhaps address this that would reassure me and I need not go on with the questions I was going to ask.
In terms of inbound tourism, I do hope that you can give us the assurance that you will examine the principle which is being established now. I must say that your answer that the difference is between onshore and offshore transactions does not really take me anywhere. The principle being established for the relief of financial institutions through this amendment seems to me to be a principle 
 that, as Senator Murray has said, flows on exactly to inbound tourism. If you can give me an assurance that you will go back and examine that principle in relation to inbound tourism, we can have the debate later.
The problem I have with your reference to onshore and offshore transactions is that, as Senator Cook said before, many of the transactions take place in cyberspace. I am not sure whether that is onshore or offshore. It is almost like saying, `Where is it?' That reminds me of another debate that I have been involved in for many years about where is heaven and where is hell, but that is a debate for another place. It is perhaps a theological rather than an economic debate.
If these transactions are taking place in cyberspace, I am not sure whether they are onshore or offshore. Although I am prepared to leave the inbound tourism issue for the later debate, you can see why I would like an assurance that you will re-examine the principle being established. In my mind, it really does apply.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—I will give you the assurance that it is clear that we are going to have a debate on inbound tourism. I will be responding at that time.

[bad debts]
These amendments deal with bad debts. Before an adjustment to reduce the GST payable can be claimed for a bad debt, the bill currently requires that businesses notify the purchaser that the debt has been written off. The government is persuaded that this 
 will not be possible in many cases. These amendments therefore propose that there be an amendment to remove the requirement to notify the debtor and, further, to allow an automatic decreasing adjustment after 12 months or such earlier time as the debt is written off.
It is important to note that the approach taken in these proposals reflects the need imposed by the constitution for symmetry of treatment between the decreasing adjustment for the vendor and the increasing adjustment for the purchaser. This will ensure that the measure does not have the effect of inadvertently imposing a tax.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-05-12,"—The Greens (WA) do not have any particular problems with this amendment, but it removes the requirement to notify a recipient of supply that you have written off their bad debt because it is undesirable from a commercial point of view. Rather, these amendments provide for a decreasing adjustment where the whole or part of the debt has been due for 12 months or more, if you have not already written off the debt. As I said, it seems to be a reasonable amendment with enough flexibility to account for the situation of bad debts. The issue of commercial reality seems to be a real practical concern.
However, the question that springs to mind—and it was brought up in the whole process of the various committees—is why some groups have access on what they consider to be reasonable problems but others do not. We have just gone through this debate concerning cultural and other organisations, environment groups and so on. Why is it that real problems are recognised by the government if they happen to be specific financial institutions or elements of industry but those of other groups are not? Why do those groups get a guernsey but others do not?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—I have made it clear on a number of occasions that the legislation has been on the table for a considerable period of time. There has been widespread consultation. In the end, the government makes a judgment on the submissions which are made to it. Clearly, in some cases, we 
 accept the views which are put to us; in other cases, we do not. It is not correct to say that we ignore other organisations. There are amendments that I have put down that assist charities with things like raffles and bingo, which were important issues that were raised. It is a judgment that, appropriately, the government makes. After all, it is the government's legislation. The government has listened to people and, as a result, has proposed a range of amendments.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-12,"—This set of amendments says that when bad debts are written off there is decreasing adjustment, that is, the GST is reduced by one-eleventh of the amount written off—clause 21-5. Correspondingly, if the amount written off is subsequently recovered, the GST owed is increased by one-eleventh of the amount recovered—clause 21-10. Items 9, 10, 11 and 13 to 18 amend the summary of the division—clause 21-5 to 21-20—to reflect that, in addition to these adjustments being made when amounts are written off, they are also to be made where the debt is outstanding for 12 months. Item 12 amends clause 21-5 to omit the requirement to notify the debtor when his or her debt is written off.
Your amendments are clearly understood. The question I have relates to the issue of recovering amounts. As I understand it, how amounts are to be recovered is not spelt out in this legislation; it is spelt out in normal tax legislation. It is the Commissioner of Taxation who can authorise an officer—and `an officer' is defined in the tax act—to recover those amounts. Is that so, or is the tax commissioner able to subcontract the recovery of bad debts to debt recovery companies and that sort of thing?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—This is essentially an adjustment to your net amount. I do not think we establish any new principle here. These principles are well established. Debt recovery arrangements are also well known. So I assure you, we are not striking out into dangerous new territory here, apart from the obvious thing—that we are dealing with a broad based consumption tax.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-12,"—The problem I have is that this issue was raised this morning at the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I would be reluctant to let the opportunity pass because there is an issue of real concern here. What was raised at that committee this morning, which will come out in their report later, had been raised in previous reports. It relates to the issues under section 66 of this bill which concern the fact that the authorised officer, for purposes of debt collection and for other purposes, means `A person the commissioner has authorised to exercise powers or perform functions.'
I would be very glad if Senator Coonan, who was present at this discussion, participates in this debate. `Person' is defined on page 268, section 195(1) where it says that `person' includes a company. This is why I am taking the opportunity raised by your amendments to this section to ask whether there is any danger of the tax commissioner, either now or in the future, subcontracting or contracting out the recovery of amounts previously written off, or bad debts, to a debt collecting company which in turn could use an agent to act on those issues? It would be of concern if the authorised officer was not a person appropriately trained and judged by the commissioner to have the qualifications and abilities to conduct this exercise. It may be, once the Scrutiny of Bills report is tabled later today, that your department or your ministry may choose to examine those issues and come back to them. I was afraid we may go past this section and then have difficulty coming back with an appropriate amendment.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—This does not have anything to do with collection or contracting out. We are looking at how adjustments are made. I have not seen the matter that you have raised. The way it has been explained to me, it seems that it is not clear that this deals precisely with what this amendment is seeking to do. It seems to be a wider, contracting out issue—we would all have views on contracting out. Bad debts are recovered by business in the normal way. The tax office does not collect debts that are owed to businesses. The 
 authorised officer issue you raise does not relate to this particular amendment.
Senator, as you have raised the scrutiny of bills issue in this chamber, I will bring it to the attention of my officers, but it does not seem, at least in the way it has been explained to me, that this deals with the issue which is before us now.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-12,"—Minister, you are quite correct: I have opportunistically jumped in.
—You weren't wasting time, were you?
—No. I have opportunistically jumped on a section which does not deal with the precise issue I raised. You are quite correct: this is an adjustment mechanism that we are dealing with. My purpose in doing so, since we are right in the middle of the debate and the report will only come down later, was to find an opportunity to alert you and your advisers to a problem which we think is easily fixed. Senator Coonan—who is sitting behind you—certainly understands it very well. I would appreciate it if you took the concerns of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills to heart and perhaps responded as rapidly as possibly, preferably with amendments. That is all I have to say on that issue at present.
—The question is that amendments 9 to 18 be agreed to.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
—We will now move to opposition amendment No. 1 on sheet 1327.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1

[GST transparency]
I have said in this debate that essentially we will allow the government to modify its bills in order that the community of Australia can clearly see exactly what the government wants this GST to do. We will in effect not be moving any amendments to the bills, and we will not support other amendments to the bills; therefore we expect this chamber to defeat the legislation at the end of the committee stage.
We have moved this amendment not on the basis that if the chamber accepts it we would find the bill therefore acceptable and would vote for it at the end of the committee stage, but rather to point out the absolute hypocrisy of the government's position on the GST. The government has campaigned around this country, designating the wholesale sales tax as a hidden tax. The cat was let out of the bag by the Treasurer on Perth radio in June of last year, when he said that the GST will be embedded in the final price.
All of us remember the propaganda sent to every home in this country by the Treasurer, Mr Costello, attacking the wholesale sales tax. What did that propaganda say? In his newsletter, Mr Costello—the Treasurer, the member for Higgins—said, `This newsletter reveals the unfair, hidden and complex tax you already pay every day of your lives' and `Who knows what taxes they are paying? Wherever you go there are hidden taxes.' That was part of the orchestrated campaign by this government, led by the Treasurer, supported by other members of the coalition, to pretend that the wholesale sales tax was somehow an evil tax.
It is not possible to show, on a price tag or at the cash register, the level of the wholesale sales tax, but it is possible to show the level of the GST. This amendment proposes that the receipt given to the consumer at the cash register show how much the good or the service cost and how much tax the consumer is paying on that good or service. For the 
 government to designate the wholesale sales tax as a hidden tax and then not move to expose the real level of the GST is, in my view and in the view of most Australians, absolute hypocrisy—and this amendment will demonstrate that.
Let me turn to the fundamental questions of tax reform. We are not debating a package of tax reform measures in this chamber; we are debating a GST. That is something different. That is a regressive tax. Underlying tax reform are the principles of equity, efficiency and simplicity. They are the principles that most people agree should be the basis for constructing a taxation system. But, in modern-day debate, a fourth principle has been added: transparency. I need go no further than the submission of the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to the inquiry of the Senate Select Committee on A New Tax System to demonstrate the point. I think it is an excellent submission, well researched and capably presented by the WACCI—one I do not agree with in its final purpose but nonetheless an excellent submission. In the second chapter they go to the question of tax reform principles, and they say this:
A tax structure should have four key characteristics. (1) it should be transparent so that it is readily apparent to both taxpayers and those meeting the real costs of taxation that they are paying tax and how much they are paying.
The other principles they enunciate are an equity principle, an efficiency principle and a principle that tax ought to adequately meet the needs of government expenditure.
On transparency, which is dot point 2.1, they say:
Because people don't like paying taxes, there is an incentive for governments to disguise from taxpayers how much they are actually paying.
Later in the submission they say:
It makes the tax system more transparent by shifting the tax burden from invisible taxes to visible taxes.
Coming to a concluding part of this chapter, they say again:
These processes can in turn only be properly informed if the first principle discussed in this section, that of transparency of the tax system so 
 that taxpayers know how much they are actually paying, is achieved.
In the hearing in Western Australia, the chamber appeared before the select committee and capably argued its brief. Ms Nicola Cusworth, the economist of the chamber—and, I think, an impressive person in her own right—was asked this question by Senator Conroy:
You have argued very strongly about transparency and the need for transparency. Do you believe the GST rates should be displayed on retail dockets?
Ms Cusworth replied, `Yes'. There is no qualification. She simply said, `yes'. The Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry is part of the Business Coalition for Tax Reform, and they hold that view. I expect therefore that there will be a willingness by every coalition senator from Western Australia to support the views of their own state organisation in the commercial and business area on this matter. I think the question of transparency is properly answered on the principles, at least in that submission from the WACCI.
But let me go to another matter. In a question to the Treasurer in the House of Representatives last year, Mr Crean asked Mr Costello:
What is the GST component of a grocery bill of $138.70?
A simple enough question. The Treasurer declined to answer. The Treasurer, on his feet in a situation like that, could not divide $138.70 by 11 to find out what the GST component was. It is not as simple as the government pretends. If the Treasurer cannot do it, how can mum at a checkout with three screaming kids try to work out how much tax she has to pay on her grocery bill? Why should she have to do it? When we get our income slip—our salary sheet—on there is how much the gross income is, how much tax we pay and what our net income is. We know how much tax we pay on wages and salaries. Why then will the government not allow us to know how much tax we will pay on our purchases of goods and services at the checkout if a GST goes through? This amendment would enable at least that to be transparent.
If anyone says this will be organisationally difficult, I have a copy of a number of receipts from checkouts in Canada. They have a GST in Canada. On the first one of these receipts—the John Todd Trading Company of Alpine Road, Sunpeaks, British Colombia—it says that the purchase of the goods came to $79.90, there was a PST of $5.59 and the total price paid by the consumer was $91.08 and it showed that it was paid by a Visa card. That is at the checkout. When you line up and go through, it says on the receipt given to the consumer what the GST component is.
If this amendment was adopted and if this law came into place, Australians would at least know at the checkout how much tax they are paying to the government on the goods and services that they purchase. It can be done. It is done in Canada. I will seek leave later to table this document to show that it does work, it is effective. Canada is not the only place where it happens; it happens elsewhere in the world as well. So let us not have any argument from the government in this debate that it cannot be done. It is done elsewhere in the world and it could be done if necessary in Australia.
The other thing that would be important about this is that, by having to show it on the customer receipt at the checkout, it would deter unscrupulous businesses from inflating their prices and blaming the higher cost on the GST, therefore hiding the real impact of what this tax on consumers would be. I know what the reply from the government on this score will be: `But we've got the ACCC and we've got maximum penalties for anyone caught'—and I emphasise the word `caught'—`offending against this law. We don't have adequate resources to police it, but if perchance by happenstance or good luck we catch someone out, they will go for a row because we've got big penalties.' That is what is meant to deter unscrupulous practitioners from artificially inflating their prices and blaming it on the GST. If you show it on the docket they cannot do that, and that is another good reason this should be shown on the docket.
In the evidence before the Senate select committee on this point, Mr Hank Spier of 
 the ACCC said, `But there are 18 million people policing the impact of the GST.' But they are very ineffective police if they are like the Treasurer of this nation and cannot work out, by dividing their total cost by 11 on the spot at the checkout, how much they are being slugged by a tax. They are ineffective if the information is not in the hands of consumers in order for them to be able to work out and know exactly what the actual cost will be.
The government opposed this in the House of Representatives. Transparency, as I said, is a problem for the WST; it is not a problem for the GST. In the Hansard we will see—because we intend to divide on this matter if it is not agreed by the government—the names of every senator in this place who wants to slug people with a GST but hide from public gaze the cost of what a GST will be to the Australian community.
I now turn to the explanatory memorandum. I believe this issue is an important issue. This is an issue that ordinary Australians understand and want to see happen if they have to put up with a GST. In the explanatory memorandum—a memorandum of nearly 1,000 pages—there are only five words on this matter: `Displayed prices will include GST.' That is all it says. There is no debate, no justification of an indefensible position, just five cynical words. As well in the explanatory memorandum there is an example. The example is Big Ben's Clocks of 12 Grandfathers Road, Cuckooville. You just wonder who the cuckoo is who thought that up as an example and trotted it out as a way of disguising from Australian consumers the knowledge they need, if there is a GST, to work out what the value of that GST is.
I do not know what the government is frightened of. This is a simple change, a reasonable change, an appropriate change and a change an enlightened tax system should enact. This is a change that the WACCI—an employer body—says should occur. Remember the Cusworth answer to the question? Simply, `yes'—an unqualified, `Yes, it should'. We know how much tax we pay on our salaries. Why can we not know how 
 much tax we pay on our purchases if there is a GST?
I conclude by saying that we do not want a GST. We will be voting against this bill at the end of the day. This is an exercise for us to just flush out the government hypocrisy on this matter, and I would be very interested, Minister, if maybe you would actually take a principled stand and support the amendment.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—Talk about hypocrisy! It is absolutely breathtaking to sit here and listen to Senator Cook carry on about this amendment. I am not aware that it is Labor Party policy to make sure that the wholesale sales tax is exposed on receipts. I do not think it is and, of course, it is not. Of course there are multiple rates. It would be of great interest, I suspect, if you were prepared to propose that and give some substance to the comments you have made. It is simply not your policy, and it is not your policy in relation to excises.
To get up and demand this amendment when you yourself have no policy in relation to your own tax system on this—which you would not be prepared to do, Senator Cook—is breathtaking hypocrisy. From time to time we throw those words around the chamber, but this rates right up there, I can tell you, as an act of hypocrisy on your part. It is interesting that the Labor Party are moving an amendment. They are all over the place on whether they are going to move amendments or not move amendments or whether they are going support the government's position or reject other amendments.
Let me make it clear that the government opposes this request. It is unnecessary, it would make the GST more complex, and it would add to compliance costs. There has been a lot of discussion on compliance costs in this debate to date, and there is no doubt, in my view and in the view of people in the industry, that this would add significantly to compliance costs.
As to the level of transparency, I believe that people understand that there will be a 10 per cent GST. People understand that it will be applied on a broad base. Of course, unlike with the wholesale sales tax where there are multiple rates, Senator Cook is demanding a 
 level of transparency that has never been present under the wholesale sales tax system and that has never been required under that system.
Let me make it clear: requiring businesses to itemise the amount of GST paid would lead to greater compliance costs of businesses by forcing them to unnecessarily increase the information contained in displayed prices and also to adapt cash register equipment to print out three amounts for every item sold. Even if the proposed changes were to apply only to subtotals and not to each item, separate receipts would need to be issued for GST free or input taxed items. This is an attempt by the Labor Party to cause serious compliance problems in the industry. It is a principle they are not prepared to apply to their own tax system. They are simply not prepared to do it.
This principle is so important to the Labor Party that you will not adopt it as your own policy because you recognise its compliance problems. You recognise that the small business sector would be appalled by the additional cost of what you are requiring, and that is why you are not proposing it for your own system. But you are proposing it for the government proposal before this chamber.
I understand that there has been some recent discussion in, for example, the Australian Retailers Association about this issue. My understanding is that they have not come to a formal position. One of the views they may have put publicly initially was that they believed that the GST should be visible in pricing, and I am advised that the Australian Retailers Association are likely to change their view, and I have the permission of the relevant individual to make this clear. Among other things, they say:
Some consumer research by one of our members has indicated that a large majority of customers would prefer to have the GST embedded in the price.
—Oh, yes!
—I am quoting what these people are saying. They say:
Further checking of the various software by retailers indicates there would be additional compliance issues if they were required to show GST and price on dockets. In the case of smaller retailers, many 
 have not got the necessary software and would have to perform the price-GST split by hand. Major retailers indicate that they would not have the systems in place to provide such information by the scheduled date without additional costs.
The individual argues that the government's proposal has a degree of simplicity and minimises compliance costs. We believe that you are attempting to impose additional costs on business and we believe that consumers understand the system which is in place—they certainly will understand it better than they understand the Labor Party's system. The Labor Party has suddenly moved into this debate with an amendment and a principle which they are not prepared to apply to their own preferred tax system.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1999-05-12,"—I have listened carefully to this debate, and it is certainly an interesting one. The position that the Democrats will adopt towards this amendment will be put by Senator Murray in due course, but there are a couple of points that have been made that ought to be addressed. I really want to address the Labor Party first of all and I have some questions for Senator Cook about this amendment, because it is an important amendment.
As Senator Kemp inferred, one wonders why there is an amendment at this stage, when the Labor Party is not supporting any other amendments. One needs to ask why this amendment is so critical, given the fact that the Labor Party is now voting against other amendments which I thought had far more substance and were far more critical for the people of Australia than whether people wanted to know if the price contained a GST and what that particular part of the price was.
Senator Cook mentioned hypocrisy. I always thought that hypocrisy was saying one thing and doing the opposite. I do not think that I would want to accuse the government of hypocrisy and I do not want to accuse the Labor Party of hypocrisy at this stage. But if we are trying to apportion hypocrisy to one or the other or to the Democrats or to anybody, let us be sure that we take the definition and apply it accurately. Saying one thing and doing the opposite: in this debate, we have to ask who is doing that.
Really this is a political amendment by the Labor Party. That is what it is about. It is a political decision on the part of the government not to show the GST because that will be to the advantage of the government if the package passes and a GST is imposed. I would not want to be a government either that allowed the GST to be shown on every docket at a checkout. I can imagine the kind of resistance that that would build up in the mind of purchasers over a period of time, and one can imagine that after a period of time it would become quite an irritant for people.
On the other hand, it is obviously a political amendment that the Labor Party is keen to have passed, because the Labor Party would see this amendment as advantaging it in any subsequent election campaign. If the continual showing of the GST on a docket becomes for people a part of the election campaign, then I would imagine that it will be to the advantage of the Labor Party for that to be shown. But I really do not think this amendment is about hypocrisy on one side or the other; it is really about who is going to win the political campaign at the next election. What the Labor Party is trying to do is steal a march, if you like, on the government—
—Win government. Shame on us!
—I see. That was not your motivation at all, Senator Conroy. I guess it is because I have become cynical after six years in this place that I look for political motives.
—You're a politician. You are supposed to be political.
—I mean party political motives. There is a difference, Senator Sherry, between—
—Order! Can I have less interjection from my left. And would you address your remarks through the chair, Senator Woodley. I know you are under severe provocation.
—I apologise, Chair. There is a difference between politics and party politics. In the church I got into this debate all the time. Politics is what we are 
 about; it is about life. Party politics is something different. Perhaps I need not go any further along that line.
It really is the beginning of the campaign. If this package is passed and a GST is applied to many of the items which would be bought, ticketed and docketed at the checkout, the political campaign will begin with that very act. The Labor Party, I am sure, would make darn sure that everybody knew that the docket they received at the checkout was in fact part of the campaign.
I was interested in the reference to Canada by Senator Cook. I guess this is what really made me become a little cynical. He gave the example of Canadian checkout dockets. He would know, as I know, that in Canada the election following the introduction of a GST saw the party which introduced the GST reduced to two seats or a handful of seats, and they sure lost government. I can see that, given that illustration by Senator Cook, he is pointing to the purpose of this amendment, and that is that the Labor Party really believes that an election following the imposition of a GST would be one that they would be hopeful of winning. This amendment is not only about transparency—it is about that; you were very eloquent at that point, Senator Cook, and I do not discount that transparency is important—but it is also about politics and the political advantage that will accrue to the Labor Party if this amendment gets up and the package is passed.
—And the Democrats.
—Senator Murray is going to give you some indication of the Democrats' position. The question I have for Senator Cook, however, is about the statement he made that the information that his amendment would supply is information that Australian consumers need. I think I am quoting you accurately, Senator Cook. My question is: how do you know? Did the Labor Party do a survey of consumers in order to ascertain whether they wanted this information? Most consumers, I think, only want to know what the final price is. I had experience of this in the 1980s when I visited the United States. In some of the States they do have a GST or a consumer— 
—It is a retail tax.
—A retail tax, okay. Thank you, Senator Sherry. I must say that Senator Sherry is always accurate in these things so I accept his interjection, because it is helpful. What is it again? A retail—
—A retail tax—in some States.
—But what I found was that when we went around we would seek to buy an item, say, in a restaurant and we would ascertain the price from the menu et cetera, and then we would get the bill and find that the price was different because there was this retail tax added on. That nearly drove us crazy, because we never knew how much money we would need. We would try to estimate that when going into a restaurant perhaps. I was a bit short of money in those days—I was not a parliamentarian and was on significantly less salary than I am now—so as we travelled around on an extended visit we did need to know how much we were spending. The critical thing was not what the price was and then to be told there was an additional retail tax; what we really needed to know was the final price. It nearly drove us mad trying to deal with that issue.
Senator Cook, have you done a survey of consumers? I wonder if you could tell us something about the results of that survey. You also said that the wholesale sales tax was embedded in the system and you really could not separate that out and have that on a docket. You made that assertion. I think you need to justify it to us. I think Senator Kemp was rightly a little indignant at that point, because he said, `It is okay to assert that you can't do it with your system but you want to do it with the government's system.' So I think you should justify your assertion that a wholesale sales tax could not be included on a docket. There probably are good reasons. We would like to hear them.
Senator Kemp, just to finish, I do not think the Labor Party is trying to increase the compliance problems. Perhaps the result is that but I am sure that is not their motivation. I would like to defend Senator Cook at this point because I do not think it is about that. It is about politics, pure and simple. I wonder 
 if Senator Cook might address those couple of questions.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-05-12,"—Willingly. I will do it briefly because I know some of my colleagues wish to speak. Firstly, on the question of hypocrisy, I chose the word hypocrisy deliberately. I used it with reference to this government explicitly. I did so because, by my definition, hypocrisy is saying one thing and doing another. The example here is that the Treasurer of Australia authorised a leaflet to go to every Australian letterbox, attacking the wholesale sales tax as a `hidden tax'. One of the so-called shocking things in the Treasurer's view about the wholesale sales tax is that, to quote him, it is a `hidden tax'. One of the disgusting things in the Treasurer's view about the wholesale sales tax is that, to quote him, it is a `hidden tax'. One of the reprehensible things in the Treasurer's view about the wholesale sales tax is that, to quote him, it is a `hidden tax'. The government, at expense to the taxpayers, put this leaflet in every letterbox in Australia saying, `The tax system is crook and we need a GST.'
Labor does not believe we need a GST. Labor believes we can have tax reform in this country without a GST and that things need to be done to improve the current tax system. But the government campaigned on the basis that one of the problems with the wholesale sales tax was that it was a hidden tax. They did not do it just once, or flippantly; they did it many times—with propaganda and deliberately. When the GST comes along, what do we find? It is a hidden tax in their legislation. That is my definition of `saying one thing and doing another'. They told us on Perth radio in June last year that hidden taxes are bad but that, in the case of a GST, they will embed it in the total price. On the question of hypocrisy, that is my point to the government.
A short footnote to those remarks: I was attacked by the government on the basis of what Labor is doing. The whole point here is that the government said all this, and taxpayers expect that the government will be consistent, but it is not. Therefore, I argue it is hypocrisy. What Labor is doing is not intro 
 ducing a GST. We had that debate back in 1986. We are not introducing a GST, because we think it is a crook tax. Therefore, we have no need to have a policy to impose a GST which is shown with the price. So that is the answer to the first question.
Secondly, on the question of why I am moving this amendment and not supporting other amendments, one of the shameful things about this whole exercise is that what is called tax reform is really introducing a regressive taxation system for Australia that hurts the poor and advantages the wealthy. The shameful thing about it is that this is called tax reform and is being rushed through the parliament, and a mandate is being claimed. We now know, by courtesy of the Senate inquiry, that the things that the Australian people were told, prior to the election, in all of the glossy publications that were put out, are not true. We know that.
We know that in the budget brought down last night there is no new compensation for the things that have been proved beyond reasonable doubt about the inequities of the system. We know that in the budget last night, or in any statement from government people since, there is no change on the government side in order to remove the high-roller advantage to casinos and gamblers so that they will escape the GST while the rest of us will get slugged by it. We know that. We think it is a crook package. Why am I opposing the package? I am opposing the package for those reasons and for the many other reasons I have stated in this chamber on many occasions. We think this amendment shows the hypocrisy of the government.
This amendment also has intrinsic merit, for the reason that the principles of tax reform are equity, simplicity, efficiency and transparency. Australians should know how much tax they pay. If you are a wage or salary earner, on your wage slip you have your gross salary, the tax taken from it and your net salary shown. You know how much tax you pay. I have here a copy of the receipt that it is possible to get at the checkout in Canada—and not only in Canada but in many other countries around the world where they have a VAT or a GST—which shows people the 
 cost of the goods and services they purchase and how much tax they pay.
We had quite an extraordinary speech from Senator Woodley about deeper, hidden political agendas. I do not know where that springs from. With the greatest respect to the Democrats—I frequently pay them the tribute that they are entitled to, because they are entitled to recognition and respect—I offer the brickbat, having been someone frequently offering the bouquets, that the Democrats in this debate have not stepped back from playing politics either. The whole deal about exempting food and therefore making a GST fair is playing politics.
—No, surely not!
—Oh, come, come! Is this such an innocent and naive chamber as to believe that there are no politics ever conducted here and that the only matters debated are matters of principle and substance? The whole assumption that this is a political matter and should therefore be dismissed is trite. What are we saying? Are we saying that when there is a GST Australians should not know at the point of purchase how much tax they are paying?
You said, Senator Woodley, as I recall—I do not have the actual words—that people will become resistant to the tax because they will see and will get annoyed by how much tax they will have to pay. I am not a fan of the GST so I think that will be a good thing. I think it will act as a barrier, too. If people see how much tax they are paying it will make it a damned sight harder for governments to increase the GST when they want to. The record of a GST everywhere around the world is that it only ever goes up, it only ever rises. If there is a GST and Australians know how much tax they are paying, there will be a block of public sentiment there to stand up to governments to make sure that it does not increase. That is an added advantage.
Your question, Senator Woodley, was: how do I know that consumers want this? I think consumers are entitled to this as a right. The obverse of saying that they are not entitled is to say that wage and salary earners should have only the net wages shown on their pay packet and not how much tax is taken out of 
 their gross salary, because they do not really want to be messed around by the detail of how much tax they pay. One of the things that this side of the chamber—and I include in this every party sitting on this side of the chamber—has always argued for is the right of the consumer to have access to certain knowledge to make their consumption at least informed. On this side of the chamber—as opposed to that side of the chamber—we have always argued that the relationship between a big retail store and a single purchaser is an unequal relationship and that there has to be some advantage to the consumer via information so that they can make discriminating choices about what is fair and reasonable. In my list of things that consumers are entitled to I include healthy foods, regulations about swift service and about not being conned, proper pricing and a number of other things about quality as well. They are also entitled to know how much tax they pay on goods and services.
The last question that you asked me, Senator Woodley, if I have them all listed, is: why can't a wholesale sales tax be shown on a docket? If you really want to put us to the test, I suppose in some cases it could be. But this is a different type of tax. It is not a retail tax; it is a tax on the wholesale value of the good as it is transformed in the various stages of production. It is a different tax. What we are talking about here is a goods and services tax which is a final tax—applied at 10 per cent under the government's bill to the last transaction—that is easy to display.
In opposition to me the government has said that I have a secret agenda. I am very fond of hearing from the government about the ALP's secret agenda because it is usually a lurid depiction of unreality; it is never anything like what we think. But the government wants to push these arguments out to try to blacken our name in the community. It always says we are trying to make the compliance costs, the costs on small business, higher by insisting that the GST figure be shown on the docket. Just about everywhere else in the world it is shown. If the government wants this shown here, it seems to me—balancing the right of consumers to know and 
 the small amount of cost, if there is any at all, given that most small businesses will have to purchase new plant and equipment to deal with a GST anyway—that an extra button on the dial will not be a huge cost. But I am told that that is the secret agenda of the ALP. I am told that it is an anti-small business agenda, which of course is nonsense. But that is the government's argument.
I think there is some merit, though, in not pushing the compliance costs of displaying a wholesale sales tax because, to that degree, it is a much more complex thing to do. But if this were to become a matter of contention on which the whole debate turns, and if it were going to break the back of the debate one way or another, I would modify my position, quite frankly. When you balance the two principles—a slight increase in compliance costs against the right of the consumer to know how much tax they are paying—I think the second argument overwhelms the first argument. In this chamber—and in life and in politics—we are often trying to reconcile which of two principles is more important when both in their own right are equally important. But you have to make a choice about how you balance them. If I am put in the situation of asking, `How do I balance the principle here?' I will balance it in favour of the consumer, quite frankly.
I think I have answered all of the questions put to me by Senator Woodley and, on the way through, Minister, maybe I have replied to some of the unfair licence you took in your reply to me when you attacked the Australian Labor Party. I will sit down now. I know a number of my colleagues want to speak on this matter because it is an important one for us.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—There is always one problem with Senator Cook: he finds it hard to run a consistent line. He almost came back to it at the end. Senator Cook rolled out a lot of very important phrases—`consumers are entitled to know as a right', which in our view they do, and `there is a need for transparency', which was highlighted a number of times. Then he said, `Consumers . . . are also entitled to know how much tax they 
 pay on goods and services.' Under our system we believe it is very straightforward; under the Labor Party's system it is exceedingly complex. Nonetheless, the principle was boldly stated. The truth of the matter is, Senator Cook, that you had 13 years in government but none of these principles applied to the indirect tax system which the Labor Party ran in that period.
You mentioned there will be complexity. I think there will be complexity; that is precisely the point I am making. With the system you have you wish to introduce complexity. In relation to excises on fuel, I think that is pretty straightforward. Despite your strong arguments about what you believe the Labor Party's position is, for 13 years nothing was ever done on this.
Let us get this absolutely clear: what we are seeing is a pathetic attempt by the Labor Party to apply what they claim are principles to our system which they have no intention whatsoever of applying to the Labor Party preferred tax system. After 13 years, Labor did not go down this route, even in areas where it would have been straightforward. I agree that it would have been complex in the wholesale sales tax area; the retailer's margin would probably have to be revealed.
—Get out of here!
—Absolutely; it would be complex. But the truth of the matter is that, on things like excises, I suspect it would be quite straightforward. But these fine principles and the arm waving were never applied to your own system, Senator. There was no intention that it apply to your own system, even when it could have been done in a less complex way. I know that Senator Woodley will get up and censure me on this, but I shall risk it: this is gross hypocrisy by the Labor Party; make no mistake.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1999-05-12,"—The issue of hypocrisy is an interesting one. I think I will leave that debate where it is. I will not be tempted to try to referee the fight as to who is hypocritical and who is not. I must say that Senator Cook certainly tried to answer my questions. I give him credit for that. I remember that when he was sitting on the other side of the chamber he always tried 
 to answer. I am not saying I was always satisfied with the answers, but they were certainly very good attempts to answer my questions. I think that is important.
However, I do need to defend the Democrats with regard to the point that has been made about politics. We know that it is all about politics; there is no doubt about that. I was not trying to be pure in any sense. I was trying to say that you built all of your initial contribution, Senator Cook, around whether or not the government was hypocritical. I felt that what we needed to point out was that, in this debate about hypocrisy, really it is about politics rather than hypocrisy. That was the issue, and that is where I would take issue with you, Senator Kemp, as well. It is about who is going to gain advantage and who is not. Of course, the Democrats are involved in politics, and of course we know that our amendments are about the political debate. I acknowledge that. If I gave the impression that somehow or other we were above that, Senator Cook, accept my apology; I did not mean to remove the Democrats from the political debate because we know that we are absolutely involved in that.
I hear what you say about consumers, but it does smack a little of telling consumers what they need, Senator Cook. `Consumers need to know'—you can make that point by waving your arms around, but I would still be interested to know whether or not you did survey consumers. I think that would be a useful exercise, because that would really tell us whether or not consumers wanted it. We can all tell people what they need, but it is a different question to ask them whether they want what we believe they need. That was the point I was making. I will leave my remarks at that point. I did appreciate Senator Cook's very good attempt to answer my questions.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-05-12,"—I might help Senator Cook here. I have here a copy of the transcript of evidence from the Senate Community Affairs References Committee. I refer to questions from Senator Chris Evans to Ms Mara Bun—for whom most of us have a great deal of respect—from the Australian Consumers Association. I quote:
Senator CHRIS EVANS —As I understand it, normally in terms of consumer protection you argue for transparency. Does that mean you argue for the GST to be displayed on the docket as part of the price—
Ms Bun —Absolutely.
Senator CHRIS EVANS —or are you happy with the government's proposal?
Ms Bun —No, we think that is central. We think that to replace a hidden tax with another hidden tax is not a sensible approach. We have discussed this with a number of very, very big financial institutions who very definitely share our views. They have had the problem, in the past, of having their own fees and charges confused with government taxation. They do not want that in the future, and we think that is fair enough. For people to make choices, they need that kind of disclosure.
I guess one of the issues that comes to the Greens (WA) is whether or not—and I would have to read the Australian Consumer Association's submission—the Australian Consumers Association were taking that further step and saying they needed that information before they made their choice about where they put their money. I would suspect that that is what they were saying—when you wait for the docket, you have already spent your money. Occasionally, you can ask for refunds, although you do not always get them. The reality is that it is after the horse has bolted, to a certain extent, if there is a requirement to get that on the docket.
There are some alternatives which have slightly less compliance cost. That includes the potential to require that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission can issue a notice that the breakdown should be on the price tag so that consumers can see it, not merely on a docket or receipt. I assume in that case the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission would take into consideration the compliance cost and maybe allow some kind of catch-up for those people who do not currently have that facility in their technology.
I notice, as a consumer, when I go into grocery stores—I think this is the area where there might be the most concern about compliance—that if it is a large chain, I can almost never pick up an item which has the price on it. That almost does not exist in most 
 large grocery stores. As we have heard in other debates, 70 or 80 per cent of the grocery chains in Australia are controlled by the same people, so presumably they have the same system. You have to remember what the price was on the shelf and keep that in your head to make sure you have been charged the right price at the checkout.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,1999-05-12,"—I seek the Senate's indulgence to make a statement for about five minutes in this matter of public interest debate. I would like to thank the Senate for granting me absence over the last few months and explain why I have been unable to attend here. In mid-February this year I went to see a doctor and was diagnosed as having bowel cancer. As a result of that I had to have major surgery on 16 March this year. That has necessitated me being unable to attend the Senate. I thank not only my own party leader Senator John Faulkner and party whip Senator Kerry O'Brien for their indulgence, support and encouragement but also President Margaret Reid and in particular Senator Sue Knowles, who sent me a nice letter.
The duration of my illness will extend a few more months yet. I am currently undergoing chemotherapy and I will also be undertaking a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy shortly. This treatment that I am going to undertake is for prevention; it is not for something that has got out of hand. I will probably not be able to attend the last sitting of the Senate in June this year because of daily attendance at Nepean Hospital for the radiation therapy.
I have thanked a number of people already, but I would also like to thank Nepean Hospital in the western suburbs of Sydney, where I was operated on and where I am still being attended to at the cancer care unit. In particular I would like to thank the doctors and 
 nurses who have been of great assistance to me, offering support and encouragement. I was in ward 4A with a number of other blokes when I was operated on. A number of those fellows were in a far worse position than I was. We maintained our sense of humour and dignity while we were undergoing our treatment. I would like to thank the surgeon, Dr Cartmill; therapist Megan Laidlaw; the oncologists, Dr Veness and Dr Jenny Shannon; and the nurse who seems to have taken me under her wing, Di Dingle.
I would like to briefly thank a number of other people for being around when I needed them: my old school mates Michael Lee and John Della Bosca; another old mate of mine who is actually a colorectal physician, Dr Anthony Donaghy; and of course Leo McLeay. A number of old mates, old truckies and old workmates have been supportive, as has an old friend of mine, John Allan, who is listening now. I would like to thank my family and in particular my sister who has offered great encouragement and support to me.
I have a few more labyrinths to journey through over the next few months. I know now as a cancer sufferer how awkward it can be to discuss it. All I can say to anybody who does have cancer is that if you give up, you will go. Anybody who has had it will know what I am talking about. If you give up you will be going, quicker than you probably think. It is hard and it does change you; emotions and feelings go through you. You do try to make amends for past sins and past wrongs, and you do try to make up. With some people you can and with some people you cannot. I want to take this opportunity to say to the house that I do appreciate not only my own side's indulgence of my absences but also the government's indulgence, as well as the kind regards and notes that have been sent to me by a number of people.
When I was first diagnosed with cancer I thought of a quote from Dante, which said:
In the middle of the journey of our lives, I found myself in a dark wood, for the straight path was lost.
I encourage people who have cancer or who have friends or family with cancer to read 
 cancer literature, because it does give you that pathway out. It does show you where to go. One of the books was on a survivor of one of the concentration camps in Belsen. His name is Victor Frankel and he says to people who are in this predicament of facing a life threatening disease:
No man can ever know what life still holds in store for him or what magnificent hour may still await him.
That is for all of us cancer suffers. As I said, my treatment is preventative; I am not out of action and I intend to be here for a while.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Leave of Absence</title>,Matters of Public Importance,3,1
"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,1999-05-12,"—I rise to speak this afternoon on a matter that has generated enormous public interest in the past couple of weeks. The opening of the tolerance room, or T-room, at the Wayside Chapel in Sydney's Kings Cross has reignited tensions surrounding the debate on drug law reform in Australia. On 3 May, Australia's first organised trial of a supervised drug injecting room began, initiated by a group of private individuals with a wealth of practical experience in dealing with heroin users.
In considering the potential benefits of safe injecting rooms in Australia, I believe it is firstly essential to draw a distinction between the T-room initiative and various illegal shooting galleries that have been operating informally in Kings Cross for a number of years. These so-called shooting galleries have traditionally been unsterile and have not provided clean injecting equipment to users. They have also generally not provided safe means for the disposal of needles and syringes after use. Shooting galleries were unsupervised and did not offer any medical assistance to users. Advice and direction for those wanting to address their drug problems were also absent. While the objectives and potential benefits of the shooting galleries were obviously questionable, their activities should not be used as a means of dismissing the T-room trial, which is as different from these initiatives as chalk is from cheese.
On the first day of the T-room trial, six drug users were provided with clean equipment and injected themselves in the presence of a trained nurse. The rules for using the room include that users must be over 18, they must use their own drugs, they must inject only into their arms or legs, they must be long-term users and they cannot be assisted in drug taking by staff. Medical assistance and advice on getting off drugs is also available. The conditions of the T-room are clean and hygienic. Users must wipe down their table with disinfectant before and after use. Clearly, the conditions of the T-room trial could almost be described as idyllic when compared with the shooting galleries that Kings Cross has already embraced as a means of getting drug use off the streets.
There is certainly no question that drug use is already rife on the streets of Kings Cross. Suggestions that a safe injecting room might attract users to the area are laughable and naive, given the extent of the problem that already exists. In a recent interview, Reverend Ray Richmond from the Wayside Chapel described the situation in Kings Cross:
We already pick up 120 needles a day in our front garden and 20 to 30 needles a day in each of the male and female toilets. We do not permit this activity and people are regularly asked to leave from anything from about 1 week to 6 months for not paying attention to our rules. There are about 200 injecting drug users here at the Wayside Chapel every week. In the last 10 weeks, 8 have died.
Reverend Richmond and his group are now seeking to prevent some of these deaths, and their ideas have not emerged in a vacuum. There is a significant body of evidence from overseas to indicate that safe injecting rooms can prevent deaths. In Switzerland, where safe use rooms have been operating for over 10 years, not one death has occurred in supervised use situations.
A recent position paper on injecting facilities, prepared by the Australian Drug Foundation, supports Reverend Richmond's belief that the T-room could save lives. The paper points out that fatal drug overdoses will be reduced because staff are on hand to administer first aid and to call an ambulance. European experience also indicates that ambulan 
 ces tend to arrive sooner because the locations are known and easily accessible. Indeed, the rate of fatal overdoses in the city of Frankfurt went from 150 to 30 within four years of opening injecting rooms.
The position of the Australian Drug Foundation on the provision of injecting facilities therefore lends considerable legitimacy to the aims and objectives of the T-room trial. The foundation believe there is a need to further explore the potential of such initiatives. Their position paper reveals a belief in the merit of safe injecting facilities, and their stance on the issue is summarised into these main points: that the health risks caused by injecting drug use pose a major public health problem, both to injecting drug users and to the wider community; that the use of injecting facilities presents significant potential to reduce the incidence of fatal overdose among injecting drug users and to improve their access to health services; that the use of injecting facilities presents significant potential to reduce public nuisance in areas of high injecting drug activity; and that the use of injecting facilities is specifically targeted at reducing the harm associated with injecting drug use, not at reducing levels of drug use within the community.
This strategy must be seen as only one part of a comprehensive response to drug use within our community. The ADF therefore strongly supports a properly conducted and controlled trial being undertaken in Australia to provide evidence on which to make decisions about the use of injecting facilities. While the paper makes no direct reference to the T-room trial, it obviously lends significant weight to the credibility of the concept. I believe it is particularly relevant that the ADF highlights the fact that safe injecting rooms are not the answer to Australia's drug problem—that they are merely a means of saving lives in the short term so that these people will be alive long enough to be able to make a decision to address their drug dependency over the long term. It is very difficult to rehabilitate someone who is already dead.
The position of the ADF also highlights the fact that the T-room cannot be relied upon as the only means of exploring the potential of 
 safe injecting rooms. Governments at all levels need to get behind the idea and organise a large-scale trial if we are ever to determine the potential of such initiatives to save lives.
The ADF position paper also provides information on the success of injecting facilities in Europe. Facilities in Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands have been found to meet their two primary objectives. The first objective was to reduce the harm experienced by injecting drug users by reducing the risk of fatal overdose and to reduce the transmission of blood borne viruses. The second objective was to reduce the public nuisance of drug users injecting in public places. Clearly, overseas experience indicates that injecting rooms can have health benefits for both users and the broader community.
In a recent interview on the 7:30 Report, Dr Franz Trautmann from the Netherlands Institute of Mental Health and Addiction, was highly critical of Mr Howard's refusal to acknowledge scientific evidence from overseas. With regard to the Prime Minister's zero tolerance approach to both heroin trials and safe injecting rooms, Dr Trautmann commented:
There's a huge number of people using heroin in this country, a huge number of young people. I think it would be wise to at least try this before you make the statement that it has no real influence.
Reverend Richmond concurred with this view, stating:
We want to tell the Government to base health policies on evidence, not outdated moralistic opinion which has the appearance of being caring but rarely leads to effective action.
When churches start talking about the outdated and moralistic opinions of governments, I think there is significant cause for concern that government policies are out of touch with community values and concerns. However, the Prime Minister seems not to be swayed by either scientific evidence or public opinion. Indeed, his dogmatic adherence to the notion of zero tolerance has even led the government to hold back funding for school drug education programs that do not comply with his own narrow perspective.
A Senate committee hearing on 6 May revealed that a $7.5 million plan to warn schoolchildren of the dangers of drugs is still waiting for final approval, despite being given to Minister Kemp almost two months ago. An article in the Herald Sun on 7 May suggested that the reason for the delay could be the failure of the strategy to use the term `zero tolerance', with which Mr Howard has been so taken.
An education department bureaucrat, Ms Lois Sparkes, admitted that only $500,000 of the $2.5 million allocated to the plan for this financial year had been spent. In addition, none of the $500,000 had gone to schools; it had only paid for research and meetings of the National Advisory Committee on School Drug Education. Clearly, the Prime Minister's inane preoccupation with the notion of zero tolerance has tainted his ability to think and act in an objective fashion.
Susan Mitchell from the Australian was also highly critical of the Prime Minister's blind faith in so-called zero tolerance strategies in her article on 12 April. In the article, entitled, `One-liners are not policy—some ideas have nothing to recommend them', Ms Mitchell perceptively points out that Mr Howard `seems to have broadened the phrase to allow him to refuse to tolerate anything with which he does not agree'. Ms Mitchell goes on to say, `Simplistic approaches, inherent in catchphrases such as zero tolerance, are not only intellectually sloppy but dangerous.' I could not agree more with this conclusion, particularly now that it seems the Prime Minister is determined to ignore any evidence that contradicts his own personal opinions.
The T-room trial has sparked a flurry of letters to editors all across the country over the past few weeks. I would like to conclude this afternoon by reading one of these letters which, I believe, is useful in providing some perspective to the current debate on safe injecting rooms. This letter was printed in the Sydney Morning Herald on 5 May and was written by a Canberra resident, Mr Bert Castellari. He said:
Back in the 1960s I was privileged to be involved in what was then a bold new experiment that tested community attitudes . . . it was the first 
 drop-in centre at the Wayside Chapel, run by the late Rev Ted Noffs.
It provided a friendly and caring environment where young people with drug and social problems could come without fear of retribution. In those days the drugs were marijuana and LSD and the chapel guided many young people through the most traumatic times of their lives.
Nowadays the drug is heroin and the Wayside Chapel is again testing community attitudes by providing a safe environment for users of a drug that is far more destructive than marijuana or LSD.
The chapel proved to be an innovator in the `60s and it will, I hope, again prove that understanding and compassion are better cures than punishment.
Mr Acting Deputy President, in the 1990s I hope that governments can learn this lesson, too. I would like to put on the public record my support for Reverend Richmond and his group, who have initiated this progressive step. I am sure all senators agree that we must look to a variety of solutions to address the drug problem and that the most important thing is keeping people alive.",SENATE,<title>MENTAL HEALTH</title>,<title>Drugs: Strategies</title>,Miscellaneous,4,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-05-12,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Newman) to questions without notice asked today.
The Minister for Family and Community Services joined with the Treasurer today in gloating about the $5.4 billion surplus achieved in the budget but had no answers to the questions posed to her about the needs of the constituency she represents. She had no answers to the desperate needs demands of people for services within her portfolio area that are not addressed by this budget. She wants to trumpet the budget surplus but she does not want to address the very real needs of people in the Australian community.
 Those people are crying out for assistance. They are crying out for programs to assist them, be it in disability services, child care, 
 aged care or housing. What the government has failed to do in this budget is address those social policy concerns. There was some money for private health. There was some money for private schools. But there was no money for the people in our community who are hurting.
It is important that we put this in context, because a range of these people in our community are hurting because of what the government did in its first couple of budgets. I refer to the $850 million ripped out of child care, the $500 million ripped out of aged care, the $450 million ripped out of housing and the $120 million ripped out of disability services. All of that did damage and hurt Australians. They were looking to the budget to provide some assistance to those families who are doing it tough, and there is nothing in it for them. The minister failed to get any assistance for those people in the budget.
She brought together a new super-department, the Department of Family and Community Services. This was supposed to achieve something for the constituents of that department. Nothing has been achieved. The damage wreaked by the first couple of Howard budgets has not been repaired. Those families, those people in need, continue to suffer. And what happened? The government threw a few crumbs to a couple of groups, mainly in rural areas, to address their political concerns about the rise of One Nation, but whole groups in our society, thousands of Australians who are suffering, got no support and no relief.
What did the minister say today? She used a dorothy dixer to try to talk about restructuring of the department. I am sure that really warms the hearts of those people doing it tough in our community! What was really interesting was that the best she could offer was to say, `But next year it'll all be okay.' The government is saying that there are some crumbs, there are some programs that will address some of the concerns, that will be introduced on 1 July 2000. What happens until then to those people doing it tough? They have got to wait. If they have got child-care needs, if they have got a disabled child who needs assistance, they have got to wait. 
 That is not good enough. They do not take any joy in a budget surplus when the basic human needs that they have are not being met in this society. And they do not want a minister who can offer them nothing—who cannot win a vote in cabinet, who cannot win any support in the budget for the programs that they need. They are told that they have to wait until July 2000 and, if they get anything at all, it will depend on their acceptance of the fact that they are going to have a new goods and services tax imposed on them, which all the evidence proves will make them worse off again, and that they have got to sell the one major public asset—the best public asset—that we have got in order to get some sort of minor relief.
These people are hurting now. They are looking for the government to provide some solutions to the social problems confronting them, and there is nothing in this budget for them. The disability sector is a good example—people with disabilities, people supporting children with disabilities. The government says they need $300 million now. The government's own report which it has had for two years has identified $300 million of unmet need. We have had two budgets in which the minister could have got assistance to address those problems. She has had two goes at it; there is nothing. There is $20 million for respite care—$20 million to meet a $300 million need. The people who care for people with disabilities say it is paltry and pathetic. They are outraged because the government has done nothing.
—What did you do for 13 years? Nothing.
—I hear Senator Synon give the same answer which Senator Newman uses: `It's all the Labor government's fault. We've only been in for four years; we've only had four budgets. It's all somebody else's fault. We're not responsible.' What I want to know is: when do you become responsible? When does it become your fault? When do you start to take responsibility for the decisions taken by government? You want to claim the credit. You want to say, `The budget surplus is all the result of our good work,' but you do not want 
 to own up to the fact that social policy in this country is in tatters. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget 1999-2000</title>,Miscellaneous,6,1
"Lightfoot, Sen Phillip",LP,1999-05-12,"—I rise to rebut what Senator Evans said in taking note, that we do want to take the credit and the responsibility for four very responsible budgets that have been brought down under the tenure of this government. Why wouldn't we want to do it? We have a 3.5 per cent growth rate for 1999-2000. We have a growth rate that is the highest in the OECD countries. We have a growth rate that is the highest in the G7 countries, except for the US this year; next year it will be the highest in the G7 countries. And that is going to go on. In spite of all the downturn that the opposition spoke about when the Asian meltdown happened, this economy is clearly one of the most exciting economies in the world. And just watch it get better. I refer not only to the $5.4 billion surplus which is the harbinger of things to come, not only to the lowering of the debt, but also to low housing loans—under six per cent—a growth rate of 3.5 per cent and a lower inflation rate. These sorts of formulae have never been brought together by any government before.
There is an extra $1 billion for the states. Senator Evans did not speak about that, did he? This sets the formula for Australia to be debt free—if the spoilers on the other side allow the GST and the sale of a large tranche of Telstra to go through. This is indeed a most exciting period to be alive and to call yourself an Australian. I think those on the other side know that.
What did Senator Evans say? `Nothing for certain people.' This budget covers everyone in Australia. This is a comprehensive budget that touches in a very positive sense every person in Australia. We have reduced the debt of the previous government. There was supposed to be a surplus but it ended up being a $10 billion black hole as a result of Mr Beazley's policies. And don't forget that Mr Beazley, now the Leader of the Opposition, left us with a $23 billion debt that he accrued in two years—and over $60 billion during that period of his government. This government has reduced it. Perhaps that 
 means nothing to you people on the other side, with your fiscal irresponsibility, because you are like a pack of dingoes going into a paddock. You don't go in there to feed—
—Order! Senator, please do not reflect on members of this place, either individually or collectively, in such language. And would you please address the chair.
—I will, Madam Deputy President. It was more of a reflection on the dingoes, and I apologise for that.
—Unreservedly?
—I apologise unreservedly, yes. What it means is this: there is $17.3 million over four years for lifetime health cover—something that will encourage Australians to go into the private health system and will take the pressure off the public health system. There is $614 million over six years for health and medical research, plus $20 million over two years to improve medical research facilities. Senator Evans said there was nothing there. There is $42.8 million over four years to establish 30 regional health service centres—something that the opposition, when they were in government, drained from the bush, from rural areas. We are going to put them back.
There is $43 million over four years to reward GPs who stay in rural areas for more than two years. One of the great problems with keeping health alive, well and up to date in the bush has been the atrophying of GPs who were neglected by the opposition when they were in government. People are not going to forget this. There is $110.5 million over four years in Medicare benefits to reward doctors for coordinating and planning care for the chronically ill. It goes on and on.
This is a most magnificent budget and it ought to be recognised. Most responsible fiscal commentators and economic commentators in Australia have given this, unequivocally, the thumbs up. Never before have we had such a combination of things brought together: growth of 3.5 per cent, an inflation rate that is lower than that, record job vacancies and a reduction, albeit small, in unem 
 ployment. This has been a great budget. It is a great day for Australia. We have a great combination in Mr Peter Costello and Prime Minister John Howard. We are going to be here for a long time as a result of this budget.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget 1999-2000</title>,Miscellaneous,6,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-05-12,"—Yesterday I heard the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, say that this budget was one of solid sparkle. It is a solid slap in the face for Australian families. Behind all of Mr Costello's bombast, smuggery and gloating, and behind all the indefensible non-answers from Senator Newman today, what we know is that all that Australian families get out of this budget is crumbs and hard grind for yet another year. There is nothing sparkling in Mr Costello's fourth budget, and that is probably why Deutsche Bank said this in their budget flash from last night:
The greatest excitement generated by the 1999-2000 Commonwealth budget was the accidental release of a number of press statements relating to budget initiatives by the family and community services ministry.
In fact, there have been five investigations into leaks since 1996 by the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Mr Max Moore-Wilton. He was only able to identify the culprit of one of those leaks. That was concerning budget cuts to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.
Mr Moore-Wilton could not do anything about charges against that person because the leaker was a Howard government ministerial staffer. Senator Newman, the Minister for Family and Community Services, knows exactly who that person was. I think Senator Newman would acknowledge that that person was a member of her own staff.
What is Senator Newman's response to this latest security debacle? As you have seen today from question time in the Senate, it is totally inadequate. She does not know who is responsible. She has demanded that a report be on her desk as soon as possible. All she knows is that it is not her responsibility. As usual, it is somebody else's fault. As usual, she has rounded up some other suspects and 
 will blame anybody except herself and her office.
The Department of Family and Community Services has outsourced its media web site. For 12 days the web site has been completely inaccessible. When it came online again, 15 press releases detailing government initiatives from the Department of Family and Community Services were exposed for everybody to see and for enough time for the media, the opposition and anybody else to download them. We said before that the finance minister's headlong rush to outsource IT was bound to be fraught with problems. Through the outsourcing of the IT function of Senator Newman's department, we have a really major budget leak. This is a really major gaff—probably the most significant and serious budget leak since John Howard's whole budget was leaked in 1980.
The security precautions surrounding a budget are tight. People who breach them fall foul of the Crimes Act. Senator Newman's call for a report was totally inadequate in these circumstances. The whole matter should have been referred to the Federal Police as soon as these materials were in the public domain at 4 p.m. yesterday. But her pattern, as always, is to take no responsibility. She will never own up to her own shortcomings, failures and inadequacies; she will blame someone else. She will scapegoat anybody else as long as it is not her. The buck stops with Senator Newman on this serious budget leak. It is her responsibility and just for once in her ministerial career she ought to own up to that and take responsibility for this serious budget leak.

"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,1999-05-12,"—I am delighted to speak here today following what is one of the great Australian budgets, brought down by Peter Costello last night. One cannot help but comment on the contribution from the Leader of the Opposition in this place. I find it absolutely remarkable that, after all the goodness, all the greatness, all the benefits and all the things that have been delivered in this particular budget, we have somebody here denigrating someone who made, almost certainly inadvertently, a mistake. To try and denigrate them and put 
 them down is an incredible reaction. Why not debate the economy? Why not debate the difference in the Australian scene today from when those opposite were last in government? I am proud to stand here and recognise the four years of contribution that we have made.
Senator Faulkner is leaving. He quoted from somebody criticising the Australian economy and the budget. Let me say that just last night, following the budget, Standard and Poor's said that we were now in a position where they could upgrade the credit rating of Australia. Just think of the impact of that. That means further downward pressure on interest rates, and that is a benefit that flows through to everyone in this community. It is something that improves the affordability of the things we buy.
Let us look at some of the real issues. Senator Evans in his contribution said that there was nothing here for the needy. I have a particular interest in rural, regional and remote Australia. There will be 30 new regional health centres. What a contribution to the health and wellbeing of those people who live out of the capital cities in this country. Of course, there are very few on the other side of the chamber who understand the importance of that particular measure. We will spend $43 million over four years to help retain rural doctors. Surely they recognise—I am sure you do, Madam Deputy President—the problem it has been, through longstanding bad policy, attracting doctors to rural, regional and remote areas of Australia. We as a government are doing something about that and we are going to have an enormous impact on those particular health measures.
There will be 500 rural transaction centres for banking, postal and Medicare services for communities with less than 3,000 people. We all know that for many years there has been a slow movement of people out of the country and into the major cities. In this process many of the services have gone with them. There is very little that you can do about that movement, but there are structural things that governments can support, such as these transaction centres, to help deal with that particular problem. There will be $1,000 for apprentices to encourage employers to provide 
 increased training. Once again we are targeting those individuals who need that training. There will be $195 million on improved roads and bridges and road black spot funding. This is a measure which is going to assist millions of Australians, and the benefit flows right back through our community. So when I listen to the arguments put on the other side, I find them quite hypocritical.
It is about time they started telling us, after their 13 years of failure in government, just how they are going to address these particular issues into the future, how they are going to change the situation and how they would not lead this country back into high interest rates and high inflation, with the damage that did to our resource industries and the individuals in it and the damage that did to the employees who work in these particular industries. That is what we want here in terms of this debate, not some attack on somebody who inadvertently released something. It should not have happened but it did happen. We want to get down to the nitty-gritty. We want to get down to the issues. We want to be able to hear from those opposite what their position is. It is amazing. Virtually every newspaper, certainly every one that I have seen, has applauded this budget for its responsibility, its direction, its soundness and for the fact that we are delivering what we said we would do in 1996 when we said we would get on top of debt in this country. Debt is the biggest single thing that drove up those interest rates. The finance minister at that particular time was a man who is now the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley. He alone, in just two years as finance minister, put $24 billion onto that debt. That is hardly a record to be proud of.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1999-05-12,"—In taking note of Senator Newman's responses to questions in question time today, perhaps I could commence by reminding Senator Crane that that is in fact the matter we are dealing with at this time, not the opposition's response to the budget as a whole. I might commend him for a more adequate response to some of the issues that were raised with Senator Newman than that exhibited today by Senator Newman herself. 
 If she were in the position to run some of the arguments that Senator Crane has just run, she may well be able to answer some of our questions. However, one point of Senator Crane's comments is that many of the areas that he comments on as significant events in this budget are in fact attempts by this government to go back over ground and cover up the problems it has created through what it has withdrawn in the past, particularly in the area of apprenticeships.
Let me go back to how unfortunately Senator Newman was inept in explaining the question that I raised with her today. That question was: why is it that the budget includes $366.5 million over four years to implement the GST package in her department and half of that is all that is made available in relation to compensation with respect to the youth allowance? To shift some of the blame from Senator Newman, she can share it with respect to the area of employment. Again we have an example there of very distorted priorities, because more funds will be devoted to computer systems to support the introduction of the GST than will be devoted to new employment initiatives. This is why we have got headlines, in relation to budget responses, that are contrary to what Senator Hill seemed to think—that they were good responses—and that are highlighting the fact that, whilst we have a $5.4 billion surplus and 3.5 per cent economic growth, joblessness is still going to be stuck at 7.5 per cent and this government has been so mean as not to do anything about what has been demonstrated as inadequate compensation to families, in particular, but more so to low income people and pensioners.
Before I go on further on those points, let me again emphasise how this budget highlights the problems with the GST. Not only in the area of employment but also in the area of health and community services do we have examples of how this tax is not simple but is administratively cumbersome and costly. Of course, it is also job destroying, and that is why the government is getting the figures that are in today's headlines.
Let me go back to those areas of direct responsibility that relate to Senator Newman: 
 the lack of adequate compensation and the Youth Allowance debacle. Senator Harradine said in response to the budget, particularly with respect to the Youth Allowance, that it was `too little, too late and improper'. Let us start with the `too little'. We have a maximum amount of $18.75 per week for the families that were not compensated as they should have been according to the commitments to Senator Harradine. Let us compare that with what was taken away and confirm the point I just made to Senator Crane. What was taken away was a maximum of $88 per week for children at home and $133.70 per week for children away from home. I think that demonstrates the point quite clearly.
Let us look at `too late'. The question I asked today followed the example that was highlighted during the GST inquiries when Senator Newman's personal representative from her department on the Treasury task force framing the GST legislation, Mr Tune, did not even know about the Youth Allowance commitment. He did not even know. It is no wonder Senator Harradine is saying that it is too late now.
Let us look at `improper'. The government's heavy-handed response to both Youth Allowance and compensation has been correctly highlighted today as `improper'. I am surprised that the government senators' report to the bill to limit violence and sex on the Internet has not also been linked to the processing of the GST—this is how clumsy this government is being. Australian families may as well be in Wagga Wagga for all the attention they have got in this budget.
Let me conclude on the minister's continual denial that the budget forward estimates confirm that the small amount of  compensation is being eroded. Your own budget confirms it but your own minister cannot understand it. She cannot understand it to the extent that, in her answer to me, she could not even understand that the heading of the area that I was referring to on page 86 of Budget Paper No. 2 is Tax Reform Family Assistance Package.

"Synon, Sen Karen",LP,1999-05-12,"—Thank you, Madam Deputy President, for the opportunity to speak today on this issue. I do 
 find the smugness of the opposition today somewhat disappointing. We are standing here after an astonishingly well-received by all commentators budget—a responsible, sound budget. A budget for our times was delivered last night. Could the opposition today ask us to account for any substantive point in the budget? No. What they chose to hark on was an administrative error in one minister's department. If that is the best you can do in budget analysis you had better get used to those benches because you are going to be there for a long time.
We are extremely proud to take responsibility and credit for the budget that was delivered last night—a well-crafted budget, a responsible budget. We now have a growth rate in this country of about four per cent. The Wall Street Journal recently lauded Australia's economic management, calling it the second most successful economy in the world. We have low inflation, averaging about 1¼ per cent. We have lower unemployment than we had under the ALP—that's for sure—when unemployment peaked at over one million. We have created 185,000 jobs in the past year alone and the unemployment rate has come down from around 12 per cent to 7.4 per cent. As the Treasurer said last night, it is still too high but it is coming down.
When the current Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, was finance minister—for just two short years he was finance minister—he managed to accrue over $24 billion of deficit and 25 per cent of the government's debt. In fact, in the last five years of Labor's misrule in this country we acquired as a nation $80 billion of debt in just five years. This budget will return Australia a surplus of over $5 billion so that we can repay the debt that Labor accrued.
Within that context of a most responsible budget, let us look at some of the important and caring initiatives that the Howard government has been able to deliver to the Australian people—initiatives that the ALP did not see fit to raise today because they are not accustomed to raising good news in this chamber. In the area of health alone, the allocation to medical research will be in 
 creased by $614 million over the next six years. This is surely an initiative that will serve this country well into the future. We have allocated $228 million to improve the health care of older Australians and those with chronic illnesses. The ALP are always getting up and asking about older Australians, but they did not have the heart to get up and congratulate us on our initiatives last night. There is $210 million for hearing services which will benefit 60,000 extra people, primarily older Australians. We heard today about the lifetime health cover initiative to make private health insurance more economical in the future.
In my own interest area of education and employment, it is interesting to note that, despite the hyperbole this morning, in 1999 the federal government will spend almost $298 million more on government schools than Labor did in their last year of office. I bet that is a surprise to you. Government schools will receive almost $1 billion more over the period 2001 to 2004 compared with the period 1997 to 2000. That is record federal direct funding. Non-government schools will now have a fairer funding system, with struggling schools better off but no schools worse off. This will cost some $56 million over the next four years or so.
There is $130 million extra for literacy and numeracy, $90 million extra for Asian languages and $78 million extra for teacher training. In 1999 there is a record number of undergraduate student places in Australia—more than 402,000. In the area of employment we have $228 million over four years to expand the existing Work for the Dole program. We have doubled the number of places and we have increased the age range so that more people can take advantage of this excellent program.
We heard about apprenticeships earlier. We are talking about $1,000 extra to rural and remote employers. (Time expired)

	 (c)	 the question for the adjournment of the Senate shall be proposed at 10.30 pm.
I seek leave to make a short statement in relation to the notice.
Leave granted.
—I thank my colleagues in the chamber for granting leave. The first part of the motion relates to sitting hours proposed for this Friday, which is a matter that was substantially agreed to—although I put it on the record that it was not agreed to by everybody in the chamber—by most at a leaders and whips meeting held at about 1 o'clock today. The government's proposal to sit on Tuesday, 25 May, which is a Senate only sitting week, in the morning and for extended hours in the evening to facilitate the completion of the new tax system debate has not found agreement around the chamber at this stage. We left the meeting at 1 o'clock with a proposal to further discuss that. I put it on the record that I am giving notice of it here so that, if we do find agreement between now and tomorrow morning, we will be able to proceed on that basis and we will have a notice. If a majority or consensus is not found this evening—
—There is a fair bit of difference between a majority and a consensus, as you know.
—There are a few votes in it, Senator Faulkner. If we cannot get an agreement, the government may well amend this motion to delete that part, either in writing to the clerk this evening or by my amending it tomorrow morning. At least it will be available for the Senate to deal with tomorrow.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,7,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-05-12,"—by leave—I am one of those who are not in favour of this proposal, but I am not going to debate that now. I simply reiterate that it will facilitate our coming to an agreement if we do not have a piecemeal approach to the change in sitting hours between now and the end of June but do have an agreed position, when this matter comes up for debate tomorrow, which encompasses all changes to sitting hours between now and 30 June inclusive. It is going to lead to a debate about such issues as the government's approach and the failure to get consensus on this matter which, of course, would be the desirable objective. A bit of homework is required by the government during the rest of today if we are to have a smooth facility of this motion tomorrow.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,7,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-05-12,"—by leave—The statement by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate is accurate, as I understand it, in as far as it goes. But I make the point to the manager that I think the spirit of the discussion that was held earlier today was to ensure that all senators had an opportunity to plan their programs between now and the proposed end of this sitting period. In order to do that, I think it is incumbent on Senator Campbell, as the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, to provide senators with more detail about other elements of the government's proposed amendments to the current sitting pattern and sitting timetable. It involves a couple of Friday sittings; it involves a couple of Tuesday morning sittings; it includes later sittings on one or two Tuesday and Thursday nights.
As senators give consideration to this particular issue, it is important that they have those details in their minds. Frankly, as I 
 pointed out at the meeting held earlier today, there is an issue of plain, simple, old-fashioned courtesy here, to give senators, their staff, officers of the parliament and others an opportunity to plan for these proposed extra sitting times and days. I do not have an argument with what Senator Campbell has told the chamber in terms of accurately reporting what occurred at a meeting today. I do accept the point that Senator Brown makes—or the point that I think Senator Brown is making—that it is not the full story. I see that he nods. The Manager of Government Business ought to provide that level of detail for senators. It is important that senators understand the sorts of constraints that the government is considering.
As senators make decisions on the motion of which Senator Campbell has given notice today, it is important that, when they come before the chamber, they do so in full possession of the facts. I ask Senator Campbell whether, given his role as Manager of Government Business, he will address that fundamental issue and provide, as soon as possible, for the benefit of all senators, details of what the government proposes in terms of amendment to the current timetable and pattern of sittings.
What senators need in this circumstance, at a minimum, is a great deal more certainty than they have at the moment. No-one likes sitting extra hours or extra days. I think everyone accepts that. Sometimes you just have to do it, Mr Deputy President, as you know. But if the government has other plans I think now would be as good an opportunity as any to outline them so that we are all clear.
I am not going to find fault with the statements made by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate in his earlier contribution. They were accurate in as far as they went, but it is urgent that the full picture be placed before the chamber so that all of us, not only senators but their staff and parliamentary officers and so many others for whom these matters are crucial in forward planning, have an understanding of what the government has in mind.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,7,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-05-12,"—by leave—The points that Senator Faulkner makes are wise ones. However, in my defence I would claim in relation to future proposals that at the meeting at lunchtime which was attended by all the whips and all the leaders, we did circulate, as Senator Faulkner would acknowledge, a full proposal for additional hours to meet the government's program.
—Is it confidential?
—I did not mark it `confidential' and I do not think it should be. In fact, I will now make it totally unconfidential and seek leave to incorporate it.
Leave granted.

—For the sake of senators and anyone else who is interested, I point out that the above timetable sets out what we regard as a generous estimation of time that could be required to debate a range of very important high priority bills between now and the completion of this term of the Senate on 30 June. For example, it sets out a further 25 hours of debate for a new tax system. If we are able to extend sitting hours as proposed by the notice, that would ensure an extraordinarily long debate on any historical terms. It sets out a range of hours estimated for completion of the bills.
Senator Brown made the point that he would be happy if we could agree on this program and have certainty about the extra sitting days. The government would be very happy to provide that to all senators and we would also be very happy to have a very clear understanding of the time that the debates on all of these bills will be completed. I think it would be very helpful to all senators to know that particular bills will be completed on a particular day, that they would then start consideration of another bill and that time management in the Senate could be greatly improved by having a much clearer idea not only of when we were able to sit but also of the days we would do particular bills and when we would reach conclusions on bills. With that in mind, I lay on the table the government's proposals.
Senator Brown to move, on the next day of sitting:
That the Senate—
(a)	 notes:
	 (i)	 the condition on page 49 of the Environment and Heritage Portfolio Budget Statement 1999-2000, under the heading Grants to Voluntary Environment and Heritage Organisations, that `Funding is dependent on whether their activities contribute to Government environmental and heritage priorities', and
	 (ii)	 that environment groups that complied with this dictum would need to support such policies as mining uranium at Jabiluka, logging koala habitat in New South Wales, woodchipping the tallest trees in the southern hemisphere in Tasmania allowing an 8 per cent increase in greenhouse gas emissions in Australia by the year 2010; and
(b)	 condemns this condition as a deliberate means of compromising environment groups by stifling criticisms of the Government's actions, which is injurious to the environment.
—I draw the attention of senators to the new orders that were moved yesterday for trial on notices of motion.
—I have another notice of motion.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-05-12,"—Madam Deputy President, I ask for your advice. Will we be circulated with a list indicating the dates on which notices of motion will be considered, whether there will be some delay or whether they will not be dealt with?
—The Clerk has just read out a list of which ones were being postponed. They are Nos 206 and 213.
—I thank you for that reply. I wonder whether you could let me know whether our offices were formally informed that those motions were to be postponed. The point I am making is that, if we are not informed, senators will need to come to the chamber to hear the clerk read out the list of postponements before they can know that the motions are not going to be dealt with—and then go back to their rooms.
—When the Clerk reads out the list, that is the first definite notification of which ones are being postponed. Senators have up until that time to postpone.
—I will not delay the Senate, but I will make another point. I would like you, Madam Deputy President, to take a note of my concern that this means the only way senators can reasonably know that there has been a postponement is to be here when the postponement list is read out.
—Senator, that was the case under the old procedure. That is not new.
—The point I am making is that no gain seems to have been made here as far as senators' attendance is concerned. I 
 would ask you to look at that matter to see if some improvement can be made.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Postponement</title>,Notices,11,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-05-12,"—by leave—The point you made, Madam Deputy President, is correct: senators would normally have had to come down to the chamber to see what was going to be postponed. But, as I understand it—I am not a whip and do not go to the whips meetings—senators will indicate to the whips that they are intending to declare motions formal. When as an opposition senator I sought to declare motions formal, it was courteous to indicate that intention to all the other parties so that they would know what was coming up. A benefit is gained by all senators in getting rid of the drudgery of going through endless announcements of postponements. By doing this in writing, you save that time, which hopefully can spent in actually debating some motions or other items.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Postponement</title>,Notices,11,1

Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
In March 1997, the Treasurer, Peter Costello, established the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program. The aim of the program is to create an environment in which businesses can get on with the job of creating wealth and jobs for all Australians. In April 1998 the Treasurer released the draft Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Bill 1998 for public comment. The bill is in four parts, dealing with reforms to directors' duties and corporate governance, fundraising, takeovers and accounting standards. This bill represents an important step in the government's drive to modernise the legal structures under which Australian businesses operate.
I want to place on record my appreciation for two of my colleagues in this place—firstly, Senator Gibson and, secondly, Senator Ian Campbell—for their work as parliamentary secretaries that brought forward this legislation. They both did very important and sterling work on behalf of the government in ensuring that this very important area of law is reformed in a worthwhile manner. I see that Senator Ian Campbell is in the chamber listening to these remarks at the moment.
—I wouldn't miss it.
—I am glad, Senator Campbell, that you would not miss it. As you well know from your own work, this is a very important area of law reform.
The bill has undergone an extensive process of public consultation and discussion involving the release of discussion papers and public consultations initiated by Treasury and the Business Regulation Advisory Group. The bill incorporates many of the comments and suggested amendments from business groups, professional bodies, practitioners and users of the law.
The committee's inquiry began in April 1998 following a request by the Treasurer. It was interrupted by last year's federal election. The committee's deliberations were also delayed by the need to consider some new issues which were raised very late in its proceedings. In general, there was strong support for both the consultation process and the general thrust of the bill. The submission of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, for example, said:
The CLERP process is considered to be a model of best practice consultation with the affected parties in policy development. It forms an integral part of a competitive industry policy and recognises the international move to outcome based regulation. It also achieves a careful balance between the need to foster vibrant capital development and the maintenance of prudential investor safeguards and confidence. This should ensure the best outcomes for Australia in terms of future investment, innovation, exports and employment generation.
There is insufficient time to outline all of the matters considered by the committee so I will confine my comments to a few of the main issues.
One of the main areas of concern raised with the committee was the extension of the compulsory acquisition provisions to allow a 90 per cent majority shareholder to compulsorily acquire the remaining shares at any time. Several individual shareholders and the Australian Shareholders' Association opposed this change on the basis that it would allow their shares to be acquired from them against their will and without sufficient regard to general considerations of fairness.
The committee members were not unsympathetic to their views. However, the committee also has to consider the effects of these small minority holdings on the efficiency of Australian businesses and on the interest of all of the shareholders of the companies involved. 
 The committee ultimately concluded that this extension of the compulsory acquisition provisions is justified and that it is generally fair to minority shareholders. The committee has, however, recommended some minor amendments aimed at protecting the interests of those minority shareholders.
Another significant issue which arose during the inquiry concerned the effects of capital gains tax on shareholders whose shares are acquired during a compulsory acquisition, or who received a scrip-for-scrip takeover offer. As one witness noted, not only will shares be taken from minority shareholders in a compulsory acquisition but also a tax liability will arise under the current capital gains tax provisions. Self-funded retirees will be particularly affected because their capital base will be diminished if they are subject to capital gains tax during a compulsory acquisition or a scrip-for-scrip takeover offer. The reduction in their capital base will reduce their future income stream and may limit their ability to continue to support themselves.
The committee concluded that the capital gains tax implications of accepting a takeover offer will deter many investors from accepting an offer. This will frustrate, to a significant extent, the economic objectives of the reforms contained in this bill. The committee has therefore recommended that, irrespective of progress on other much needed capital gains tax reform, roll-over relief from capital gains tax be provided where shares are compulsorily acquired and whenever a takeover offer for a publicly listed company is accepted on a scrip-for-scrip basis. An amending tax bill should be introduced urgently to accompany debate on this legislation to give effect to this recommendation. Failing this, the legislation should be amended so that a potential unwanted capital gains tax liability provides an absolute defence against compulsory acquisition.
In a late submission to the committee the Australian Stock Exchange raised several new issues relating to the listing of new floats and to private placements of securities. As the suggested amendments proposed by the ASX involved significant, though somewhat technical, changes to the bill the committee wrote 
 to a range of affected parties seeking their responses. After considering the responses it received, the committee was not persuaded that significant changes to the bill were warranted. However, the report does contain some recommendations aimed at addressing some of the concerns which were raised.
In correspondence to the committee, the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, the Hon. Joe Hockey, outlined some issues relating to takeovers which were highlighted by a recent takeover bid by Evans Deakin, and the Federal Court decision in the Aberfoyle case. The minister provided the committee with a report by the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee dealing with these issues.
The CASAC report recommended that sections 623(2) and (3), which prohibit the giving of collateral benefits, be removed from the bill. It also recommended that section 621(4), which requires that a cash offer equal to or exceeding the maximum paid for the securities by the bidder over the last four months, be extended to all bids. Unfortunately, the committee did not have time to examine these issues at a public hearing or seek further comment from other interested parties.
Based on the evidence available to it, the committee accepts the CASAC recommendations. However, in light of its limited consultation on this issue, the committee has not made any definite recommendation. It has left it to the government to accept the CASAC recommendations or to proceed with the bill as drafted and refer these matters to the committee for further consideration.
Mr Acting Deputy President, my tabling statement deals with other issues in relation to the Takeovers Panel, and I also have some comments on supplementary reports that have been tabled by Labor Party senators and also by Senator Cooney and Senator Murray. Given the shortness of time for government business this afternoon, I seek leave to incorporate the rest of my remarks in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
The report also examines the new provisions which deal with the Takeovers Panel. During its inquiry 
 the committee was able to conduct a hearing by video conference with Mr Peter Lee from the UK Takeovers Panel. This was a very valuable exercise for the committee because the UK has successfully operated a Panel for over thirty years. The hearing emphasised to the committee that for the Australian Panel to be fully effective it must enjoy the support of the whole business community. It also focused the committee's attention on the importance of ensuring that the best possible people are appointed to the Australian Panel, and that they are appropriately paid.
The committee concluded that the bill will establish an effective Takeovers Panel.
Before concluding, may I thank all members of the Committee for their contributions to its deliberations on this important legislation. Given the involvement of Senators Gibson, Conroy and Senator Murray, and I on the Senate Select Committee on a New Tax System it has taken special cooperation for this Committee to conduct its deliberations concurrently but that has been achieved.
I welcome the general support of all Committee members for the Report and note the absence of dissenting Reports.
However, I do wish to comment on the Supplementary Reports lodged by several members. In response to Labor members may I say that the legislation does not relax regulation but simplifies it to make it more user friendly.
Those members express scepticism regarding the benefits of takeovers because some are not successful.
That may be the case. However, it is a matter for the market to sort out. It is not a reason to unduly restrict takeover activity or open avenues for costly and obstructionist litigation.
Restricting to ASIC the initiation of court action regarding decisions of the Takeover Panel is questioned by Labor members. However, this is also designed to prevent undue litigation.
ASIC has adequate capacity to protect small investors in these circumstances.
Labor members' comments on Directors' Duties and Corporate Governance and also on Accounting Standards add little to the Main Report.
I reject the criticism and the need for amendment.
Senator Murray suggests that the Committee has been equivocal in its reaction to CASAC's proposals that Section 621 (4) should apply to all forms of takeover bids and that as a consequence Sections 623 (2) & (3) should be removed from the Bill.
In fact the committee supports CASAC on this. We simply made the point that we have not had the 
 opportunity to take external evidence on this and that it may be appropriate to do so.
As regards the voting rights of a director who is on the boards of both the bidder and the target, it is appropriate to leave the solution to this, should a problem arise, in the hands of ASIC.
Despite Senator Murray's comments, his proposal to extend the source of enforcement applications regarding Takeover Panel decisions is contrary to the Bill's purpose of minimising litigation.
This is also the case with his proposals regarding compulsory acquisitions. Senator Murray's admirable points of principle regarding appointments to accounting standards bodies should apply to all appointments to government bodies.
They are principles which this Government and its Ministers do apply.
It would not be good administration to write them into one piece of legislation in this piecemeal fashion.
The legislation strikes the appropriate balance between black letter law and delegation to ASIC, contrary to Senator Murray's comments.
It does not preclude future legislative initiatives if proven necessary.
Senator Cooney's references to the balance between reliance on business ethics and regulation are noted but the legislation does strike the appropriate balance.
As a non-lawyer, I do not share Senator Cooney's enthusiasm for the courts and believe in the intent of the legislation to reduce litigation.
Before I conclude my comments on the Bill I would like to thank all of the individuals and organisations which made submissions to the Committee, appeared before during public hearings, or responded to requests from the Committee for comments on specific issues.
May I also thank Committee Secretary Frank Nugent and his staff for their tireless work on this Inquiry.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>Report of the Corporations and Securities Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-05-12,"—I would also like to place on record a number of thankyous, firstly to the chair of the committee, Senator Chapman, who has had to carry this one for quite some time through many different phases, and secondly to the secretariat, who worked tirelessly on the report on the provisions of the Corporate Law Reform Economic Program Bill 1998. I would also like to record my appreciation for the work of Senator Gibson and Senator Campbell on this as well, which I think is appropriate. 
At the outset I would like to indicate that the Labor Party supports the reform of the corporate regulatory environment. Labor has, though, a number of concerns with the bill, and we are likely to move a number of amendments to it. We have not yet finalised our position, but I would like to indicate some of the areas of our concern. Taking the proposed changes to the takeover laws as an example, Labor believes that the potential threat of takeover is necessary to maximise performance by management. However, there is growing overseas evidence that the most crucial aspect of international competitiveness is strong domestic competition.
The government has asserted that existing laws have discouraged takeover activity, yet evidence presented to the committee was not compelling. The recent Ernst and Young report on mergers and acquisitions, showing that Australia experienced a record level of mergers and acquisitions in 1998 and that this is expected to continue into 1999, shows that in the real world, in the real market, the reality is somewhat different from the evidence that was given to the committee. The proposal may, in my view, breach some important principles of transparency, information in the marketplace and equality of access to this information.
The government has also indicated that it wishes to change the rules on compulsory acquisition of minority shareholdings. Labor believes that this change will unfairly disadvantage minority shareholders. Even the government members believe this provision is unduly harsh, and they indicated so in their report. I would like briefly to quote from Mr Alfred Rofe, Chairman of the Australian Shareholders Association Ltd, who highlighted this concern on behalf of minority shareholders in this way:
Compulsory acquisition involves the expropriation of the property of the shareholders whose shares are to be acquired. Minority shareholders in a partly-owned group of companies are in a particularly vulnerable position. It is therefore essential that any compulsory acquisition of their shares can be seen to be fair to both the majority and minority shareholders. As the courts have pointed out on a number of occasions, fairness in this context involves both fair dealing and a fair price. The proposed new compulsory acquisition power in its 
 present form tips the scales too much in favour of the majority shareholder.
This is something that should be of concern to everybody in the chamber. Over recent years we have seen many new entrants into the share market. Many mum and dad shareholders have now come into owning shares as part of a whole range of floats of former public companies and demutualisations. This is an area where we should be particularly conscious of making changes.
Labor supports the revamp of the Corporations and Securities Panel, believing that it may more effectively address takeover disputes, but we will be keen to examine this over the next couple of years to make sure that it lives up to the hopes that we have for it. We are concerned about the restriction on individuals approaching courts, as is set out in this legislation. At the moment, only ASIC has the power and, unfortunately, ASIC—and Senator Campbell and I have debated this many times across the chamber—is not always driven by the capacity to deal with every issue that is brought before it. It is a question of the resources available and priorities for those resources. In some cases it may be that ASIC does not feel it necessary to follow some of these matters up.
Another area of concern to us is the proposal which sees that the notice of acquisition be accompanied by an expert valuation and that the expert valuation be provided by somebody paid for, and selected by, a majority of shareholders of the company. We believe that in those circumstances the possibility of a not necessarily impartial report by the valuer, if they have been hired and chosen by the directors, is sufficient that the Corporations and Securities Panel should be the organisation that chooses the valuer. We believe that the majority shareholders and the directors should pay for this, though. That part is consistent.
Another suggestion revolves around sophisticated investors and the proposal in here for a sophisticated investor to be deemed to be a sophisticated investor by the licensed security dealer. They have the power to make this choice. Due to both this government's and the last government's policies many people will 
 have large superannuation lump sums towards the end of their lives. That has been a consistent policy that we have pursued and that this government has been pursuing. If we find that people have maybe half a million dollars at the end of their 20-year or 30-year working life, they will not necessarily be what you would traditionally describe as a sophisticated investor. But, on the surface, if a licensed dealer chooses to say, `You have a large amount of money, you have obviously had experience around here,' in his own mind he can make the decision himself to waive the information that would be going to somebody in those circumstances. So we do not believe that you should allow the licensed security dealer to make this choice under the proposals that exist at the moment.
Another area is directors' duties and corporate governance and the question of a safe harbour for directors. This has been debated for many years. This is not a new proposal. It has been around for at least 10 years.
—Senator Cooney thought it was pretty good.
—Senator Cooney has probably dealt with it before, I am sure. The government say they want to clarify the duties for directors. My concern, from a reading of the legislation at the moment, is that in actual fact there is a watering down of the responsibilities, not a clarification. In those circumstances, fellow members and I are uncomfortable with supporting the bill in its current form. There is also a range of existing court decisions which have clarified the responsibilities for directors. And they have been quite clear about what those responsibilities are. If anything, they are perhaps too clear. What we are concerned about on our side of the chamber is that this bill waters down that position.
Finally, so that other colleagues get a chance to have a few words, on the accounting standards question—whether or not we should be adopting the European model or the US model—we are concerned that this government is seeking to mandate one or the other of these proposals when it is too early at this stage. We are working towards harmonisation. This is a thing we should be working 
 towards. But for the government to be potentially mandating either of these options is, I believe, to be jumping the gun, and what we should be doing is having a little more time before we jump one way or the other.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>Report of the Corporations and Securities Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-05-12,"—As Senator Conroy has said, we do need time to see which way we are going with corporate law. Corporate law is absolutely essential to the sort of society we have, because it is through the corporate structure that most of our economic activity is now conducted. Not only is our economic activity conducted through the corporate sector but the corporate sector is becoming more and more important, as Senator Conroy has said, to the population generally.
That has been largely brought about by encouragement from governments of both kinds. When we were in power, shares in the Commonwealth Bank were put out to the public and the public were encouraged to invest in them. A third of Telstra has been sold and many people in the community own shares in Telstra. So government has encouraged people in the street to invest in companies. In addition, government has encouraged people to go into superannuation schemes, because it is through superannuation that people are going to be able to provide for their later years and it is anticipated that the social security system, as it is presently run, will not be able to meet the demand that will be put on it further down the line by those who are becoming older. As a way out of that problem it is suggested that people take out superannuation. Of course, superannuation funds make their money largely through investments in companies, so the company structure in Australia and the laws that guide companies in their operations are of essential importance to Australian people. It is for that reason that I have some reservations about the direction in which company law is going.
A significant thing is that company law is now the responsibility of Treasury, whereas it used to be the responsibility of the Attorney-General's Department. There is a significance in that, because there is danger that an overemphasis will be placed on monetary returns that people get from companies—on, 
 as it were, the issue of gain rather than the issue of service that companies may give and of responsibilities that companies have not only to their shareholders but to the community generally. But particularly with public companies it must always be remembered that the ownership of those companies is largely divorced from the control of them. It is a matter of great importance that those owners of the companies be protected from the actions of controllers. I am not saying that the controllers are going to act dishonestly or in an oppressive way, but they are going to act in a way that does not always suit the shareholders, particularly the minority shareholders; and Senator Conroy has made some remarks about that.
In respect of the report I want to join the speakers that have already given their speeches and acknowledge some people who have had a lot to do with this report. As Senator Conroy said, Senator Chapman has led the committee well. I think that his predecessor, Senator Ian Campbell, needs acknowledgment. I am to be followed by Senator Andrew Murray, who on behalf of the Democrats has done a lot of work in this area and has done it well. Senator Brian Gibson has been mentioned. I think he has done seminal work in this area. It is a pity, I must say, that he is not amongst the ministers that we have in this government.
As far as the secretariat goes, I have a great deal of praise for Frank Nugent who, it seems to me, is required to do a lot of work without all that many resources. I know that in the additional contribution I made he picked out some errors that needed correcting, and I thank him for that, particularly since it must have been almost an oppressive task that he had to get this report into shape.
I note that some recommendations were made in the majority report, and that some recommendations were made by the Labor Party and some by Senator Murray. I think those recommendations deserve consideration. I know the government is intent on getting ahead with its program on corporate law reform but it is important to remember that this is an important area of the law. It is an area of the law that will never be finally dealt 
 with. There will always be reasons to change the law but, whenever those changes occur, they should be made as significant as possible.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>Report of the Corporations and Securities Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-12,"—I will commence by acknowledging the chair. Mr Acting Deputy President, you would be aware that I sit on a large number of committees; they number 13 at this time. I have experience of a wide variety of chairs—both members, in joint house committees, and senators—and Senator Chapman joins the ranks of coalition chairs who exercise their role judiciously and with courtesy, even when there are differing views. Labor Party chairs that I have served under have behaved in the same way. In fact, there is only one chair out of the 13—regrettably a coalition male senator—who is a rude person as a chair. Generally speaking, the standard of chairing is high. Senator Chapman has indeed carried on that tradition.
The other point I make about the committee is the quality of the secretary and, secondly, the continuity of membership between one parliament and another, which is very helpful in terms of a corporate memory and of experience and abilities. Of course, there is a range of abilities in the committee which includes people with very good legal qualifications, business qualifications and other practical areas of experience.
This committee is also notable for its coalition members avoiding the temptation to automatically support whatever the government puts up. They are prepared to be critical and to make recommendations which differ from the legislation before them. That is healthy and I hope that they have some influence on the Treasury, who do not have a reputation, in my party at least, for having very big ears. Hopefully, those members can generate a number of amendments.
The report on the provisions of the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Bill 1998 and the bill itself cover a number of areas. The process that has been undertaken here is that a draft bill has been put out to be commented on at large and then put to a committee. That is a very practical, useful and proper way in which to develop good legisla 
 tion. There are four main areas of attention that this bill deals with in terms of the Corporations Law. The first relates to some adjustments to directors' duties and corporate governance, the second to takeovers, the third to fund-raising and the fourth to accounting standards. The middle two might be regarded as having a focus on economic outcomes. The first and the last have very much to do with standards of corporate behaviour and corporate reporting, which should be in the interests of the community as a whole. As Senator Cooney said, they must not just be based on economic precepts and economic views but on social needs and the ethics which we require at this level of operation in our society.
The Australian Democrats will attend to issues of corporate governance when the debate comes to the floor of the Senate and we will be moving a number of amendments. We regard it as our role to push hard at the accountability area. We have previously been supported in this effort, in the last round of legal change in this area, by the Labor Party, and I look forward to them assisting us again to improve the levels of corporate governance without putting directors and senior management into a straitjacket and without making it difficult for them to run their companies appropriately.
The Democrats have addressed the issue of takeovers. The areas concerned are the consideration offered during a bid, collateral benefits and bidders statement formalities, as well as the scope and powers of the panel and compulsory acquisitions. Against each of those headings, we will be making amendments, largely derived from evidence to the committee. In those areas, we have differed with some of the members of the committee as to the direction we should go in. It is very healthy to see in a joint house report that there are three supplementary reports to the main reports. They are not minority reports; they are not dissenting reports; they are supplementary reports and indicate the way in which a diversity of views can be properly expressed in an area of great legal, commercial, economic and social significance to the country. 
The other area the Democrats will be attending to is that of appointments to accounting standards bodies. We have a particular desire to push an agenda that ensures appointments are made on appropriate grounds of merit, probity and the right balance of skills and backgrounds. One of the issues we draw attention to is the excessive power which is being delegated to other authorities—in this case, ASIC—and we will be making some remarks on that matter. We will also be addressing issues which have arisen from witnesses but which are not spelt out in our main supplementary report. Accordingly, I thank the committee and the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>Report of the Corporations and Securities Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-12,"—The amendment we are dealing with is the only one offered by the opposition to the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Bill 1998, which has attracted the bulk of the over 250 amendments being put to the tax package. There has been great concern throughout the Senate committee tax inquiry about whether the benefits of the reductions in indirect taxes will be passed on to consumers. This is a key issue and one which has needed very careful thought.
The research from overseas suggests that it will take six months or so for prices to settle down after the introduction of a GST. This was evident from the research in Canada and in New Zealand. Treasury, for example, provided the committee with a report by Mr A.E. Bollard of the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research which showed that about 70 per cent of the impact of the GST passed through in the first quarter and was most evident in the quarter after. But these effects do need to be accentuated as much as possible and as quickly as possible. There is a real concern that retailers and wholesalers in less than perfect markets will try to profiteer by increasing their margin by absorbing the benefits of the wholesale sales tax being abolished. That has worried the Democrats, 
 and I know it has worried other members of the Senate.
The ACCC are to be given sweeping powers to prevent that, including the imposition of fines of up to $10 million for corporations and the power to issue injunctions. But, realistically, the ACCC are being given only a small number of extra officers for the difficult job of prices surveillance and legal compliance—from memory, that small number is 40. But, of course, there is also the added difficulty being claimed in some quarters that giving the ACCC this authority will actually rub up against constitutional difficulties, and it is not too clear whether they will be able or allowed to do the complete job that the government is suggesting they do. Nevertheless, the real benefit of the ACCC's actions must be in the educational process and in working with businesses to develop appropriate means to identify the real benefits of reductions in indirect taxes and incorporating these into their pricing structures.
The Labor Party amendment is focused on how price is expressed. The week before last, the ACCC issued its draft guidelines on how it will enforce its rules—guidelines described by the Financial Review as being `stiff' and `tough'. The ACCC has recommended that businesses display GST-inclusive prices, arguing that this is what is required by the law and the Trade Practices Act, sections 52, 53 and 53C. However, the ACCC is also suggesting that businesses display pre- and post-GST prices where appropriate. The guidelines as they stand are in deliberately vague terms because they are intended to apply across all industries, with the ACCC promising more specific guidelines if needed for particular industries.
Minister, you may like to comment on this point later but, as far as I am aware, there is nothing in the government legislation which prohibits a business from showing its prices as it sees fit, provided it complies with the government's law. If the business wanted to show the GST separately, there is no rule, as far as I understand, which prevents it from doing so. In other words, for those retailers and those businesses supportive of showing a 
 GST separately, my understanding is that they can do so. I would be interested in your response if you fleshed that out. So the idea that they cannot, I think, is wrong. It is apparent from the approach of both the government and the ACCC that they do intend that pricing should be GST inclusive. In other words, if there is to be any doubt or any ruling required, it should be GST inclusive. That contrasts with Senator Cook's Labor Party amendment.
I think the guidelines as they stand are in deliberately vague terms because they intend them to apply across all industry, with the ACCC promising more specific guidelines if needed for particular industries. Whilst that flexibility might be practical, it may lead to some difficulties in the implementation. The ACCC seems to have made a fair start with those draft guidelines, but clearly they do not go far enough. The requirement to display pre- and post-GST prices during the transition period might be regarded as quite essential, particularly to help consumers in their own informal prices surveillance—which will help the ACCC in its work—but we should not understate the immense amount of work and the cost that that will entail.
Just picture your average supermarket needing to put up two sets of prices and needing to do all the posters that are necessary—the art work, the price bursters, et cetera—and I presume also in newspaper advertising. That area of ACCC compliance will carry a cost, and I am not at all sure, having gone right the way through the committee hearings, that I have ever heard that area of cost spelt out. I think the compliance cost of software, hardware and price changing was spelt out, but not that of having to put up two sets of prices and run that throughout your shop for a period of maybe six months. Minister, you might choose to comment on that potential cost as well in your response.
It is during the transitional period—that key six months after the introduction of the GST identified by the Treasury—that some additional consumer measures will be needed, especially in the retail sector. The Democrats will be developing proposals to bring forward to the Senate when we debate the changes to 
 the Trade Practices Act later in this package of bills. That is an appropriate place to deal with the issue of GST transparency, because we must maximise the early pass through of indirect tax changes by making it mandatory to give consumers all the information they need to know if they are being ripped off. But I am with the Labor Party—I do not expect early pass through; I think the pass through will take at least two years for most indirect taxes. That would seem to me the most practical way at present to deal with the GST's price effects.
This is Labor's only amendment to this particular bill. For that reason, Senator Cook, it is a bit difficult to take you seriously on the policy ground. I take you very seriously on the political ground, but when this is your only amendment it is a bit difficult to take you seriously on the policy ground. Senator Kemp has rightly made the point that over your 13 years in government you did not propose to include the wholesale sales tax on prices, even when it was raised again in 1993. I think we are dealing with different matters here—it is more difficult to deal with a wholesale sales tax than a retail sales tax or a final consumption tax—nevertheless, I think the point has legitimacy. You did not put petrol and alcohol excises on price tags. Again, there are difficulties attached to that because of the particular level of production, but the point deserved to be made.
In 1994, when the Democrats asked that embedded indirect taxes be noted on business inputs so that exports could be fully rebated, the Labor Party at that stage refused point-blank to consider the issue. When you introduced the fringe benefits tax in 1986, it was put on employers rather than employees, so in that sense it was hidden and not exposed to the employee. So there is a long tradition of the Labor Party in government not exposing taxes up-front. This coalition government is continuing that tradition. From memory—and Labor Party senators could correct me—your election policy on the wholesale sales tax did not propose that the rate of WST should be shown on invoices either. So, again, that differs from the policy you appear to be promoting here.
What concerns me most is that, of all the hundreds of technical issues presented to the committee over four months, this is the only Labor amendment to the GST bill. I am one of those who believe that individual Labor senators have a genuine and great concern about social justice and such issues as taxing the essentials of life and taxing food, but the concerns of those individual senators who I know have those strong feelings have not been translated by the Labor Party into amendments that attend to issues in the health and community services area or child care or aged care or any other area of charitable organisations or cultural organisations affected by the GST.
If Labor's committee members have genuinely written long lists of problems and concerns into the committee reports and have supported recommended changes and a different policy approach in many instances to that adopted by the government, why hasn't that been translated into amendments? If Labor's opinion is that they are not going to do anything to lessen the pain of this bill, that is an abrogation of your responsibility, because you do not have the numbers. If the bill were to be passed by any of the other groupings in the Senate capable of providing the numbers, the fact that you did not seek to make the bill better is a cross you are going to have to bear.
I think the Labor Party is a much harder beast than many of its members and has turned its back on amendments which would address the issues of social justice and equity, which individual senators feel very strongly about. The Labor Party, as that much harder beast—if I can put it that way, rather than the individual senators—has deliberately chosen political divisiveness. I understand why. I can understand the approach and I think, incidentally, it will be a very effective weapon in your hands. It will be a singularly effective device because what we have here in pure political terms is the Labor Party wanting every consumer, every day, to have the GST stuck in their face until election day. Then the ALP will be able to use those invoices, which would have a GST on them, to really push the 
 message as to the effect of the tax on individual consumers.
That is predicated on the belief that you would have a Canadian result—that the community as a whole would react and throw out the government. That may have been the case in Canada; it has not been the case in 105, or whatever it is, other countries that have introduced a GST or a VAT. It was not the case in New Zealand, the UK or Denmark—let us go through the long list.
I would have preferred the very real and genuine concerns that Labor senators have individually to have been translated into support for amendments being put to the bill by the Democrats, the Greens (WA) and the Australian Greens. The only amendments you have supported are government amendments, which so far we have supported because they do improve the bill. Why improve it for the government and not also improve it by supporting the cross-party amendments where you agree with them?
—Why not approve it for the Australian people?
—Exactly. Why not improve it for the Australian people? (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMPENSATION MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-05-12,"—Will the minister advise the chamber of what is the practice in other countries? Is it or is it not a fact that labelling which shows clearly the GST component of the total price is done in all countries where there is an equivalent tax, except for New Zealand? Secondly, though honourable senators will know that I do not stand in this place often quoting the World Bank or the IMF, is it or is it not a fact that both organisations have indicated in articles that such a practice—that is, to show specifically and separately the GST component of the total cost—is the correct way to proceed?
Senator SHERRY (Tasmania) (4.48 p.m.) I would like to make a contribution, which will be largely in response to Senator Woodley and Senator Murray. Senator Kemp might want the time to check up on the material that Senator Harradine has just asked about, which I think is a very important 
 question. I am pleased that Senator Woodley has remained in the chamber since the contribution he made.
—I knew you were going to speak, Senator Sherry.
—Thank you very much. I was pleased in respect of your second contribution that you acknowledged you are a politician and that we are involved in a political process. I really did think you were stretching the principal argument of the Democrats just a tad too far to maintain the position that you were maintaining in your first contribution.
We are politicians. We have legitimate differences from time to time. Unfortunately in this country we tend to focus on the differences rather than the things we agree on. I suspect, if you look at legislation, that there is a majority of legislation we actually do agree on in terms of a significant number of things. But, Senator Woodley, to suggest that we are not involved in some political process, as I believe you were doing, was really stretching it quite a bit.
I would like to touch on Canada, because you both touched on Canada and I have some knowledge of what occurred in Canada. I do not believe, and I do not believe the Labor Party believes, that you would have a political result after the introduction of a goods and services tax like the one that occurred in Canada. The Canadian Progressive Conservatives—that is a bit of a contradiction in terms, Progressive Conservatives—were defeated after a long period in office. Certainly the goods and services tax was an issue. Compounding that in Canada, almost every province except Alberta had its own state tax, and the GST was added on top of it. That just added to people's angst. There were commitments given that there would be a uniform national rate and that this other state provincial tax would be done away with. That did not happen.
Also in Canada there were five parties that had substantial electoral support. The electoral system was first past the post. You had the Quebecois; the Reform Party, which was a right of centre party; the Liberal Party; the Social Democrats, equivalent to the Labor 
 Party; and the PC. Those five parties, all competing, drew their relative strengths from regional bases. Unfortunately for the Progressive Conservatives, their vote was scattered throughout the country. It was not an insubstantial vote. From memory, they received about a quarter of the vote and ended up with two seats.
—We know the problem well.
—I know the problem well, and I have done some analysis of it. I do not believe for one moment—and I am sure the Labor Party does not either—that you would get a political result emerging that was comparable with Canada's if we ended up with a GST in Australia.
Senator Murray, one of your remarks was that you believed that the parliamentary Labor Party was a much harder beast than many of its members and supporters. I have spoken extensively about my role and work on the GST committee to Labor Party members and indeed to many members of the community in Tasmania in the last few months. I am yet to find one Labor Party member who has seriously questioned the Labor Party's approach on the GST.
—Bob Hogg.
—I am talking about my Tasmanian colleagues in the Labor Party. We went to the election with a fundamental commitment to vote the GST down. I have made it very clear that the Australian Labor Party intend to vote down the goods and services tax. The Labor Party are not going to produce a so-called warm, soft and cuddly GST. That is not our function. We believe a GST is fundamentally unfair, and we do not believe that any amount of window-dressing of a GST will produce fairness and equity for Australians, nor do we believe that the so-called protections that this government is arguing are there will be maintained anyway. We have had this argument time and time again. As I say, I am yet to find a Labor Party member who questions our particular approach. They want us to vote this down. They do not want us to be producing a warm, soft and cuddly GST because they do not believe that can emerge.
What I have encountered from time to time—including at a barbecue I was having over Easter with some farmers in the Forth Valley, close to where I live—is some fairly significant ignorance about the impact of a GST. I am not criticising the particular people I was having the barbecue with, but at least two of them thought that payroll tax was being replaced as a result of this package. So there is still, unfortunately, a considerable level of misunderstanding, despite the government's publicly funded $20 million propaganda campaign in the lead-up to the last election.
Senator Woodley said to my colleague Senator Cook and to other Labor senators who were here, `Why haven't you done a survey of consumers to see whether they want to know this particular information—whether they want to know what the GST price is and want it included on their receipt?' Senator Woodley, we have not done a consumer survey. That is our judgment, and it is not just our judgment. For example, we heard from Mara Bun from the Australian Consumers Association. I do not believe the Consumers Association had done a survey of consumers to determine their view on this matter, but it was their expert judgment, and very firmly their expert judgment, that the 10 per cent should be shown on receipts. I would submit that that is the case in other policy approaches. For example, in relation to choice of superannuation, this government is developing what are called `key feature statements'. I do not agree with the government's policy, but these key feature statements are designed to give information to consumers; whether they understand it or not is another issue. That is not as a result of any survey this government has done or the Consumers Association have done; it is a result of the expert opinion of groups like the Consumers Association believing that this is what should occur.
There are a couple of comments that Senator Kemp made. He did allege that many businesses, particularly small businesses, would not have the software in place in time to ensure that this particular pricing is carried out. That must be one of the largest furphies I have heard for some time in this debate. It 
 almost matches the assertion that the high-roller changes were minor technical amendments, but that is another issue.
—Not quite the same excitement.
—No. But surely recording on receipts the actual price of the tax, the 10 per cent, is a very minor aspect and will be a very minor contribution to any costs for the purchase of software. Labor does not believe that it would be a significant cost. In fact, I suspect that the cost of doing this would be zero or very minor in the context of the general compliance costs that are being forced on not just small business but also large businesses. For those who already have the software, it would be a very minor change to their existing software. For those who do not have the software and have to purchase it and/or the hardware as a consequence of a GST, I do not think there would be any additional cost. I think the arguments about compliance costs as advanced by Senator Kemp are simply not correct.
In the lead-up to the last election there was a particular constant mantra and misleading argument from the government. There was a range of those, but one of the allegations they made was that the wholesale sales tax was a secret tax, a hidden tax. They said, `Why don't we get it out in the open? With a GST it is going to be out in the open. We want the consumers to see the effect and the impact of a GST.' This is the government's proud boast, and what Labor is attempting to do with its amendments is to hold the government to their word on this issue. We want this tax out in the open. We want consumers to see it, and we are picking up the government's own rhetoric on this point. It is not our commitment. Senator Murray is right: we did not give a commitment about the wholesale sales tax. We did not give a commitment about the GST in the lead-up to the last election except a commitment to defeat it, hopefully to see it never return to the political landscape in Australia.
There are some very important practical reasons why our amendments should be supported. The first is the issue of the transition stage for a GST and its implementation 
 in that first year or two. It is very important that consumers are able to determine the effect, and part of determining the final price is knowing that goods did or did not have a wholesale sales tax. I would concede that the number of consumers who are going to work out what the approximate price should be as a result of the abolition of the wholesale sales tax will be relatively small, but some will want that information to determine whether the wholesale sales tax reductions are being passed on in full. We do not believe that they are going to be passed on in full in many areas. But it is important that consumers have the information about the 10 per cent tax on most goods and services.
This brings me to the second point: the GST is not going to apply to all goods and services, so it is important to know which goods and services it is going to apply to.
—Not high rollers.
—We know it is not going to apply to high rollers according to the government. In some shape or form the government is going to make sure high rollers are exempt or it is going to get the states to exempt them. That is another issue, Senator Conroy, but a very important issue.
In the context of the GST not applying to all goods and services, it is important to know those that are going to be taxed and those that are not going to be taxed. That is why the level of the tax should be shown on the receipt. My colleague Senator Cook rightly referred to the submission from the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and its representative Miss Nicky Cusworth. There are many things that I did not agree with in their submission, but in terms of a witness presenting a case with some facts and some backup support, she was one of the most impressive representatives of the business community that presented submissions to our committee hearings in Perth in Western Australia. She very strongly maintained that, in terms of transparency, the tax should be shown in full.
As I said, the issue of transparency is very important. This is the government that is introducing a very major new tax by any measure. We can agree on that, at least: a 
 very major new tax into the Australian economy and community with very substantial effects and impacts on the community. We have lived with the wholesale sales tax for a long time; I hope we live with it for a lot longer. But there are practical difficulties, as Senator Cook touched on—it could be done; I would certainly concede that, but we are not promising it should be done—of showing the impact of the WST through to the consumer. We did not make a promise at the last election to show the impact of the WST.
—You missed the point of the argument.
—No, I did not miss the point of the argument, Senator Kemp. We did not make that commitment. I am submitting that the practical difficulties of showing a WST are very substantial indeed. Do we show the impact of tariffs, which are effectively a tax, on goods and services in the community when they are sold at the retail end? Of course we do not. You take a practical view about the impact of tariffs.
I think there is an element of peevishness in the Democrats' approach. They are effectively saying, `You're not supporting any of our amendments so we are not supporting yours.'
—Fair enough.
—Senator Lees, for the principled Democrats I submit that that is not a particularly principled position, particularly after Senator Woodley's homily to us before lunch about playing politics and not playing politics. I would submit to the Democrats that there are very good policy reasons indeed why we should show the tax on receipts. There are good political reasons, as well.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-05-12,"—I rise to support the Labor Party amendment and I want to respond to a number of issues that have come up so far in the debate, starting with the government and Senator Kemp. Here you are: you have $20 million worth of advertising, you are proud as Punch of the GST, proud as Punch this morning and all during the election, as was the Treasurer last night, but what happens when it comes to 
 the crunch of actually putting it up-front for people to see?
—They don't want to boast about it.
—That is exactly right: they don't want to boast about it. It is the tax package that does not really have a GST in it. Don't mention the GST. I debated a Liberal party member during the election campaign and each of us had 15 minutes. After 15 minutes of speaking from the member for Indi it was discovered that he had not mentioned the GST once. Fifteen minutes from a federal member and not once did he mention the GST. And that is how this continues to be. They will talk about tax cuts, they will talk about this and they will talk about that, but as soon as it comes to the hard ball on the GST, don't mention it.
Senator Kemp has indicated the compliance cost issue. I am surprised, Senator Kemp, because I am sure you are familiar with the evidence presented to the committee. Accounting group after accounting group, representatives from New Zealand and business groups came before us to tell us how simple this GST was going to be for the small business community in particular—all that you needed to do was put an extra column on your ledger; and for those poor small businesses that did not already have a computerised system, the answer was, `This is going to help them modernise and it will cost them only $150 to buy a new package.'
I had a degree of scepticism about $150, but let us take the government and the evidence on face value. We are talking about systems that are being designed at the moment, systems that will be designed after the final vote is taken and all the amendments are in place—if there are any. Those companies that design these packages have the broad outline ready but they know it could be an amended package and they will not complete their product until after they see the black and white of the legislation. In those computer codes they write and put into a package, all that will be needed is one extra line. Out of thousands and thousands of lines of computer code to design these new software packages, 
 one extra line is going to be needed to accommodate this particular amendment.
One line out of tens of thousands of computer codes into $150 cannot come to much more in compliance costs, Senator Kemp. It is not as though there are previously existing packages that you can just pick up from New Zealand, bring across and put in place. You have to have a new computer software package designed for the Australian system that is coming on. To say that there are significant compliance costs to meet this particular amendment is a furphy, an absolute furphy.
We had witness after witness, from the National Farmers Federation to the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry—I think Senator Sherry has already referred to Ms Cusworth—all saying that they believe in transparency. They believe that it is necessary to have the docket with the GST on it. One of the organisations that appeared before us, one august organisation of which one of our senators is a former official, and has direct experience in the retail industry is the shop assistants union. The shop assistants union was asked about hiding the amount of the GST and what the concerns were. Mr Blandthorn gave a very comprehensive submission—
—An excellent submission.
—It was an excellent submission. Mr Blandthorn made the following point:
We make the point in our submission that the introduction of a new tax which leads to increased costs of goods and services will hit consumers. In many cases, the first time consumers are hit with those costs they are going to be surprised. The people at the front, that is, the shop assistant serving the customer is the person we are concerned for.
We believe that once the GST is introduced, people will take out their anger on the people serving them. That is why we ask in our submission whether anyone has considered the impact of the GST on those people at the front line, those people actually serving the customers, when they are suddenly open to abuse and criticism because of something that is beyond their control. They are the only people that consumers can take out their ire on.  

That is, except at the next election, when people will have seen the real impact, as opposed to the froth and bubble that they were told about, and when they will get a chance to take their ire out on the government—if they are successful in passing this legislation. We have the legitimate concern of an organisation representing 250,000 shop assistants around Australia, all at the forefront of dealing with the impact of the GST. They are not involved in an esoteric philosophical debate in this chamber; they are at the forefront, the front line, of having to deal with this.
Senator Mark Bishop interjecting—
—I wouldn't go that far, Senator. The hypocrisy of the government's position on this has already been pointed out. Equally, the hypocrisy of the Business Coalition for Tax Reform has also been pointed out. Their advertising campaign can only be described as deceitful. There they were, with $4 million, talking about the `hidden taxes'. Remember the ripping ads? `Ripped off' and `hidden taxes' was their implication. There was never a word in their $4 million advertisements about the fact that they were supporting a hidden GST. The hypocrisy of the Business Coalition for Tax Reform on this issue is only matched by that of the government. The National Farmers Federation, the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the shop assistants union and St Vincent de Paul came before us and said, `We want to see it exposed.'
—That was a poorer version of Senator Cook's speech.
—Senator Cook was particularly eloquent today.
Senator Kemp interjecting—
—I agree with you. I will come to Senator Woodley and Senator Lees in a minute. The hypocrisy of the government is in saying one thing and doing another. Recently in this chamber we had a debate on the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill. The government championed the need for transparency, accountability and improved disclosure. Senator Kemp and Senator Campbell are on the parliamentary record. They 
 outlined why they wanted a charter of budget honesty. I quote:
What we are doing in this charter of budget honesty is bringing in a new improved accountability, ensuring that the public is properly informed . . . 
That was Senator Kemp, on 1 October 1997, talking about ensuring that the public was properly informed. Senator Campbell said:
The improvement of the fiscal position will only be achieved through greater discipline, transparency and accountability in government fiscal policy . . . Transparency and the accountability of government will be substantially increased through improved disclosure . . . 
The government on one hand are saying that, when it suits them, they are about transparency and disclosure but, when it might not suit their political agenda, it is off the table. Senator Kemp has made a number of points about the WST and disclosure. I will give you a news flash, Senator Kemp. It is easy to disclose the WST on food; it is zero. The WST on utilities and housing is also zero, as is the case with a range of other goods. It is very easy. There is not much need for a discussion on it. It is zero on the necessities of life. There is no need for disclosure because it is already there.
I now turn to the Democrats—Senator Murray, Senator Woodley and Senator Lees. They have expressed disappointment at our unwillingness to support some of their amendments. They have accused us of playing politics, playing hardball. Recently the following amendment was moved in this chamber:
At the end of the motion, add ""but that the Senate condemns the Government for:
(a) unfair tax cuts, with more than 50% of the benefits going to the top 20% of income earners—
that is a fact which is not denied by the government—
(b) tax cuts for higher income earners which far outweigh the increases in social security payments for lower income earners—
that is another fact—
(c) creating a situation where a couple with no children earning $100,000 gets 5 times the benefit of a low single income family with three children"".
I can understand why the government did not want this to be on the public record and for 
 this amendment to get up. I understand their position. They are ashamed of some of the things that they have done in this package. What surprised me was that the Democrats took a walk, filled those chairs at the back of the chamber and abstained. We lost.
How could you possibly come into the Senate today and accuse us of playing politics and say that we will not support good wholesome amendments like the ones you are moving, when you walked? You walked and that is what matters. How can you possibly oppose a statement that says, `Unfair tax cuts with more than 50 per cent of the benefits going to the top 20 per cent of income earners'? You stated the unfairness of this package day in and day out. I understand the government did not want them on the public record but where were you? I think Senator Margetts voted with us, but where were the Democrats? That was not the only one. We had an emotion—
—An emotion?
—We certainly had plenty of emotion, but we also had an amendment that read:
. . . the Senate condemns the Government for:
(a) misleading the Australian people about the real price effects of the GST—
a fact uncovered in the Senate inquiry—
(b) inadequately resourcing the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, thereby not protecting consumers from GST related profiteering—
something acknowledged by the ACCC itself—
(c) threatening the viability of small business with unprecedented powers over small business pricing policies.
Again, I understand why the government wanted to vote this amendment down, but I do not understand how you can have the front to come in here and say to us that we were playing politics when again you took a walk back to the chairs against the wall. And it went on. It was not just those two. We had the another amendment which said:
. . . that the Senate condemns the Government:
(a) for the most complex, administratively expensive and job destroying tax this country has ever seen; and 

(b) for a GST that forces charities and other non-profit bodies to reallocate scarce resources to filling in forms for the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello), when these resources could be used to alleviate the misery and suffering of the poorest and most vulnerable members of the community.
You would have thought that we would have got that up, that there was a majority in this chamber to support an amendment like that. I understand why Senator Kemp was too ashamed and wanted to hide that. Again, what did the Democrats do? They took a walk. They abstained and the amendment was defeated. There is one final one—they weren't done yet—which said:
. . . that the Senate condemns the Government for:
(a) imposing a huge new paperwork burden on Australian small business through the GST, which does not exist under the wholesale sales tax;
(b) increasing the number of businesses paying indirect tax to the Government from 70,000 to 1.6 million; and
(c) imposing tax on the necessities of life for the first time.
Again, I understand the government—absolutely consistent with the government's position—but why did you abstain? Who was playing politics? Why did those amendments go down in this chamber? Do not come into this chamber and say to us that we are playing hard ball, that we are playing politics, when you had the chance to vote for these amendments and you took the walk, you pleaded the fifth, against the back wall. We lost. These were fair and reasonable amendments, but to our surprise the Democrats decided that they were going to help defeat them. They took the option of abstaining on all of them.
So, Senator Woodley, no-one has the high moral ground when it comes to this particular debate about amendments. We said up front to the Australian community that we would defeat the GST. We said we would not move amendments and we are sticking to the commitment that we gave.
—So what's this if it's not an amendment?
—We indicated that we had a couple of amendments—I take your point. Up front during the election campaign 
 we indicated that was our position and we are sticking to it. The mistake in your logic is that you think you can make this fair. You cannot make this fair. This bill is an atrocity and you cannot make it fair.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-12,"—I have been a little provoked by Senator Conroy, but I must indicate that I have corrected on the record previous statements by members of the Labor Party concerning your amendments in the second reading stage which, as you know, are an expression of opinion but have no effect on the bill. At the time I indicated that there were amendments which we supported, there were a couple we opposed and there were a number we abstained on. For the number we abstained on, in fact we had far stronger real-life amendments which change the GST bill materially. Your amendments simply did not go far enough. That was our purpose in asking.
The latest second reading amendment you outlined was on the essentials of life. We are sitting here ready to go on the amendment which deals with the exemption of food, which I think runs to three pages—not a second reading amendment, not a hands up and we just think there is a problem here but we are not going to do much about it kind of amendment; these are real amendments. This is where you put your money down.
We were making sure we could see exactly where you sat on your second reading amendment so that we are going to counterpose that with where you sit on our amendment. Then we will have the battle of the amendments in the public relations war. I think you are going to lose because you are going to be out there saying, `We had the second reading amendment which indicated our policy and our approach, but we actually opposed the amendment which would have made food GST free. Oh and we opposed the amendment which would affect the charitable problem. Oh and sorry about your cultural organisation. Education, this is a real problem, but we couldn't quite get beyond the second reading amendment.'
That policy position I understand. I think this is a very sound statement of a policy 
 position. I have no problem with your views on that, but you do not have the numbers and we do not have the numbers. If this GST goes through without the amendments which would help cultural organisations, educational organisations, health organisations, charitable organisations, churches, the poor and the disadvantaged, then you will be culpable. We do not have the numbers and nor do you.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMPENSATION MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—I do not wish to intrude into the debate between the Democrats and the Labor Party but I think that we now need to move on. I think I may have the support of the Leader of the Democrats, Senator Lees. There are a couple of general comments I could make.
Senator Lees interjecting—
—I thought you were providing support. I will make a couple of comments. The first is that it is very clear, Senator Woodley, that you have sorely provoked the Labor Party. I think that is very true. I do not know whether that was your intention or not but, if it was, you have scored 100 per cent—and congratulations. My second comment is that Senator Conroy repeated, by and large, the speech that Senator Sherry gave, which by and large repeated the speech that Senator Cook gave.
I thought it was a pretty good debate today. We did not agree on a lot of things, but it was a considered debate: a lot of questions were asked and a lot of questions were answered. I thought it was a good debate, and it is unfortunate that we are now seeing some further time-wasting. I think that is a great pity. The Labor Party official spokesmen assured me that they were very keen to move on to the amendment that Senator Lees wishes to move, and the Labor Party were going to pull their speakers off. I think it is a pity that did not happen; we may have saved ourselves an hour or so.
I will turn to specific questions that a number of colleagues have raised. Senator Murray, nothing prohibits a business separating out a GST. The only time they would not be able show a GST amount is when there is no GST. For example, where an unregistered business sells an item, showing a GST would 
 be misleading. I think that answers the question you put to us. You spoke at some length about the ACCC, and I think those issues are better dealt with when they come before the Senate in the relevant bill. My view is that we should deal with them at the relevant time rather than dealing with them out of sequence. So please bear with me on that.
Senator Harradine raised a number of questions—he is not in the Senate at the moment, but I will bring my answers to his attention—in relation to what the practices are around the world. There are varied practices around the world. My advice is that many of them make it difficult to know what the full price is, and I think this is the most important fact for consumers. Further, many countries have multiple rates, which may make separate reporting more relevant.
In relation to some papers that Senator Harradine referred to us, the advice I have on the IMF Occasional Paper No. 88, Guidelines for Administering a VAT: Value Added Administrative and Policy Issues 1991 says that for invoices provided to final consumers in the unregistered sector, the price may be shown as including VAT. My advice is that the IMF prefers a simplified invoice for final consumers, and I understand this is entirely consistent with the approach the government is taking.
—What is the unregistered sector? What does it mean?
—We stress that we have developed an Australian model and we think it is world best practice. We have obviously looked at what other countries do.
—There is no point quoting something if you don't explain what it means.
—Could I just finish my remarks, if you don't mind, so I can go through the questions that people have raised? Senator Sherry was not listening to the comments I made. I was reading out, in relation to issues such as software, a facsimile I have received from the Australian Retailers Association. I was putting the view that they had put to the government.
—They are wrong.
—I am just correcting the record. It was a vital bit of information that was missed from your comments. I was providing information supplied by the Australian Retailers Association.
I think that probably covers the broad issues which were raised. I think we have canvassed this at some length. It has been quite a long debate on this particular item. The views have been put on the table, and it is the government's preference that we put the motion so we can decide this and move on to the next one.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMPENSATION MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-05-12,"—I intend to be brief. I just wanted to respond to Senator Kemp's continual allegation, any time anybody stands up to speak, that they are filibustering. The only problem we have is that his adviser is getting writer's cramp. In terms of the Democrats and the suggestions that Senator Lees made about food—and Senator Murray is saying, `Food! These are fair amendments!'—the problem for us on the Labor side, and for the voters out there in Voterland, is the definition of food. Throughout the election campaign and for a fair bit of the inquiry, the Democrats had one view of food. Today they have a string of amendments.
—They changed from breakfast, lunch and dinner.
—That is exactly right. They had a broad definition of food. Then we got to the business end of the season, as they say, and food had narrowed a bit—and a couple of things that were in were now out. We went from the Norwegian to the French, to the Swedish, and we finished with the Irish model.
Over the next few weeks when the Democrats say, `Trust us, back our amendments on food,' what concerns me is that, by the time we get to 30 June, food will be a lettuce and a tomato bought at Coles in Manuka. And by midnight it could be just the lettuce. So when they say to us, `We want you to back our amendments on food, we want you to help make this fair,' and the government is saying, `No, we are not going to cop that' and they put the pressure on, we are concerned that food will get narrower and narrower. There is 
 only one way to make this legislation fair, and that is to reject it outright.
The revenue base was proven yesterday in the budget not to be broken—furphy gone. Now we are being asked by the Democrats to take it on trust, and I do not believe we are in a position to agree to that. I happen to think that food is more than a lettuce and a tomato, and that there is only one way to make sure that this bill is made fair, that is, by defeating it.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMPENSATION MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1999-05-12,"—Obviously I cannot let those nonsense comments go. For the poor unfortunate people—of which there are probably three—still listening to this broadcast today after some of the utterances from the Labor Party, I do have to explain the difference between pious amendments that the Labor Party moved to the second reading and the amendments, if we ever get to them today, we wish to move that will actually make a difference.
For those who may be listening—the three or four left—pious amendments can be attached to the second reading, but they do nothing, they achieve nothing, they do not actually make a difference. Nothing happens to actually change the law and government policy. Our problem with a lot of those amendments was that the issues they identified—the difficulties within this package—are the very ones we are trying to sort through and to sort out. So we were not about to vote for a series of worthless amendments which would just attach themselves to the bill and go nowhere, that did in fact imply that that is what we could be left with at the end of the third reading—to still have those amendments in the bill.
If Senator Conroy, who has unfortunately left the chamber, bothered to read our food amendment, he would see that not only is it detailed, not only does it show that it is the one used by 17 of the 23 OECD countries that treat food as a special case, but he would also see very clearly that we actually make sure that there are no extra compliance costs. We overcompensate for the difficulties of compliance. So we were not about to vote for second reading amendments that are largely 
 useless when what we wanted to do was to get to the third reading stage and actually make a difference.
To answer a number of Labor senators who have spoken on this and who attributed to the Democrats all sorts of motives for moving their amendments: we genuinely want to look at tax system that is better than the one we have now. That is why we have bothered and gone to the trouble of putting together the amendments and of arguing them in the community and are now going through the process hour after hour in this chamber hoping that we can get them up, because if we do not get a broad cross section of our amendments up, we will simply be voting the bills down.
But I can see where the Labor Party is going. They moved their second reading amendments so they had on the record some concerns without actually having to do anything; so that if this does get through—and it will not be on our vote—with food in it, without fixing the problems for charities, with the poor definitions of health and education and with the diesel fuel problems, the Labor Party will go to the next election and say, `We identified those concerns, we moved these amendments, now we will go to the election and we'll campaign to take food out, we'll campaign for charities, we'll campaign for the rest of the health sector and education and all the rest of it.' So what you are really doing is having a bit both ways. You have moved some amendments which, for those out there who do not understand the political process, will sound like you have done the right thing, but in fact you have voted against the key amendments at the time that they could have really made a difference.
We will see what happens as we now progress, but my final comment is just to the nonsense that Senator Conroy suggested when he implied that we had in some way reduced our commitment to no tax on food. We did not. We actually listened carefully to the evidence from the fast food industry to make sure that we taxed like products the same. We listened to the arguments from dietitians, health groups and rural producers. There are a lot of jobs in this for rural Australia— 
thousands of jobs; 6,000 to 8,000 jobs—if we can keep the tax off fresh food. We listened carefully to the tax commissioner's concern and indeed to Mr Costello and his thermometer on hot and cold chooks and hot and cold pies so that we could get it right on the compliance grounds. That is why we threw out the English model and why—as we look at what the government wants, which is the New Zealand model—we cannot accept the New Zealand model, which is tax everything, either.
We have spent some time listening to all the evidence—and I know Senator Cook listened to the evidence as well—before the committee before deciding on our model of which food amendments we would move. They are all there. Had Senator Conroy been here, I could have sat with him and taken him through them.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMPENSATION MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,1999-05-12,"—I want to make a range of comments with respect to this particular issue and the amendment moved by the Australian Labor Party. I will try to confine my comments in the interests of getting through this process, but I think there are a couple that need to at least be put on the record.
I have to say that I actually agree with what Senator Woodley said this morning in response to some of the issues raised by Senator Cook: this is a political issue. There is no doubt it is a political issue, and there is no doubt in anybody's mind that the government has made a political decision about how it will deal with the presentation of the GST. It is done specifically to protect its very exposed rear end in this issue.
It is well known, as Senator Woodley referred to this morning, what happened to the Canadian government that introduced a GST. It is also well known what happened to the Labour Party in New Zealand after it introduced a GST. The political results for governments that have gone down this path have not been terribly good. Their experiences have not been terribly positive in terms of the political outcomes for them as a result of introducing it. 
—Stop weeping then, George. You sound very sad, George.
—It is interesting, Minister, because an article appeared in the Canberra Times  on 18 March which referred to what had occurred in New Zealand and referred to the fact that the Prime Minister had actually learnt some lessons from the New Zealand experience. The article went on to say:
Having won the October 3 election, the Prime Minister has been quick to claim a mandate, but there seems little doubt that coalition hardheads have not overlooked the closeness of the result or that their parliamentary leader went within an ace of making them a one-term regime. It is in these circumstances that the coalition must now be careful to ensure that the GST does not remain an election issue, that the Howard government is not made to pay the same price as the former New Zealand Labour government. To ensure this is not the case, the coalition must ensure that the GST is introduced as seamlessly and unobtrusively as possible. Just like New Zealanders, Australians will have to be able to walk into a shop and buy an item without realising they are paying a GST. If Mr Howard doubts how important this will be, he need only visit some of the nations where a GST or a value added tax is in place and where it is quite deliberately added on to the marked retail price consumers are expected to pay.
There are a range of examples I could go through. I want to quote a couple to reinforce that position. A report, in relation to the application of a GST in Singapore, in the Straits Times  of 1 April 1996 states:
A Consumers Association of Singapore check last month showed that nine out of 15 GST and non-GST registered furniture shops, electrical and electronic shops and restaurants excluded GST from the prices of advertised goods.
Under the Goods and Services Act, GST-registered shops must include GST in the prices they quote to customers, advertise in the media or display in the shops . . . 
Mr Gerry Harvey from Harvey Norman made some comments which were reported in December last year:
Mr Harvey said that, if a GST was introduced, the new tax should be clearly displayed as a separate add-on to the retail price, similar to the `plus tax' method used in the US.
`Everything should be sold as plus tax,' he said. `Customers should be well aware of how much of they're paying in tax. It should be like that now. 

`If you buy something now, it should be at, say, $10, plus whatever tax is added on.'
Mr Harvey said that, when people were aware of the amount of tax they were paying, they tended to make governments more accountable.
`If governments are more accountable, there is even the possibility we might get better government,' he said.
There are a range of examples like that which I think justify the Labor Party moving this amendment. At the end of the day, this is the one opportunity that may present itself to protect consumers' rights in this whole process—rights which have been totally ignored. I want to quote from one of the submissions to reinforce that point. It was a submission made on behalf of the Australian Consumers Association. Under the heading `Disclosure of the GST', they said:
Unfortunately, the proposal for a new tax system fails to address the issue of `hidden' taxes. While the publicity surrounding a GST will keep this tax in people's minds, it is not easy to calculate the individual's tax burden—as is possible in the current income based tax system. We urge the government to improve the level of disclosure by legislating that prices must be given with the GST `on top'. This will improve the transparency of the tax and make price monitoring simpler.
In Canada prices are given as the amount `plus GST' with the total transaction broken into these components, given on the receipt. This allows consumers to understand the effect of the GST on the price they pay, and to calculate the tax burden they are incurring. The UK system is more arbitrary, with some large chains giving a price breakdown receipt for travellers.
ACA encourages the government to become world leaders in GST disclosure to improve consumers' understanding of the tax and minimise over-inflationary price increases.
That in summary, Minister, is what the Australian Labor Party amendment to this bill is all about. It is about ensuring transparency of the taxes that people are being asked to pay on goods and services as a result of the introduction—if it is voted for by the Senate—of your ANTS package. It is about ensuring that, every time the public go in to buy a loaf of bread or clothes for the kids or to pay for their education, they will know at the end of the day what tax burden is being imposed upon them.
That is what the amendment is all about. That is what you are politically frightened of in terms of your position on this tax. What you want to try and bury as quickly as possible is the real impact over time that your package will have on the average Australian. And that is what this amendment, if it is carried by the Senate, will expose.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMPENSATION MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-05-12,"—Mr Temporary Chairman, I was actually in continuation at the time we were last dealing with this bill, and I was dealing with the fact that the Greens (WA) support the issue of transparency in relation to the GST. I was talking about the fact that these days you rarely in the main supermarket chains pick up a good with the price marked on it. I was indicating that we have an amendment which will be moved later because it relates to the Trade Practices Act and I would like to think we could get support from the ALP on it. It actually enables the ACCC, when they believe it is necessary, to also require—especially when there might be complaints and so on—that a business put the GST information on the price ticket.
Prices, in my understanding, are generally about what you see before you buy. If it is on the receipt, it is the cost of what you have already paid. I know also that the Australian Consumers Association want it to be as open as possible. If we are wanting to be world leaders, I would think that the Labor Party would not only support this motion in relation to the dockets but would also want to enable people before they buy—before they have actually committed their hard-earned money—to find out what the price component is and what is tax and what is not.
I must admit that at one stage we thought it might be a case of one or the other on these amendments, but I think they can live together. As I say, I will be moving mine at a later time because it does relate to the Trade Practices Act. I indicate that the Greens (WA) will support this amendment. I hope that the Democrats were not saying that second reading amendments are always worthless amendments; sometimes they do have an important role to play. We are getting robust debate on some of these issues.
I believe that it is interesting that this is one of the few substantive areas—apart from the government's amendments, which are often problematical—which the Labor Party have chosen to support. The Greens (WA) will support the ALP's amendment and we would like to think that they will allow the ACCC discretion when they believe it is necessary for people to clearly know before they buy, when there might be some evidence that consumers may be being misled.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMPENSATION MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—I can answer the question. I think Senator Margetts flagged, while I was speaking, that she had a bit of concern about a lack of clarity in one of the comments I made. Senator Margetts, I spoke about the unregistered sector, and I think that caused you some concern. The unregistered sector is the sector that is not part of the GST system—in other words, it includes the final consumer. It includes business below the registration threshold that choose not to register. Those are two areas. The registered sector is entitled to a tax invoice.
I can now quote from a paper that was referred to by Senator Harradine. Issued by the International Monetary Fund, it is entitled Value-Added Tax: Administrative and Policy Issues and is edited by Mr Alan Tait. I will read the relevant paragraph, `Final Consumer Invoices', into the Hansard:
This is a simplified type of invoice for registering sales to unregistered persons, who should be considered final consumers under the VAT. On this invoice, the price may be shown as including the VAT and the name and address of the buyer may be omitted.
So that provides the answer that Senator Harradine was seeking. We have largely dealt with the sorts of issues Senator George Campbell raised. We will differ on a lot of those, but if there was a logic to Senator Campbell's comments that governments that brought in this sort of tax reform lost elections I would have thought, Senator Campbell, that you would be the first person over here supporting what the government is doing.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMPENSATION MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-12,"—I have been listening to this debate very closely. I was not going to contribute but 
 I was listening to Senator George Campbell speaking in relation to this amendment, and it is one that arose at the committee that I was a member of, the Senate Community Affairs References Committee. He made specific reference to the support of the Australian Consumers Association for this amendment. I do have a great deal of time for the Australian Consumers Association. I think they are one  of the more effective advocates in this country for the interests of consumers and of the general public. Some of the other contributions my colleagues have made indicate why the Democrats are inclined not to agree with them on this specific amendment.
There are a range of other aspects such as Senator Kemp's reference previously to the curiousness of wanting to label a GST but not label a wholesale sales tax—and other points like that. But it is also worth pointing out that if the ALP are wanting to use the Australian Consumers Association as support for the validity of backing a particular amendment, I would certainly be interested in knowing why they are ignoring the Australian Consumers Association when they are talking about the need to exempt food from the GST, for example, or when they are talking about the need to modify the tax package to make it fairer in a range of other ways.
It is all very well to pull out the ACA in relation to one particular amendment which will not actually fundamentally change the fairness of the package. Surely the major aspect of what we are supposed to be about in this parliament in considering proposals that the government put forward is to make sure there is a net benefit to the Australian community, particularly to those who are less well off. I think that is what our priority has to be. The Australian Consumers Association gave lots of very informative and very helpful evidence to the Senate committee, not just on the issue of food but on other areas such as treatment of health, for example, which we will be getting to a little later on in this legislation.
I suggest to the opposition that, if they are wanting to point to the position of the Australian Consumers Association on any particular issue, they look at the position of the 
 Australian Consumers Association on far more fundamental issues, such as ensuring that this legislation, which this parliament quite responsibly has to consider, generates a fair outcome. They should look at the position of the Australian Consumers Association on a whole range of other issues, including particularly the exemption of food, the treatment of health and the treatment of community non-profit organisations. All those issues will fundamentally affect people's standard of living and the fairness of our entire tax system—something that will not be affected by whether or not there is a label on something in a supermarket. It is pretty obvious that the intention of this amendment is to maximise the potential electoral backlash from consumers having to be hit with a visual reminder of a tax every time they buy something. The amendment has not addressed in any way making the package fairer. To the Democrats, that is the fundamental and crucial aspect of what this legislation and our considerations are about, and that is what we should be focusing our attention on.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMPENSATION MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1999-05-12,"—There is one issue that I would like the Labor Party to give us some clarity on, because I think it does affect how we feel about these amendments. I do not want to make it hard for the Labor Party, particularly as Senator George Campbell was so kind in his remarks about me before. One of the issues that might not seem to affect this amendment but certainly does affect it and is why I am sceptical about it at the moment is that every Labor senator who has spoken so far has said that the GST is fundamentally unfair. I think that in a way, particularly if you are talking about the GST as currently presented in the legislation, I would agree with you about that. I noticed also that in constantly saying that—I am not sure which Labor senator said this; perhaps it was Senator Cook—they warned us about was that if the GST was passed then it would stay in place even if there was a future Labor government because, they said, it cannot be unscrambled.
I would like the Labor Party to spell out in more detail why the GST cannot be unscram 
 bled. You have told us that the current tax model is much fairer and that it is good. Why couldn't you simply announce a return to this model, obviously with the modifications which you believe would improve it—I presume that would include tax credits, as announced by Labor during the last election campaign—and then give voters a clear choice at the next election? It would be a choice between the government that introduced a GST and the opposition that will abolish the GST, if it is elected to government. This was the choice at the 1998 election, so would it not be appropriate to make it the choice at the next election? You may be able to give us some detail about why the GST could not be unscrambled.
If you cannot answer that question, we would be very sceptical about your amendment. Why would you want to have a computer print-out at the point of sale to show the GST? That is a terrible imposition. Why would you then say to consumers at an election, after 12 or 18 months of putting the GST up the noses of consumers by that device, `Sorry, we're going to leave it in place'? You can see the anomaly that I am pointing out. I am not going to use the word hypocrisy, because I eschewed that this morning, but George Megalogenis, writing an article in the Australian some weeks ago, put it very well when he said that there was basic hypocrisy in the Labor position—that is, for Labor to argue how bad the GST is and then refuse to abolish it if they win government after the next election. You can see the problem. I think George Megalogenis was right when he said that there is a basic hypocrisy in that position.
The problem with your second reading amendments, which really did not address the issue, is that they were pious waffle—fairy floss, if you like, that disappears as soon as the sun shines on it—whereas the Democrats were moving and are moving real amendments. Senator Conroy is the one who said that we were running away. Well, I do not know who is running away from real amendments. In any case, could you tell us whether, if a GST is passed, you would abolish it at the next election? If not, why not?

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-12,"—I realise that on the running sheet we have a Democrat amendment to be moved 
 next. I want to use this brief hiatus before the next amendment is moved to follow up something with the minister. He will recall, I am sure, with his razor sharp memory, the questions I raised with him on 27 April about the process followed in relation to the development of these tax proposals and the government's legal requirements under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. At that time, in his usual cooperative manner, he indicated that he would forward my questions and concerns to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage.
I am keen to know, firstly, whether he has been able to do that in amongst everything else on his schedule and, secondly, whether there is any information in relation to that matter that he could provide to the Senate to give an indication as to what processes were followed. Do the government have any further advice to indicate that their requirements and obligations under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act were adequately followed or, for some reason, do they not apply in this case?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMPENSATION MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1

You may have verbalised it during a part of the debate that I did not manage to hear, although I have been following it very closely. In relation to your short answer that the act does not apply, I can understand that aspect of the argument—certainly we are at the stage of proceedings where the legislation has already been put forward, formalised, investigated, et cetera, by Senate committees—but I would be interested in the environment minister's views or the details of the briefing in relation to the legal requirements when the proposals are being developed and the appropriateness of not triggering the act in relation to the develop 
 ment of those proposals. I am not sure if your briefing deals with that.

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1999-05-12,"—The Labor Party did not help us in that last division. I was trying to get an answer from them which may have helped me to decide how to vote in the last division. I wonder if they are prepared to give an answer now to my question about the next election and whether or not they would be prepared to abolish a GST if they were in government. It related to the amendment, in the sense that I could not see much point in supporting it.
You will remember my speech this morning, and I must have made an assumption—incorrectly—that you wanted the GST to be clearly labelled. It would have helped me to decide how to vote. But it is still relevant to a lot of the other amendments which we are putting forward. If we wanted a GST as part of the labelling process, it would confront people every time they went to a cash register, and you have said that if you were subsequently in government it could not be unscrambled. I wonder whether you have any detail of why it could not be unscrambled. It would help me in future as we work through other amendments.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMPENSATION MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,1999-05-12,"—I am tempted to my feet because the good Senator Woodley has made a couple of points. I am getting involved in the last part of the debate, and I somewhat regret that now, but I did want to see this progress today. Senator Woodley, the one thing about this tax package that I think everyone in here will agree with is that if it gets up either in its pure form or via Dublin or Belfast, or whatever you people are going to do to it by the time it gets through here, it is going to be one of the most significant tax changes—if not the most significant tax change—in living memory. What is going to happen is that a series of taxes will disappear. Some might take longer than others, but a number will disappear. The whole basis of indirect taxation as it is currently collected will disappear in favour of a retail turnover tax which, courtesy of your party, will be hidden—it will not be transparent to the public out there. This tax 
 will take either $25 billion or $30 billion annually out of the community and put it into the Treasury. I say $25 billion because, if you get your Irish model up, according to the government figures it will be a $5 billion change in the whole procedure.
I see Senator Lees is shaking her head. I could not care less if it were 5s 6d. The fact of the matter is that if you take something out of it, then it will be less. At the end of the day, it does not matter to us because we oppose it up hill and down dale. We do not care that much for the Irish option, the Norwegian option or, for that matter, any other option. We will not be voting for it.
The proposition that Senator Woodley has just put to us is whether we would get rid of it at the next election. Senator, I think you know the answer to that. We would have to promise immediately to put back all those taxes that had been taken off, many of which would be outside the jurisdiction of this place and, for that matter, the House of Representatives. One of the reasons I oppose this tax is that we do not know where the money is going to go and in whose hands the control of these massive amounts of funds will be.
The reality is that we are seeing not only a significant tax change—arguably one of the most significant tax changes—but also a devolution of considerable power in health, education and a number of other areas to state administrations. I have even seen floated in front of me various amendments which talk about the hypothecation further still to the third tier of government in this country—into local government. I will comment on that at the appropriate time. In answer to the question that you have asked—will we promise at the next election to somehow or other manufacture all of these tax moneys, to reverse this particular policy in every state and maybe even reverse it in every council district in the country—I think it is sufficient to say that, unfortunately, it would be impossible.
I am sure every member of the Labor Party would like to say, `Yes, it will be reversed if we get back to power,' but this will be change at such a significant level that it would take years, if not decades, to wind back. Coming from a low-grade state, I am 
 very concerned about what this will mean. If all of the health and education services that my constituents in South Australia are going to get will be as a result of the South Australian administration—and we are not going to have national standards on those services, we are not going to have national benchmarks and the Commonwealth government is walking away from it and saying, `This is a new kind of federalism'—then I think we are all going to be in for a bit of a hard time. But, at the end of the day, I suspect these changes that go through this place will be here for many a year, and that is irrespective of the way I vote, should they get up.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMPENSATION MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-12,"—On the running sheet it has, at the bottom of page 2, Democrats amendments 1 to 16 on sheet 1353 revised to be moved by leave together. I do not intend to do that. I move:
(1)	 Clause 35-5, page 73 (after line 21), at the end of the clause, add:
	 (3)	 If you supply food products affected by the definition of food for human consumption in section 38-2, and the total turnover of your business is less than $10 million, then you are entitled to a further refund of GST that is equivalent to 4% of the input credits payable in respect of GST-free food for a tax period.
I have separated that out deliberately because the major debate about whether food should be taxed or not taxed has rested on the simplicity issue. If you listen to the government and business, they have not focused on the equity argument, they have focused on the simplicity argument. That is about compliance costs. The food issue, as we all know, can be easily funded. The $3.5 billion that the Irish option propounds as opposed to the New Zealand option, which is what the government has, can be easily funded by reducing the income tax cuts at the top end of the proposed income tax scales. But the principal argument of business organisations and of the government has rested on simplicity and compliance. That is why I wish to settle this issue, if I can, by leading this amendment first.
This amendment seeks to ensure that small businesses affected by making food GST free 
 receive a small collection fee to cover the additional compliance costs. Research by the United States General Accounting Office suggests that zero rating increases compliance costs by between 30 and 50 per cent. So if your compliance cost was a dollar it would—
—Procedurally this seems a strange way to proceed because we are providing compensation assuming that a future amendment is passed. When they were taken together I could see some logic. Of course I will not be supporting it.
—Minister, it is not necessary for you to debate. Senator Murray is moving his amendment. If you want to take a point of order you can, otherwise I call Senator Murray.
—It did seem a strange way. I am just trying to be of assistance, but I think Senator Murray understands my point.
—I do indeed understand the minister's point, but we did not want to get this issue lost within the food definition issue. The food definition as to what should be in or out, how chickens are to be dealt with, what happens with yoghurt and all of that kind of stuff is bound to be raised and aired and will need to be dealt with.
Minister, I would understand your point most of all if I thought there was the remotest chance of this getting up. As we know, the Labor Party have indicated that they will not vote for our amendments and you have obviously indicated the same. So I know the numbers are against me. What I am trying to do is to focus on what I have found to be the core opposition to our proposal from the government and from business organisations. By focusing on that, I think that the next 17 amendments, which we will move by leave together tomorrow, will go quicker. For us, compliance is the issue.
Returning to what I was saying, the United States General Accounting Office does suggest that zero rating increases compliance costs by between 30 and 50 per cent. So if a compliance cost was a dollar, it would go up to between $1.30 and $1.50. Based on an estimate of 40,000 retailers being affected by 
 making food GST free, in Australia this would amount to a cost of between $13 million and $40 million.
Here is the first area of contention. The ABS figure we use to arrive at the number of retailers that would be affected is 40,000. The ATO used a figure of 300,000. I asked them on notice to confirm that that figure was accurate, and I have not had a response. Maybe it has not reached me; maybe it went through the secretariat. I personally have not received a response.
The collection fee would cost, on the basis of our amendment, around $40 million. That is four per cent of the input credits payable in respect of GST free food or about 0.2 per cent of food turnover. That is the next important issue: how much in terms of extra compliance costs would result from food being made GST free? Unfortunately we have only two figures available to us: one figure was provided by the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants and the other by the Democrats from their own calculations. Neither the government nor any other source has provided us with a compliance cost figure.
The ASCPA provided a compliance cost for making food GST free of $100 million. In the scale of things, if the entire argument against making food GST free rests on the compliance cost, then the cost of that compliance is relevant. If it is somewhere between $40 million at our top estimates and $100 million at the top estimates of the ASCPA, then it is a minuscule amount given the range of this proposal because the government's own figure for the compliance cost of introducing the GST across all business is $1.9 billion. In other words, our proposal, at the maximum, will cost five per cent extra in terms of compliance. We think it could be as low as two per cent extra. That is the cost.
On that very shaky foundation business organisations and government have built this edifice of the introduction of food being GST free as being unacceptable. We have had Mark Paterson, a very experienced, very capable head of the largest business organisation in this country, describing the introduction of GST-free food as a nightmare. It is not 
 a nightmare in cost terms. As we all know, the superannuation funds have estimated that the cost of complying with the government's superannuation tax is $100 million, and the government dismisses that and says it is just a consequence of a necessary law. So why would $100 million maximum for the compliance cost of making food GST free be a big issue? Why, in the words of Mark Paterson, experienced, capable leader of a business organisation, would it be a nightmare?
We step away from those judgments into the arena of international experience. Why is it not a nightmare for the majority of the 105 countries that have a GST-VAT to have food either differentially rated or zero rated? They do not find the compliance costs unbearable and they do not find the practice of making food GST free unbearable. In fact, it is very manageable. The committee heard all sorts of claims that a food definition would be impossible to police and would add hugely to compliance costs. It is not impossible to police in the 23 out of 27 OECD countries that have a GST-VAT. It is not impossible to police amongst the 700 million people affected within the OECD by food being GST free or being differentially rated. It is against that very unsound judgment that we should put into context the government's obduracy about refusing to contemplate this as a policy option. We think it is a superior option from an equity point of view. Their principal argument against it is on compliance costs, and we think the evidence that is before us is that the compliance cost issue is vastly overstated, both in cost and effect terms.
For all of the assertions and the photocopied VAT circulars from other countries, no empirical evidence of the size of the problem was produced to the committee. Senator Cook, who was the chair of the principal committee, will verify that very few submissions among the 1,500-plus that came to the committee actually dealt on an empirical basis with the compliance issue as regards food. The rough estimates of the likely compliance costs, as I said, came from the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants, who used the ATO figure of about 300,000 food outlets. Yet I do not know where they 
 get that from, because the ABS figure is 40,000. The Democrats election policy also overstated the cost. We had called for $120 million of compensation for small businesses affected by the zero rating. In other words, small businesses would have been overcompensated for the problems created by zero rating food. But the ASCPA estimate of compliance costs, if it was only 40,000 retail outlets, would mean that a figure of between $13 million and $40 million might be more appropriate. That cost is an awful lot less than the cost of $1.9 billion of putting the GST in generally, and it is an awful lot less than the cost of compensating the millions of Australians who will be detrimentally affected if food is taxed.
If this issue is the core claim by which the government try to counter our approach, they need to substantiate and validate the actual consequences of not taxing food. The first reason we have heard is that it will cost too much. I think that the Democrats have conclusively shown that it will not cost too much. The second thing they have said is that it will gut their package. In 1993 the coalition went to an election supporting food not being taxed under a GST proposal, so they have changed their tune since then. They say it will gut their package. They know it is easy to cover the $3.5 billion which it would cost under the Irish option by cutting the income tax cuts at the top end.
The third ground they have used is psychic costs. That might sound a bit fanciful, but I guess for someone running a butchery or a bakery somewhere the stress and the psychic costs of changing systems or of introducing new systems do indeed exist. But, if you are going to make such a claim, you have to go and look empirically at what were the consequences overseas where a GST or VAT was introduced and where food was zero rated or differentially taxed. I can assure you that the insane asylums, the psychiatric hospitals and the places which look after people who have been excessively stressed were not filled with people who found they had to make food GST free.
The other ground we have heard put up was the issue of time, that it would add unbearab 
 ly to the time that retailers in particular would need to devote to separating out items that were to be taxed from those which were not to be taxed. I can see some validity in that argument. But when I look at the fact that the government is proposing to exempt or make GST free over 80,000 businesses, including pharmacies and businesses in health, financial services, education and so on, which will themselves have to separate out those items which are GST free or not, I think they have shot themselves in the foot. If it is all right for those 80,000 businesses, why is it not all right for the 40,000 businesses which would be affected by making food GST free?
Let us return to the overseas evidence on compliance costs. I want to quote Professor Cedric Sandford, who is still running hard in this professional field. This remark is dated a bit: it was made in 1982. When he did a survey in the United Kingdom he said the following:
The average compliance costs for all repayment traders (i.e. zero-rated) was 35 per cent lower than that of payment traders . . . Where outputs are zero-rated or exempt, book-keeping is simplified and this may well account for the low ratios in most sectors . . . The particular combination (of a zero rate and a standard rate) appears from the figures to cause relatively few (compliance cost) problems.
I know everybody can produce their own pet expert, but there is an expert saying that doing things on this basis does not cause that much of a problem.
Then we have Professor Neil Warren, who is a very eminent economist who happens to believe that you should tax food, so he is not on my side. This is what he said:
It would therefore appear from the United Kingdom evidence that the burden on compliance of a GST, in aggregate, is not unduly serious.
Mr Simon Holdsworth, President of the New Zealand Employers Federation, reporting to the ACCI in Australia, said:
As far as our export invoicing is concerned, these are all zero-rated and done automatically by computer, and as we are able to claim any input tax there is no added cost associated with our (zero-rated) exports.
When you are dealing with exports you have to differentially rate. You may be running a 
 business where you have domestic sales and export sales. You are going to have to do the very same thing that you are going to have to do in a supermarket where some goods are taxed and some goods are not taxed. What does Mr Simon Holdsworth, President of the New Zealand Employers Federation, say? He says that it is a piece of cake.
Then we have the UK National Audit Office report on VAT compliance costs in 1994, which said:
The incidence of compliance costs in relation to trader turnover is broadly consistent between the United Kingdom (zero-rated), Germany and the Netherlands (which concessionally tax food), Canada (which zero-rates food) and New Zealand (which taxes food).
In other words, the compliance costs do not differ that much whatever you do.
In conclusion, the compliance cost issue in the sense it has been described to us by the government is dead. The argument should be about equity and not about compliance costs.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMPENSATION MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-05-12,"—I sought the call earlier only to indicate that, from the opposition's point of view, we have no objection to the Democrats proceeding in the manner which Senator Murray has indicated, that is, by taking his first amendment first and dealing with that. The Democrats, after all, have originated these amendments and it is appropriate that, if they want to refine their approach to presenting them to the chamber, they should do so.
I do not think it is appropriate for me to engage in a long intervention in the debate now. What I want to do, though, since I have taken to my feet and been given the call, is to indicate to the minister that I will have at the appropriate time a number of questions for him on food.
I make the observation in passing that the government has argued that this is the broadest possible base for the tax. Many of those who made submissions to the Senate select committee and who, if I may say it this way, are in the government corner, argued for the widest possible base. But the truth is that this is not a tax that the government is proposing 
 to apply to the widest possible base. It has made exceptions in health and education. No doubt at the appropriate time and in the right place it will be argued that they are exceptions on merit because of equity reasons or because of political sensitivity or because those sectors need to be regarded differently.
However, having established the principle that this is not a tax to apply to the widest possible base, to dismiss the Democrat argument that therefore an area of exemption should be further included, as if there were a principle here, sets a lie to the government position. They have not applied the principle and they recognise that by not doing so there are, at the margin, compliance difficulties for the sectors—certainly for health and education. But they have drawn the line here on food. I do not think the government argument holds water as an argument as to why they should simply turn their back on this area. I make those remarks because it is to the threshold point of this amendment that is now before us.
As I am in an observational mode, I should also observe that I do not necessarily agree with Senator Murray when he says that this is, if you like, a foundational question that may decide the fate of other food amendments. I do not necessarily see it in that light, but I do think there is a degree of misrepresentation of this position by the government. Those rusted-on government supporters were constant in their argument about the transitional costs of food. But if food were out, the companies would not be applying a GST and would be free of the cost of having to comply in that sense. So a whole population of companies would have a lesser compliance difficulty than would be the case if food were in.
All of my remarks are observations. I have couched them that way deliberately. We think it would be a good idea not to have a GST on food. We think it would be damned good idea not to have a GST at all and our preferred option is the latter, not just the former. As a consequence, we will be exercising our view at the appropriate time.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMPENSATION MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1999-05-12,"—I pick 
 up where Senator Cook left off and refer to some of those rostered-on government supporters in reading both their submissions to the committee and the evidence before it, and indeed some of the comments they have made when they have lobbied us. They actually want the government to put the tax on health and education on the grounds of simplicity: we should forget about equity, economics and everything else when going down this road. We have selected this amendment, and I will refer to Senator Kemp's point in a moment, to highlight how hopeless the government's case is when it has already exempted two areas, will not exempt a third, and its key argument is, `Sorry, we have to worry about simplicity and costs, et cetera, before we look at either economics or equity.'
I direct a few comments to Senator Kemp, who did raise an interesting issue—that is, if this amendment goes down, where do we go with the rest of them? I flag to the government that, if this amendment goes down, we will still proceed with the other amendments on food. If they both go down, we will continue to work as constructively as we can with this bill and attempt to get up as many amendments as we can. If, at the end of the day, we are in a similar situation to the one we are in now—that is, there is no negotiation with government and no real effort to reach any compromise; not even the opportunity to debate the case at any real level of food in and food out—and the government will not recommit the amendments before we take the final reading on this bill, we will vote the bill down.
We are not going to be pushed into a situation—if our food amendments go down—where we walk away from the rest of our amendments and the work we have done. We will pursue, issue by issue, one at a time, all of the things that we are committed to in the package of amendments that we have put before the chamber. The fact that we have isolated this particular food amendment to highlight the inadequacy of the government's argument against our food option does not mean that there is a problem, if this one goes down, in dealing with the rest of our amendments tomorrow.
Senator Murray has gone through some of the other excuses the government has given for refusing to look at excluding food. I find it most interesting that somehow in Fightback it was okay to have food excluded, but now Mr Costello says things like, `It would be unravelling the package if we take food out.' That is simply not true. There are 23 OECD countries that treat food as a special case. It has not unravelled their VATs or GSTs. In fact, it has made them fairer. It has reduced inflation. It has enabled them to have a package that works for their entire community, not as we see in this package before us—basically advantaging those who are already quite well off. We move this amendment with some interest in the result, but it is not going to mean that our other amendments become irrelevant or that we are not going to keep pursuing them.
I now turn to the amendment itself. Effectively, what the amendment will do is put in a collection fee for small retailers. We are acknowledging the small compliance cost. No-one has ever said one did not exist. The fact is that it is simply not a problem. It certainly will not be a problem if this amendment is successful because it overcompensates those small retailers. Senator Murray has already gone through the particular amounts. In our original package we had overcompensated even further. We have now looked through and taken on board all the evidence that was put before the Senate committee. Based on that evidence, these amendments deal with the issue of compliance costs for small business.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMPENSATION MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-12,"—As time is running out, I will deal with just a couple of matters which have been raised. If the Senate has no objection, I would like to deal with a number of questions on notice, including one which Senator Bartlett raised. I said that I would get back to him before the close of business tonight if I could, and I can get back to Senator Bartlett now.
There was a suggestion by Senator Bartlett that the government has disregarded Commonwealth environmental laws in relation to the tax package. That is wrong. The 
 advice I have been given is that the tax package is to be given effect by an act of parliament. The assessment procedures under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act do not apply to the passage of legislation by parliament. The EPIP Act has been in existence since 1974. My advice is that, in that entire time, no government has sought to designate under it a bill before the parliament, nor indeed a change to the taxation regime. That is the advice I have received.
Senator Crowley asked that I follow up some issues. Apparently, some offers had been made before the Senate committee to brief community groups. Senator Crowley asked me about the status and whether there had been a follow-up with the Treasury. I have some advice from the Treasury. To save time I seek leave to incorporate that advice in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Senator Crowley asked whether follow-up had occurred with 11 community groups that were offered briefings during committee hearings.
The following is the summary of organisations that the Treasury has met with or had contact with so far following the invitation of Government Senators during the Senate Community Affairs References Committee public hearings. The original list consisted of 11 organisations.
Treasury has met with 4 of the organisations
.	 Community Housing Federation of Australia (and associated groups)
.	 National Youth Coalition
.	 YWCA of Australia; and
.	 the Government of Independent Retirees.
Treasury has made contact by telephone with 5 groups
Australian Confederation of Child care;
.	 Consumers' Health Forum of Australia;
.	 National Association of Community Based Children's Services;
.	 Older Women's' Network; and
.	 the Seniors Economic Forum.
Treasury will also be sending further information to the Older Women's' Network and Seniors Economic Forum following on from the phone conversations.  

Treasury has attempted to contact the remaining two organisations, but have not been able to do so due to possible inaccuracies in the contact details (Mr Gerard Thomas of the Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants Federation and Mr Geoff Opray of the Qld RSL).
—I thank the chamber. Senator George Campbell asked me a question concerning the time period over which positive impacts on growth of a GST would occur. I have a response. The question was raised during the debate. I seek leave to incorporate that answer in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
TREASURY
SENATE QUESTION
Senator Kemp—on 28 April 1999 (Hansard page P3779) Senator George Campbell asked me a question without notice concerning the time period over which positive impacts on growth of a GST would occur.
Generally, computable general equilibrium models used to model indirect tax reform provide estimates over the medium to long term. The actual time frame will depend upon the scale and type of change being modelled and how long it takes for investment to change and the capital stock to fully adjust.
There are some models, however, configured to track short-term and year by year adjustments, eg the Monash Model, and Mr Chris Murphy's MM2.
—I thank the chamber. When people talk about rusted-on positions and people who appeared before the committee, they have to be very careful. They suggest that somehow their evidence can be discredited because they happen to be in the government's so-called tax cart or they seem to be pushing a particular vested interest. I think a fair assessment of the evidence that was given to the various Senate committees—in my view, the overwhelming weight of evidence—on the food issue was that it was opposed to the position which the Democrats have adopted.
The Democrats have adopted this position, I think I am correct in saying, almost from day one of the tax package. I think the government's position has been given very strong support in the evidence that was given to the Senate committees. It is wrong to 
 suggest that anyone who gives support to the government's position is—I do not know whether there is an inference that I could draw—somehow tainted, and anyone who gives evidence that supports the Democrats' position is therefore quite virtuous.
—That's true, isn't it?
—No, it is not true at all. I am trying, with difficulty, to elevate the debate. I know this is an exceedingly difficult task. Let me go through the evidence that came before the committees in statements by organisations. Mr Rob Bastian, the Chief Executive of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, representing some 150,000 small businesses, said:
It is our very strong belief that to exempt food would be a disaster. Without question, small business wants food included.
Quite rightly, most of us in this Senate recognise the important role that small business plays. We see that a lot of future jobs will come out of small businesses as they grow into larger businesses. We should not dismiss this sort of comment in a cavalier fashion. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, representing some 350,000 businesses, indicated that:
The potential exemption of food would be a critical blow to the fundamental attraction of a single rate, broad based GST. All the key advantages in terms of lower compliance burden, high level of voluntary compliance, ease of administration and improved competitiveness would be seriously eroded if food were to be exempt. It would be difficult to exaggerate the compliance nightmare which an exclusion or partial exclusion of food would cause for small business in the retail and distribution centres.
Democrat senators interjecting—
—If I could just be heard in silence; we listened very carefully to what you said, Senator Lees. I know you had your say and in principle you would want me to have my say. My position is that the Democrats should have listened closely to the evidence that was given. They adopted a fixed position almost from day one and have not varied from it.
—And you haven't?
—The government had a flexible position throughout.
—I am sorry that reading out evidence which gives comfort to the government position causes such angst in the chamber. Let me quote the National Farmers Federation. The NFF feel so strongly that food must be taxed that they said they will withdraw support for the tax package if food is exempt. Rob Douglas, Director of Rural Policy for the National Farmers Federation, said:
Once you start zero rating things and having things so that every invoice has to be dissected, the compliance costs go up exponentially.
The Executive Director of the Australian Food and Grocery Council, Mr Mitch Hook, said:
Excluding food from the GST base will only serve to render the system more complex, more administratively difficult and more costly to comply with. It is just not an efficient way of ensuring that the social objectives of tax reforms are met—equity, progressiveness and responsibility for the poor and disadvantaged.
There are a host of other quotes that I could put before the chamber. Let me quote the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants. This is pretty weighty evidence when you look at these organisations which are coming out—organisations which have some expertise in this area. The society's tax director, Angela Ryan, said:
Approximately 300,000 business operators will face a massive increase in compliance costs as a result of making food GST free. This is a dead weight on the economy and one that will inevitable be recouped through increased prices.
So it goes on. I will not delay the Senate, but frankly I think that the Democrats have refused to listen and to take into account the evidence.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-05-12,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The 1998 annual report of the Australian National University starkly sets out the degree of crisis which this government and its policies on higher education have inflicted upon 
 the Australian higher education sector. In fact, this document is quite damning in relation to the government's continued attacks on the sector and the slashing of funding which has taken place since the government came to power in 1996.
I was quite surprised when I opened this document this afternoon. I was struck by the forcible language used. I hope that other members who look at this document—certainly government members—are conscious of that when they read the document or at least its opening sections where it describes the impact that the funding crisis has had on this particular institution. It is undoubtedly written with the intention of sending a very strong message to the government and to government members which I think they would do well to heed. The review of 1998 in the report commences with a quote which says:
In the last three years, Australian universities have confronted their harshest financial and administrative environment ever.
It goes on to note the deep concern of the university at the unprecedented level of scrutiny to which it has been subjected. It continues:
The impact of these pressures on higher education, including cuts to courses, diminished capacity for basic research, the loss of staff, and poor morale, challenges the validity of the policies that have generated this environment. These policies have harmed Australia's ability to sustain high-quality universities with research excellence and outstanding staff that enable the nation to claim a world-class higher education system . . . At a time when Europe, North America and many countries in Asia are maintaining, or increasing, higher education funding, especially for basic research, Australian research and higher education risk collapsing to the second or third world rank.
Those are quite strong, damning words from this institution in an annual report. This is from a university ranked very highly; in fact, it is ranked next to Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, MIT, Stanford and the Sorbonne by The Times Higher Education Supplement .
Of course, this message is not a new one; it has been levelled at this government since its first harsh higher education measures were announced. But it is clear from this report that the sector is nearing crunch time and that the 
 margins which the sector has continually narrowed to survive have now almost disappeared. In short, there is nothing left to cut.
I do acknowledge that some of the initiatives announced in last night's federal budget are directed specifically at industry research linkages, but universities are still in such strife as a result of the deep funding cuts over the past three years that this government has a long way to go in positive initiatives before the damage is contained, let alone repaired. Universities around the country have had to cut staff and courses, reduce book and facility budgets and increase fees. The road back from this severe downgrading of standards and facilities is a very long one, and current government attitudes towards this sector do not give much cause for optimism.
Job losses at the ANU over the past year have been severe, amounting to 430 full-time jobs lost, and have affected nearly every area of this world-class university's operation—not to mention the impact on higher education generally and on unemployment in the Australian Capital Territory. Sadly, the government has a very poor record on heeding the concerns of this sector and its representative organisations. Unfortunately, the response seems to have been to ignore these concerns or, worse, to attack the messenger.
This attitude has been abundantly displayed, not just in recent months but in recent days, with the hearing last Friday of the Senate employment committee that is looking at the government's intention to introduce voluntary student union legislation—rejected, of course, by nearly all organisations and lobby groups within the sector. I hope that government members—particularly Senator Tierney, who is a member of the council of the ANU—read this report and take heed of the strong messages contained within it. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1999-05-12,"—I rise tonight to speak on a matter that has been before this parliament and was debated yesterday: the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999 . I did try to get on the speakers' list for that bill, but it was only one a side so I did not get the opportunity.
Having sat through the entire inquiry—up to midnight on quite a number of nights and a full day's hearing last week—I would like to make a few comments on the evidence that was given to the committee. I have had a longstanding interest in this matter. Before the information technology committee was established, I was chair of its predecessor for about two years. This committee, which has operated since 1991 in various forms, has taken a great interest in the whole issue of online services. We saw that we had a changing technology in front of us which raised many issues and which was going to become a major driver for the new phase of industrial development as we move into the next century. We saw that information industries and their main tool, the Internet, opened up enormous possibilities for our economy and our society. We are now seeing these come to fruition through e-commerce, the increasing amount of business that is done across the country online and the increasing amount of home usage of Internet services.
Australia is a great adaptor of new technologies, and the Internet is no exception. People are shopping, banking and working from home with this technology, so it does have a very beneficial effect on our economy. It is driving a new information revolution and it is one of the factors that is keeping up the level of growth in our economy.
But there is a dark side to the Net. As well as adults using the services on the Net that 
 are in e-commerce, entertainment and a range of other areas, children have access to the Net as well. This is currently unregulated, and parents have expressed considerable concern about that. The challenge to government is what to do about this new situation. We have had before the committee a range of views on what we should do—for example, `Do absolutely nothing; treat it like the Wild West and just let it all go and governments have no role.' People in the industry have put that proposition to us many times in the earlier hearings and in the hearings in the last week.
But the question that has always been raised in the minds of members of the committee is that, if illegal activity is occurring on the Internet, why does the medium make that situation different? If it is illegal in print, in books, on TV, on videotape and on film, the same material is also illegal if it is in a different medium—being the Internet. Some people argue that you can use the current laws of the land to fix this problem. You can use the current laws of the land up to a point. If there are sites that are illegal and police become aware of them, they can arrest people for illegal activity. This does not only involve hardcore pornography; it can involve things like paedophilia rings and homemade recipes on the Net for making bombs. These sorts of illegal activities, which I am sure any reasonable sort of person would want stopped, should be stopped, but the current laws do not really take account of what this information revolution has produced. For example, if material came into the country illegally 20 years ago, it would have come in by plane or by ship and we had Customs officers who could then seize it at that point. Of course, the Internet travels at the speed of light and comes in instantly from other countries, so you need a whole range of new responses to that situation.
We did have some varying views on how we should approach this matter, and there are basically four or five levels of response that can be made. People who appeared before the committee tended to support some, if not all, of these measures. At the base level, you have the whole idea of community education, the theory being that, if you educate the parents, 
 the children and the teachers, this will prevent a lot of access to this material and we should do as much as possible in that area. But it is really a problem of scale. Any community education program—no matter whether it is against smoking, reckless driving or whatever it is—has only a limited impact and reaches only a limited audience, and certainly this area would be another area where you would have that sort of a problem. That does not mean that we should not do anything in the area, but we must never see that as the panacea to the problems created here.
The next level relates to the people who are providing the material—the Internet service providers. Those people have developed—and it should be in place by Christmas—an industry code of practice. We welcome that and we feel that that will create a generated standard from the people who are involved in this industry. But it will not be compulsory for people to join, so having a code of practice does not totally solve the problem.
At the next level, governments can intervene. I mentioned a range of laws that exist, but with this new technology you need to do something new at the service provider level—the ISP—and that is what this bill actually focuses on. It focuses on ways of blocking or filtering material as it comes through the Internet service provider. A lot of people have argued to us that you cannot do that, that it is not technically feasible. But increasingly we have found—and we did start our inquiries on this as far back as 1993 when we were told we could not do any of this sort of thing—that the technology has developed to screen and filter out material, and it is becoming quite sophisticated.
That is why the bill has as a major provision that the Internet service provider must take down illegal material if it is technically feasible and commercially viable. That clause creates a flexibility in the bill so that, as this industry develops, we can actually change what is happening in responding to the problems. I cannot really see why anyone could object to that sort of provision if they take that flexibility into account, because if it is not technically feasible they will not be 
 required to take it down and they will not be charged with anything.
Some of the industry have kicked and screamed about this particular provision, but I think it is a most reasonable provision, and Australia is a world leader in trying it. People say that it will not work 100 per cent. Well, what laws do work 100 per cent? There is a law against stealing, but it does not mean that there is no stealing going on. But we try to enforce to the capacity of the law what we can to prevent that, and it is the same with this particular area of endeavour.
At the next level above what we can do in this government, there is international cooperation. There have been great strides in this area in recent years. If there is illegal material happening in different countries, there is cooperation through organisations like Interpol to take this material down or to arrest the people if the material is illegal in that country. Increasingly, there are conferences and meetings of groups of people who are trying to fix this problem at the international level.
The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill is not a sudden last minute thing, as some people have been making out. We have been working on this since 1993. It is a new industry, it is a difficult technology, but the hearings that we had were very useful in bringing out all the issues and looking at possible solutions. We have managed to put together a bill that will make quite an effective step forward in control in this type of technology.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999</title>,Adjournment,21,1
