"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1999-09-28,"—I have a little further information for Senate Bourne but I suspect that it is not any more than she already has. Radio Australia's coverage via transmitters in Taiwan and Singapore cover central and western Indonesia for an hour in the morning and an hour in the evening. The morning broadcast is in Bahasa Indonesian and the evening broadcast is in English. I have also been looking at the broadcasting schedule from Shepparton and it seems, from my calculations, that 3½ hours a day, to its areas of coverage, are in Bahasa Indonesian. The balance of Indonesia is intended to be covered, as I said, from the Taiwan and Singapore sources. That is for the more limited periods that I have outlined—an hour in the morning and an hour in the evening. If I can get some further information that might be useful to her, I will do so.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Radio Australia: Transmission into Indonesia</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-09-28,"—This question, as Senator Carr said, was put on notice 33 days ago. The department is currently waiting for information from another agency. The parts of the question placed on notice by Senator Carr involve information which is not within the possession of the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs. I anticipate that an answer will be provided to Senator Carr in the very near future.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Question No. 1361</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-09-28,"—I move:
That the Senate takes note of the explanation.
I think I have to formally move this motion so that I can ask other questions relating to this matter. The minister has responded by suggesting that he has been waiting on a response from another agency—I presume it is the department of immigration—which concerns matters relating to colleges under the education services for overseas students act which are owned or managed by immigration agents. Other parts of the question, and there are six other parts, relate explicitly to the activities and administrative responsibilities of DETYA. Why is it that those other six parts of this question have not been answered?
I also note that the minister was similarly asked questions by me concerning the apparent disappearance of some 400 students at a college in Sydney, the National Colleges of Australia, and that the minister undertook at that time to come back to me with an answer. That equally took about a month, about the same as for this original question. I am concerned that the minister has to rely upon a department which, first, has a history of not being able to answer parliamentary questions; second, has failed to respond to questions asked in this session concerning this matter in a prompt and timely matter; and, third, relies upon advice from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs concerning the operations of registered migration agents, which I note are included on a publicly available registry of agents. Why is it that it takes so long, 33 days, to secure information from another department?
Is this not itself further evidence of the failure of the government to administer this legislation in an effective manner and to provide a whole of government approach to this very serious issue concerning the abuses of student visas and the use of these colleges for people smuggling? And is this not evidence of the ineffectual manner in which this government has responded to a series of questions that have now been raised by the opposition and by the industry? In that context, while I note that the minister has said that he will get back promptly I would seek from him an assurance that promptly means that and that answers will be provided. I seek some assurance from him as to specific times by which answers can be provided.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Question No. 1361</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-09-28,"—The department is not in the practice of giving incomplete answers, and Senator Carr did not indicate in his question which parts he would like to have answered first. It was the department's approach to this that it would wait until it had all the information and could answer the question as a whole. So that is the answer to that part of Senator Carr's question.
As to what was put to me a month ago in this chamber—I think that is what Senator Carr is referring to—I will have a look at that and see if there is anything further that I can give him. I can say to Senator Carr that I will use my best endeavours to make sure that this question is answered in full in the very near future.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1999-09-28,"—I have some further information in relation to detainees in East Timor for Senator Cooney that I wanted to put on the record. I seek leave to incorporate the information in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The information read as follows—
DETENTION OF PERSONNEL IN EAST TIMOR
ISSUE:
SENATOR COONEY asked SENATOR HILL, representing the Prime Minister, on 27 September 1999:
The Indonesian army and Indonesian police are now withdrawing from East Timor. How will INTERFET deal with the people it detains there? What authority and what capacity does INTERFET have to hold detainees? Will anybody be responsible for keeping those suspected of perpetrating atrocities held secure until their position—that is, the detainees' position—is ultimately resolved, and who will determine what that position is to be?
TALKING POINTS:
.	 Persons apprehended by members of INTERFET are delivered to a Force Detention Centre, temporarily located at Dili airfield, to which the International Committee of the Red Cross is allowed full access. All detainees will be treated in accordance with fundamental humanitarian standards.
.	 INTERFET's detention authority is derived from United Nations Security Council Resolution 1264 and is necessary and incidental to the accomplishment of the mandate. It is not possible to restore peace and security in East Timor without having the power to detain persons who commit serious crimes or who obstruct the accomplishment of INTERFET's mission. INTERFET has established a Force Detention Centre in Dili which currently has a capacity to hold 15 detainees.
.	 INTERFET detention policy is predicated on the continued functioning of Indonesian law enforcement authorities in East Timor.
.	 Future arrangements for the administration of justice in East Timor have been raised with the United Nations. We await their detailed response.
Supplementary
.	 The Force Detention Centre has held a total of 43 people so far, including Pro-Independence and Militia.
.	 37 have been released:
- 2 to Indonesian Police;
- 9 to Indonesian Armed Forces;
- 7 to UNAMET CIVPOL;
- 18 released under their own recognisance; and
- 1 has elected to stay of his own free will.
BACKGROUND
Under the mandate of UN security Council Resolution, INTERFET military personnel are authorised to apprehend any person who has committed, is 
 committing or is about to commit a serious offence, and any person interfering with the accomplishment of the mission. ""Serious offence"" includes, but is not limited to:
.	 Murder
.	 Manslaughter
.	 Assault occasioning Grievous bodily harm
.	 Rape
.	 Possession of a weapon with intent to injure
.	 Carrying a weapon with criminal intent
.	 Causing explosions likely to endanger life or property
.	 Kidnapping, and
.	 Looting.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT,N/A,1999-09-28,"—The President has received a letter from Senator Forshaw proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the Senate for discussion, namely:
The failure of the Federal Liberal-National Party Government to address the needs of rural and regional Australia as demonstrated by their lack of 
 support for our major agricultural industries, failure to adequately support rural producers facing extreme financial difficulties and severe cuts to vital rural and regional programs and services.
I call upon those senators who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places.
More than the number of senators required by the standing orders having risen in their places—
—I understand that informal arrangements have been made to allocate specific times to each of the speakers in today's debate. With the concurrence of the Senate, I shall ask the clerks to set the clock accordingly.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Australia</title>,Matters of Public Importance,9,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-09-28,"—Not only is this matter of public importance supported by the opposition; it is also supported by the overwhelming majority of people in Australia. It is particularly supported by people living in rural and regional Australia, people who have been deserted by the Liberal and National parties virtually since they came to office in 1996. It was John Howard, the then Leader of the Opposition, who promised he would look after the battlers. When talking about battlers, there can probably be no group in Australia more deserving of attention than our farmers and people living in rural and regional Australia, who have been so badly hurt and so hard hit by the policies and decisions of this federal government and by the decisions of state governments of Liberal-National Party persuasion. I will come back to the election position in a minute, as we are seeing wholesale desertion by Australians living in rural and regional Australia when it comes to support for the coalition parties.
People in rural and regional Australia have borne the brunt of the massive cuts introduced by this government when it came to office in 1996—cuts across a whole range of services such as education, health, local government, transport and so on. My colleague Senator Mackay will deal specifically with the impact of those massive cuts and other decisions of this government in respect of services for rural and regional Australia. I want to talk particularly about the impact upon those people who contribute so much to the wealth 
 of this great nation, that is, farmers and employees of farmers in our great agricultural industries. This government, this federal Liberal-National Party government, has ignored their concerns.
Remember when this government came to office one of its first decisions was to abolish the then Department of Regional Development, the department that was specifically targeted at considering the needs of our farming and rural communities. Since then we have seen one ministerial disaster after another. John Anderson, who was the Minister for Primary Industries in the first Howard government, was so incompetent, so inept, that he had no-confidence motions passed against him at various meetings of farmers around this country. In the end, they had to promote him sideways to give the job to another National Party minister in Minister Vaile.
Minister Vaile's approach was that he would not adopt the haughty, landed gentry approach of Minister Anderson, an approach that was rejected by the people who had placed so much faith in this government; his approach was to be your friendly stock and station agent: `Come into my office, sit down, have a cup of coffee, discuss your problems and I will fix them.' That was Mr Vaile's approach. Looking at the agricultural sector in this country today, he has not fixed one problem; he has simply moved from one problem to the next. Any small moves that have been made by this government have only come about because of constant pressure being applied to previously Minister Anderson and now Minister Vaile.
Take, for instance, the pork industry. The pork industry in this country faced a major crisis due to significant levels of importation of pig meat and other pork products into this country. This government stood by and did nothing. Despite the pressure that was being applied, despite the appeals to Minister Anderson and to Mr Fischer, the then Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party, they did nothing until they were dragged kicking and screaming to the table and over a series of months dribbled out some assistance packages. But they came about well 
 after the time had run out in which the decisions should have been made, and that is a problem that is endemic to this government. It allows the problems to go on and on before it takes any action. Unfortunately in some cases it is far too late. We have seen another example of that today, which I will come to in a minute. The government dribbled out these assistance packages but, as I said, much too late for many pork producers.
The problem, however, was that this government, in ignoring the plight of those producers, took the credit when prices increased recently. There has been a bit of an upturn in that industry, brought about not by the policies of this government but by a major disease outbreak in Malaysia whereby Australia was able to pick up some additional export markets, particularly to Singapore. This government tried to take the credit for something it had absolutely no control over.
We can then go to another significant industry in which we have seen a belated announcement today—again at the eleventh hour, or well past the eleventh hour—and that is the dairying industry. I do not want to get too involved in that debate because as Senator Crane, Senator Woodley and members of the rural and regional affairs committee know, we are about to bring down a report on this. But what has been the position of the federal government throughout this problem of deregulation in the dairying industry? It sat on its hands and did nothing. There has been a total absence of any national leadership.
—It is a state matter.
—This is the problem, Senator Troeth. Senator Troeth says that it is a state matter. We have had the admission from the words of the parliamentary secretary. What have they said? They have said that it is a state matter. Notwithstanding the fact that they ripped hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars out of state finances in their first two budgets, they continue to say that this is a state matter. I say to the parliamentary secretary: it is not a state matter. Whilst regulation of the dairying industry may be controlled at the state level, there have been decisions made over a significant period of time in relation to the national dairying 
 industry. Those decisions have come about because of national policies such as the determinations of national competition policy. I remind the parliamentary secretary that the national competition policy is not a state only matter; it looks at the issues of state regulation from a national perspective in trying to bring about competition on an equal basis or on a level playing field.
—One of the Labor Party's better policies.
—That is true, but I remind Senator Macdonald that the whole point is that you just do not have a policy. You also have to have leadership that drives that policy. Under the previous Labor government, we had ministers such as Mr Kerin. He set the dairying industry reform process on its way. He was able to convince the dairying industry of the need for reform. He was a magnificent minister for primary industries. He was then followed by Simon Crean. We had the Crean plan, which took the initiatives under John Kerin further, as did Bob Collins when he became minister.
But what happened when the government changed from a Labor government to a Liberal-National Party government? What happened? Well, it all stopped. These people said that this was a state matter. Even though we know that the domestic market support scheme is going to cease at the beginning of July next year, this government has decided to do nothing to bring the states together in order to bring about a national position. What do we have now? We have a situation where the still remaining Premier of Victoria for a short time, Mr Kennett, decided to go it alone and sent the whole thing into a spin.
Today, in a last desperate act to try to keep some sort of measure of involvement in the process, the federal government has announced its response to the dairying industry package, something that has been called for for many months now. But, at the same time, we still have major states involved in the dairying industry saying that they are not on board with that decision. We have a whole series of positions across the states, and Victoria is in a real state of flux because nobody will really know which party will be 
 governing that state until the outcome of the by-election towards the end of this year.
All through this, what has been the position of the Australian government? It has sat on its hands and done nothing. At the very time when we need national leadership to bring the states together to hammer out an agreement, knowing the deadline of 1 July next year is approaching, you have done nothing. It is a failure of national leadership. You can go through all those other issues we have had to look at over the last couple of years such as in the wheat industry, in the wool industry, in the salmon industry and in the forest industry where the minister for chainsaws is in charge of the forests—
—Order! Please do not reflect upon a member in the other place.
—Mr Tuckey—and what happened? The policy fell to bits in total uproar with respect to his management of that portfolio. What we have seen over the last couple of years is that those people in the bush, in rural and regional Australia, placed their faith in this government in 1996. They voted for a change and they believed John Howard when he said that he was going to look after these battlers. What have they done? They have deserted in their hundreds of thousands, firstly in Queensland. They voted against the National Party government and elected quite a number of One Nation members to the Queensland parliament. The National Party was virtually wiped out in the bush there.
Then in Tasmania the coalition government was thrown out of office, and Tasmania is a state which is extremely important in terms of rural and regional issues. It then happened in New South Wales. The Labor Party now holds a majority of seats outside the Sydney metropolitan area and the National Party lost a senator just like it did in Queensland in the last federal election. Then, to top it all off, it happened again in the Victorian elections recently when the Labor Party smashed the Liberal and National parties because of their desertion of people in the bush.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1999-09-28,"—The debate today on this matter of public importance proposed by the Labor Party deals with matters of great importance to rural and regional Australia and refers to matters like support for major agriculture industries, support for rural producers facing extreme financial difficulties and vital rural and regional programs and services. I do thank the Labor Party for raising this important issue as it gives Senator Crane, Senator Boswell and me the opportunity of explaining in more detail than we can at question time just what this government has done.
I am rather surprised that the Labor Party has raised this issue today. I wonder what the underlying philosophy is. It is the day when the newspapers are full of the disappearance from the public stage of Labor's chief spokesman on rural and regional matters, Ms Kernot. The great gain for the Labor Party who was going to do so many things for Australia has disappeared from sight because she cannot do the job. She is incapable of doing it and, when she is challenged about it, she spends most of her time blaming the messenger—the media. I saw a transcript of an interview she gave today—three pages of bile on a reporter who happened to report accurately what she said. Even Graham Richardson, the former Labor senator, has shaken his head with despair at the stupidity of the Labor Party's putting Ms Kernot in charge of this area.
I am amazed at Senator Forshaw raising this issue today of all days. Perhaps Ms Kernot is not of his faction. I do not know: I am not into those sorts of conspiracy theories. But why has this been raised today? The Labor Party keep promising that they are going to do something. Ms Kernot says that she is getting a policy together, but she has been saying that for 12 months now. She says she has been consulting with regional communities in regional Australia and Canberra but, as I go around regional Australia, I see neither head nor hair of her. I know some of Ms Kernot's own colleagues who have asked her to come out to the bush have been disappointed because she is too busy. She says that she 
 is looking after the marginal seat of Dickson, but the people of Dickson have not seen her either. She has simply disappeared without trace. Senator Woodley—who I understand is in this debate—was right when he disclosed to us Ms Kernot's philosophy, and that was: `Don't go near the bush, because there are no votes out there.'
I see Senator Mackay follows me in this debate, and I expect we will get from her a rousing defence of her senior minister. I am sure she will tell us what Ms Kernot has been doing, and she will tell us why all the commentators are wrong when they say that Ms Kernot is simply not up to the job. Whilst that is a matter for the Labor Party, I say to the Labor Party: if Ms Kernot cannot do the job, please appoint someone who can, because country Australia is too important to have a very part-time player in the field who is more interested in getting herself a safer seat from the Labor Party—as she so clearly demonstrated on election night.
I do thank Senator Forshaw for raising this issue although, as I say, I find it curious that the Labor Party would simply highlight Ms Kernot's absence by putting forward this matter. Senator Forshaw has raised a number of industry issues, and I know Senator Boswell and Senator Crane will go through those very carefully. Across the board, we are a government which understands rural and regional Australia. We are a government that understands farmers, and the Liberal and National parties have responded accordingly. I will mention just some of the ways we have responded. Following the regional and rural financial summit a couple of years back, we put into place the $525 million Agriculture—Advancing Australia package, which has done more for farmers and rural people in the last few years than Labor did in all of the 13 years they were in power. We have put $24 million into the pork industry. We have put $18 million to $20 million into the lamb industry. We have just today announced—and Senator Forshaw obviously has not read about this—a $1.8 billion package to assist the structural adjustment of the Australian dairy industry. 
—It's not your money! The consumers are paying that!
—It is not our money, but we have done it, Senator. The Labor Party never did this, because they never understood rural and regional Australia. Up my way, the sugar growers have had tough times with reductions in prices, but some of them are doing pretty well, and they are grateful to this government—as are the NFF—because we have introduced the tax reform packages that the National Farmers Federation and cane growers asked for. With the Ralph reforms, the cane growers have come out and supported the government on those tax reform measures. The GST and the original tax reform proposals were called for by the National Farmers Federation for two decades. They pleaded with the Labor Party to do something about tax reform. The Labor Party typically shut their ears to rural and regional Australia and did not have the courage to do something about tax reform. We, the government of the Liberal and National parties, have done something. We have brought in a tax regime which is good for rural producers, good for small businessmen and good for regional Australia generally.
We have been able to do these things because we do go out and consult. A big part of our program is listening to what people in rural and regional Australia say. Senator Forshaw, you rarely get out there, but Senator Crane and I live out there. We know what it is like out there because our neighbours tell us. We understand these sorts of things, and then we hold things like the rural summit. The rural summit is where we get people from rural and regional Australia in to talk to us. Do you know this rural and regional summit which is on at the end of October is one where politicians are not invited to speak?
—You're going!
—We are going, but we are not invited to speak. We are not invited to participate. We are going because we want to hear from rural and regional Australians. We want to listen and learn, and that is what we have done also with our regional forums program. But, more 
 importantly, we send our people around to listen and learn. Mr Anderson holds a very marginal seat: he got 46 per cent of the vote in his seat. The Labor Party and One Nation together got more than 46 per cent of the vote in that seat, so it is a very marginal seat, but that does not stop Mr Anderson from going right around this country consulting and listening to people. It does stop Ms Kernot, because she has to look after what she calls her marginal seat until the Labor Party can find her a safer seat somewhere to allow her to get around.
I am not like Ms Kernot or Senator Mackay. I do not just fly into a town, deliver a speech and then not hang around to listen to what everybody says when I go; I actually stay there. I also get in my car, drive throughout western Queensland—through rural and regional Australia—and stop in towns and listen to people. I come there not to say anything, not to give them a message, but to ask them, `What is happening here; what is the problem and what do you think the government should do about it?' That is called consultation. Ms Kernot does not know about it; she is not interested. All I can say to you, Senator Forshaw, is can you please get a representative from the Labor Party who has some real interest in the bush.
I know that Senator Crane, Senator Boswell and Senator Heffernan consult with the bush, as does Senator McGauran—Senator Heffernan lives in the bush. We understand these people and we want to listen to them. I make no political point about that. I do not want to be unfair to Ms Kernot. She attained some recognition as head of the Democrats, but she has found that dealing with your type, Senator Forshaw, in the Labor Party was not all beer and skittles, as she thought it would be. Even Senator Jacinta Collins showed what she thought of Ms Kernot—remember when she issued those wine bottles with the Cheryl Kernot label—so you know what the female members of the Labor Party think about Ms Kernot.
It is not good enough: rural and regional Australia is an important area of policy. We have listened and we have done what we can. But we have more to do. I do not say, by any 
 stretch of the imagination, that we have solved it all, but we are working towards that area because we listen, we want to understand and we want to try to help rural and regional communities to help themselves. That is what our policy is all about. We have addressed the things that are the subject of this matter of public importance. I urge the Labor Party to do the same. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Australia</title>,Matters of Public Importance,9,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1999-09-28,"—This is a very important debate today and I am glad that the Labor Party have put this matter of public importance before us so that we can debate it. I want to underline that the MPI is quite correct in talking about the failure of this government to address the needs of regional and rural Australia. But I have to say that that was true of the previous government as well. However, that issue is not before us. I want to address the failure of this particular government and the areas in which it has to lift its game. It really must lift its game.
—You should talk about the rural transaction centres.
—No, that was your speech, Senator Macdonald; I will stick to mine. I want to talk about a big issue that is before us at the moment, and that is the failure of the government in the area of dairy deregulation. I think this is a big issue that is going to bite everybody if we cannot show some leadership in this area. I want to say to the government that there has been a failure of the government in three areas. First, there has been a failure in the area of leadership. I agree with Senator Forshaw: the problem is that this federal government has allowed Victoria to lead the debate. There has been no leadership at the federal level. If you do not believe me, then let me read from the press release put out today by the honourable Warren Truss. He says it quite clearly:
The dairy industry proposals represent the single biggest deregulation of any Australian rural sector. The Victorian State Government and the Victorian dairy industry have indicated their intention to deregulate. As the Victorian industry represents 63 per cent of the Australian production their decision will bring considerable pressure on the regulation of other State markets. 

That is very true, but why doesn't this federal government show some leadership on this issue? Why doesn't it, when it is a national issue—it is not just a Victorian state issue—have something to offer for everybody else?
—Like $1.8 billion.
—I am coming to that, Senator Boswell. I welcome the package which the government have released today, but it is not going to be enough. The problem is that they are hiding behind the skirts of state governments. They are not showing leadership. They are saying, `State governments are going to deregulate and all that the poor federal government can do is to make sure that dairy farmers not only get a compensation package but pay for it as well.' So they are going to get a loan, from which dairy farmers will be paid compensation, but then they will also be asked to repay the compensation they receive and, I presume—although the press release today does not make it clear—that the increase in the amount means that there will be tax implications. So the dairy farmers will be taxed on the compensation they receive—the compensation which they will have to repay anyway. What sort of a deal is that?
The problem for the government is that there is not only a failure in their leadership but also a failure in the fact that there is no plan B. That is the problem. If deregulation does not go ahead, what is going to happen? The Victorian election really puts deregulation very much in doubt. If Mr Kennett does retain the premiership of the state, then he will have to depend upon a couple of Independents, and they have declared themselves very clearly—certainly, Susan Davies has clearly declared where she stands on deregulation. I just do not know what is going to happen in terms of plan B. Of course, if Labor wins in Victoria, John Brumby has already indicated that he will review deregulation.
That does not take into account what the Western Australian government might do, as they are faced with being sued by the dairy farmers in their state once the quota system has been struck down in terms of deregulation, because those quotas in Western Australia are seen as real property. They are viewed 
 this way in the other states as well, but in Western Australia the contracts for buying and selling the quotas attract stamp duty. They are real property. If, at the stroke of a pen, you destroy someone's real property, of course they are going to sue for compensation. That is not taken account of in the package. So I am not sure that the Western Australian government are going to be very keen on deregulation itself. That is two states: Victoria and Western Australia. I believe the government had better have plan B ready very quickly because, if the package does not get up, then we are going to need to know what is next.
—Are the Democrats supporting it?
—Yes, of course we are supporting the compensation package. But here is the problem: who is going to pay for the compensation? This was something that we asked as we went around during the inquiry, and we could not get a straight answer. In some cases, people were saying, `It's the consumers who'll pay because there is an 11c a litre levy on the cost of retail milk sales.' Certainly, when we went to northern New South Wales, Senator Forshaw would remember that Norco predicted there would be an increase for the consumer of about 10c a litre. But much of the other evidence we received suggested that, in fact, the farmers would pay.
Senator Forshaw interjecting—
—You say that the farmers will not pay. Let me tell you what Mr Truss said today in his press release:
The package will be funded through a levy of 11 cents a litre on all retail milk sales. This levy is unlikely to have any impact on retail prices as farm gate prices are expected to fall after deregulation by at least this amount.
There it is. So we can see who is going to pay for their own compensation. I have to say to you we will be supporting the package but I will keep my fingers crossed.
There is another problem, and that is that the government has failed to listen to grassroots farmers in all of this. Let me quote from a very interesting letter which came my way. This underlines the fact that the UDV, the 
 United Dairyfarmers of Victoria, have driven deregulation against the interests of farmers in the other states and, many of their own farmers would say, against the interests of farmers in their own state—and certainly against the interests of many farmers in regional areas. I have a very interesting document from Bega, which the committee also has, where the farmers and the local business community have done a professional social impact statement, and that shows the devastating effect of deregulation on that area. But the interesting thing is that this letter from the UDV must have been sent to the wrong people, because it is about a campaign and it includes eight draft letters. They are suggesting that these letters should be sent to local papers so that UDV members can get into the debate. The advice to their members is:
.	 Please try to do this as soon as possible, remember they—
the letters—
must look genuine. I have selected DC's—
district councils—
on the basis of where we are getting the most calls.
—It's push polling!
—Yes, it is a bit like that. The advice goes on to say:
It would also be great at this time if Central Councillors and District Councils confirmed their support for the Executive, Central Council and UDV's position on deregulation.
We are throwing everything at this to try and gain the final tick off from the Federal Government.
They are not even sure whether the federal government support them, but they do.
We recognise this is more work however, your help at this time will certainly make a difference.
There were eight letters attached to this and they are very interesting, but they are saying, `We're not really sure if we're winning this debate, but we'll put out this disinformation which may help us finally get over the line.' So there you are: the government have let themselves be led by the Victorian government, which has almost fallen over because of this very issue.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-09-28,"—I congratulate Senator Woodley on a good speech. I am interested to note that he concluded his speech with what we could call `push post' in terms of letters being made `genuine'. I am also interested that Minister Ian Macdonald has become much more voluble recently than he has been in the past in relation to a few matters that he raised today. If I were the government, I might have sent somebody else in to play the person. I notice he spent six or seven minutes talking about Ms Kernot rather than talking about the policies of the government.
What kind of person are we talking about in Minister Macdonald? I would never play politics, as he said, in relation to this matter, but let us cast our minds back to 1995 when Senator Ian Macdonald was shadow minister. This was, as Senator Crane will no doubt remember, at a shadow ministry meeting in North Queensland, and a certain piece of paper was left on the table. Subsequently, it got an awful lot of publicity resulting in a sequence of events which I will deal with. This is a quote from then shadow minister Senator Ian Macdonald:
The policy indicates that prior to the election we would be announcing a list of long term visionary projects we would specifically like the Council to investigate—
They are alluding to the previous council—
and prioritise, for example: Darwin to Alice Railway, turning coastal waters inland, rejuvenating the Murray-Darling Basin—
is this starting to ring any bells here—
Adelaide Airport.
This gives us the flexibility of announcing a lot of major long term visionary matters but without committing ourselves to actually proceeding with them.
Who said that? Senator Macdonald.
What happened to poor old Senator Macdonald, Senator Forshaw? Where was Senator Macdonald when the frontbench was announced in 1996? He was not there. He had a long way to go up the slippery pole before he got the imprimatur of the Prime Minister to come back onto the front bench. And we know why he is there. I would not play politics in relation to this, but it may have 
 something to do with the fact that he is a Liberal senator from North Queensland, and it may have something to do with keeping the Liberal Party presence in North Queensland in terms of the National Party. So that is the kind of person we are dealing with: the kind of person who comes in here and plays the person. He is the sort of person who says, `Announce all these policies but don't worry too much about them because we don't have to deliver.' That is what he said, effectively, yet he comes in here and casts aspersions on other people when, clearly, on empirical evidence, he has no clothes on.
As I said, we have never heard Senator Macdonald so voluble. Senator Crane, my colleague over there, has shared many hours in estimates with me, Senator Forshaw and Senator O'Brien in relation to a number of matters. He will well recall—as his patience was sorely tried—the last round of estimates where we attempted to ask many questions on the GST and regional Australia and also on the impact of the diesel fuel changes which were in the ANTS package. We also tried to ask a number of questions in relation to the GST and local government. We did not get one response. I could be wrong, but I surmised that the minister was having a big sulk because—unfortunately, from his perspective—he retained the portfolio of local government as a result of the deal with the Democrats. Anyway, he did not respond. I do pay tribute to Senator Crane for his behaviour in relation to this matter. I know he did attempt to get the minister to answer the questions, but it was impossible.
Just in relation to the whole issue of regional and rural Australia, the opposition is very happy with the performance of the frontbench on this matter. We are very happy. We say to you, `Keep doing what you are doing.' We say to you, `Keep implementing the same sorts of policies that you have implemented in relation to regional and rural Australia, because it is those kinds of policies that delivered us the result we got in Victoria.' We are happy with that, so keep doing what you are doing.
We were very happy with the debate on Victoria the other day. We were very happy 
 with the contributions of Senator Troeth, Senator Patterson and Senator McGauran, because they said to us that you have not learned a thing. It was absolutely extraordinary—and Senator Heffernan would know this; he has been around politics for a long time—because when you get that kind of defeat, which it effectively was, what you say is, `We are sorry.' Even Jeff Kennett had some grace in relation to that. And you say, `We're going to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps and we're going to do something.' But, no, the debate in relation to Victoria was, `Why on earth didn't the people of Victoria vote for Jeff Kennett?' Senator Patterson went through a long list of the policies of the Victorian coalition and basically ticked them off—gave the people of Victoria a big lecture about not voting for Jeff Kennett.
We are very happy with that. Please keep doing it. Do not depart from the script. Do not go off the message, for goodness sake. While I am at it, might I say that we are also very happy with the calibre of the frontbench. Please do not promote any of the talented people, particularly women, that you have sitting on the back bench. Do not promote them to the frontbench. You keep them where they are. That is terrific.
But it is not good enough—Senator Boswell has finally made it—to come in here and repeat the Goebbels-like mantra: `We are doing the right thing by regional and rural Australia.' You cannot just keep repeating this Goebbels-like mantra, backed up by Reifenstahl-like TV advertising which essentially says, `Yes, we are right, therefore people will vote for us.' That is not good enough, because people in rural Australia know—they are not silly—that this government has not done the right thing.
What did the government do when it first came in in 1996? The first thing it did was abolish the department of regional development. If that was not a signal of what this government thought of regional and rural Australia, I do not know what was. I wonder whether, after the Victorian election, Minister Macdonald will stand by the government's own National Commission of Audit report from 1996 which stated that the federal 
 government had no clear rationale for involvement in regional development policies. This picks up the point that Senator Forshaw made. Whose responsibility does it think it is? The states' responsibility. That is whose responsibility it thinks it is. It was the government's own National Commission of Audit that clearly said that.
It is also worthwhile going through at some length some of the cuts that this government has made in relation to regional and rural Australia.
—Poor old Cheryl. Give her a Gregorys  map so she can find her way around.
—As I said, the first thing they did was abolish the $150 million regional development program. We have already covered that.
—Give Cheryl a Gregorys .
—Senator Heffernan, I ask you again: if you are interested in actually speaking, why don't you, for once, get yourself on the speakers list and let us have the benefit of your wisdom? You are not actually heard very often in the Senate. But I will not be diverted by you.
One of the first things that the government did, as I said, was to abolish the $150 million regional development program. That was the most telling illustration of this government starting off how it meant to go on. That program was very popular. It was committed to building regional economies and infrastructure—it is gone. Secondly, we had $62 million slashed from financial assistance grants to local government. Those senators who live in regional and rural Australia know exactly how local government feels about those cuts. That was the second thing.
Thirdly, we had the slashing of the local government development program, which was a very popular program and something that Labor announced just before we lost office in 1996. That is now gone—$34 million gone, replaced by a $7 million program called the local government program, which is primarily designed to assist councils prepare for the implementation of the GST. Fourthly, the 
 coalition cut $620 million in road funding from the national highway system. I am only up to the fourth thing.
Fifthly, the coalition has inflicted large cuts on the higher education sector, impacting on regional universities and the positive and collaborative role they play in regional communities. I divert here to just mention the report on regional unemployment which will be brought down in the Senate in the next few days where, having gone all around regional Australia, we heard evidence of precisely what is happening in the education system under this government, and there are some very angry people.
Sixthly, the coalition has dramatically reduced the size and scope of Labor's infrastructure bonds program, which has provided $200 million for the regional infrastructure program every year. In its place, what do we have? The infrastructure rebate, capped at $75 million and limited to transport infrastructure. That is what the coalition thinks of regional and rural Australia.
The list goes on and on and, unfortunately, time does not permit me to continue in relation to this. But I will mention a few other things. None of these cuts have been lost on rural and regional Australians, and I think Senator Forshaw outlined electorally the impact that this is having. There was the slashing of funding to the ABC; the further sale of Telstra, which is not popular out in regional and rural Australia—Senator Boswell knows that, although he obviously will not say that here today; and major cuts to employment programs, including Working Nation which is still very well received in regional Australia, as you will see when the report comes out.
—How many seats did you win in Queensland?
—Senator Macdonald has rejoined us. Welcome, Senator Macdonald. They turned their piecemeal approach to industry policy into an art form. They closed CES offices all over Australia. I noticed today that the head of Job Futures has come out and said that the Job Network has let regional and rural Australians down—this is after Minister Abbott gave it a clean bill of health. But we 
 will deal with that later on. They closed the CES and replaced it with a substandard program which impacts disproportionately on regional and rural Australia. They closed tax offices. They closed Medicare offices. They failed to address the declining banking industry. The list goes on and on.
We know the type of turmoil that is going on in the coalition at the moment. We all read what Senator Boswell had to say at the National Party conference a couple of weekends ago where he slammed national competition policy.
—Who, me?
—Yes, Senator Boswell. We read the reports—
—It was Graeme Samuels—
—Graeme Samuels and the National Competition Council, I beg your pardon. So you have slammed the NCC and not the NCP. Who introduced the NCC, I wonder? I do not think it was us.
—You introduced it.
—You have a look at the continuum of the national competition policy and when it was introduced by Labor and what has happened under this coalition government. The hearings of the Senate select committee into national competition policy, Senator Heffernan, have been most illuminating as to the disproportionate impact in regional and rural Australia. It is simply not good enough, as I said before, to come in with a Goebbels-like mantra and try to say to us that this government has tried to do the right thing by regional Australians. Look at the empirical evidence. Look at what happened in Victoria two weeks ago. Look at the electoral impact and try to mend your ways.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Australia</title>,Matters of Public Importance,9,1
"Boswell, Sen Ronald",NP,1999-09-28,"—Senator Forshaw produces an MPI today which states:
The failure of the Federal Liberal-National Party Government to address the needs of rural and regional Australia as demonstrated by their lack of support for our major agricultural industries . . . 

What a free kick in front of the goalposts! On the very day that we bring down the biggest package ever produced for rural Australia—$1.8 billion to the dairy industry—Senator Forshaw fumbles the ball and says that the government is not looking after our agricultural industries. I would have thought that was an own goal, a free kick in front of the goalposts. If you had any understanding about rural Australia, Senator Forshaw, you would have withdrawn this MPI. It is a masterpiece of mistiming. Only the Labor Party could put their foot in their mouth and put up an MPI on the very day that the biggest package in the history of the parliament of Australia is being produced for rural Australia and the dairy industry.
—Who is putting the $1.8 billion up?
—The $1.8 billion will be legislated for. It is to go to the dairy industry because Pat Rowley and the industry came to us and asked us to do it. The industry put a package before the government and the government has agreed to honour that package. So, Senator Forshaw, you have really let the side down very badly by putting this MPI up today. It lacks any sort of credibility. One wonders why you do it. Could it be, Senator Macdonald, that there is a bit of blood in the water and that the sharks are circling Ms Kernot? Her electorate is 152 times smaller than Mr Anderson's, but she cannot get around her electorate because she does not have enough staff! She does not have a safe seat.
—You are a National Party senator: talk about the issues.
—I am going to talk about the issues. Why you would bring this MPI up on a day like this is beyond me. The only conclusion that I can come to is that there might be a bit of room coming up in the shadow cabinet and the parliamentary secretary might see an opportunity for a smart young lad with a bit of experience. That is the only reason that I can see that you would bring an MPI forward today.
Let us deal now with the real issues. Let us look at some of the positive things that this government has done. Let us look at the 
 diesel rebate of 23c a litre for all of rural Australia. That is going to return $550 million. This is a positive thing that John Anderson and the government have done. Road transport costs will be slashed by an estimated $1 billion; rail transport costs will be slashed by $160 million. Every tonne of wheat shifted will return to the farming industry an extra $1.60 because of this policy. There will be $30 million a year to upgrade roads and bridges. All of this is positive.
If we want to get into the negatives, I can remind the Senate—and it will not need reminding—of the terrible years of Keating, from about 1985 to 1992, when rural Australia was absolutely gutted by high interest rates. Can we ever forget that? It is talked and whispered about around rural Australia—the 19 per cent, the 23 per cent and even the 25 per cent interest rates which sucked the equity out of Australian farming properties. It was a nightmare out there. So don't you ever have the audacity to come in here and say that you represent rural Australia. You absolutely wrecked rural Australia. People went broke one after the other as they had to climb over very high interest rates that were absolutely unbelievable and insupportable. Then you come in here and move an MPI on the very day that the government has given the greatest package to rural Australia and the dairy industry. We are a step closer to major fuel cost savings for the transport industry. We have delivered those major cost savings. We have delivered tax breaks. We have delivered many other things for rural Australia.
Let us look at the absolute litany of things the Labor Party did when they were in government—and I am mentioning Hawke and Keating; I am not getting into the Whitlam era. In 1983, primary producers lost their general depreciation allowance and the special depreciation allowance on farm storage was abolished. Excise on petrol and diesel increased. Export inspection charges massively increased. Tax incentives on IEDs were abolished. There are pages and pages of concessions that the Labor Party took away from rural Australia. And that will never be forgotten. It will always be remembered out there. 
I want to pick up on one particular point that Senator Forshaw mentioned concerning the pig industry. Senator Forshaw said the National Party and Liberal Party deserted the pig industry. I will just read the Queensland Country Life editorial this week—and this is the bible of rural Australia in Queensland:
A remarkable transformation is taking place in Australia's pork industry.
Only a year ago the industry was in crisis. Knives were out then for Agriculture Minister John Anderson who was being accused of destroying the domestic pig industry.
. . .              . . .             . . .
Today, prices are at a three year high and climbing. Export markets have been established and the industry is entering a growth phase firmly aimed at supplying the massive—and nearby—Asian market.
The article continues:
John Anderson has stuck by his guns at a significant political cost to deliver a more efficient and robust industry.
Leadership remains the single most powerful tool in agriculture—and Australia has to move forward.

"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,1999-09-28,"—I am absolutely delighted to join in this debate today, because it is one of the most misplaced debates ever to come before this place. Really, what it is about is the little song Graham Richardson and John Laws sang yesterday: `Where have you been, Cheryl? Oh, where have you been?' In this case, Senator Forshaw, the Right from New South Wales, beat the Left from Tasmania in getting this motion up here. What they did not know was that today was the day on which Minister Vaile was going to bring down the dairy package. What this is all about is them positioning themselves to try to get Ms Kernot's job. One thing I will say about Senator Mackay, though, is that she does travel. She did go across to Perth last week, because I was on the same plane. I doubt whether she got out of the metropolitan area but I am sure she enjoyed some good Western Australian wine, which is thriving under our policies.
I want to run through some of the major important reforms—not the things on the edge but the things that really matter in the short, 
 the medium and the long term. The first thing is the reform of the grain research committee and the new structures we have there. Remember the old Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, the little baby of the former minister, John Kerin? Everybody hated it. We now have Meat and Livestock Australia—universally supported, commercially driven and doing a fantastic job for the Australian meat industry.
Let us think about the reform of the Australian Wheat Board and the new structures that exist there. Under the old statutory arrangements we were used to up to 80 per cent in the first advance; we are now going to have an additional payment in May to take it well above the 80 per cent. What are the grain growers of this country doing? They are rubbing their hands together and saying, `We now have a responsive commercial operation which is going to look after the marketing of our wheat.' If you can read the press, you will see that yourself.
We have seen the reform in which we got rid of the old Wool International and its bureaucratic mess, replacing it with Woolstock Australia. We have seen the gradual strengthening of the wool market—very significant at the finer end and picking up in the middle ranges of wool. We are told that, come October-November, we are going to see some significant improvements in price in the broader lines. Once again, we are reforming the big things that really put the dollars and cents in the pocket.
I want to say a little about the pork industry, which Senator Boswell mentioned. Sure, we got criticised at the time, but what did we do? We had a look at it, we concentrated on reforming the export sector and we put in place some decent abattoir facilities so we had the mechanism to get it offshore. When the recovery came, we were in a position to export meat. The crazy thing about the position you people on the other side supported—your answer was tariffs, banning Canadian pork and restrictions—is that we were a net exporter of pork. How silly can you be. You did not do your homework. We were a net exporter. We are an even greater exporter 
 now, and the pork industry is going to continue to grow.
The lamb industry has been mentioned. Tax reform has meant that $4.5 billion has gone from the cost of doing business in agriculture and mining in rural Australia. That is absolutely huge—the big stuff that really matters. A press release I have here from the National Farmers Federation states that farmers will be $5,000 to $7,000 a year better off.
I want to spend just a moment on the $1.8 billion dairy package. You would think that somebody clicked their fingers yesterday and today we have it. The fact is that we have been working on this package for a long time as to the best way to handle it. And we have been working in conjunction with the dairy industry—something you people were not very good at—and with the states in terms of their constitutional rights as far as the setting of quotas is concerned. And the situation is no different in Queensland, Tasmania or New South Wales—all Labor states—from what it is in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia—all Liberal states. They all have the constitutional problem with respect to the quotas and who has the responsibility for them. You know that, but you try to do a beat-up on it. We have put in place the $1.8 billion package.
I heard you interjecting on Senator Boswell and saying, `Oh well, you are not really funding it.' It is exactly the same funding, might I tell you, as the Crean DMS package. It is exactly the same form of funding. You said you were going to support it—
—The Labor government was funding it. He claimed the government was funding it; that is why he got corrected.
—No; they were not funding it.
—Then why did he say that?
—You are wrong. I will go on a little further to some of the other issues that we have before us here. I have to watch that clock very carefully. Look at the rural transaction centres for the bush: $70 million over five years. We now have 58 communities that have Creditcare outlets. 
 Were there Creditcare outlets in your time in government in 13 years? Not a hope in hell; you did not even know what Creditcare meant. There are 182 rural projects worth  $21 million. Moving on to education and assistance for isolated children schemes, in 1999 the basic boarding allowance was increased from $2,900 to $3,500, restoring the rate of 55 per cent of the average boarding fee.
I tell you people on the other side of the chamber that when I was the senior vice-president of the NFF, I made representations to your government to get something done about it, and you did absolutely nothing. Prime Minister Hawke at the time did promise that he would do something about it but he did not quite get there. You can keep on running through these things, such as Agriculture—Advancing Australia and the increase in rural doctors. Who was the first one to deal with the problem of rural doctors? We have still got a long way to go on that issue but we are addressing it: we have more of them out there and we have got special fly-in, fly-out services with female doctors to help women in the bush. A whole range of things have been done.
I really want to come back to where I started. The issues that we have tackled are the big issues, the issues that are going to put more dollars and cents in the pockets of the people in the bush, and the issues that are going to cut their costs. When you can improve their terms of trade, that is how you will deal with the issues in country Australia, whether  it be mining, agriculture or any of the service industries. That is how you will deal with it effectively—not by handouts.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,1999-09-28,"—I seek leave to present a delegation report and to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the Philippines and Japan, which took place from 24 May to 5 June 1999 and move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The delegation occurred, of course, during the Asian economic downturn, which had extended throughout the region during the previous year and which had been manifest in Japan somewhat earlier in terms of a prolonged financial recession.
The aims of the delegation's visit were, in general terms, to strengthen the bilateral relationships between Australia and both countries at a time when economic pressures underline the necessity for regional stability as a means of enhancing mutual security and promoting economic growth and recovery. To this end the delegation participated in an extensive program of meetings with members of the legislatures of both countries and with ministers and officials at the highest levels in the areas of economic policy, health, agriculture, foreign affairs, trade, defence and tourism. I have to say that people were enormously generous in the giving of their time, and the honesty and frankness with which they spoke to the delegation was certainly appreciated by all its members.
In the Philippines, the government of President Joseph Estrada has continued to pursue the economic and social reform agenda established by his predecessor, President Ramos. Economic growth has proved difficult to achieve during the past year, due to continuing regional recession and climatic factors affecting agricultural production. The delegation was advised that economic restructuring was being pursued despite the social costs, such as higher structural unemployment. There were clearly measures being taken by the government to improve the status, and so it was very disheartening, not long after we came back, to see the typhoons that had so seriously affected the Philippines and would obviously put back a little further the strategies and the plans that had been made.
Issues dominating the delegation's discussions in the Philippines ranged from tariffs on agricultural produce to investment and securi 
 ty issues. The Philippines is trying to pursue a policy of trade liberalisation to open new markets for such produce as tropical fruits but continues to encounter political resistance to attempts to reduce tariffs on locally produced commodities, such as sugar and rice, which are produced very inefficiently as peasant based industries. Discussions with a range of congressional leaders and provincial officials made it clear to us that there was little or no popular support for tariff reduction on commodities such as sugar.
The extremes of wealth and poverty, as well as infrastructure deficiencies, remain critical problems in the Philippines. The immaturity of the existing party system, with the extensive use of congressional `place filling' by families of leading political figures, was an additional issue which became apparent to the delegation in discussions with political leaders both in Manila and in the provinces.
Security issues brought to our notice by Foreign Secretary Siazon and by Vice-Admiral Santos of the Philippines Navy included the concern over Chinese incursions on islands claimed by the Philippines in the South China Sea, the continuing insurgency problem on Mindanao and the ratification of the Visiting Forces Agreement with the United States by the Philippines Congress. That debate was in fact being conducted at the time we were there, and it was quite incredible to see the amount of passion that was raised by locals, both for and against that agreement.
The heavily armed escorts necessary for the delegation to make its way in safety through Manila and to areas of the provinces underlined the continued existence of law and order and insurgency problems in the country—both significant problems for the Estrada government. Although I would have preferred the delegation to have spent more time investigating health issues, Senator Denman, who is in the chamber at the moment, and I were able to visit the San Lazaro hospital in Manila and to inspect the hospital's centre for HIV/AIDS patients. While at the hospital, we were briefed by the project manager and community physician of the AusAID funded Remedios STD clinic.
In Japan, the delegation met with Mr Takumi Nemoto, the Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Health and Welfare, whom we were able to ask about the details of the Japanese government's strategy with respect to the fight against drugs and HIV, as well as about their aged care and pension policies. Senator Denman and I also called upon Mr Ienishi, a member of the House of Representatives from the opposition Democratic Party of Japan. Mr Ienishi is a leading campaigner for the rights of Japanese infected with AIDS through the use of tainted blood products to treat haemophilia and other ailments. Mr Ienishi provided a valuable first-hand account of the issues faced by AIDS sufferers in Japan and expressed interest in Australian approaches to the problem.
In Japan, discussions focused on the economy and on the financial restructuring measures put in place by the Obuchi government to restore confidence in the banking system and stimulate consumer spending and investment. There remain continuing concerns about the pace of reform in the areas of financial market deregulation and tariff reforms on a range of agricultural imports, some of which are important Australian agricultural exports—such as dairy products, meat and rice.
I agree with some of my delegation colleagues that political and business leaders showed a lack of urgency with regard to change—particularly in regard to trade and financial deregulation matters. Representatives of the Diet Members' League were very senior political figures and the league would greatly benefit, we believe, from an infusion of younger Diet members.
It was also an interesting observation that, while Japan is in somewhat of a recession, there was a severe lack of willingness to spend and people had not been encouraged at all to spend. The older community were very much sitting on the money and the assets, while the younger people were the ones who were saying, `We have to move forward, take some risks and get the country back on its feet.' It was also apparent that the Japan-Australia Business Cooperation Committee consisted of very conservative and senior business leaders and was dominated by 
 commodity importers at the expense of representatives of such sectors as food processing and information technology—both areas in which Australia is keen to develop markets in Japan.
The delegation's visit to regional areas of Japan enabled members to strengthen and consolidate already effective sister city relationships with Sasebo and Nara—sister cities of Coffs Harbour and Canberra—to be briefed on regional trade initiatives being undertaken by the Australian Consulate in Fukuoka and to observe the local tourism facilities in Nara and in the Mie Prefecture.
In both the Philippines and Japan, the delegation was received with warmth and friendliness both at official levels and by its many hosts within the capital cities and in a variety of provincial centres. The itineraries in both places were absolutely first class and provided us with a very broad ranging cover of a whole range of issues that gave us a great insight into the past, the present and the future strategies of both countries. I sincerely thank my delegation colleagues, as well as Dr Margot Kerley, for their support and for the constructive contributions that were made by everyone.
I would also like to mention the highly professional assistance received from the Australian Embassy staff in both the Philippines and Japan. We could not have asked for better support from both embassies. The amount of briefing they did and the support they gave us right throughout the visit to both the Philippines and Japan were nothing short of first class.",SENATE,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Parliamentary Delegation to the Philippines and Japan</title>,Delegation Reports,10,1
"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,1999-09-28,"—I will be very brief. I would like to congratulate Senator Knowles on the report; it is excellent. The things she has addressed are the things that were important. I would also like to briefly congratulate the embassies in both places for the superb support they gave us. They went out of their way to make sure the things we wanted to do and see happened.
I would first of all like to speak on the Philippines. I was particularly keen to go back to the Philippines—I had been there in 1996 on a delegation—to see whether there had 
 been any changes under the Estrada government. They still have a lot of problems, with their major problem being their high population growth and enormous poverty. They have a population of 74.5 million and, out of that, 25 million are living in enormous poverty.
As Senator Knowles said, she and I visited the San Lazaro hospital where we were briefed on the AIDS educational programs. We met with AIDS patients, and it was interesting to see AIDS patients and their families living together in the hospital with the families helping to care for the patients. Women with AIDS are able to have their children stay with them, which is of enormous comfort to the women.
One of the other persons from the Philippines I would like to mention is Senate President Fernan. He was an enormously courageous man. He spent just about the whole of the day with us on 25 May, and he hosted a dinner for us that night. He was terminally ill and he died about a week after we left the Philippines. He was a very gracious person and so was his wife. It was very courageous of him to have spent the amount of time he did with us. We pass on our sympathies. The visit to Japan was, as Senator Knowles said, based around a lot of trade and investment issues. She and I, again, saw drugs and AIDS issues there. The AIDS issues in Japan do not get the policy attention that they do here in Australia. There do not seem to be the AIDS problems, according to the Japanese, that some other countries have.
Since 1963, it has been compulsory for drug addicts to be hospitalised in Japan. It is also compulsory for doctors and the law to enforce and report officially drug addicts. The minister for health and welfare is undertaking several studies to develop new methods to control drug abuse. As Senator Knowles also said, we met with a spokesperson on AIDS issues. He was in the opposition Democratic Party in the House of Representatives. He is an AIDS sufferer as a result of infected blood, and he spends most of his time working for people who have AIDS, which is not such an enormous issue in Japan. He campaigned as an AIDS sufferer and was able to gain a seat 
 in parliament to do the sorts of things he is doing.
The visits to the sister cities were interesting. Nara, which is Canberra's sister city, is a particularly beautiful city. It is the old imperial capital, and that was one of the visits we found relaxing, because it was a very full on visit to both the Philippines and Japan. We were flat out all the time with very little spare time, but Nara was very different and I really enjoyed it.
A couple of issues that were topical to Australia at the time were brought up in both countries. One was the referendum—both countries were very keen to know how we thought the vote would go—and the second was East Timor. We were asked many times by politicians on all sides of politics what we thought would happen in East Timor.
Finally, I would like to pay tribute to Dr Margot Kerley, who was the secretary for the delegation, and the other members of the delegation. It was a very compatible delegation. We did not have any disagreements. I think we all enjoyed it, and I send my sincere thanks to the embassies in both countries for their organisation.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-28,"—When we adjourned yesterday, I was speaking in support of our Labor opposition amendments. The thrust of my remarks went to the question of these amendments applying only to those providers who were not doing the right thing, and Senator Allison had raised objections to the amendments on the basis that these might have unintended consequences. I want to make the point very clearly that these amendments apply to those who have already had their approval to operate a facility revoked. These 
 are people who are not doing the right thing. These are providers who have failed to care properly for aged care residents.
We are saying that the current provisions available under the act and this bill do not sufficiently protect those residents. We have had the example of Alimar Nursing Home in Senator Allison's own state of Victoria where the provider was failing to provide care and where there was an intention to leave the industry. We had a great deal of difficulty with residents not being treated properly and families being most concerned about the treatment of those residents while the proprietor closed the place down. This is designed specifically to make sure that those residents who, because of the lack of supply of alternative places, are left in the residence while it is closing down, while they are looking for new places for those residents, get appropriate care.
No doubt, the minister will rely on the argument that the existing provisions of the act will provide sufficient protection. I think that is not true. I think the other provisions of the act provide enough protection to residents for providers who are trying to do the right thing and might need to be guided as to some of their practices. But these are the people who are going to have their licences revoked. They are clearly not suitable to be providers. They made a decision that they are not going to play ball, that they are not going to offer suitable standards of care, and our amendments try to ensure that they do provide that care and that we take a proactive role in ensuring the residents get that care. It is a very important addition to the set of provisions available to the government.
As I understand it, most of the current provisions rely on the discretion of the minister and/or the secretary to the department to appoint an authorised officer and are not specifically linked to a particular facility. We are not aware of any such officer being specifically appointed to monitor care residential facilities that have a proven record of poor care. There is no evidence that these provisions are providing the sorts of protections that we are seeking in these amendments. So we think these are an import 
 ant adjunct, and we would urge the Senate to support them.
Amendments not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-28,"—I move opposition amendment No. 2 on sheet 1508:
(2)	 Schedule 1, page 4 (after line 5), after item 4, insert:
4A  At the end of subsection 16-1(2)
Add:
and (f)	 the transferor has no outstanding debts to
		 (i)	 a member of staff; or
		 (ii)	 a care recipient, or the legal personal representative of a deceased care recipient, because of paragraph 57-2(na), 57-2(nb) or 57A-2(la);
	 or, if the transferor does have any such debts, the debtors have agreed to the transfer.
This is the opposition amendment that deals with the question of the sale of licences only when there are no debts owed. It is an amendment that inserts a requirement that the secretary must ensure that a provider does not owe debts to either staff or residents before approval for the transfer of bed licences can take place. The provision allows for the transfer to occur where all debtors agree, which covers the potential situation that the provider may only be able to pay out the debts following the sale of the bed licences.
We think this provision guards against the situation highlighted again by the Alimar Nursing Home example, where the department is made aware of the debts owed to staff but agrees to the sale of the bed licences and allows the provider to go into hiding owing staff money. If the amendment is not carried then staff in nursing homes will have to continue to fight for entitlements owed to them through the courts while the department allows the provider to sell their bed licences for substantial sums of money and simply walk away with that money. We are not talking about peanuts here; we are talking about bed licences that sell for $30,000 or upwards of that figure each. If it is a 60-bed nursing home, we are talking about very large sums of money.
We have had examples already in the courts of people, reacting to the accreditation and new standards of care required of them, leaving the industry. But they are leaving the industry owing their staff thousands of dollars in unpaid wages, redundancy entitlements, long service leave entitlements, et cetera. Those staff are having enormous difficulties trying to pursue their entitlements. Many of these people are the nursing staff who are providing care to the residents, or domestic staff, many of whom are on very low wages. This is an important issue for them, because they cannot afford to lose the entitlements that they have accrued while working, some of them for very long periods, at some of these facilities.
We think it is a very simple measure to implement what all parties in this parliament have been talking about in the last few months. There has been a great deal of fuss about the Oakdale miners and about other situations where workers have lost their entitlements to wages, accrued entitlements, long service leave and redundancy payments because of the closure of a business. The government says that it is very concerned about that. The government says that it is looking at ways of introducing legislation to provide protection for those people.
The Democrats also agree that something needs to be done. Senator Murray and others have been very vocal in advocating that we do something to address these concerns. I say: let's take a small step now. This measure provides a small step; it provides protection for workers in the nursing home industry. The very thing we talk about on a grand scale—protection of entitlements on a nationwide scale, which is proving a fairly difficult issue to come to terms with—can be achieved in some cases by an industry by industry approach. In the nursing home industry, the sale of the bed licence is the bonanza for the provider getting out of the industry. For that person getting out of the industry, it seems to me that this is a reasonable measure to ensure that they have met their debts, both to their residents and to their staff.
This is within the power of the department and the minister. They have to approve the 
 sale of bed licences. All we are asking is that we put a reasonable measure in place that ensures that some check is made before the sale occurs to ensure that those entitlements are covered. I do not think it is an unreasonable thing. We do not want to put overly onerous provisions on the department or the minister, but it seems reasonable that they do take the step, because they do have a great deal of bargaining power in this situation.
If someone has hundreds of thousands of dollars at risk, they will settle outstanding wage and other entitlement issues with their staff, because they will have to in order to access those funds. What we are seeing at the moment is those people trying to pursue their entitlements through the courts, trying to track down and serve writs on people who leave no forwarding address, et cetera, and who go into hiding to avoid their debts. The simple way of solving that is to support these amendments, to put the trigger in place that allows the department to make sure that all reasonable debts have been paid before the sale of the licences is allowed to occur, before the provider leaving the industry has access to that considerable amount of money. I think that is a reasonable step to take along the path that we have all been discussing about providing some protection for employees when a business fails or when a provider goes out of business owing them money.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-09-28,"—I indicate that this, as with the other amendments put up by Labor, will not have the support of the Democrats. That is not because they are not worthy; I think this one probably has some merit. For us the most significant problem is the fact that consultation has not taken place with the service providers. It may well be that they would support this proposal. But they have said to us that there are some doubts about definitions of this one and others. Perhaps the minister might be able to comment on what he sees as underlying problems with proceeding down the path of this amendment. Is there any problem with understanding what might be meant by `no outstanding debts'? Perhaps Senator Evans can answer this as well. He has already mentioned outstanding payments for salaries 
 and wages and the like, but I wonder if there are, as we have been informed, some problems in terms of being able to talk this through, and whether or not the amendment has got some unintended consequences.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-28,"—Like Senator Allison, the government supports the sentiment behind the amendment. There is no question that it is aimed in the right direction. However, the reality is that it is unworkable because the effect of the amendment would be that it would absolutely preclude the secretary from approving a transfer of places if there are outstanding debts to staff or residents. Generally, it is the poorest providers of care that seek to leave the industry or who are unable or unwilling to make the necessary capital investment by preventing or seriously hampering transfers. Would the opposition rather see closures than an orderly restructuring and improvement of the residential aged care sector?
Preventing the secretary from acting in a timely manner to transfer funding from a substandard facility to another would put the health and safety of residents at substantial risk. Places are transferred concurrently with residents to enable continuity of care, and staff work up until the transfer and in practice beyond to wind up and so accrue debts as they go. The provision could therefore never in practice be satisfied. Staff, of course, maintain their rights to action to obtain payments of moneys owed through Corporations Law. The reality is that the government will oppose the amendment because it is bad policy and it is unworkable.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-09-28,—I ask the minister or Senator Evans: what does this amendment actually mean? Does it mean that a nursing home which wants to transfer its licence cannot use the profits from the sale of that licence in order to pay off debts or salaries to staff? Is that one effect of this amendment?,SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-28,"—I do not think it is my job to defend Senator Allison's argument that there are unworkable consequences of my amend 
 ment. Senator Allison, if you are searching for a reason to vote against this, you find it. Do not ask me to find it for you. You have been told by somebody that it might have unintended consequences. That is all you have to say about all our amendments. The public expect better analysis of the issues. Quite frankly, it is not my job to provide answers to you when you say that there might be unintended consequences and can I find some for you.
The consequence of this is that the owner of Alimar Nursing Home collected $1 million, approved by the department from the sale of his licences, and his staff members are trying to get legal representation to go to the courts to get the $2,000, the $4,000, the $10,000 they are owed in wages, long service leave and redundancy entitlements. What I am trying to do is enact what I understood was Democrats' policy as well, that is, to provide some protection for those employees' entitlements. If there is a technical problem with the amendment which you can identify, then we will gladly work with you to fix it up. But you cannot just say, `Oh, well, there may be unintended consequences; it is all too hard.'
This is an important public policy issue. The amendment is before the Senate. We would expect senators to support it because it is one way of protecting the entitlements of these workers. I am not going to search around—you have asked three leading questions to the minister and one to me—to identify what you say might be problems. I am not going to do that. I do not think there are problems. I think with goodwill the department and the government can make this work. If there is an objection that a particular phrase in the amendment might have an unintended consequence, the government can raise that and we can work on fixing it. That is what we have always done in this chamber. But to throw up your hands and say, `There may be unintended consequences that we cannot identify and it is all too hard,' is not the answer. What I want is someone to debate with me why we should not be doing this rather than saying, `We agree with you but we want to talk more about it.' This is the chance. This is the first time in two years we 
 have had a chance to deal with aged care bills. Let's deal with them.
There is a problem in Senator Allison's state of Victoria, where people, as a result of the government's quite correct policy of improving standards, are being driven out of the industry. They do not want to make that investment. They are leaving the industry. Some of these people are quite shonky in their operations and people are suffering because of the loss of their entitlements when these aged care institutions close. This is a simple measure to give the secretary to the department the ability to protect their interests. I do not think it is unreasonable. I do not think it is all that hard. I think we ought to be looking to see whether we cannot support that thrust of policy.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-09-28,"—I do not want to delay this vote any longer than is necessary, but I take exception to Senator Evans suggesting that I am just looking for unintended consequences; I am certainly not. I am trying to understand what this amendment means. Since you are the mover of it, Senator Evans, it is incumbent on you, I would have thought, to explain such things. I have just pointed out what seems to me to be a fairly obvious flaw. If you have to deal with outstanding debts before you get the returns from transferring the licence, then it may put some nursing homes in a spot of difficulty. I do not know, but such nursing home operators are probably in some financial difficulty already, otherwise there would not be a debt problem.
That was a simple question. I am not looking for unintended consequences. This is one amendment of all of those that you have put forward that I have great sympathy with but, again to come back to the old question, if we have not consulted with the industry then we do not know the answers to these questions. That is why you do yourself a disservice in putting amendments up that have not been through that process. I am not going to say any more about it. We are simply not going to support it because (a) I have not been persuaded that this is useful and (b) you have not asked the questions in the right quarters. ",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-28,"—On the one hand, Senator Allison, you ask me to answer the question to convince you and then you say you are not going to vote for it anyway. So I do wonder whether I am on a fool's errand. I am happy to answer the question because we do provide in the amendment that, if there is an agreement amongst those who are owed money, they can proceed with the sale. But it seems to me that the more important point is that, if you have $1 million or $2 million at stake, then you can afford to pay out the $40,000 or $50,000 or $100,000 you owe in wages, et cetera. These are people who, the minute the secretary signs off on the sale of the bed licences, get a windfall. What we are trying to do is make sure that the little people are looked after in the same process so they actually get their entitlement before that provider disappears with the money.
We have provided for the fact that, if there is a particular problem where someone cannot meet the costs and there is an agreement about how the debt issue will be managed, then the secretary can provide, but we do provide that trigger for the secretary to the department to involve themselves before the provider accesses that money to protect the interests of those people who are owed money by that provider. I think it is a fairly straightforward amendment. Senator Allison, I just do not agree that there has been no consultation with the industry. I agree that some of them do not agree, but there has been consultation. These issues have been raised with them.
At the end of the day, the Senate votes on amendments to bills. We have an obligation not just to providers but also to the residents of aged care facilities, to the consumers and to the public more widely. I say to you that this is an important protection for another group involved—that is, those people who are employed in the industry. They certainly support the measure, but it is also for the residents. I think your concern about that particular aspect is covered. It certainly gives a lot of flexibility to the department in terms of approval, but it is an important addition to the bill. I hope you will support it.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-28,"—Senator Allison asked a question and I can confirm some of what has already been said. Holding up the transfer and sale of beds would make it harder for providers to repay debts, including to the staff. So Senator Allison is quite correct.
In reply to Senator Evans, I point out that his amendment would allow a debtor care recipient who does not wish to have care provided by a new provider to not agree to the sale of places for reasons unrelated to the debt. It would act as a significant impediment to business transactions in the aged care industry by parties unrelated to the transaction. Senator Evans does not seem to accept that, but that is the reality. It is for that reason that the government is not accepting the amendment.

"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-09-28,"—On this concessional rates issue, last night there was an amendment to the principles announced, whereby the minister exempted people whose assets are valued at less than $23,500. That is fine. I am aware of an institution in New South Wales that has four such residents. They have had those residents since the beginning of the changes to the Aged Care Act. I understand this abolition is worth about $4,500 a year to the institutions in concessional payments. If they have four residents, that adds up to their being $18,000 a year out of pocket. This has been going on for two years, which means that this institution in New South Wales is $36,000 out of pocket. Can the minister tell me whether he is going to do anything to compensate institutions that have lost money up to the gazetting of this particular amendment to the principle? Is the government going to undertake to compensate those institutions for that amount of money? Some $36,000 over two years is a lot of money to an institution. That is a fair part of one member of staff's salary.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-28,—The answer is that those residents would have been covered under the hardship provisions. The services would have the money. There have been 22 such approvals since 1 October 1997.

"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-09-28,"—Is the minister telling me that all of these clients—or residents, patients or whatever you want to call them—since October 1997 have been in receipt of hardship provisions?

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-28,"—Perhaps as a starting point, I would ask what accountability mechanisms are in place to ensure that the concessional resident supplement—which I understand will be $142 million this year, $169 million next year and $180 million the year after that—will be spent on capital?",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-28,"—I am seeking advice on that, but I would assume that that would be notified to the department and then it would 
 be up to the department to accept or reject that advice.
Advice has now been provided to me that the concession is not purely for capital and accountability is on the outcomes of that. For example, the providers who needed to spend money on improving care services and other services which do not relate to capital requirements for certification and accreditation would not be able to do so. Effective mechanisms already exist to ensure that providers direct sufficient funding to capital upgrading. Providers are required to report annually on their upgrading activity, and certification and accreditation frameworks have built-in mechanisms to ensure continuous improvements.
Providers who do not continue to upgrade their facilities lose the capacity to receive concessional resident supplements and from 2001 they will lose government subsidies as well. It should be clear that these requirements would be extremely difficult for the government to monitor and it would place a heavy administrative burden on providers to document expenditure and reserves. Because of that, these amendments could severely impact on care and services for residents and could prevent providers from achieving accreditation by interfering with their ability to manage their finances to provide the best care and accommodation for residents. For that reason, we will be opposing the amendment.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-28,"—I do not know that that fully answers my question. My question was: what accountability measures do we have to ensure that the $150 million or so each year that goes on the concessional resident supplement—which, when it was announced by the government, was for capital—is spent on capital? I understand that the minister is now saying that it is not only for capital. Is he therefore indicating that this is now a subsidy for care by the providers, because I thought that was made by a separate payment? My understanding, and that of the industry, was that these were funds provided for capital. If you are not saying that, I would appreciate your being a bit clearer about what the concessional resident supplement is for, what 
 accountability measures are in place to ensure that the money is used for those purposes and where in the bill these provisions are made.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-28,"—It seems like Senator Evans is putting up another straw man to knock down. There is no quarantining as to whether the money should be spent on capital or on care. It is an overall sum that is provided. As I said previously, the department provides notification of any upgrading that occurs, but I do not know where Senator Evans got this straw man from.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-28,"—As I understood it, Minister, when you introduced your aged care reforms, we had a situation where there was an accommodation charge levied against those who could afford to pay under your guidelines to meet the capital needs of the sector. In the case where the resident was not able to contribute to that accommodation charge, the government would pay a concessional resident supplement to the provider in lieu of that charge. You then have a situation where the provider receives either the accommodation charge from the individual or the concessional resident supplement from the government. Forgive me if I have misunderstood, but I thought one was in lieu of the other and that they were both related to the provision of capital.
The government have made a series of announcements about the capital needs of the sector. They have traditionally pointed to this as being a measure that they have introduced to meet the capital needs of the sector. You are now telling me that the concessional resident supplement is not for capital needs but rather to meet the care needs of the sector. I must admit that I am a bit flabbergasted if that is in fact the government's position. So perhaps you could explain further.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-28,"—It should be fairly obvious to Senator Evans that when we came to government we inherited a terrible mess and a terrible backlog of aged care places. 
 There was a desperate need for an injection of capital into the aged care industry. The concessional supplement was about ensuring access to care for those who could not pay. It can be used for capital—and it is—but it is not quarantined. As I say, I do not know where Senator Evans got this idea. We inherited this mess and applied mechanisms to ensure that more money went into the industry, but this money was primarily aimed at access for people to aged care beds across the industry.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-28,"—I will not delay the chamber by having this debate about what is a bit of a rewrite of history. Certainly the government at the time used the sort of rhetoric that Senator Herron used then, and then said, `We need to provide capital to meet the capital needs of the sector.' He is now saying to me that the concessional resident supplement is not about capital; it is about care.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I object. What I said will be on the record.
—I am not trying to verbal the minister—as he says, it will be on the record. But I do not think that his answer is all that clear because it seems to me this was very much about the capital needs of the sector, and now the minister is saying the government's position is that this need not be used for capital. Of course, the intent of the Labor opposition's amendment is very much to quarantine this payment for the use of capital. That is what it is about. We seek to insert provisions in the act that set out the use of the concessional resident supplement and ensure that the taxpayers' dollars allocated to the supplement are used for capital improvements in the aged care sector, because we think there is a glaring hole in the government's approach with their failure to direct the use of the supplement in that way. Our amendment attempts to put some accountability into the system to ensure that the millions of dollars of taxpayers' money spent on the supplement are spent appropriately and, where that does not occur, the amendment would ensure that the funds be returned to the Commonwealth. 
The government's original estimate was that 27 per cent of residents would be covered by the concessional resident supplement. Last week, as I saw it, that was at 47 per cent. This is a payment that is supposed to cover the capital needs of half of the residents of nursing home facilities in this country, and we simply do not know what the providers are doing with the money. Most are doing the right thing and putting it into funding their capital improvements and ensuring that they meet accreditation—the sort of point that Senator Herron alluded to. I concede that. We are trying to deal with those that are not doing that. We are trying to make sure that there is some accountability for the millions of dollars of taxpayers' money spent. Minister, I want to know what accountability there is. What is to prevent nursing home proprietors leaving the industry and pocketing the concessional resident supplement payments that you have made to them?
We have always understood that there was a clear and strong link between the supplement and capital improvements. In fact, the industry recently put out the HESTA report, which said that the current capital needs of the sector will not be met by the accommodation charge and the concessional supplement. I will leave that argument to another day, but clearly they think there is a link between the concessional supplement and the capital needs of the sector. That certainly was my understanding. I want to know what there is to prevent a provider who intends getting out of business before certification comes in from pocketing thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of dollars in concessional supplements—not improving the facility, not spending it on more care for the residents and leaving the industry. We have had a number of examples already; more are expected to follow.
Why are you handing over taxpayers' dollars to these providers with no assurance that they will spend the money—even under your scenario—either on capital or care? There is no provision at all that they spend that money on anything. We are trying to quarantine it to the use of capital. Your defence is to say it is a more general pay 
 ment, which is an interesting development; I thought the funding of that was covered by the daily care charges, but apparently not. What guarantee can you give that that money is not pocketed by people leaving the industry?",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-28,"—Senator Evans either misunderstands or purports to misunderstand the whole point of accreditation. A poor home will not be certified.
—In two years time.
—Senator Evans is incorrect. He interjects, but he is incorrect. It is in now.
—How many homes have been accredited?
—Certified?
—You said accredited.
—Lapsus linguae. For the non-latin scholars, a slip of the tongue. I meant accredited—so it is in now. It is a hypothetical point that Senator Evans is making. Would Senator Evans point out one instance where that has occurred?
—Alimar Nursing Home, Victoria.
—Which was not certified.
—Order! Minister, perhaps if you make your point.
—I think I have made the point. It was not certified and, if it is not certified now, no payment of concessional supplement would occur. As of now, five per cent are not certified.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-28,"—I do not think we disagree about what is happening. What I am saying to you is this: prior to accreditation and with the changes occurring in the industry, there will be providers who will be looking to get out of the industry. I want to make sure that the concessional resident supplement that you pay, the taxpayers' money you send to them, is used for the purposes of providing capital. 
 I want to know what guarantee you can give that the money that is paid to these people is kept in the system and used for the improvement of nursing home facilities, because it seems to me that for someone looking to get out of the industry, it can go in their pocket and there is no guarantee that it is spent for any public purpose at all. To say that it is spent on care implies that your current care subsidies are not sufficient, which has not been the government's traditional position. So, if the current care subsidies are sufficient and it is not spent on capital, what is to prevent the money just being pocketed and taken as profit? There is no accountability in your bill for the expenditure of this money, other than the longer term view, that is, that accreditation and certification will provide protections in the sense of standards met and that that money will be required to be used. But that is a fairly nebulous and longer term view. I am asking you about the shorter term impacts and what guarantees we have that the money will be used for those purposes.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-28,—The guarantee is that if it is not certified now there is no payment of concessional supplements. So it is a hypothetical—it does not exist.,SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-28,"—The point I made is that no facility has yet been accredited, as I understand it. Accreditation is still 18 months or two years away. The sorts of standards that you say will ensure that the money is spent for those purposes are not in place. Even if they were, and even if those standards were saying, `You're currently paying them X amount of dollars to provide care. You're now providing them X plus Y, the concessional supplement, to provide for capital needs,' I want to know what mechanism ensures that Y is spent on those purposes? What accountability assures that it is spent on those purposes?

"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-28,"—The point is that we have had certification from 1 October 1997. 
 If they are not certified now, there is no payment of the concessional supplement. I think that is the point. So it is a hypothetical.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-28,—I want to make clear that we can agree on what we can agree on and then move to the point of argument. I am not saying that that is not right; I am talking about certified nursing homes which do not use that money for capital improvements. What guarantee do we have that that money is used for those purposes? They might well have a new building or a building that is up to scratch. What I am saying is: you are paying them $12 a day per resident for half of their residents for capital purposes and I want to know what protection the Commonwealth taxpayer has that that money is used for those purposes.,SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-28,"—There seems to be some misunderstanding in this regard. I think it could be clarified by asking: if they are certified, would Senator Evans accept that the building standard is good? That is simple.
—If that meets the minimum, yes.
—Yes, it meets the standard. If they are certified, they are servicing debt, upgrading and increasing capital expenditure. They require that for certification. So I cannot see what the problem is.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-28,"—I do not seem to be making my point very well. But it seems to me, Minister, that that is right; they are certified. But you are now paying them extra. Under your reforms you are going to give them an extra $12 a day—if you have indexed it, it will be more; I am not sure whether you have taken that decision yet—to provide for capital improvements. You are now telling me it is not for capital improvements; it is for capital improvements and care as a more general concept—a little ill-defined. I want to know 
 what guarantee—other than you saying that the buildings are okay—there is that the money is used for those purposes. I accept that, if they are certified, they have met the minimum standards. They are certified maybe for three years. But you are giving them an extra $12 a day per resident, and I want to know what you are getting in return for that payment.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1

"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-09-28,—I return to the issue that I was pursuing and seek some information about the paperwork that goes back to institutions when they receive the concessional subsidy or when they receive the hardship provision in lieu. I am told it gets paid to the institution. What is in the paperwork that goes back to the institution that allows them to reconcile the amounts of money they have been paid and to identify the hardship subsidy paid to them in lieu of the concession?,SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1

My sources are saying to me that they are not aware of that institution or the residents in that institution receiving hardship or any other subsidies. I would not like the minister or the department to mislead this place, and I would like that checked, because I think it needs to be very clear. It might well be that in the issue I raised when I spoke earlier things were not very clear or in simple language when they came from the depart

"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-28,"—I am in complete agreement with that. I certainly would not want to mislead the Senate or Senator West.

"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-09-28,"—I would appreciate that, because somewhere along the line this is not computing. I was asked by the institution, `What about the money that we have not been paid' and I wonder just how clear the documentation is and whether we are at cross-purposes. I would like that to be checked further—I think the department knows which institution and which individuals we are talking about—because, if there is some confusion there, then we need to iron it out. If it was not an issue, I wonder why it would have been raised in the first place and why the department did not tell us and the institutions this information some considerable time ago. There seems to be some sort of failure in communication here, and I would like to get to the bottom of it.

Amendment not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-28,"—I move:
(4)	 Schedule 1, page 10 (after line 12), after item 30, insert:
30A  Subparagraphs 57-2(n)(ii) and (iii)
Repeal the subparagraphs, substitute: 

		 (ii)	 to retire debt associated with capital works costs relating to residential care; or
		 (iii)	 where no capital expenditure is reasonably necessary to comply with matters specified in the certification principles for the purposes of subsection 38-3(3) and meeting accreditation requirements, to be placed in reserve for future use in accordance with subparagraphs (i) and (ii);
30B  After paragraph 57-2(n)
Insert:
	 (na)	 where the allocation of a *place ceases to have effect under Division 18, the approved provider must refund to the care recipient, or the legal personal representative of a deceased care recipient, any income derived from the accommodation bond and the retention amount that the approved provider received for that place and that has not been used in accordance with subparagraphs (n)(i) and (ii);
	 (nb)	 where a *place is transferred to another provider under Division 16 and the place would relate to a different *aged care service, the transferor must refund to the care recipient, or the legal personal representative of a deceased care recipient, any income derived from the accommodation bond and the retention amount that the approved provider received for that place and that has not been used in accordance with subparagraphs (n)(i) and (ii);
	 (nc)	 Rules for the refund of any income derived from the accommodation bond and retention amount under paragraph (na) or (nb) will be set out in the Residential Care Subsidy Principles.
This is the first of the measures that the Labor opposition is supporting which seek to quarantine the use of income derived from accommodation bonds and charges for use in upgrading capital infrastructure and ensure that where a provider closes down a facility they be required to refund the money where it is unspent. It is a similar measure to the one we just moved and lost in terms of the concessional supplement, but it is a slightly different debate because I do not think, on this occasion, the government will be arguing that this has nothing to do with capital. I am still flabbergasted by the response to the previous amendment with that defence. 
 Clearly, if we could not get support for that, I suspect we will not get support for this either.
I want to raise the issues at stake in this because this is an even more important issue. The previous one was about the protection of taxpayers' funds and ensuring that they were used for the purposes for which they were intended. The Labor Party's deep concern is that there was no protection for those taxpayers' funds and no sufficient accountability to ensure that funds were used for purposes for which the parliament approved them. This is a measure which seeks to protect the interests of residents who are paying, if you like, user-pays fees for their accommodation, either in hostels or in nursing homes.
The government's aged care reforms introduced charges for nursing home residents to go with the bond system that was in place for hostels. The thrust of these amendments by the Labor Party is consistent with the approach we took in 1997, that we were looking to try to ensure that there was some protection for those residents and that the quite substantial amounts of money that they pay to their provider for accommodation purposes is used for those purposes. We are not convinced that there are sufficient protections in place for those residents.
With these amendments we have sought to put in place a system that ensures that where an older Australian pays money to a provider for the provision of the capital infrastructure of their nursing home or hostel the provider is required to use that money for that purpose. I think it is a fairly unremarkable initiative. We expressed our concern in 1997 that there was not enough of a link or enough protection to ensure that funds were used for the purposes that they were designed for. We still are of that view and I think the history of the last couple of years has added to our concern that providers are not required to commit those funds gathered from residents, in the form of fees, to the use of capital.
I think, for good accountability reasons, these amendments ought to be supported. From the industry's point of view, there is another problem, and it is one that will 
 increasingly become a concern. The government's position on the last amendments indicated that there is this confusion now between what will be for daily needs and care and what will be for accommodation charges. There is a real risk that we will see the underfunding of daily care costs as the government seeks to blur the edges between the capital needs and the care needs.
Senator Herron's answer to the last amendment is a very interesting development in that when the care providers are arguing that they need more money to provide sufficient care the government is saying that the concessional resident's supplement that was for capital is now for capital and care and that somehow the boundaries have been blurred. I think there is a real risk that by blurring these boundaries, by failing to quarantine funds for capital, as was originally intended under the aged care reforms, we will see pressure building to use what was to be for capital for ongoing care needs, and we will end up in a situation, which a number of people in this chamber have gone on about at great length, where there will be a failure to address the capital needs of the nursing home sector.
I think these measures are important in terms of the consumer protections they provide to the residents. But I also think, in terms of dealing with government policy and development of the sector, it is an important policy imperative that we separate the two and that we give protection to the industry, if you like, to ensure that the money that has been designed to meet capital needs is used for capital needs. We will be moving these amendments along that track. Given that we have not been able to get support for less radical propositions, I do not expect to get any support from the chamber for these. However, I make my point quite strongly because I think it is going to be an important issue in the years to come.
I do want to say, particularly in terms of the bonds, that I would be interested in whether the minister can answer a couple of questions. I understand that paragraph 57(2) already requires providers to account for the income they derive from the bond and the capital expenditure, even if it does not require qua 
 rantining the funds for capital works. The issue I want to raise with the minister is: what action does the department currently take to enforce compliance with that rule, to have providers account for the monies raised by the bonds; and what enforcement provisions have been put in place to ensure that the income derived from the accommodation bond is being used in accordance with the act? Perhaps that is a good starting point.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-28,"—Senator Evans said he is flabbergasted. I am in complete agreement with him. I see from the dictionary that flabbergasted is `to be overcome with surprise and bewilderment.' He is certainly bewildered, because the amendment he has moved would require that all income from accommodation bonds be quarantined for capital works. I have travelled around many nursing homes and hostels in the last 40 years—certainly during election campaigns—and there have been many places that I have seen that certainly do not need money spent on capital works. This amendment would require that that money be quarantined for capital works. What if that place does not need money spent on capital works? Do we have to quarantine it, put it away somewhere, lock it up? He is certainly bewildered. I suggest that he come around with me some time to nursing homes and hostels—there are a wide variety—
—I've done my share, John.
—Not as much as Senator West and I have done, I assure you. As I said previously, because this is a similar amendment, if the money is not spent and buildings are not kept up to standard, they are not certified—they lose the ability to charge the bonds and, after 1 January 2001, they lose all funding. That is being pretty accountable as far as I see it.
As I said previously, these amendments could severely impact on care and services for residents and could prevent providers achieving accreditation by interfering with their ability to manage their finance. Once again, we are back to the `big brother', the good old ALP philosophy: control it all; make sure it 
 reports to government; do not allow people to make their own decisions. The nursing homes are required to reach a certain standard—that is what accreditation is about—and, if they do not become certified, they lose the ability to charge those bonds.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-28,"—The minister said, `They might not need it for accommodation.' Why would you then charge the pensioners of Australia and the older Australians who are residents in these places $12 a day if you think they do not need the capital? What you are saying to me is, `If they do not need the capital, you should not have a problem.' You introduced this fee and told the people they had to pay it to meet capital needs. They asked me whether it is being used for capital. You say, `If they don't need the capital, what is the problem?' I guess the people paying the fee would ask why they should be paying the fee. That is the question you have to answer.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-28,—It improves the standard of care. It is spent on improving the standard of care to the residents. That is the purpose of injecting more money into the system—so either it can be spent on capital works or it can improve the quality of care that is provided. But in either case it must reach the standards for certification.,SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-09-28,"—I want to indicate that the Democrats will not be supporting this amendment nor the next two. As far as I can see, this is going over old ground again. We had the same debate at some length back in 1997 when my colleague Senator Woodley debated the original bill. At that time, after lengthy debate, the Democrats acknowledged that leaving aged care providers with absolutely no flexibility in how to allocate the money they receive from fees and charges might be counterproductive. I seem to remember that there was some discussion about whether a similar ALP amendment would mean that providers with facilities which already met the appropriate standards would be required to keep on upgrading those standards. You might imagine moving to gold taps in the bathroom or the like to use the 
 funds for that purpose. I think that is what would happen. 	 It is hardly likely that a nursing home would return funds; they would just go on spending them on unnecessary materials. For the record I would like to quote Senator Woodley during that debate when he said:
In the initial phase, certainly we would want all of the money to be used for capital, retiring debt, et cetera. But down the road, does there come a point at which a provider has done everything he can possibly do? What does he then do with the income? It seems to me that, once you have done everything to bring the facility up to scratch, there may be the point at which you would want to allow the use of income for other things.
At that time, the Democrats successfully moved an amendment to the opposition's amendment which would require that:
. . . the approved provider must use the income derived from the accommodation bond and the retention amount in the following ways:
(i) to meet capital works costs relating to residential care; and
(ii) to retire debt relating to residential care;
or (iii) where no capital expenditure is reasonably necessary to comply with matters specified in the certification principles for the purposes of 38-3(3) and meeting accreditation requirements—to improve the quality and range of aged care services;
That amendment was widely supported by the industry at the time. So while a small minority of providers might have been acting against the interests of aged care residents in relation to the expenditure of the funding derived from fees and charges, I think it is very important to make it clear that these are only a small minority. Again, the Democrats, from my discussion with the industry aged care providers as well, recognise the need to examine ways of ensuring that cases such as those that Senator Evans talked about previously in his speech on the second reading are not able to happen in the future. However, it is pointless to try to do this without consultation with the majority of aged care providers, who are doing the right thing and who have the best interests of consumers at heart.
Again, while the sentiment is there—and we support that—and there is some merit in these amendments, we cannot support them, because they have been largely put together 
 without industry consultation and support. The major peak bodies that I have spoken with who represent aged care providers have all expressed a willingness to sit down and talk about finding effective ways to protect consumers against the minority of providers who are doing the wrong thing; and that is something that we would be happy to follow up with all relevant parties in the very near future. But, at this point in time, we do not see that there is a reason to move on these amendments and we will not be supporting them.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-28,"—I do not know whether it was a Freudian slip, Senator Allison, but you said that the `government' will not be supporting these amendments. I presume that you meant the Democrats. I did not expect that you would support them but, as I say, I have made the point a couple of times that I do not think it is enough to say that we will sit down at some other time and look at the problem and that yes, it is a problem, but we cannot vote for it. The duty that we have as senators is to actually deal with the legislation now and try to work through those issues. Your unwillingness to engage in that means that we miss that opportunity, and that is unfortunate. I do accept though, that these amendments are largely directed at a very small minority of providers. That is an important point to make, and I made it in my speech in the second reading debate. But we are dealing with how to deal with those providers who are not playing the game.
One of the things that I do want to say is that the `gold taps' type of argument is a bit fallacious. One of the things we could do is actually not make people pay the fee. The fee was introduced because we said there was a need for it. If there was not a need for the fee, because they had enough capital, couldn't we reduce the fee? Couldn't we take the burden off older Australians? Couldn't we actually ensure that they do not have to pay the fee if, in fact, it is not needed? We are saying, `Let's be accountable for the fees charged.' This parliament has agreed to charge people extra fees to meet the capital needs of the industry. So these older Austral 
 ians are having to fork out $12 a day—quite a lot of money—to fund these things. We are saying, `Let's make sure it is used for that purpose.' If it is needed for those purposes, then fine. If it is not needed for those purposes, why should they be paying it? I think that is a reasonable question.
The approach seems to be, `They can just go on paying it and it does not really matter too much. The providers can use it for whatever they want.' I have raised the concern before about the blurring of care costs and accommodation costs and what that will perhaps mean for governments faced with tough budgets about daily care charges in the future. No-one is immune from those sorts of pressures, so I think we ought to take that concern seriously.
Anyway, as I say, I am not going to win this debate today. I think it is a debate that we will have again, because the problem is not going to go away. But I did want to get the minister to answer this question. He relied on, in terms of the bond, the provision that Senator Allison referred to that was asserted in 1997. I want to know what the department is currently doing to enforce compliance with that rule and how it is working. If this is the defence, I want to know what you have been doing about it for the past two years and how it is working.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-28,"—One point that has not been raised that I think properly important to put in the Hansard  in relation to this matter is that nobody has mentioned the continuous maintenance that is required in this situation. Funds have to be spent not only to achieve certain standards but to maintain them. There is in these cases a continuous upgrading and investment needed.
In response to Senator Evans's last question, I have answered that previously: once those standards have been achieved and the nursing home has been certified, then that notification occurs and they would lose their ability to charge the bonds if they were not certified.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-28,"—I raise again the question that 
 I asked the minister about the amendment that Senator Allison relied upon in her arguments and which was put in requiring providers to account for the income that they derived from the bond and their capital expenditure.

That says that the providers are required to account for the income they derive from the bond and their capital expenditure. What form of accounting does it take? Is it purely the certification? Is that it? I think the minister has indicated by nodding that that is it. Certification has obviously become an all-embracing and very powerful tool.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-28,"—I just want to clarify that, Minister. Are you saying that the trust was established and now is being abolished? If so, could you explain why that is the case?

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-28,"—by leave—I move opposition amendments Nos 5, 6 and 7:
(5)	 Schedule 1, item 34, page 14 (lines 8 to 13), omit subparagraphs (ii) and (iii), substitute:
		 (ii)	 to retire debt associated with capital works costs relating to residential care; or

	 (lb)	 where a *place is transferred to another provider under Division 16 and the place would relate to a different *aged care service, the transferor must refund to the care recipient, or the legal personal representative of a deceased care recipient, any payment of the accommodation charge that the approved provider received for that place and that has not been used in accordance with subparagraphs (l)(i) and (ii);

Insert: 

	 (aa)	 monitoring the care of care recipients in residential care services operated by approved providers who have been issued with a notice under paragraph 10-3(7)(a) or (b);
The debate on these issues goes very much to the debate we had on the previous amendment, which was about the need to provide for the charges to be used for capital purposes. There is no support for that in the Senate, so we will have that battle, I suspect, on another occasion.
I do want to say, though, that I think the industry needs to consider this issue quite seriously. On the one hand, the industry say to me, the Democrats and others that there is a $1 billion shortfall in capital funding for the sector, even under current funding arrangements, and that they need more funds to meet the capital needs of the sector; and they have released the HESTA report and have argued that that seeks to establish the case for more capital funds being required for the sector. But, on the other hand, they argue that the Senate ought not support amendments which quarantine the capital currently available for capital purposes.
I suppose I am indicating on behalf of the Labor opposition that we think there is an instance here of wanting your cake and eating it too. If the sector want to make the case for more capital funding and to argue there are insufficient capital funds, they should not really be arguing that the funds that have been dedicated for that purpose ought to be used for other purposes. It just seems to me slightly inconsistent, and I think there are real traps for the industry in supporting this blurring that is occurring in terms of capital and care funds. They will be the losers at the end of the day if they acquiesce in that. Having said that, that is now obviously a debate for another day.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-09-28,"—For the third time in just over two years, the Senate is being asked to consider detailed changes to the government's flawed superannuation surcharge tax policy. On this occasion, there seems to be a begrudging acceptance of these changes before us by some in the superannuation industry, which is so shell shocked after three years of the Howard government that it is grateful for any scraps that fall off the Treasurer's table from time to time. I say there is a begrudging acceptance because one gets the impression that the industry would prefer to see the surcharge dispatched with rather more than more fiddling from the Assistant Treasurer.
There are others in the industry who believe that the changes before us are an outrage in that they apply retrospectively, a point which is all but acknowledged by the government. It is on this point that Labor has a problem with this bill and will be moving an amendment that will prevent the retrospective operation of this bill. The Senate should very carefully consider legislation which applies any retrospective penalty on a person who has already complied with the law as it is written. Senator Kemp has maintained that there is nothing wrong with the current legislation. If that is the case, why is there a need for this amending legislation in the first place?
In addition, Labor will be moving a second reading amendment, to be moved by my colleague Senator Sherry, which urges the government to address the unfair circumstances that currently exist for some mineworkers at Pasminco sites around Australia. These workers receive superannuation based on their base rate of pay of around $25,000 per year. However, because of working a 12-hour shift, the workers actually incur a surcharge tax liability which they are 
 forced to pay, despite getting superannuation contributions based only on a much lower rate of pay. Clearly, this is inequitable—just another of the many inequities of this flawed policy—and should be addressed by the government. A restriction on opposition parties initiating tax legislation in the Senate is why the opposition will not be moving a specific amendment.
Most measures in this bill improve and, to the extent that it is possible, simplify the operation of the superannuation surcharge tax, and Labor will be supporting them. On this occasion the government appear to have consulted widely in formulating this bill, which they seem very eager to have passed. As I said earlier, there was not complete agreement of the government's position on the retrospective calculation of the surchargeable contributions. Compliance costs associated with the changes are claimed by the government to be low, although anything related to compliance with the surcharge is much more likely to cost a bomb rather than cost little.
To the extent that it is possible, Labor agrees that some measures in this bill improve and simplify the operation of the superannuation surcharge tax, and we will support these aspects of the bill. The outstanding issue is the abolition of the advance instalment requirement, which should not have been a part of the bill in the first place. It was only Senator Kemp's stubbornness which saw it remain as part of the bill. Senator Sherry will have more to say about that, I am sure.
A number of the changes, however, are chiefly designed to address the legality of the surcharge tax on defined benefit schemes, particularly those on a `contributions holiday' and those who are unfunded and make notional contributions. This aspect of the surcharge is presently the subject of a Federal Court challenge, which may come as news to the government and its advisers, who surprisingly indicated, in evidence to the committee which examined this bill, that they were not aware of the court challenge. But perhaps it will not come as news to the government and its advisers, as one could be forgiven for assuming that it is the likelihood that the govern 
 ment will lose the case which has prompted these changes.
A senior superannuation lawyer and outstanding critic of the surcharge tax, Mr Noel Davis from Clayton Utz, together with Mr Chris Beeny from Mallesons and others who handle corporate defined benefit funds, are unhappy about the retrospective nature of the bill, which will require some superannuation funds to recalculate their surcharge tax liability. Mr Davis and Mr Beeny, who work as superannuation lawyers and, one could argue, benefit from a complex tax law, actually want to see the surcharge collection method scrapped. However, the government is unlikely to support a scrapping of the surcharge tax, despite it being a complete embarrassment, despite it being an albatross around the government's neck. The recommendation from Mr Davis and Mr Beeny and others is that, at the minimum, the government should ensure that this legislation does not operate retrospectively. Labor is inclined to support this view.
The requirement that super funds only need provide information to fund members if requested by the fund members represents a substantial cost saving to funds with a majority of members who do not pay the surcharge tax. However, it also means that fewer people would be aware that their super fund is reporting contributions received to the ATO, regardless of whether they pay the tax. It in effect reduces the transparency of the compliance costs of this tax in a way which I am sure the government is quite happy about. While drawing attention to this fact, Labor will not be opposing this measure, as it will result in cost reductions and a higher retirement income for working Australians.
Preliminary discussions with the Institute of Actuaries have revealed a range of technical problems with the bill relating to definitions of a number of terms. These definitional issues would ordinarily be issues about which Labor would propose amendments, but I understand that the government may be considering amendments as a result of these discussions.
The superannuation surcharge tax is a world's worst practice tax legislation and 
 administration. The super tax is supposed to be levied on some 355,000 higher income earners and collect approximately $500 million per annum. Instead, due to the government's desire to keep its promise not to introduce any new taxes or increase any existing levies, the collection mechanism chosen has cost all eight million superannuation fund members the high price of reduced retirement incomes through increased administration costs as a minimum. Some low and middle income earners who did not provide their tax file numbers to their superannuation fund or the Australian Taxation Office—and whom the ATO cannot find cross-matching data on—are also likely to pay this tax.
The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia estimates that the cost to super funds in administration and collection of the super tax is in excess of $190 million. Evidence to the committee from Mr Noel Davis that the industry's reporting costs in the first year of operation of the super tax were some $270 million to enable the government to collect $340 million of tax revenue is clear evidence that this tax is not only inefficient but is inequitable. For all eight million superannuation fund members to have to pay for the collection of a tax which is supposed to be levied on only higher income earners is grossly inequitable. The government should be ashamed.
Answers to questions placed on notice confirm that the ATO itself has spent in excess of $23 million, with the Department of Finance and Administration and Comsuper spending $3.4 million. That adds up to approximately $27 million spent by the government in collecting this tax, meaning that all Australian taxpayers have shelled out for this tax, which is supposed to be on higher income earners. Remember, many funds, particularly industry funds, and many low and middle income earning members will go on incurring costs when they have few fund members who actually pay the tax.
The ATO has also confirmed that it had issued some $454 million of 1996-97 assessments, of which only $347 million had been collected by 30 June 1998. Some $86 million 
 of amended and original assessments were issued in February 1999, bringing the total expected revenue for the financial year 1996-97 to $540 million, some $60 million more than the $480 million estimated for the 1997-98 financial year. Some $100 million has been collected since 1 July 1998, with approximately $76 million outstanding, again indicating revenue in excess of projections.
In February 1999, the ATO issued 66,500 surcharge tax assessments to persons who had not provided their tax file numbers to their superannuation fund or the ATO. While the ATO anticipates that all of these assessments will go to higher income earners, there are bound to be some who are not higher income earners yet will still receive an assessment from the tax office. This new tax is starting to bite the government, and it is the opposition's intention to ensure that all Australians know that Mr Howard has not only reneged on his promise but also lumbered eight million Australians with the most cumbersome tax in the history of taxation.
The figures I have mentioned suggest that many more people are paying more surcharge tax than the government estimated. This is expected to increase as employers are now required to provide superannuation information on group certificates, which will lessen the opportunity for surcharge avoidance. There is little doubt that the surcharge tax is an embarrassment to the government, particularly the Treasurer. Along with the GST, it represents poor tax administration and collection.
The Senate Economics Legislation Committee examined this bill and recommended that the Senate pass it subject to discussions between industry representatives and the government. These discussions have taken place and the government has indicated that it may move two technical amendments on the advice of the Institute of Actuaries and consulting actuaries William M. Mercer. Labor should support these amendments. Labor senators recommended that the bill be supported after the government address the issues of the retrospective aspects of the changes to the calculation of the surcharge and the fact that some workers are paid SG 
 on a low base but are forced to pay the surcharge tax due to allowances and overtime.
—You will live to regret this.
—I will debate you on the 7.30 Report  any time you like to appear on that show, Senator. The government's bill will retrospectively apply amendments designed to address the legality of the surcharge tax on defined benefit schemes, particularly those on a `contributions holiday' and those who are `unfunded' and make `notional' contributions.
—You have done a big shift. You have done a Nick Sherry.
—Order, Senator!
—It is all right, Mr Acting Deputy  President. The actuarial practices and methods of calculating the surcharge are presently the subject of a Federal Court challenge, which it appears the government is not confident of winning. It appears that the likelihood of the government losing the court case is what has prompted it to make the changes to abolish the advance instalment. In other words, it is an attempt to placate the industry in return for industry accepting the changes to the calculation of the surcharge which will retrospectively apply to a minority of funds.
Labor will be moving an amendment to prevent the bill from operating retrospectively. This amendment may have an impact on revenue that the government believes is owing from funds who reported nil surchargeable contributions. The extent of this revenue is unknown according to verbal advice from the ATO. However, the arguments against this legislation are overwhelming. First, Senator Kemp has said in evidence to the committee that the government is happy with the existing legislation. That is right. Senator Kemp has said, `From our point of view, the legislation is sound.' If that is the case, Senator Kemp, why then the need to change it? Nothing to say? No interjection at this point?
—I will have plenty to say. You have done a Nick Sherry. It will come back to haunt you.
—If you think the legislation is sound, Senator Kemp, why are we standing here today debating it?
—Order! Senator Conroy, I invite you to direct your comments through the chair. Senator Kemp, I invite you to use more parliamentary language, please.
—All I said was that he has done a Nick Sherry.
—You are out of order, Senator Kemp.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Second, funds who notified a return to the ATO of nil, based on the current legislation, will have to incur costs in recalculating a new return. Chris Beeny from Mallesons estimated in evidence to the committee that the cost would be approximately $40,000 to $50,000 for some funds. That cost would be borne by all fund members, not just those who are liable for the tax again, proving the inequity and injustice of this tax.
Third, most funds may not have the information available to them to recalculate the liability under the new laws. In many cases, the systems have changed since the 1997 and 1998 returns were made. Fourth, systems changes to retrieve information could have implications for the Y2K security procedures funds are currently undertaking. Fifth, this bill will retrospectively change the existing law. That amounts to a denial of right to take legal action against existing legislation if the bill is changed retrospectively.
Sixth, the government has claimed that less than 1,500 funds reported nil contributions in the period in question. That is less than five per cent of all 180,000 superannuation funds. If, as Senator Kemp claims, its existing legislation is sound and such a small percentage of funds did not report as the tax office may have liked, why is the government pursuing a retrospective amendment for such a small number of funds? The government has not identified any revenue with this measure, so it cannot be to chase more revenue. No 
 revenue—so what is happening, Senator Kemp, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President?
—You have taken bad advice.
—Order! Senator Kemp, you are out of order.
—Senator Kemp has said that these changes are the result of industry representations. But one wonders why the industry will want to foist retrospective legislation on itself. If there is no revenue attached to this, why would the government want to force funds to incur further costs in meeting this disaster of a tax? Those are just a few of the reasons why Labor is seeking the Senate's support for its amendment to ensure that this bill is not retrospective.
—It is a free gift to a lot of rich people.
—Try the Ralph package or the GST, Senator Kemp.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-09-28,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I rise to speak on the second quarterly report of the Chief Executive Officer of ARPANSA, the regulatory authority which was established this year under the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act. That act came into force on 5 February and the accompanying regulations on 17 March 1999. These dates are particularly significant since there was a six-month transition period inserted into the act during which all Commonwealth agencies were to apply for licences to permit their involvement in the operation of radiation sources, facilities and nuclear installations. That six-month period has now passed and all Commonwealth facilities must now be licensed.
One of those facilities now licensed by ARPANSA is the Lucas Heights complex, 
 which is operated by ANSTO. Since ANSTO is the intended operator of the new nuclear reactor the government wants to build in Lucas Heights, I would like to comment on some of the incidents that have been referred to in this particular report. Although it did not actually occur during the quarter of this report, the fuel rod handling incident has received another special mention. This seems to be due to a decision by ANSTO to change the INES rating of the accident. The INES rating is a figure on an agreed scale—it is actually an internationally agreed scale—from level zero to level seven, zero being where there is no safety impact and seven where there is a major accident such as Chernobyl. The fuel rod accident was moved from zero to one on that scale.
The accident was examined extensively by the Economics References Committee during the recently completed inquiry into the new nuclear reactor. Some of the evidence that was received during those hearings demonstrated a fairly lax view of the seriousness of this particular incident. I note that a period of eight weeks elapsed between the accident and the provision of a submission on recovery procedures by ANSTO. Curiously, ARPANSA's review of that submission took less than 24 hours and the operation was completed the same day.
The next incident report relates to a damaged sewer pipeline at Lucas Heights. This problem was dealt with rapidly, but the blaming of subcontractors bears an intriguing resemblance to the major discharge of water into the Woronora River late last year.
Perhaps most significant in the ANSTO related issues covered in this report is the small mention of the Little Forest Burial Ground. It is understood that previous media reports led to this inclusion. So that it is clearly stated on the record, I will repeat the sentence from the report. It states:
In total approximately 47,600 packages of active waste, with a volume of 1,765 cubic metres, were buried in 77 three metre deep trenches.
This is in a suburban area, not part of the main ANSTO complex. So apparently ANSTO will be applying for a licence to operate the site. I should hope so. My under 
 standing is that those same media reports which prompted a reference to this site in the ARPANSA report also suggested that there had been vandalism and theft of radiation monitoring equipment at the site.
We know very little about what is actually stored at Little Forest, which provided waste disposal for the Australian Atomic Energy Commission from 1960 to 1968. Certainly, there is uranium, cobalt, beryllium, small amounts of plutonium, traces of other isotopes and extensive low level radioactive waste. I hope that the commitment that has been given by ANSTO to make further investigations at the Little Forest Burial Ground in the context of the licensing process for Lucas Heights has been followed through. The Little Forest Burial Ground remains a major issue for the local community.
I conclude my remarks with a brief reference to the new nuclear reactor that has been promoted by this government. The ARPANSA report makes reference to the licence application for this new reactor, referring to it with the government's preferred phrase of `replacement reactor' when we know it is a new reactor. This report refers to materials which would be considered in investigating the licence application. Included were 73 public submissions. I hope these submissions have been treated seriously by ARPANSA. I hope that ARPANSA has been the regulator of government nuclear activities. I hope it will be the regulator of these activities. It should be. I am not confident of that. I understand that ARPANSA has now granted a site licence for the new nuclear reactor. The construction and operation of a reactor is not necessary. It is not appropriate. I reiterate the Democrats' opposition to Australia's continuing involvement in the nuclear fuel cycle. (Time expired)
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency</title>,Documents,16,1
"Watson, Sen John",LP,1999-09-28,"—Tonight I wish to share with the chamber a Tasmanian good news story, and that is the story of the Tasmanian poppy industry. I wish to take this opportunity to shed light on the growth, benefit and strength of Tasmania's poppy industry, where we have become the largest producer of raw narcotic materials in the world. There are just two players in this Tasmanian success story, and they both operate from the north of the state. Glaxo Wellcome Australia Ltd is situated at Latrobe, and Tasmanian Alkaloids Pty Ltd is situated at Westbury.
Poppy production in Australia is strictly regulated by federal and state governments, and Tasmania, being an island state and isolated, is favoured for security reasons. The Poppy Advisory and Control Board coordinates the regulatory and surveillance operations, and the Tasmanian Poppy Growers Association provides a healthy sounding-board and an information source for growers. The Tasmanian poppy industry was pioneered by Glaxo Australia in the early 1960s. Today it is one of the success stories of Australian agriculture and manufacturing. The industry's 
 growth has been based on the innovative development and usage of technology in all aspects of the operation, and Tasmania's poppy crop provides world markets with a reliable and secure supply of alkaloids for analgesic medicines.
Poppy production has quite an interesting history. For example, in 1806 a complex chemical responsible for pain relieving properties was isolated from opium gum and called `morphine' after Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams. In 1831 a process for the extraction of morphine hydrochloride from opium gum was developed at Edinburgh University in Scotland. In the 1920s, Hungarian scientist Janos Kabay developed a process to extract morphine from dry poppy straw, which was an essential requirement for the future development of a mechanised harvest. The year 1951 saw Mr Stephen King, an agriculturalist, and Mr Bull, a chemical engineer, commence work on the production of poppy straw in Britain—on behalf of the Glaxo group—as an insurance against the unreliable supply of opium from traditional producers. Heavy rainfall resulted in low alkaloid concentration, however, and the attempt to grow poppies in Britain was abandoned in 1957. A search began for a more favourable climate and, in the 1960-61 season, trials were undertaken in New South Wales, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. Poppies had been grown in Australia on a limited scale during World War II, but cultivation ceased after the war.
Tasmania was chosen as the location for all future development. In the 1964-65 season, the first commercial harvest of 52 hectares using 17 growers produced 140 kilograms of morphine alkaloid. Mr Stephen King moved to Tasmania in 1965 to supervise research and commercial production, and growers formed the Oil Poppy Growers Association. Thus a new Tasmanian industry was born. A reliable and productive cultivar suited to Tasmanian conditions was identified in 1969. A Glaxo factory was constructed at Latrobe in 1970 and, in the 1971-72 season, Glaxo for the first time produced sufficient morphine to supply the needs of Australia as well as New Zealand. In 1977 exports of poppy seed to the 
 United States exceeded imports from the Netherlands for the first time. In 1985 continued growth in the industry resulted in Glaxo supplying 13 per cent of the world's requirements for opiate alkaloids.
Ten years later, in 1995, Glaxo Wellcome Australia—Glaxo having purchased the pharmaceutical company Wellcome—supplied 25 per cent of the world market. Approximately 90 per cent of all production was being exported. The success continues. Work has begun on planting the crop for the 1999-2000 season. It will be the biggest poppy crop ever planted in Tasmania and is expected to earn about $200 million for the state's economy. Using 1,400 growers statewide, the area of Tasmania's farmland planted with poppy has doubled in four years to 20,000 hectares. Cropping is mostly concentrated in the north-west and north-east of the state.
In the competition for fertile farmland and to drive the industry forward, producers offer free seed and professional advice from qualified field officers, drilling charges are paid, all herbicide costs are paid by the company and deducted from the final grower payment and harvesting and cartage is undertaken by the company at no cost to the grower. An innovative payment system guaranteeing minimum payments and a bonus incentive scheme ensure satisfied growers. Each year Tasmanian Alkaloids give their growers the chance to win a Mercedes Benz 180 motor vehicle. The company seek out a champion in the poppy industry to create a goal for all growers to strive towards in trying to improve the product.
This year's winners produced a crop which yielded 40 kilograms of alkaloid per hectare. This compares to a world average of 12 kilograms per hectare. The return was $8,763 a hectare, which is nearly three times the northern Tasmanian industry average of around $3,000 per hectare. The support of Tasmanian growers has been an integral factor in the success and growth of the poppy industry, and growers have displayed an ability to quickly adapt to the many improved practices targeted by the producers. Efficiency in providing a competitively priced product and aggressive marketing of the unsubsidised 
 crop in the international arena have led to the industry meeting competition head-on from France, India, Hungary, Spain, Turkey, Poland, Yugoslavia and other countries.
Customers demand a reliable supply of quality products, which in turn enables them to supply quality products to their own markets. Glaxo Wellcome is recognised as being one of the world's largest opiate suppliers with exports to over 12 countries. Tasmania is pushing for more poppy exports to the United States, and a change of attitude by the United States Drug Enforcement Agency could result in increased Tasmanian narcotic raw material exports—which would be good news for the state. Unfortunately, the US specifies that 80 per cent of its imports must come from India and Turkey, with 20 per cent from the rest of the world. A relaxation of the US law to a 60 to 40 percentage split would enable the Tasmanian industry to grow significantly, and all parties are lobbying very strongly for this to occur.
Security of the product is extremely important. Tasmania has a worldwide enviably low level of poppy theft at 0.001 per cent. This compares with recent statistics suggesting a 30 per cent diversion from legitimate purposes of material in India and Turkey. All Tasmanian growers are issued with individual licences and these carry responsibilities and obligations which ensure that the industry maintains its status as the model of poppy production. The companies, growers, police and control board inspectors all play an important role in security and in the industry's future. As the industry grows, additional staff are employed by the companies and the control board, cars for field officers are required, new seeding drills and harvesters are purchased, additional trucks are required and additional laboratories are built.
The Glaxo Wellcome annual poppy crop is harvested and processed in Tasmania at Latrobe and the poppy capsules containing the medical alkaloids are processed and shipped to the Port Fairy plant in Victoria for extraction. The poppy seeds are cleaned and exported from Latrobe to the culinary food industry worldwide. Tasmanian Alkaloids has recently opened a new research and development 
 laboratory in a three-year, $18 million expansion at its Westbury factory, and the company aims to keep all its value adding processes in Tasmania. With demand for poppy alkaloids to supply the legal pharmaceuticals market growing at the rate of five per cent a year, Tasmania now supplies half the world's morphine demands. Further favourable outcomes for the Tasmanian poppy industry are ensured. Successful partnerships with growers, profitable and reliable crop returns, the application of innovative technology, crop security, the capacity for rapid crop harvest and intake, aggressive marketing and a worldwide reputation for reliability and quality have all contributed to the building of a sustainable future for this outstanding industry. So it is not surprising that agricultural commentators from the ABC recently commented that, if you want to go to an interesting place in terms of agriculture, you should get a transfer to Tasmania.
