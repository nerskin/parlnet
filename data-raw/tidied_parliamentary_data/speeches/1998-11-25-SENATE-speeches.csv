"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-11-25,"—Minister, you were seeking an answer to a question I put to you when we were last discussing this matter.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1998-11-25,"—The question related to the Australian Research Council and a discussion paper. I believe that is where we left matters yesterday. I can tell the Senate that it has been almost 10 years since the release of the last substantial policy statement on the role of higher education research in Australia.
Research and research training have never been more important to the nation's economic, social and cultural wellbeing, and it is critical, in the government's view, that public expenditure on research and research training be seen as an investment in the future. We should do everything as a government to get the best possible value for the Commonwealth's investment.
It is therefore appropriate, we believe, to look at this situation. A discussion paper was thought appropriate in this regard, and I am advised by the minister that he will be releasing shortly a discussion paper on research and research training. As I understand it, the government's position at this stage has not 
 been finalised. The discussion paper will be released, and comment then will be taken on it.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-11-25,"—Minister, could you advise the Senate what consultation has occurred to this point in the preparation of this discussion paper?",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1998-11-25,—I am advised that the department has undertaken the task of drafting the discussion paper and has done so in consultation with various vice-chancellors.,SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-11-25,"—I read in the press that various vice-chancellors are saying that they have not seen the document. For instance, I note a report in the Australian  on 18 November which says that representatives of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee have asked that they be provided with a copy. In fact, they have said they thought it would have been courteous for them to have been sent a copy. A number of senior vice-chancellors have been arguing that this has been put together in secret, and that the proposals contained in this measure go to some fundamental changes in the way in which research grants will be distributed.
It is suggested, for instance, that there should be a movement towards internal assessments and a removal of peer review for the awarding of research moneys. It is suggested that the proposals contain a provision for portable scholarships for research higher degree students to replace existing postgraduate places funded through the operating grants of the Australian postgraduate awards and that there be a research and innovation scheme in the form of competitive block funding to institutions to replace the Australian research schemes that currently operate and the bulk, for instance, of the funding of the Australian National University Institute of Advanced Studies would be rolled into the new competitive scheme. Responsibility for allocating research moneys and the peer review process would shift to the universities.
 It is further suggested that the government proposes that a research training and environment scheme replace the existing research quantum, to be calculated equally in two 
 measures—research income from all sources and higher degree research completions. A peak facility scheme is the final proposal—for large-scale infrastructure projects to replace the research infrastructure equipment and facilities program.
If these propositions are contained in the paper—and I ask the minister whether these are the propositions that are being advanced by the government—I ask: what steps will the government take to protect the quality of Australian research projects and the international reputation of Australian universities? It may well be argued that, should propositions such as this be advanced, international accessors would distrust the objectivity of the processes and cease to participate in Australian research projects because, inevitably, it will lead to a narrowing of the research and funding focus. Applicants could be subject to the claim that the process has been contaminated by nepotism and by failure to examine matters on an objective international peer basis. Minister, I ask: are those concerns justified? What action does the government intend to take to protect the quality of Australian research activity?",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1998-11-25,"—There are a number of questions there, Senator Carr, and I will address each one in turn. Firstly, the paper is not yet in final form for release. As I said earlier, the minister will be releasing that paper for discussion when it is in that form. Those who are interested in this area of research will then be able to comment on it. The drafting of the discussion paper is one which was engaged by the department, in consultation with some vice-chancellors. Others will have adequate opportunity to comment when the paper is released.
It is a tenet of this government's policy in relation to tertiary education that it will take all steps necessary to protect the integrity of the high standards that we enjoy. The process that the government has embarked on concerning this discussion paper is nothing untoward; it is a normal process. I presume that the opposition is not impugning the integrity of the department in the way it has 
 conducted this. I think that answers the various points of your question, Senator.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-11-25,"—I appreciate the minister's attempt to address these issues. I beg to differ as to whether or not the questions have been answered. I notice in the press this morning that Dr Kemp is not committed to a particular time line for the release of this report. Given the history of this minister in terms of releasing matters for public debate at times when there will be as little public attention as possible, can the minister assure the Senate that this report—this green paper, as some have called it—will not be released over the Christmas period when the academics and other components of the industry are out of circulation?",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1998-11-25,"—Dr Kemp has said that the release of this paper would be some time not very far in the future. I do not think the minister can be any more certain than that. Senator Carr knows how these things are done. That is as far as the minister can go in the circumstances, and it is not unreasonable for that indication to be given. I note that Dr Kemp did say that the document would contain a very positive set of proposals for university research. I think that indicates the government's commitment to the sector.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-11-25,"—Minister, you indicate that some vice-chancellors have been advised. I note in the press that a number of senior academics, including Professor O'Kane, the former chair of the ARC's large grants committee, has indicated strong support for the international peer review system. As I understand it, she is one of the vice-chancellors that have not been consulted about this measure. Has there been any consultation with anyone else in the industry, apart from the government's few hand-picked vice-chancellors?",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1998-11-25,"—I understand that, apart from the vice-chancellors that I have referred to, there have been some others, perhaps not of the same seniority as a vice-chancellor but nonetheless with expertise in this area, who have been con 
 sulted. I have not been privy to that process of consultation.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-11-25,"—Perhaps that is a matter that we will have to take up in the estimates, Minister. I am sure you will look forward to that discussion. I ask: what guarantee will there be under this proposal that there will not be a concentration of research funding to the so-called big eight? Has there been any consideration given for an equitable distribution of research moneys across the sector?",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1998-11-25,"—This is touching on what I have referred to previously, that the discussion paper will be released and will be available for comment. That is the time to address these points, I would suggest, Senator Carr. I am really unable to take it any further than that today.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-11-25,"—I appreciate that, Minister. I asked yesterday a question concerning illegal fees being charged by universities, which I would argue are in breach of the HEFA Act, or certainly that allegation has been made. I also note that the minister has announced that these breaches will now be investigated. Can you provide the Senate with any details of this investigation? What steps are being taken to immediately review these questions?",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1998-11-25,"—Perhaps it is opportune for me to address questions which were raised yesterday on this and other matters. Firstly, in relation to the ancillary fees matter that was raised yesterday, certainly there was an article today in the Australian  which was entitled `DETYA to tackle illegal fees claims'. The situation is that there are guidelines in relation to the fees that can be charged by universities, being such fees which are not essential to the course.
There have been some complaints—three, I understand—which the department has been investigating. Two of those have resulted in a change of practice by the university concerned, and one is continuing. As stated in the article, the government will investigate claims that universities are charging students illegal 
 up-front fees. This matter has been under investigation, and should further complaints arise they will be looked at.
Senator Carr asked yesterday about a drop in operating grants of $590 million from 1998 to 2000. That really is a similar question to that posed by Senator Crossin in relation to clause 3 of this bill, which relates to section 17 of the act. Of course, I stated yesterday that the apparent reduction in figures which appears in the bill does not take into account supplementation which would occur from HECS contributions. The Department of Finance and Administration has provided figures which show that, in fact, the operating grants will increase from $4.879 billion in 1998 to $4.9 billion in 2000. That is when you consider the supplementation of the HECS contributions.
Senator Crossin also asked me yesterday how the HECS contributions were calculated and whether there was any guarantee. I indicated yesterday that these were based on projections. These projections were arrived at via the department and, of course, the department of finance and the Commonwealth Actuary. I understand that in that there is a calculation of some 13 per cent for what could be classed as—for want of a better term—bad debts and that, in any event, the department of finance has guaranteed a top-up if there is a shortfall. Yesterday I indicated it was based on projections, but I am now advised that the department of finance will provide that top-up if it falls short of the mark. It is the government's view that it will not fall short of the mark, but if it does there is that assurance from the department of finance.
The other question related to James Cook University and the restoration of 450 places. Senator Carr asked on what basis this had taken place. I can tell the Senate that there had been a reduction in growth places which came about as a result of the university failing to meet its targets. It appears that the university has improved its performance. After consultations between the university and the department, there has been a revision of the situation and those 450 growth places have 
 been restored. I believe the other matters in relation to funding were touched on yesterday.
In relation to section 23C, which is dealt with by clause 7, Senator Crossin asked a question on the apparent reduction of $481 million in 1998 down to $417 million in 2000. What is not provided for in those figures is the $36.8 million which has been provided for the year 2000 in relation to the strategic partnerships which I mentioned yesterday. There is a reduction in those figures that relates to the quality program, which was a one-off program provided for by the previous government. The discontinuance of that has resulted in the savings that we see. So, when you take that into account and then add in the $36.8 million that I have mentioned, the situation is not as it would seem in the bill as described at clause 7. On the question of open learning—and this is to Senator Carr—there has been no change in the policy and this bill, I am advised, in no way affects that policy.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-25,"—Yesterday I asked a number of questions in relation to the inclusion of Notre Dame University in table A. I thank you, Minister, for your answers on that occasion. I wonder if you could expand on some of the answers you gave yesterday. For example, I asked you if you and the government had given any thought to the significance of including, for the first time, a private university in that triennial funding arrangement. I understand the rationale that you have put forward for the inclusion of Notre Dame, that is, that obviously funding of a triennial nature provides more stability and certainty for the institution.
I do not doubt the good work of this institution, particularly in providing educational opportunities in the Broome region. I think all members of the chamber would be willing to commend Notre Dame on its work, on its progress, but I state again for the record my concern and also my query as to why the government is embarking on what is an unprecedented move of including a private university in that triennial funding arrangement in table A and why we are not seeing 
 comparable institutions—I mentioned Avondale College and Marcus Oldham yesterday—not being included. I also brought up the issue of the new university, Australia's newest public institution, Sunshine Coast. I acknowledge, Minister, that you have said it will be included in that table when the legislation is brought to the chamber. But I still believe that that institution has good reason to question—indeed every other public institution has reason to question—why the government would take this unprecedented step of including a private university for the first time in the triennial funding under table A.
I will seek to move an amendment that returns to the status quo arrangements—that is, to maintain Notre Dame in table B. I understand that that will not be widely supported in the chamber, but I think it is an incredibly important issue, and that is why I give the minister a number of opportunities once again to explain the rationale from the government and to explain perhaps why other private institutions are not being given the same so-called stability and certainty.
I also would like to know the impact and the implications of the inclusion of Notre Dame University in that table. Obviously, apart from access to triennial funding, I am just wondering what accountability and reporting mechanisms the university will be expected to comply with. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Ms Trish Worth, said in the other House:
This amendment will have the effect of providing the university with triennial funding as opposed to annual funding and will provide a capital roll-in and research quantum in the university's operating grant as well as enable the university to seek funding under the capital development pool for major building works.
Minister, my understanding is that it is unprecedented for a private institution to be in this funding category, but I would like to know some more of the implications of this decision. Will this mean that other public institutions miss out? I note that the National Tertiary Education Union is asking similar questions. Will Notre Dame and any subsequent private institutions added to the act be required to comply with the same conditions 
 and public scrutiny as are existing in public institutions? So it is unclear what accountability mechanisms will be put in place as a condition of the receipt of this funding.
This amendment gives a private institution access to public operating funding without increasing the available money. Minister, please feel free to clarify that statement. Does this mean that public institutions will lose funding and student places in order to provide a subsidy to private institutions? And the National Tertiary Education Union goes on to ask other questions, such as: does the inclusion of a private institution within the same category as existing public institutions pave the way for competitive tendering for student places by private providers? In the context of declining fully subsidised places, does this precedent mean that resources will be spread even more thinly?
Again, Minister, while not seeking to suggest that there is any deficiency or anything wrong with the operations or the work of Notre Dame University—like other members in this place I commend its work, especially in that Broome region—I would like to know why the government is including a private university in table A. I heard the minister's answers yesterday, and I am yet to be convinced that this is an appropriate move for a private institution. I move:
(1)	 Schedule 1, page 3 (line 5), omit ""Table A"", substitute ""Table B"".",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1998-11-25,"—This will involve funding of $1 million per annum out of a budget which is well in excess of $4 billion. So the government rejects any assertion that this will detract from funding for other tertiary institutions of a public nature. In fact, the funding for this can be found from legislated superannuation which involved an excess amount. This small amount of funding will be found from that amount at no cost to public funding for the tertiary education sector.
I indicated yesterday that this university provided for tertiary education in the form of teachers in an area which is a remote area of Australia. In fact, that was touched on by the Leader of the Opposition in his letter. It is a 
 good point, because that places Notre Dame in such a unique position. This does not put Notre Dame's Fremantle campus in table A; it is the Broome campus that we are talking about. It was the work at that Broome campus that I referred to yesterday. So the funding of this relates to its Broome operations, which of course provide sorely needed access to tertiary education.
The National Tertiary Education Union ought to have a look at what Notre Dame does in the north-west and perhaps look at the unique service it provides in tertiary education in the Kimberley—to those people living in remote areas—and also its indigenous education. It is not the only private university to be in table A. The Australian Catholic University is also in table A. So this move is by no means the first of its kind, but it does provide for recognition of the unique work that is done by Notre Dame in a remote area and in the provision of tertiary education in that area, particularly in relation to indigenous students,.
So the government feels that in this instance there is no excess of exercise of any discretion. As I say, it is supported by the opposition and for good reason. I commend the amendment—not the Democrat amendment, the government's amendment as contained in this bill—to the Senate. With due respect to Senator Stott Despoja, we do not believe her fears and those of others are substantiated in any way and we believe that to not allow for this amendment would be a retrograde step in the provision of tertiary education in what is a remote part of Australia.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-25,"—I thank the minister for his response. I think it is very important to state once again, not only on behalf of the Democrats—I understand the Greens will be supporting this amendment—but also on behalf of the NTEU, that this is not a negative reflection on the work of Notre Dame as an institution. To suggest that the National Tertiary Education Union is not aware of or supporting the work that is being done at the Broome campus is not a fair allusion. This matter relates to private versus public institutions and public funding of those institutions.
Minister, are you stating categorically that money made available to Notre Dame University will not be at the expense of public institutions? Is that what I can ascertain from your comments? I saw your head nod, but would you please answer the question in relation to what regulatory and accountability mechanisms will be in place for Notre Dame.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1998-11-25,—They will be the same as any university which has public funding.,SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-11-25,"—The opposition supports the proposed amendment to the legislation and opposes the Democrat amendment. This is because we recognise the work done by Notre Dame University at its Broome campus and its teacher training at both campuses. The large number of indigenous students at the Broome campus—close to 80 per cent—justifies the provision of access to the full range of operating grants funding, including research and capital funding. With the exception of the two instances above, however, Labor does not believe there is justification for further access to Commonwealth operating grants funding for Notre Dame University.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-25,"—I thank the opposition for clearly stating their position in relation to this amendment. I will not be dividing on this amendment because it is clear where people stand. I acknowledge once again the work being done by the Broome campus of Notre Dame University. I understand that is the rationale which the opposition are using to explain the reason they are opposing my amendment. But with due respect, when Senator Carr says `with the exception of the above, we do not support private institutions being given access to public funding', the point is—and this is the point of my amendment—where are we going to draw the line?
Most people in the community would have a great deal of sympathy for the NTEU when they state that this is privatisation by stealth. I would like to see the government make a much clearer distinction as to which private institutions have access to public moneys and 
 why. Is it simply because you have arbitrarily decided that this happens to be a particularly good institution and that we all support the work of that institution in the region, obviously, commendably, because it is doing work with indigenous communities? Are there specific guidelines in place suggesting why this private institution over any other should be given access to public moneys?
With respect to the opposition, I suggest that this is being done not only by stealth but that, as other representatives of the education movement have suggested, this argument is, once again, the thin edge of the wedge. Basically, we are now paving the way for private institutions to be in table A, that is a funding pool which enables them access not only to triennial funding but also to a range of other funding. The opposition has to realise that this is quite an important step today. The government amendments which they are supporting really do blur the distinction between public and private institutions when it comes to access to public money for education in this country. That is a serious step. This is not a reflection on the particular institution, but it is very clear that the Democrats and some others in this chamber believe that public money should be available first and foremost to public institutions. I have grave concerns about the direction in which we are heading.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-25,"—As Senator Stott Despoja has mentioned, the Greens (WA) are prepared to support the amendment put forward by the Australian Democrats in relation to public funding for a private university. I understand the arguments that have been put forward by the minister and I also understand what is being sought to be achieved by Notre Dame University in this particular instance. But I can also think of examples where we have stood in this chamber—and during Senate estimates committee hearings—and argued about reduction in funding on programs within the public education sector. One that springs to mind relates to universities like Curtin University where the number of home visits for indigenous students was cut because the minister at the time—it was Senator 
 Vanstone—argued that everybody had to take a cut and she thought reasonable access was provided.
We have had the arguments about where the public university system is attempting to provide better access for indigenous students and the minister saying that that was not possible because of general cuts in funding. It is difficult for us to see that specific cases can be made for redirecting funding, and I do not think there is any other way we can say it. The money has to come from somewhere. Whether it is tertiary education or some other sector, you do not create funding from thin air, and the government is always telling us that.
Neither of us is having a go at Notre Dame University; neither of us is criticising the need to make universities more inclusive. However, we have had many arguments about reductions in funding for student groups representing indigenous students, and we have had many arguments about the government reducing funding for programs which specifically try to cater for the needs and cultural values of indigenous students. The government did not seem to notice or pay much attention to that. It does seem to be selective. I am very concerned about the precedent that is being set. I am prepared to support the concerns of the student bodies. I will therefore be supporting the Democrats amendment.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-25,"—I have a quick question for the minister. Minister, you stated that this change is restricted to only the Broome campus and will not apply to the entire University of Notre Dame. For the record, could you state how you will ensure that that is constrained? How will you ensure that it only affects that particular campus?",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1998-11-25,"—I understand that there is an agreement with the university through the profiles process which can accommodate this, and it will be based on the places. That can be readily identified in relation to the Broome campus. I restate what I said earlier: this is only in relation to the Broome campus.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-25,"—I understand that process, but I suggest that there is no guarantee that this applies to only the Broome campus. By virtue of the way you put Notre Dame University in the table, there may be certain agreements, but I cannot see how that is a guarantee that it will be restricted to only the Broome campus. Do you accept that legally it could be extended, it could be broader, and it could apply to other parts of the university?",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1998-11-25,"—In relation to its public funding, the university has to acquit the money in the way it has been provided and for the purposes for which it has been provided. For a start, I think the university is a thoroughly reputable institution. I take it that you are not suggesting that the university would in any way try to fiddle the books or fudge the figures. The department will ensure that that does not take place, as it does in relation to other matters. I can give the Senate every assurance that the funding will relate to only the Broome campus.
Amendment not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-11-25,"—The minister made some responses to questions I put to him yesterday. I thank the minister and the department for answering those questions promptly. On the question of the operating grants, it is apparent that the figures contained in the bill are correct. There has been a reduction in the Commonwealth's contribution to universities; that is, there has been a fall in operating grants of $590 million from the 1998 level, with a further fall of $140 million in the year 2000 under this bill.
The supplementation referred to is drawn from students themselves and is in part a response to the government increasing HECS charges by 125 per cent. This is money drawn upon as a result of revenues raised by those increases in the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. I thank the minister for confirmation of those matters.
I indicate that, in terms of the research question, I had not included all the questions 
 I wanted to ask on the matter. Given that this bill has been before the chamber for some time, I conclude on this particular matter with this question to the minister: can you advise the Senate whether the government is looking at any form of voucher system linked to research grants allocations for postgraduate students?",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1998-11-25,"—In relation to Senator Carr's question on the voucher system as it relates to the question of research, these matters will no doubt be discussed when the discussion paper is released. I cannot in any way pre-empt the course of that discussion, and it would be best taken up when the discussion paper is released.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-11-25,"—Obviously that will be the case, Minister. To conclude on this matter, in the second reading debate on this bill I raised the question of the adequacy of university reporting and the attention drawn by Professor Walker of the University of New South Wales to the inconsistencies in approach that are being taken by universities in that state. Specifically, he said that universities were making internal decisions regarding the centralisation or devolution of administrative functions to hide the true nature of their cost structures.
Professor Walker indicated that the financial reporting was inadequate and that those measures did not reveal relevant data as a result of poorly drafted instructions from DETYA in regard to the ways in which these matters should be reported. He said that the failure of the department in this area had shielded the management of universities from appropriate performance scrutiny.
Professor Walker indicated that, in the various figures tabled in the New South Wales parliament, universities had signed statements in their annual reports which indicated that the records they were presenting were a true and fair view of the results of the operations of the universities and that signatories were not aware of any circumstances which would render any particulars included in the financial statements misleading or inaccurate.
Professor Walker goes on to suggest that that is in fact not the case because significant components of universities' operations were not recorded accurately in those financial reports and were not consistent with various other financial statements and because the New South Wales Auditor-General had claimed that universities' published budgets did not encompass all financial transactions reported in their financial statements. My question to the minister is: does the government believe there is a need to standardise reporting by formulating draft rules governing universities' accounting practices which do take into account these criticisms? When will DETYA be able to effectively monitor the operations of universities and the profiles process without such reforms of the accounting guidelines?",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1998-11-25,"—Firstly, I can assure the Senate that the Commonwealth grants to universities are fully and effectively acquitted. Secondly, financial statements of New South Wales universities have been audited by the New South Wales Auditor-General and have not been qualified. Thirdly, in relation to the question of the development of financial reporting, I am advised that the Australian Accounting Research Foundation is conducting a program to achieve greater harmonisation between Australian accounting standards and those of the International Accounting Standards Committee. The intention is to complete the program by the time the International Organisation of Securities Commissions provides its endorsement of the IASC accounting standards.
Advice from the Australian Accounting Research Foundation is that a new accounting standard on financial operating statements should be issued in the second quarter of 1999. It would be sensible to await the outcome of the work being undertaken by the AARF before any revision of the guidelines is undertaken. I am advised that there is work in progress in the division on financial reporting and analysis. That includes the Deloitte financial statement analysis of universities' financial health, the analysis of three-year projections of university income and expendi 
 tures, Ernst and Young's developing of a robust costing methodology for use in Australian universities and the development of a response to the Coopers and Lybrand review of university reporting requirements.
In view of the work in progress that I have mentioned and the program which is being conducted by the AARF, it is the government's view that it is sensible to await the outcome of that work. The minister has said that he believes there is scope for improvement in financial statements from the point of view of increasing transparency for stakeholders and this is something that the government is working towards.
Bill agreed to.
Bill reported without amendment; report adopted.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-11-25,"—The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1998  amends the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Assistance) Act 1996 to give effect to the budget measures and to make a range of other changes. It provides $40.2 million to extend the National Asian Languages and Studies in Australian Schools Program to the end of 1999. The NALSAS was an initiative of the federal Labor government in 1994 to support, enhance and expand Asian language studies in all Australian schools. The languages targeted are Chinese Mandarin, Indonesian, Japanese and Korean.
I note that a study by the ANU late last year showed that more languages are taught in Australian schools than anywhere else in the world, particularly Asian languages. The 
 opposition supports this extension of NALSAS. We note, however, that the parliamentary secretary for education, during the debate on the bill in the House, refused to confirm the additional $90 million for NALSAS promised in the coalition's election policy and that this was additional money to be appropriated in this bill. So the $40 million we are dealing with here could be part of the $90 million, which is very much part of the style of the creative accounting which we have come to expect from this government, and particularly from this minister.
The bill provides some $20 million for the so-called full service schools initiative to help schools cope with the influx of additional students which will occur from next year as a result of the introduction of the Youth Allowance. This $20 million is part of a $40 million package of measures to help schools cope with the impact of the Youth Allowance. The other measures in the package, $13.5 million for the Jobs Pathway Program and $6.2 million for the new Apprenticeship Access Program, simply continue programs put in place by the Labor government.
The then Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs prepared what has now become a famous cabinet submission last year which recommended expenditure of $140 million to help schools cope with the influx of students as a result of the Youth Allowance. The government's package falls $100 million short. Schools will have nowhere near enough money to cope with the services needed, given that up to 27,000 16- and 17-year-olds will be returning to school next year due to the Youth Allowance.
These young people will need special help to complete their studies and to ensure that they do not disrupt the learning of others. Some will need basic literacy and numeracy programs. In many cases they will need individual case management. They will need one-to-one tuition. This government has not provided sufficient resources to do that. The former coalition education minister in Queensland estimated that each additional student would cost an extra $7,000, yet the Howard government is providing only one-tenth of 
 that amount and in so doing will exacerbate inequalities within our schools and restrict educational opportunities.
The number of young people affected will be heavily concentrated in the high areas of youth unemployment. The government knows who these young people are although, despite our having raised these questions at the estimates process, it seems unable to come forward with the relevant information. The number of recipients of the youth training allowance—those 16- and 17-year-olds who will be affected by the youth allowance from 1 January next year—can be identified by postcode but, instead of providing additional funding to the schools in these areas, the government is taking submissions for funding under the so-called Full Service Schools Program.
While a submission based approach may be a good way to encourage ideas, it is not the only way. I have concerns that the management of the allocation of funds by submission may lead to a situation where schools desperately in need of additional support do not receive it. I understand that some principals of schools in high unemployment areas are not preparing submissions, because they believe that the $20 million being provided is totally inadequate to meet their needs.
The Labor Party believes young people should finish their education and we encourage participation at all levels of education, but we do not believe that schools can cope with an influx of young people who are largely alienated from the education system, and in many cases from society as a whole, without there being additional resources to enable them to do so. The amount provided in this bill is nowhere near what is needed, and that is a fact acknowledged by the minister's own department.
The bill also provides for flexibility of funding allocations under the Literacy and Country Areas programs so that most ABS census data can be used for determining relative need. This means determining the allocations between the states and sectors. But what has happened beyond that? My information is that, in removing the so-called red tape in the 1996 changes to the targeted programs, 
 the coalition threw out the baby with the bathwater. Along with the word `equity', mechanisms which showed how targeted money was being distributed by systems have disappeared or at least are not working as they ought to.
For all the minister's huffing and puffing about literacy, the opposition is not convinced that literacy funds are going to the neediest schools and students. This is particularly the case in my state of Victoria, where substantial cuts to programs, running into millions of dollars, have occurred. This bill has inserted amounts for capital funding for non-government schools of up to $74,537,000 each year from the year 2000. This amount has declined from $84,672,000 in 1999 and is $39 million less than the $113 million that Labor provided in 1996. This extraordinary decline is causing major concern in the non-government school sector, and I call on the minister to give an explanation.
The amount provided for recurrent capital expenditure for 1997 and subsequent years is adjusted by this bill in the most recent rounds of supplementation. This leads me to the important issue of the real and nominal figures on Commonwealth school funding. This is a question that I have pursued with some vigour in the estimates. I have received totally unsatisfactory answers from the officials in this regard—totally unsatisfactory answers which I expect are being directed by the minister.
The amounts provided need further investigation and much closer examination. On 12 May this year the minister for schools claimed that the federal budget provided $153 million extra for schools in one year—a 3.8 per cent increase on the previous year. By 24 May the claim had become an increase to government schools of only $380 million in 1998 compared with 1996. Neither figure allows for the true year-on-year comparison because they are not in real terms. The second one includes attributed FAGS funding, which we were told in the Senate estimates hearing on 10 June had to be revised down from 24 per cent to 17.6 per cent.
Subsequently, the answer to question No. 223 from the same estimates hearing provided 
 projected figures for Commonwealth schools funding to the year 2000. The table provided included attributed amounts of financial assistance grants for each year from 1996 to 2000. I have had some work done on that table, and the results were extremely revealing. The work I had done shows that the amount of FAGS attributed to the government schools—that is, the percentage of untied grants assumed to be spent by the states and territories on government schools—was not the 17.6 per cent which, according to the minister's department, is the correct figure. My calculations show that for each of the years from 1996 to 2000, the table provided by the minister attributes 20 per cent of the FAGS to government schools. I ask: how do the government and the department explain this discrepancy?
That is not all; there is a great deal more. For example, Dr Kemp's FAGS figure, which he assumes to be a percentage spent on schools and then claims as Commonwealth money, includes amounts which are clearly earmarked for purposes other than schools—amounts like $400 million annually in identified road grants incorporated into FAGS for 1997-98, and $370 million for 1998-99 which was previously separately identified as health funding.
These amounts, while notionally part of the financial assistance grants pool, are clearly destined for uses other than education. It defies credibility to expect us to believe that the states will channel money away from other areas of need—like roads and hospitals—in favour of schools. So the FAGS pool used by the minister is artificially inflated. To claim, as the minister does, that one-fifth of roads and health funding goes to schools is a nonsensical argument. It is just as nonsensical as his claim that the $1.6 billion cut to FAGS imposed by the Howard government in 1996 had no impact on the states' capacity to fund schools.
Dr Kemp wants to have his cake and eat it as well. He wants to maximise the size of the FAGS pie and claim a percentage of it as Commonwealth schools funding, but he also tries to argue that if you cut the size of the pie it makes no difference to the Common 
 wealth's contribution. The people of Australia are not falling for this one any more. Minister, it is time to start dealing with the facts and not with fantasy.
The work I have done factors out those amounts for road funding and health expenditure. It also seeks to turn figures into real, comparable dollars rather than nominal amounts. In the table provided in response to question No. 223, the minister claims that there is a per capita increase in Commonwealth support for government schools of 13.5 per cent—from $1,987 in 1996 to $2,255 in the year 2000. On these calculations, adjusted for an inflation figure of three per cent—which is a very conservative amount given the recent supplementation outcomes and the array of indices provided to the estimates committees on cost increases for schools—there has actually been a decline in the per capita payments to government school students of some 7.4 per cent from $2,047 in 1996 to $1,896 in the year 2000. This is further proof that the minister's figures cannot be relied upon. They are, in fact, doctored.
This explains the government's flat refusal to provide official real funding figures to the Senate. It has been done in the past, but the practice changed after this government was in office for a few months. Ever since the table which the opposition obtained through the Senate estimates process in 1996 exposed the truth about what this government is doing to school funding, this practice by the government has ceased. That table showed a decline in the real funding for Commonwealth contributions to government schools of $87.5 million between 1996-97 and 1999-2000.
In the second reading speech on this bill in the House the minister claimed that Commonwealth direct funding for schools will increase each year between 1997 and 2000 by an average of 2.5 per cent. But if one looks at the government schools only, even the minister's own figures, which are in nominal, not real, dollars, show a fall in direct Commonwealth funding in the year 2000—$1.684 billion as compared with $1.730 billion in 1999. In real terms the fall will be much greater.
These figures do not include the impact of the enrolment benchmark adjustment. That will be a cut over and above the declining expenditure revealed in the minister's own documents. The enrolment benchmark adjustment is an unjust and unjustifiable cost-cutting measure which is decried by teachers, parents and school authorities right around Australia. The EBA is a piece of public policy so bad, so inequitable and so abhorrent that there are calls for its removal across traditional boundaries between government and non-government schools and between Labor and non-Labor state governments.
Taking money away from schools whose enrolments are increasing is unfair and is totally unacceptable policy. In 1997, New South Wales government schools enrolled 2,839 more students than in 1996 but lost $4.3 million through the EBA—equal to $1,081 for every government school in the state. In Victoria there were 1,414 more students in 1997 than in the year before yet the EBA reduced funding by $1.73 million—more than $1,000 for each government school. In South Australia the EBA represented a cut of $3,557 for each school. In Queensland the cut averaged $1,986 for each school. For each of the additional 8,495 students enrolled Australia-wide in government schools last year the Commonwealth through the EBA cut funding by $1,400. This amount far outweighs the per capita payments made by the Commonwealth for government school students of $379 for each primary school student and $559 for each secondary student. So the additional students represent a net loss to the states of at least $841.
There is no doubt about this. Despite the fact that this government has attempted to hedge these figures, a clear examination reveals what many have known for some time: the presentations that the government has made are inaccurate and misrepresent the real funding allocations by government to the students of this country.
It is about time the minister revealed the official figures. We will give Mr Evans and his group in the parliament the opportunity to present their view of the real funding figures in terms of real allocations of dollars. But the 
 situation cannot go on. There is an attempt to present these figures in a way which is totally inadequate and false. This attempt demonstrates to me the total lack of credibility attached to this government's statements about the level of funding for education.
This is not about making sure that funding follows the students under the EBA measure, as the government has continued to try to tell us. It is about cutting funding to government schools. It is about cutting opportunities to students in this country. It is about reducing choices and limiting life chances. This government has taken these actions deliberately and in a most destructive manner for ideological purposes. It is no good having the department seek to present these measures in any way other than what they actually are or try to cover-up what is an obnoxious, totally unjust and inequitable policy.
I would ask that Dr Kemp focus his attention on education and training and on providing factual information to the Australian people about the directions of policy in this government in terms of educational opportunities for all Australian students. We can only hope—and I suppose it is more hope than experience—that he will heed the call which is now coming from all sections of the education community in Australia that this government move to abolish this totally unfair and unjust policy.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-11-25,"—The bill we are considering today, the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1998 , introduces two main changes to the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1996. These are the allocation of $21 million for the introduction of so-called full service schools over three years, and the allocation of $40.2 million for the extension of the National Asian Languages and Studies in Australian Schools strategy. The Democrats will, of course, be supporting this bill because we understand that schools need the very small amount that is being offered, which will be available to them for programs such as these.
With so many schools already facing enormous pressures in trying to operate 
 effectively in the face of vastly inadequate resources, the Democrats certainly have no desire to hold up the passage of this legislation today. But I do want to take the opportunity to put on the record yet again the very serious concerns we have about the amount of funding the government is making available to schools, which will be faced with vastly increased demands as a result of the government's Youth Allowance eligibility guidelines. Estimates of the number of students likely to either stay at or return to school because of the Youth Allowance requirements vary considerably. Last year the government said that figure was somewhere between 25,000 and 27,000, but it has now revised that figure and indicates that it is 8,200. I might add that Victoria has said that it expects this figure to be 6,000 in that state alone.
The Australian Council of State School Organisations estimates that the overall funding impact on schools will be closer to $150 million than the $21 million which is on offer. There is a problem here in terms of the differences in expectations of students who will remain in schools who would otherwise not do so, and that is because we are talking here about a fixed sum—$21 million over three years, or $7 million a year—regardless of whether it is 27,000, 25,000, 8,000 or 6,000. That is what is really inequitable about this amount of money.
Many will go back to schools they have previously left, and many will no doubt think of themselves as adults already and resent having to return to school. For those students who do not want to be in school this will be something of a nightmare. I think it is useful to refer today to a document which has been prepared by the Successful Learning Project entitled Negotiating, Staying and Returning: Young People's Perspectives on Schooling and the Youth Allowance. In that publication the following factors were identified as influencing early school leaving. The first is the type of school system: the vast majority of early school leavers have a government school background. The second is gender: more young men than women leave school early. The third is ethnicity: Koori students 
 are the most seriously disadvantaged of all school leavers. The fourth is regional difference: rural areas have higher levels of early school leaving. The fifth is socioeconomic status: low income is predominantly linked with early school leaving. The sixth is change of locality and residential insecurity, especially homelessness; the next is early and chronic truanting, a clear indicator of early school leaving; and the last is family expectations of schooling, although this has declined as a factor since the mid-1980s.
The reason I point to those is that they indicate the sorts of areas in which this funding will be needed to address this problem of students being at school who would otherwise not choose to be there. As a former teacher, I can tell you that students who do not want to be at school can be a real nightmare for the schools and for the students themselves. So, when it comes to many of these returning students, the importance of specifically designed programs and carefully designed support structures cannot be overemphasised.
Aside from the $21 million, the federal government will pay its usual $550 per capita on average to these students. But, as has already been mentioned by my colleague, the rest will have to be found by the state governments. As we know, it costs around $4,500 to educate a student in a government school, but here we are talking about special needs, and principals estimate that the costs of providing worthwhile programs for returning students will be closer to $7,500 per capita. So, instead of providing $435 per student if you take the higher estimate of 27,000 who will be in this category, or roughly $1,000 per student if you accept that it is only 8,000 students who will be returning, it does not measure up to what the government ought to be providing, which is around $3,000 extra per student for this measure.
The ACEE Equity Network newsletter, an education publication, in its August edition reviewed the work that I have previously mentioned, Negotiating, Staying and Returning, and outlined four critical areas which will impact on the success or failure of the programs that we are talking about here with this 
 funding. They are the ways in which young people are treated; the nature of the courses on offer; the institutional flexibility of the delivery of courses; and the support structures, especially for those with most negative experiences, in providing both initial and ongoing support. The report argues that to be successful the nature of the responses required at the system level and the school level must include arrangements which reward schools and colleges for returning students and successfully re-enrolling students. That document goes into the reasons why those enormous disincentives exist for schools. It reads:
Melbourne suburban school principals are generally careful to balance the quest for overall student numbers with a focus on getting the `right sort of student'—who will present positive images of the school, and who will produce positive `educational outcomes'. Archdall argues that schools do not want to be seen as catering for the more `needy' students as they will then be termed a `welfare' school; parents who want an academically rigorous curriculum will move their students to a school which does not have such a `welfare' label. Being perceived as a school that cares for the `welfare' of students may then result in a lowered perception of it being able to provide a quality education, and thus increase the danger of forced closure because of falling numbers. The message is clear: individual schools which attempt to cater for the welfare needs of their students do so at the `risk' of being labelled.
That is just an excerpt from this report, which comes from the Dandenong Regional Youth Committee response.
The report also suggests that there needs to be a case management approach that aims to match individual students to existing or emerging options, to work with them in appropriate placements and to continue to offer support and guidance. The staffing formula for schools and units should undertake to accept and retain difficult students, to work with returning student needs, and to recognise the particular personnel needs of curriculum development and delivery and of providing support for students beyond the classroom. A staffing formula should acknowledge the implications of flexible timetabling and attendance requirements—in other words, extra staff. There should also be flexible development of courses and approaches at individual school and college levels.
One thing that all of the principals and teachers I have spoken to have made very clear is that providing the sorts of programs that are needed with the current proposed funding levels will be virtually impossible. Even with the most optimistic reading of the numbers coming back into schools,  $1,000 for each student, if one was to allocate it on a per capita basis, would barely pay half the cost of an ordinary classroom teacher. As I think I have already demonstrated, there is a far greater need for resources for schools to cope with this situation.
One of the most serious consequences of the youth allowance legislation is the effect it will have on the demand for teachers and, in particular, the impact on students and schools in rural and remote areas. I have raised this matter previously. It is a very serious and immediate problem arising from teacher shortages in this country.
Barbara Preston's report for the Australian Council of Deans of Education, published just two weeks ago, shows that 4,500 positions will not be able to be filled next year. I have done an extrapolation from those figures, which shows the direct impact of the youth allowance on that demand for teachers. In New South Wales 386 teachers will be required but will not be there because of the youth allowance. In Queensland the figure is 177; in Victoria it is 561; in Tasmania it is 52; in South Australia it is 94; in the Northern Territory it is one; in the ACT there will be a surplus as a result, which is unusual; and in Western Australia the shortage will be 107. That totals 1,386 teachers who will be required because of the extra numbers that the youth allowance will demand in our schools.
I want to foreshadow that, during the committee stage, we explore the possibility of delaying the implementation of the effect of this legislation. That is so we can look at those figures to examine whether there are some immediate steps that need to be taken to increase the number of teachers who can be made available and to stop any very serious consequences of this legislation, which the government did not manage to raise at the time the youth allowance legislation was introduced. There was no suggestion that the 
 shortage of teachers this would cause would be addressed by the federal government. The most serious concern for the Democrats is the shortage of teachers, along with the inadequacy of this level of funding.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-11-25,"—by leave—I indicate that, while the opposition supports this bill because it is an allocation of moneys, we are highly critical of the way in which this government is proceeding to allocate those moneys. To demonstrate our concerns more specifically, I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
	 ""but the Senate condemns the Government for damaging Australia's schools, including by failing to provide them with adequate resources to cope with the expected increase of up to 27,000 students a year as a result of the introduction of the Youth Allowance"".",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1998-11-25,"—Much of what I have to say this morning has already been covered by my colleagues Senator Carr and Senator Allison. But it is important to further put on the record that, while this bill will provide schools, states and territories with funding of $21 million for the introduction of what they say is the Full Service Schools program, that is $21 million over three years. This is by no means adequate if you look at the facts and figures in relation to the number of young people on whom the youth allowance is going to impact around this country in the next three years. As we know, the common youth allowance will affect young people aged 15 to 17 from 1 January 1999. They will have to be engaged in full-time education to qualify for payment, unless they meet special exemptions. This is going to have an enormous impact on schools across Australia.
There has been an allocation set aside for states and territories to help fund what we now believe is an expected 27,000 students between the ages of 16 and 17 years returning to school. In the federal budget only $24 million was allocated over a three-year period to assist schools with the implementation of the common youth allowance. This hardly meets the former DEETYA's estimate of $140 million per annum—not $7 million per annum—that will be needed to help schools cope with the influx of students in 1999.
The impact of the policy on the common youth allowance is going to severely affect many young people and their families. Firstly, it is going to force some young people who are living independently back into their family home. Secondly, it is going to force young people with family conflict to stay living in the family home. Thirdly, I believe it is going to create severe financial pressures on families. The other serious implication of the common youth allowance is that it increases the age of independence in this country, for the first time, from 18 to 21.
I think it is important to note that this $21 million in funding will be provided to schools in areas with the highest numbers of young people affected by the implementation of the common youth allowance. One of the questions I will be putting to the minister will be how they are going to ascertain that. We need to look not only at the areas that have the highest number of young people but also the different environments of each of the states and territories. I will explain a little bit about that later when I come to the analysis of the Northern Territory and what happens there.
The other thing I notice is that the funding will address the needs of young people who will be forced to return to school following the introduction of the youth allowance, and for current students who are at risk of not completing year 12 or of making a successful transition from school to training. That is a significant number of students across our school system. I believe $21 million does not take into account the fact that a lot of young kids leave the schooling system originally because it does not cater for their needs. As we know, there is a high incidence of youth suicide and youth drug use. I do not think the $21 million goes any way to addressing the poor self-esteem that young people sometimes suffer from in a downward spiral as they grapple with what skills they will need for their future—or what future they are going to have—and where they see themselves in later life.
I want to say also that the commitment by this government of only $21 million in school funding over three years to the states and territories adversely affects the teaching 
 profession. We already know this through the Senate inquiry into the status of the teaching profession, to which the government is yet to respond. I have my own thoughts about why that is the case: it is because the recommendations in that inquiry are too near the bone. We know there is low morale amongst the teaching profession. We know that the profession attracts people. However, the tendency is that people who get into the profession become overworked, have limited resources and get extremely stressed. More people leave than the profession can attract these days. Ultimately, the status of the teaching profession has become less highly regarded in this country. Time and time again, when people say, `My kid has left school' or `School is not catering for their needs' or `The curriculum is not appropriate', the blame is always put on teachers. The resources that are given to schools and the lack of assistance that is given to teachers to grapple with the many demands they have in this day and age are very rarely looked at.
I think we need to look at the impact of the common youth allowance and the measly amount of $21 million over three years when it comes to teachers' supply and demand protection. Senator Allison has already commented on the recently released report by the Australian Council of Deans of Education. That report, titled Teacher supply and demand to 2004: 1998 updated projections has been prepared for the Australian Council of Deans by Barbara Preston. The methodology in the report is rigorous and comprehensive and the predictions cover the non-government as well as the government school systems. The conclusions in the report are clear and compelling. I will concentrate today on tables 18 and 19 and will table them when I have finished my analysis.
In this report there are consistent trends across Australia towards a significant period of undersupply of appropriately qualified graduates. The most serious and extended shortages are expected in Victoria and South Australia. From 1999 to 2004, the supply of teacher education graduates in the primary sector will be only 80 or 90 per cent of demand. At the secondary level—and I will 
 refer to the implications for the common youth allowance—the shortfall is expected to be greater in that supply will be only about 70 per cent of the demand. The $21 million over three years, according to our brief, will be for:
the employment of specialist teachers or counsellors, providing professional development for teachers and other staff or delivering and developing special courses or assisting students to access government and community support services.
But the $21 million will fail to attract the large increase in teacher numbers that this program will warrant.
The figures on a state by state basis are quite astounding. Tables 18 and 19 provide national totals of supply and demand for primary and secondary teachers, including supply as a percentage of demand and the size of projected surpluses or shortages. Table 19 in this report adjusts secondary demand to take account of the expected impact of the common youth allowance. This table suggests that, across Australia for 1999—let alone up to the year 2004—the demand will be 8,334 teachers. The actual supply is only 5,262 teachers, which leaves us with a shortage of 3,072. When we take our projections through to the year 2004, that shortage becomes 3,192.
When we have a look at the implementation of the common youth allowance, we see that it will result in an increase in secondary enrolments of about 25,000 students, which is about one-quarter the increase necessary to bring retention to year 12 to 100 per cent. The secondary shortfall will be much more serious in 1999-2000.
There are a number of major factors in the projected shortfalls that are outlined in the report, but I think it is important to have a look at what effect the common youth allowance will have on all states and territories.
In the ACT, retention is already very high, so the effect will probably be quite minor. I might place on the record that perhaps bureaucrats sitting in the ACT might think that $21 million will be an adequate amount if they stay within the bounds of the Australian Capital Territory. But in Tasmania and the Northern Territory where retention is low, the 
 effect will probably be proportionally greater than in the nation as a whole.
I would like to remind this chamber again that, unless you live in one of the five major centres in the Northern Territory—Gove, Darwin, Katherine, Tennant Creek or Alice Springs—your only access to secondary education is through a correspondence school. This is a national indictment on the delivery of education in this country. We are talking about providing programs for youth who will be affected by the common youth allowance when, in the case of the Northern Territory, if you do not live in one of the major cities, there will be no access apart from secondary correspondence courses. Those correspondence courses are predominantly targeted at kids who live on pastoral stations and who will complete year 11 or 12 either through a public exam or a school assessed system. There is no secondary education outside the major centres in the Northern Territory. It is something that this nation should be ashamed of.
Getting back to the impact of the youth allowance around the country, this report suggests that in New South Wales the implementation of the common youth allowance will exacerbate the shortfall in 1999-2000, with supply in those years, as well as at the end of the period, less than three-quarters of demand. In Victoria, the impact is expected to move from a moderate to a severe shortfall, especially at the secondary level.
—That is dead right.
—That is right, and the expected shortfalls in the next two years in Victoria will increase substantially. Again, there will be little change in the expected shortfalls in the subsequent years.
In Queensland, the report concludes, the implementation of the common youth allowance is expected to severely exacerbate the shortfalls. For Western Australia there is the same comment. In South Australia, the implementation of the common youth allowance is expected to take supply well below half of teacher demand in 1999-2000. In Tasmania, the introduction of the common youth allowance is expected to ameliorate the 1999-2000 surpluses, the increased senior enrolments in 
 part making up for the reduced year seven enrolments.
But, let us turn to the Northern Territory because, of all the states and territories this report refers to, the Northern Territory not only attracts comments about the shortfall of primary and secondary teachers in greater proportions than for the nation, but the attractiveness of teaching in the Northern Territory and how difficult it is to retain teachers in the Northern Territory are talked about. It says that the Northern Territory school authorities will need to do more than increase their interstate recruitment efforts.
Historically, there have been very high resignation rates in the Northern Territory. Therefore, much more effective strategies to support teachers in the positions they find difficult and generally improve the attractiveness of teaching in the Territory, thus lowering the resignation rate, may be essential for reducing the demand for replacement teachers who will become very difficult to find. This is all within a projected national commitment of only $21 million over three years.
This report says that, because of the already high retention rates in the ACT, the introduction of the common youth allowance is expected to have only a minor impact. So we have one territory out of all our states and territories where this report of the Australian Council of Deans of Education suggests there will be a minor impact, but generally the evidence is there, based on supply and demand of teachers, that there will be a severe shortfall.
In conclusion, this money will target specialist teachers, but not teachers who initially will be required to be there to cater for the influx of these students; professional development for teachers who are already there, and devising specialist courses. You are going to need additional teachers to actually devise the courses. You are going to need additional teachers to get out there to work with ITABS and industry groups or to set up curricula whereby these kids who are being forced to return to school—bearing in mind there were probably substantially good reasons why they left in the first place—will not have to under 
 take public assessment exams. They will need assistance to get into an alternative learning pathway; they will need to undertake vocational education or they will need to be channelled into the new VET in schools programs—all on a shoestring of only $7 million a year.
Finally, colleagues I speak with from my background in the teaching profession say to me that this adds to their low morale; it adds to the fact that teachers are being asked to do more each day with less; it adds to the fact we are still waiting for the government's response on the status of the teaching profession. If the government's response is only to provide these people with $21 million over three years to cope with the large influx of 16- and 17-year-olds they expect back in their schools over the next three years, it will fail, and it will fail because there is no commitment to provide the resources to do any better.
I do not want to be standing here in the Senate chamber in three years time hearing that this new, you-beaut common youth allowance policy did not work because the teachers did not put in the commitment or because there was not enough effort on behalf of the systems to make it work. It will only work if there is a commitment to fund resources, a commitment to fund more teachers in the system so these young kids get a better go over the next couple of years.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1998-11-25,"—Much has been made of that aspect of the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1998  which deals with the full service schools and the provision of some $21 million over three years in relation to this program. Of course, what senators from the opposition and the Australian Democrats fail to have regard to is the total expenditure for education and the other programs that supplement the full service schools program. I thank those senators for their contribution. At the outset, let me say that total direct Commonwealth schools funding will provide in excess of $16 billion for schools over the period 1997-2000. The Commonwealth budget papers show that 
 funding for schools is estimated to increase each year to 1999-2000 with an average increase of around of 3.6 per cent a year.
Let us look at the facts. This government went to the people of Australia a few months ago in the federal election with a plan for the future education of the young people of this country. But it went to the people of Australia with a strong record on education. We had brought about, with the cooperation of the state and territory governments, uniform benchmarks, national goals, in relation to literacy and a plan to develop numeracy as we have developed literacy—in years 3 and 5, national goals for literacy.
When I travelled around this country during the election campaign, it was apparent to me that literacy was one of the greatest concerns of Australian parents. This was despite the fact that the opposition and minor parties downplayed this when this government raised it as a serious issue in the last parliament. We have provided funding to meet literacy and numeracy needs. We have provided $680 million over four years for literacy and numeracy. As well as that, we promised that in this parliament we would provide an additional $72 million over three years to improve literacy and numeracy standards in schools. We also pledged to provide an additional $40 million over four years to ensure high literacy and numeracy standards in the middle years of schooling.
The middle years of schooling is perhaps an area which is sometimes overlooked and is crucial, because it is from this current band of students that we are looking to increasing retention rates. The full service schools relates to addressing the fall in retention rates that this country has been experiencing in its schools. In 1992, the retention rates were at 78 per cent. In 1997, this had fallen to 72 per cent. Something had to be done about this. The parents of Australia wanted us to address it and we had to address it, because we had young students leaving school with nowhere to go. They were leaving school without adequate training, with no direction. So the full service schools, combined with the youth allowance, is designed to address this drift of students away from schools.
Senator Crossin said that students have good reasons for leaving school. I can say that, in many cases, young people do have good reasons for leaving school because they are going to a job or they are going to training. But, in many instances, young people do not have what I would call sufficient reasons for leaving school. They leave school without sufficient training or backup. So that $40 million for the middle years of schooling is a supplementary, if you like, to this whole full service schools approach.
We have to look at those that have just left school and we have to look at those that are at risk of leaving school. The $21 million that has been spoken about deals with the question of returnees and keeping those at risk at school. The number of students quoted by the opposition and the Democrats, we believe, is not a correct number. It will be much less than the 27,000 students estimated by the opposition and Democrats. We believe that the returnee figure is more like 8,000 students. When you combine that with the retainees of 12,000, you get a figure more like 20,000. The variation in the returnee figure comes as a result of amendments to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997.
What the opposition and the Democrats fail to recognise is that in Australian schools we have in place courses which are currently addressing those students at risk. This is particularly so in the areas of vocational education. Vocational education is perhaps one of the greatest areas of growth that we see. Since 1992, the number of students engaged in vocational education training courses at school has increased by over fourfold. That recognises the growth in this area. We as a government believe that this is crucial in addressing those students at risk.
Because of that we have provided $200 million over four years to assist students combine study towards a senior secondary certificate with nationally recognised and accredited vocational education and training. Therefore, whilst you are at school you can embark part-time on a traineeship or apprenticeship. When I travelled to many schools across Australia I saw some successful exam 
 ples of young students increasing their literacy and numeracy skills, going through to year 12, but at the same time embarking on part-time training—accredited training—which meant that when they came out of school they had a clean transition from school to work. Their training whilst at school was nationally accredited and nationally recognised. That makes perfect sense.
We have also committed $80 million to the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation to enable schools to develop school based industry courses with local businesses. I can advise the Senate that the number of students who are enrolled in foundation programs has grown from 18,000 at the end of 1996 to 38,000 in 1997. We have also provided $13.6 million over 1998-2000 to help schools become job placement agencies and mentors for their school leavers.
So it is not just the $21 million that we are looking at for those students at risk of leaving school and returning to school. We are looking at $80 million for the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation to work with industry; $13.6 million for job placement to assist schools; $200 million over four years to assist students engage in part-time studies and training at the same time; and $40 million for literacy and numeracy programs, targeted at that crucial middle year sector of schools—that is, looking at those students who will be questioning whether they will stay on at school in the next year or so. If you add all that together with the full service schools, you have a comprehensive plan by this government to address the decline in retention rates from 78 per cent in 1992 to 72 per cent in 1997. That is a deterioration that we have to address, and we are addressing it.
Much was made about the shortage of teachers. This bill deals with funding for schools and school programs such as full service schools and national Asian languages and studies. In the last parliament we provided $42 million for national Asian languages and studies to take us through to the end of 1999. We then committed in the election campaign $90 million to take that further, from the year 2000 and for the following 
 three years. That is a pledge we have made that will come into effect in the year 2000.
We have already put $42 million into this crucial area to take us through to 1999. I agree with Senator Carr when he says that there is a huge take-up of Asian languages and studies in this country. I saw it when I travelled around Australian schools—I was formerly minister for schools. I saw many successful courses. This innovation in our election platform was widely greeted wherever I went because it gives two great benefits to the Australian people: it teaches its young people Asian languages so that in future when we deal with our neighbours we can deal with them in their own language if needs be; it also brings about more harmonisation in our own society and an understanding of our Asian neighbours and those people of Asian extraction living in Australia. There is a win-win aspect to this whole program. In the future, when Australia does business in the South-East Asian region it will have a young generation who will be in control when dealing with our Asian neighbours, who will be able to speak to them in their own language.
But there is more in this bill. There is the country areas program and the issue of providing flexibility for that. Senator Crossin mentioned the question of how we are looking at education in country areas. I share that concern, coming from the state of Western Australia—the greatest state in area in this country—and I have seen the difficulties that you have with remote education. That is why in our election platform we announced funding for the basic boarding allowance for isolated children. We announced an additional $23.6 million over five years to increase that basic boarding allowance so that isolated people could send their children to school.
We also announced, and have in place, programs in relation to indigenous education. There is $80 million worth of practical programs that will achieve outcomes for indigenous students. As well as that, there is $6.2 million for intensive English studies for those indigenous students who do not have English as a first language. We have had the Department of Education, Training and Youth 
 Affairs working with the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts in a strategy designed to maximise the increase in technology in delivering distance education to those remote parts of Australia. This government regards education in regional Australia as crucial. We recognise that there are difficulties, and we are working to address them.
Teacher shortage is an aspect which the opposition and the Democrats have made much of today. As I stated earlier, this bill is designed for specific programs and the appropriation of funding for Australia's schools. Teacher supply was dealt with in the report mentioned by the Democrats, which was written by Ms Preston and which involved the Australian deans. What that report is at odds with in relation to the states is the question of teacher shortages. Let us look at what some state ministers have said. The Victorian minister in a letter published in the Age on 31 October this year said:
Department of Education figures indicate that the supply of teacher graduates will meet demand well into the future.
Similarly, the South Australian education minister was quoted in the Advertiser  on 31 November this year. He said:
The state government did not expect a teacher shortage in 1999 apart from the usual difficulty in filling about 10 positions.
This bill is not about addressing teacher shortage. It is about addressing education in Australia's schools and funding specific programs, which I have mentioned. A major difference between the Australian Council of Deans of Education report and departmental work is the treatment of the pool of qualified teachers who are available to re-enter the teaching force. The Australian Council of Deans of Education report focuses on recent graduates and argues that the pool dissipates as people obtain teaching work or other employment. This does not allow for qualified teachers who have left for family reasons and are now seeking to re-enter the teaching force.
Australian Bureau of Statistics data for 1996 shows that there were some 14,600 unemployed persons with education qualifications and that 75 per cent of them were 
 female. So, obviously, there is a pool of qualified teachers out there who are not seeking employment. Of course the teaching profession is ageing and there are great demands being placed on it. During my term as minister for education I acknowledged that and the work that Australia's teachers were doing in this country. The ministerial council of education ministers commissioned the development of a teacher recruitment strategy. Individual states and territories would be able to adapt this to address local requirements, and I am happy to say that the Commonwealth is committed to 50 per cent of the funding for this research because it is important to look to the future.
What I can say in relation to the work of teachers is that this government recognises the very good work that teachers are doing in Australia today. In fact, it was with a view to that that during the recent election campaign we announced some $75 million over three years to a quality teacher program to update and improve teachers' skills and promote and lift the status of teaching in government and non-government schools. The government is yet to respond to the status of teachers inquiry. It will do so—of course, in between we have had an election which has perhaps distracted us somewhat—but we did put our money where our mouth was during the election campaign by announcing this $75 million which will go to a quality teacher program. I believe that that is a very important step indeed and really does show the importance that this government places on keeping teachers up to speed with their professional development. So there is no question of the government ignoring any teacher shortage or ignoring the status of teachers.
So when you look at aspects of this bill, you need to look at what this government is doing in the total area of education and in professional development of teachers. You need to look at our track record where we have addressed those big issues of literacy and numeracy, where we have addressed the question of vocational education and training in schools to the extent that it has never been recognised before, where we have allowed 
 accredited training to occur within our schools, and where we are allowing this flexibility to give young Australians great opportunities to go on for training and subsequent employment.
	 Question put:
	 That the amendment (Senator Carr's ) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1998-11-25,"—My contribution to the debate on the Space Activities Bill 1998  is to simply place on record the proposal and to make mention of what is happening at the Christmas Island satellite launch facility. I am aware that this bill seeks to regulate what is happening in this industry. I am also aware that there are two other areas in this country which this bill will regulate. My particular interest is in what is happening on Christmas Island because for federal matters it is under the jurisdiction of the Northern Territory electorate.
As a senator for the Northern Territory, I want to say a few words about the proposal for the Asia Pacific Space Centre, better known as the Christmas Island satellite launch facility proposal. Christmas Island is a small island of 135 square kilometres and has about 2,000 residents. With regard to the satellite launch facility there are differences of opinion amongst my constituents on Christmas Island as to whether the proposal should or should not go ahead. The Asia Pacific Space Centre proposal is one of three commercial satellite launch facilities currently being pursued in Australia. There is another in Queensland and another in Woomera in South Australia.
The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has previously determined that the Asia Pacific Space Centre proposal for a satellite launching facility would require the preparation of an environmental impact statement. This draft environmental impact statement should soon be released for community consultation. I know that Christmas Island residents are eagerly awaiting its release.
In a press release that Senator Robert Hill issued back on 29 May this year he outlined that he had determined that a proposal by the Asia Pacific Space Centre Pty Ltd to build a satellite launching facility on Christmas Island would require the preparation of an environmental impact statement, and this announcement by the minister was certainly welcomed. He went on to say that the preparation of an environmental impact statement would ensure that all environmental impacts of the proposal are fully assessed.
It is important that any potential impact on Christmas Island's natural and cultural heritage is taken into account before the approval of this proposal goes ahead. Eighty-five square kilometres of the island are now covered by the Christmas Island National Park, reflecting the unique ecosystems and biodiversity contained on the island. Christmas Island contains a number of unique ecosystems and five nationally listed endangered species.
As I am sure the EIS will demonstrate, there are both pros and cons regarding the satellite launching facility, but it is vital that the residents of Christmas Island have all the information they need to make an informed decision about whether or not they want the launch facility to proceed. Seventy per cent of the residents of Christmas Island are Chinese in origin, 25 per cent are Malay and only 10 per cent are European. With this in mind, I would hope that the Chinese-Malay population, many of whom speak English as a second language, have the opportunity to have their concerns explained in the appropriate language. If the proposal does go ahead, it will introduce a technologically sophisticated operation to the island which would be likely to have a major impact on telecommunications, air services and shipping services. The target date for this project is the year 2000.
The Space Activities Bill will establish a regulatory framework for space activities in Australia. I want to place on record that, whilst we welcome what is outlined in this bill, there is a need for companies such as the Asia Pacific Space Centre Pty Ltd to bear in mind, when they are conducting consultations about building launch facilities in areas such 
 as Christmas Island, where only 10 per cent of the population are European, that the consultations are conducted thoroughly in all languages so that everybody concerned has a complete understanding of what is being proposed and what are the implications. At this stage, having visited Christmas Island, it is my conclusion that some people there misunderstand the proposal and are feeling fairly threatened and frightened. That is mainly due to the fact that a lot of the information has not been provided to them in a language that they can understand and feel comfortable with. So, on behalf of my constituents on Christmas Island, I remind Senator Hill that future consultations should in fact be in a language that everybody on the island can understand.
As well as being important to ensure that Australia attracts investment by commercial interests in the areas of satellite launch facilities and other related activities, it has been said that it will ensure that Australia will meet its obligations under United Nations space treaties. It is essential that there is clear legislation to establish and apportion liability in the event of any damage caused by a satellite launch. As has been spelt out in the Space Activities Bill explanatory memorandum, the risks inherent in space launch operations dictate close monitoring and supervision of launch activities to protect the community from unsafe practices. I know the people of Christmas Island will be watching closely to ensure that, if the satellite launch facility proposal does go ahead, residents will be protected in the case of damage or accidents and that there are adequate environmental safeguards in this event.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-25,"—May I begin, Mr Acting Deputy President Bartlett, by saying how nice it is to see an Australian Democrat sitting in that chair for a change. I wish you well in that new position. I rise to speak to the Space Activities Bill 1998 , an initiative designed to provide a comprehensive framework for space activities in Australia and involving Australian interests. There is presently no regulation for the licensing, safety 
 and liability of Australian launch activities. The justification for this legislation is to secure the investment needed for commercial success of Australian space ventures.
I would like to say something about the importance of governments taking the initiative to set in place the framework for new industries. Australia has a heritage of space science and astronomy participation—and a long history of sidelining space program decisions and space issues. Australia uses global communications satellite systems, remote sensing imagery, space based meteorological forecasting and navigation guidance. Space based activities are important to Australia in both monetary and utility terms. Australia already spends more than $500 million annually on satellite systems, but mostly overseas and with no guarantee that a local industry will derive any benefit from or involvement in these programs.
This legislation is a step in the right direction to get the Australian industry involved. It is absolutely essential that Australia develop a vibrant and growing manufacturing and services sector to provide the high skilled, high value jobs for the future. This requires the government to provide the strategic direction necessary to develop the local industry. Part of this process is the need to develop a strategic plan for industry sectors. This should be an integrated approach to science and technology, recognising, of course, the importance of education, research and development support and initiatives, intellectual property protections, venture and seed capital, the encouragement of innovation and creativity, a government purchasing policy, a comprehensive industry policy and initiatives, including taxation, in the short, medium and long term, as well as a social assessment of technology and the inclusion of innovation in the economic analysis and budget planning undertaken by government.
To achieve these goals, the Democrats have plans to integrate the place of education, research and development and innovation into the economic agenda. The Democrats support, firstly, economic independence for Australia where we as a nation earn more, save more and invest smarter, and in particular support 
 an active industry policy to identify and develop, sector by sector, export and import replacement opportunities and the adoption of the latest innovations and technologies.
Secondly, we support the nurturing of a highly skilled work force that is capable of meeting the demands of the future, which presently requires a massive boost to our education sector. Thirdly, we support reviewing and establishing a new gauge of wellbeing—such as a genuine progress indicator or GPI—that takes into account socially and environmentally detrimental and beneficial effects which are not included in the present measures such as the GDP. Fourthly, we support reform of the taxation system to make it fairer and more effective. Lastly, we support increasing public investment in infrastructure to support our nation's future development, job security and wealth creation, especially in research infrastructure to ensure universities and research institutions have state-of-the-art equipment. These measures will directly affect the ability of Australian science and technology to prosper in the future. As for space, the Democrats support a proactive government legislative scheme that sets out the framework for regulating the industry. This bill creates some of that framework.
I am taken by Douglas Adams's description:
Space is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly hugely mindbogglingly big it is. I mean you may think it is a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space.
And here we have a bill that proposes to regulate space—all space. This is a substantial challenge and must be based on some fairly significant ground rules. This sentiment is set out in a number of international conventions. For example, the agreement governing the activities of states on the moon and other celestial bodies:
. . . is determined to promote on the basis of equality and the further development of co-operation among States in the exploration and use of the moon and other celestial bodies.
The treaty on principles governing the activities of states in the exploration and use of 
 outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, is:
. . . recognising the common interest of all mankind in the progress of the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes.
I acknowledge that that was `humankind'.
—We won't report you to the thought police to make sure you are politically correct all the time.
—Thank you, Senator Schacht, but I am sure you support language that is not gender specific.
Significantly, these conventions identify equality, the common interests of humanity and the peaceful use of space. These are worthy ideals and our legislation must promote and reflect these ideals and goals. In most instances this bill is consistent with these ideals and the Democrats welcome this. However, there are some issues I would like to address broadly.
Firstly, I am concerned about radioactive and other toxic and dangerous substances in space. Last year, as some members of the Senate may recall, the Cassini space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral to hurtle around the earth with 33 kilograms of plutonium. I, together with a lot of other people, was concerned about the potential for an accident. I understand that the risk of accident as the probe swung past earth on the way to Saturn was very low—people suggested infinitesimally low—but the consequences of an accident would have seen an estimated five billion people subjected to radioactive plutonium. The issue here is that the risks may be very low—and scientists are very good at calculating risks, I acknowledge that—but it is the broader community that should decide whether or not that risk is worth taking.
I appreciate that the role of radioactive and toxic materials in earth orbits is likely to be minimal. However, this bill deals with all space, and I am concerned about any radioactive or toxic material in all space. The lifespan of Cassini's 33 kilograms of plutonium is a long time and we should be cautious about spreading this stuff around.
Of more immediate concern to earthbound life is that materials sent into earth's orbit do 
 eventually come back to earth. This is significant as the lifetime of some of these materials spans many generations, so we need to look to the very long term when we are talking about regulation of space. For example, the United States has used radioisotope thermoelectric generators, or RTGs, for earth observations in orbits generally greater than 700 kilometres. RTGs generally use plutonium 238 as a fuel source because of its high heat to mass ratio and relatively long half-life of 87.7 years. The natural orbit decay of these satellites is several hundred years, when they will re-enter the atmosphere and, as a result of friction in the air, burn up. This will, in most instances, turn the satellite into dust that will then be spread around by the wind and weather.
Both the United States and the former Soviet Union launched vehicles into space with RTGs as well as nuclear reactors using enriched uranium 235. We know that the US vehicles, which have re-entered the atmosphere, had RTGs that were encased so as to survive re-entry. All reports suggest that this was a successful design strategy, although I will comment more on that later. In contrast, the former Soviet Union designed their fuel sources to vaporise on re-entry.
The consequences of radioactive material spreading around the globe are frightening. The most important point to make here—and I will leave the details for another time—is that there is no safe dose of radioactivity, because the harmful effects of low dose radioactivity over generations cannot be presently determined and one `hit' is enough to cause cell damage that may lead to cancers. This means it is not acceptable to send radioactive material into space unless we have determined the risk and made a decision that it is a risk worth taking. Just because it is a low risk—and I say this to the smiling minister—does not necessarily mean it is a risk worth taking.
The next issue of concern to me is the increasing amount of what is broadly referred to as space debris. I would like to expand on this to talk about objects in space as being useful objects and as being debris. Whether you have the useful ones or the debris, it is 
 all out there. Australia accounts for some 15 payloads and debris objects.
Senator Minchin interjecting—
—I would very much like to hear the minister expand on his thoughts not only of space regulation but also about Australia's 15 payloads and space debris. The way this number is calculated is quite contentious. It should be seen as a relative number compared to the thousands of objects attributed to the United States, the former Soviet Union and the European Space Agency.
This also means that Australia's contribution to space objects is a contribution to a fairly crowded space. It is a fairly crowded environment. The United States Space Command reports some 26,000 human-made objects in orbit which have been detected, tracked and catalogued. This number includes around 8½ thousand earth satellites. The rest are used rocket bodies, dead payloads and operational debris, which includes optic covers, attachment hardware and other bits and pieces which fall off vehicles.
Interestingly, only about six per cent of the 8½ thousand satellites are functioning. This does not include objects that are less than 10 centimetres in size in low earth orbit and up to one metre in geostationary orbits. This may amount to tens of thousands of objects. This is of significant concern, as these objects are likely to cause accidents and unexpected behaviour of space objects.
I have more to say about the specific purposes of this bill. My office received answers to questions about this bill quite late last night. Perhaps the minister will be happy to outline his responses to some of the concerns that were raised between our offices. I will be happy to address some of my concerns in relation to regulation versus self-regulation during the committee stage of this bill.
For the record, I do congratulate the new minister on his responsibilities, and I hope that he will bring vigour, a bit of passion as well as intellect to the debate not only about space but about science issues generally. I suggest that science is an area that has been sidelined by this parliament not just in recent 
 history but by the previous government. I think that science issues are intimately linked with a range of portfolio areas like industry, training, education, research and information technologies—all these areas of the future which we should be considering as investments for future prosperity, be it economic as well as contributing to a society where we are more enlightened.
I think that science issues are not given the precedence that they often deserve in this place. It has been quite exciting to see a space bill on the Notice Paper for debate. I hope, Minister, that you will ensure that there are many more opportunities for discussion in this place about the crucial areas of science and technology.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-11-25,"—I rise on behalf of the opposition to support this Space Activities Bill 1998  and do so with some pleasure as a former minister responsible for space activities from 1993 to 1996. It is a pleasure to see at long last a commercial development in space related activity taking place in Australia.
I remember when I was the minister, when we were talking to the Kistler Corporation and others who may have been interested in using Australia as a launch site, that it was pointed out to me by the officers in the then Department of Industry, Science and Technology that this bill would be needed to provide a regulatory regime for commercial interest in space. I think I said I could accept that and I think at the time, informally, the department started to prepare what is now this bill, anticipating that we would be successful—after many trials and tribulations—in convincing some commercial organisation to use Australia as a launch site.
As a South Australian, I was particularly interested in getting Woomera reactivated because, in two years time with the closing of Nurrungar, Woomera will be basically wound down to being a care and maintenance operation of what 30 years ago was I think the third or fourth biggest town in South Australia. Woomera will be almost a ghost town of only a few hundred people on a care and maintenance basis for the Australian defence forces. In view of the taxpayers' contribution 
 to build and establish Woomera over 50-odd years, it would be very sad—not only for South Australia but for Australia—to have Woomera wind down and allow it and a lot of facilities to basically disappear.
I did visit Woomera on a number of occasions as minister to look at what was already there in space related activity. I say to Senator Minchin—a fellow South Australian, as well as the minister—that it is instructive to go to Woomera and to go out to the various places where rockets used to be launched, as part of a military program by the British government in particular, in the fifties and the sixties. I am sure he, like me, would be staggered to see the investment that was made and the range of launch facilities that were built in that area, spread over many hundreds of square kilometres of Woomera and not just near the town. In fact, you have to drive 30 kilometres out in different directions to find some of them. In 1994 the command headquarters for launching rockets of a large nature, including the former ELDO rocket, was still in operational form. It had been maintained all those years waiting for the next rocket to be launched. Much of the equipment and the computers were outdated, but some had been upgraded. There was a care and maintenance operation. It was a two-storey building—more than a blockhouse arrangement—and it could be activated at very small extra cost.
It was also salutary to go and see at the edge of Island Lagoon the two sites the ELDO operation built in the late sixties to launch the European rockets before they were shifted for political reasons to French Guiana. We now find that that site in French Guiana is the most successful commercial rocket launching site in the world, regularly launching satellites every few weeks. That was a political decision the French forced on the ELDO operation under the wonders of General de Gaulle and we lost.
But, before it shifted, tens of millions of dollars were spent to build two major rocket launching facilities on the edge of the escarpment at the lagoon. One of them was used for static firings of the ELDO rocket and the other was never used at all. They had built 
 the gantry that shifts the rockets to assemble the rockets; they had built all the ancillary equipment.
When I was space minister, it was most distressing for me to find that, in the late 1980s, one of these sites had been used by the SAS for target practice, to test gunfire power and to conduct explosives tests. They blew the roof off the underground control bunker with explosive devices as an experiment. That concrete structure, which is equivalent to 10-storeys high, is pockmarked with every type of light to middle level armament. There are shell holes all over it. All the concrete observation posts built around the edge of the site from which the observers watched rockets take off have shell marks all over them.
I took the matter up with my colleague the Minister for Defence so as to stop the SAS, or any other Defence operation, continuing to blow up these assets because, in that period, we had invited a delegation from various Russian rocket making companies to visit. They said that the shell of the site which had not been blown up could be used, with very cheap modification, to launch modified proton rockets. I think we got agreement that they would no longer use the ELDO concrete site for target practice and that the SAS would no longer use it to test explosive devices.
All over Woomera there are sites for launching very small rockets up to the size of the ELDO. The major advantage of Woomera is that it is a declared area for defence purposes, and it covers many thousands of square kilometres. It would be nice if it was closer to the Equator because we could launch equatorial rockets. Commercially, it is cheaper the closer you get to the Equator. But, for a north-south polar orbit, Woomera is very well placed to launch rockets with low earth orbiting satellites for communication purposes. I think that is what the Kistler organisation is looking at.
I think I can mention now for the benefit of the minister that the Russians told us it is possible to assemble and fire these rockets from Australia for as little as $10 million a firing, which is extremely cheap. The Russians provided drawings. We brought a Russian delegation to Australia and they were 
 amazed at what we had at Woomera but also, when we took them through the submarine corporation engineering works at Pooraka—not at Osborne—they said the equipment the submarine corporation had at those engineering works was capable of being used for assembling rockets. The equipment and the technology was available then.
In the early 1990s Transfield was interested in putting together a consortium to launch rockets from Australia. As John White, the former head of Transfield, said, making and launching a rocket from Australia is a lot less complicated than building an Anzac frigate in Williamstown. It is not that difficult. We used the old saying that you must be a rocket scientist. But this is not rocket science. By using that phrase we made rocket science sound a lot more complicated and expensive than it now is.
I say to the minister that I ran into trouble when trying to convince Treasury and Finance to make money available to seed fund and initiate space related activities in Australia. I think my colleagues in the Treasury and Defence bureaucracies believed I was trying to build Cape Canaveral at Woomera. All I was after was a few million dollars over five years to kick-start something that would be, in the end, a value added industry.
As Senator Stott Despoja pointed out, in Australia we probably import now about $1 billion worth of services from space satellites. That goes on our current account deficit. If we are serious about getting the current account deficit down, in the long run we will have to look at areas where we think we can reduce those import costs. One of those areas is through space related activities.
If we launch satellites, we can then leverage the service that goes on the satellite because that can be provided to Australia at a cheaper price since we are actually launching it. I have to say that Treasury and Finance did not accept that argument and did everything possible to say that that is not what the free market is about, et cetera.
Let me tell you that space is not about the free market. Everything in space is about a controlled, fixed, rigged market. When I was dealing with the Russians or the Americans, 
 they were always leveraging it to make commercial advantage for their nations. We should not be naive enough to believe we will get any advantage without leveraging our geographical and geopolitical position in the world. Australia is very well placed to be a major launch site, but it will need a commitment.
I have to say that this bill is an excellent start. I suggest, Minister, that there will be some issues debated in committee and some amendments may be moved. I have no doubt that, within two or three years, you will be back here to amend this bill to expand the regulatory regime and, I would hope, to put in place a more proactive industry policy to provide value adding space related activities from Australia—and, I have to say, from South Australia in particular. I think the Kistler beginning is an excellent one.
Minister, I know that you inherited this portfolio and that decisions were taken in the last three years about the funding of space activities. I have to say that, although I was not successful in growing the space budget, I was able to hang on and maintain in it at least a few million dollars. In the first term of your government the decision to abolish the Australian Space Office and the funding that went with it for some proactive research was a mistake. In industry policy terms, it was about leveraging value added for Australia. I am pleased to see that at least you have put some money back to administer the regulatory regime. But in the estimates committee to come in February, I will take that opportunity to have more of a dialogue about developing space related activities.
You will never get commercial development to the level of value adding the best jobs unless the federal government of Australia is seen worldwide as being genuinely interested and willing to put some money up-front as seed money for R&D and some infrastructure development. This legislation will be a good message to start off with. I am not suggesting that you need $50 million, $100 million or $500 million. You may need a few tens of millions over five years to target where you need the development of space related activities. If we are serious about creating high 
 quality jobs, reducing our current account deficit and space related activities, this is the place where we can do it without a major cost to the Australian taxpayer.
Regarding the development of low earth orbiting satellite networks for telecommunications, we have seen the advertisements on television that the Iridium network is now up and running. This is the start of what we ought to be able to say to Iridium and to Motorola. Every year they are going to have to launch replacement low earth orbiting satellites. We should be able to say, whether to Kistler or someone else, `We can launch these from Australia on a regular basis at a cheap price'. Bill Gates, under his program, believes he can deliver the information superhighway by a network of 900 low earth orbiting satellites. Nine hundred would mean that, every year, 40 or 50 would have to be replaced. Some will fall to earth, some will hit each other and some will not work. So there has to be a replacement.
What we have to aim for, in my view, is getting the commercial operators to see that we can effectively launch these satellites. Once we get into that, we can then start leveraging back and asking, `What are we going to do to build the satellite?' We already have people in this country who have won contracts to provide parts to American satellites that are now operating in space, either militarily or for commercial reasons. In this very town of Canberra there are people who have successfully made parts—major and significant parts—for American satellites for various commercial companies. That ought to be built upon. That is why we need an industry policy, an industry plan—not a plan to give a free kick or for someone to grab $50 million, put it into their pocket, disappear and then, after five years, say, `Thank you very much. Give us another $50 million'. We need a dedicated plan to leverage the opportunities we already have—the skill we already have.
I read only last week in the Business Review Weekly—and I draw this to the minister's attention—a story about the next generation of jetliners that will actually go through the edge of space, supersonic, to London in two hours. What are they talking 
 about? One of the jet engines compresses gas, or oxygen, at high speed and at a high speed it combusts and provides power. The leading proponent of that technology over the last 10 years is from Queensland University. All they needed for that program was funding from time to time of a few hundred thousand dollars. They have the worldwide leadership in it. They need to test the equipment. They need to put up a test probe on a satellite with a model to show that it actually works.
If we get into the league, we have the control of the technology; we have the knowledge and the skill. We will not have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars. Others will come and say, `We want you to be the partner because you have the skill. You have the intellectual property'. That is how I see an effective, subtle, discreet program operating, because we have the intellectual knowledge already in this country if we can put it together with a focused program.
Although I have not spoken much on this bill, because I agree with it—and the opposition agrees with it—we see this as the very first small step of what some of us tried to do in the early 1990s as the opportunities arose. There are companies in Australia, given the right leadership, that will invest. There are overseas companies that will invest. The jobs that will come, and the quality of those jobs, will mean that we have a real advantage in this country, in our national interest as well as in our commercial interest.
Minister, I urge you to go and visit Woomera and have a look at the site. You will, like me, be a little dismayed at what we have allowed to be destroyed. I ran across an Indian space engineer who skited that, when we wound down ELDO and so on, we sold all our best space equipment to India at give-away prices. They used it to build their own space equipment. They have their own rocket now, built on cheap equipment they bought from Australia in the 1960s and 1970s when we gave away Woomera and the equipment at peppercorn prices.
The saga of space in Australia now is a very sorry saga of many lost opportunities. I hope this bill, in a sense of bipartisanship, is the beginning of an opportunity that we are 
 not going to lose—that we see it as the beginning of an opportunity and build upon it. Therefore, I commend the bill to the Senate. I look forward to taking part in the committee stage, if there are further amendments. Minister, I ask you whether at the committee stage you can give any further indication of allocation of extra resources to the space program. I will take that up with you in the estimates committee as well. I look forward, as I say, to further debate in this chamber about establishing a decent Australian space program.
Debate (on motion by Senator Minchin) adjourned.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-11-25,"—I rise today to talk about the importance of community sport and recreation and, in particular, what will happen when the 2000 Olympics are over.
The course this government is charting is based on providing for elite sport above all else. They have shifted the balance such that grassroots sports and recreational activities are being ignored in favour of medal winning sports. We have seen cuts right across the sporting budget in the last two coalition budgets and inevitably, as that pool of funding diminishes, community and participatory sports programs receive less and less resources. Yes, the Olympics are important—but so too is the local netball court, public pool, athletics track and recreational fishing day.
Under this government, Australia's reputation as an egalitarian society where everybody gets `a fair go' no longer applies. It no longer applies because this government cannot see beyond a bandaid solution of short-term funding. There is no depth to their policy and no strategy that has Australia's future in mind. Because sports funding is increasingly being directed away from grassroots and 
 community based participation towards elite programs, in an ever-diminishing pool of funding, there is now an even greater need for government involvement in the promotion of participation.
Regrettably, the government has to date ignored some of the critical recommendations contained in the report prepared during its period of government entitled Rethinking the funding of community sporting and recreational facilities: a sporting chance. It has failed to act on some of the report's critical recommendations. Certainly, sport has changed. It is now big business and the corporate dollar that largely shapes competitive sport. It is the sponsorship dollar that determines whether or not a sport survives. If you want an example: here in the ACT our women's cricket team had to clean out the amenities at Manuka Oval during the men's one day game, so that they could raise enough money for an interstate visit. Without sponsorship or funding, the non-elite side of sport suffers.
Just look at how sports competitions are declining in many regional areas because transport and registration costs are becoming prohibitive. Rural and regional communities are really doing it tough under the Howard government. We have seen this across a whole range of policy areas. And the one thing that many small towns have to alleviate the many stresses of life—sport—has become a discretionary cost that fewer and fewer families can afford.
What happened to sport and recreation as simply a means of enjoyment and exercise? What is the government doing to ensure that participation is increased and that facilities are available to anyone who wants to improve their health?
If the government wants the low-down on the role sport plays in Australian life, they should take a careful look at the Confederation of Australian Sports study, the Economic Impact Study of Sport. The Confederation's report highlights the tremendous contribution the sports sector makes to Australian society. In the 1995-96 financial year, the sports sector was worth almost $8 billion and sports related exports contributed over $430 million. 
 Australian households spend around $6 billion each year on sport and recreation, meaning that sport brings in about the same economic benefits as the car, clothing and electricity industry sectors.
You would think that the government would recognise the economic benefits by supporting the sports industry. You would think that an industry that employs close to 100,000 people, as well as engaging almost 850,000 volunteers, would be deserving of a long-term commitment from the coalition. But their record to date shows that this is not the case.
By the year 2000 to 2001, the Howard government will reduce its financial commitment to sport by over $60 million. The Howard government is happy to take almost a billion dollars in taxation generated from the sports sector, but they will not provide any real commitment beyond the Olympic Games. So when the games are over and the big sponsorship dollars have moved on to Athens, Australia is going to be left without adequate funding for elite and community sport programs and participation rates will drop even further.
The government's approach to sport is a short-term strategy—if you could call it a strategy at all. It is bereft of any vision about the important role sport and physical activity will play in our future. And, outside of some cheerleading about the Olympics, I have heard nothing about addressing the fundamentals of physical fitness and recreational sport and the role that that has in the quality of the lives of Australians.
The report of the Confederation of Australian Sport, which presents a snapshot of the nation's health, acknowledges the importance of participation. Unfortunately, we are more of a nation of sports watchers than sports participants. In 1995-96, just over 30 per cent of Australians participated in some form of physical activity. That means that over 4½ million Australians were involved in either a playing or non-playing capacity—but it also means that nearly 70 per cent of adults were not involved. One of the most important statistics to emerge is that a five per cent increase in the participation rate in sport would deliver a net economic benefit of over 
 $800 million to the Australian economy. In other words, if the government bothered to invest in sport and recreation—rather than slashing away at the budget allocations and funding—then they might be surprised to find that the rewards far outweigh the investment.
The benefits of increased participation are tangible right across the board. A healthier society means a healthier work force. And we know that there is a direct correlation between increased health and fitness and increased productivity and occupational health and safety standards. Conversely, people who are not fit—and less healthy—take more sick days. They are less productive and have greater occupational health problems.
So increased community participation in sport and recreation creates greater income for governments and delivers tangible benefits in terms of workplace productivity and safety. Some of these equations represent a correlation of figures that is not currently taken into account in the government's assessments of where they should put resources. It is the blend of looking at these cross-portfolio areas and their interrelationships that becomes so critical in policy development in this area.
What the statistics do not tell us, however, is how many people are unable to participate. Statistics do not tell us about people excluded from participation because of structural and economic barriers that this government has done nothing about. They have not done anything about increasing participation, because this is part of the unglamorous side of sport. You will not find the Prime Minister or the minister for sport addressing barriers faced by sections of the community who want nothing more than the chance to participate in some form of recreational activity.
You will not see them out there talking up Paralympic sport with the same gusto as non-Paralympic sport. The Australian Paralympic Committee received just $1 million from the Olympic program—or just four per cent of sports funding in Australia. This pitiful amount of money is hardly recognition for the 42 gold medals, 37 silver medals and 27 bronze medals Australia won at the Atlanta Paralympic Games. Yet, in many ways, it is more important to fund programs for people 
 with disabilities, as their ability to participate is often dependent on government provided infrastructure. And the opportunity to participate in those programs presents the first opportunity for them to just participate in physical activity from a grassroots perspective.
There are too many barriers to participation—barriers such as lack of public transport to venues; lack of facilities for athletes with disabilities; inadequate lighting of grounds and car parks, which is a real concern particularly for women and children; lack of change rooms and toilets, especially wheelchair access; lack of adequate child care; and lack of quality public facilities.
So how do we redress the barriers that are preventing more Australians from pursuing a healthier lifestyle? There obviously is not some magic formula that will automatically make us a fit and healthy nation, but slashing funding and cutting critical government programs are certainly not the answer. What can be done is to look at those sections of Australia where participation is low and then to examine what resources and facilities are available. And what you will find is that, while some regions and urban centres are well catered for, others compete for scarce resources.
It is amazing what a decent football field or basketball court or soccer pitch with a clubhouse and change rooms can do for the physical, mental and economic health of a community. The government might be surprised to learn that the health and wellbeing of all Australians is what counts, not just that of certain sections favoured by this administration.
One of the reasons that we must enhance and broaden the participation rate is that sport acts as a coalescing force. It binds people together; it gives them a sense of purpose, a sense of place and a sense of community. For many residents of rural Australia, sport is one of the few things that keeps their communities alive. The banks might be gone, the Internet might be unaffordable, pay TV might never arrive—but sport is always going to be there.
Governments understand this—or at least they should. They understand it when they 
 underwrite international sporting events, but this government have shown that they do not understand that by investing in people, by investing in grassroots sport and recreation, they will get a far greater return than just the financial revenue.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Community Sport and Recreation</title>,Matters of Public Interest,6,1

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-25,"—I rise to speak on this important Space Activities Bill 1998. We are dealing with issues of legislation of space activities, and it seems that it may well have been brought on by recent commercial activities, including those mentioned by Senator Crossin in relation to Christmas Island. They are not issues about what happens in space activities; they are about the launches. Unfortunately, we have seen in recent years that the issues and concerns in relation to space activities are not just about launches—although launches are important because, as we found from the Christmas Island example, we are dealing with superheated steam in a fragile national park environment. We are also talking about dangerous materials that could be jettisoned through the process, and we are talking about processes that need to be carefully monitored.
But in particular we are also talking about the range of activities that could occur in the future—about what actually happens in space, what is taken into that environment and what the responsibilities are. We only have to look as far as the 1997 Cassini probe to see the assumption that whoever launches the particular satellite can take responsibility for the rest of the world. We had extreme concern in 1997 about the launch of the Cassini probe and its 33-odd kilograms of plutonium. The launch could have gone wrong—and of course launches have gone wrong; there have been problems in the blast-off stage in the past—and could have put at risk some five billion of the world's population of seven billion. That risk was not shared with the rest of the world; they were not taken into consideration. Those people who conducted the launch took the risk on behalf of everyone 
 else. A great many people in the world—those people who knew about it—were outraged that those who conducted the launch took that risk on behalf of everyone else.
Space is considered to be the final frontier. We hear of space exploration, space tourism, women and men travelling to distant galaxies and great adventures in space. However far into the future these visions might be, I think we can be quite confident that it will not be the Space Activities Bill 1998 that provides the framework or legislative basis for them. To be quite fair, this is not the intention of the bill. The intent of this bill is much more mundane: it is to provide a framework for the commercial exploitation of whatever advantages Australia may have in the lucrative business of launching what the bill somewhat quaintly calls space objects and providing them with a place to land. Ironically, the bill does not concern itself with what those space objects do when they are up there. It is about licensing the places from which they are launched and issuing permits for the objects, including both the launch vehicles and their contents.
In speaking about the bill today, I will address issues not covered by the bill and some of the many issues that are raised by the bill itself. We believe there is a need for community debate on the future in space. Since the launch in 1957 of the world's first satellite, Sputnik—a small ball sending out regular beeps—through the massive US space program of the 1960s, culminating in the moon mission of 1969, and the recent series of space shuttle missions that have attracted so much attention—and perhaps the first case of space tourism—the range of technological possibilities has expanded at an enormous rate, so much so that we have spacecraft successfully travelling to Mars, Jupiter and beyond. Enormous amounts of resources have been expended on these efforts with very little debate on the real issues of what it means for the long-term future.
So what is the purpose of space exploration? Is it an extension of the Christopher Columbus mentality—discovery to open up the way to exploitation of previously untapped resources, perhaps? Can we actually be 
 trusted in space when we do such a poor job of sustainably using and equitably distributing resources here on earth? Are there inalienable rights for aliens? Or can we create a culture in space which does not repeat the errors of the past—greed and exploitation, territorial acquisition and colonisation?
This bill does not provide the opportunity for that debate, but it is one we should have in Australia—and we should have it soon. Why so soon? Debate on the hypothetical issues of space will help us to clearly focus on some of the recent and contemporary issues which get lost in the messy business of political partisanship, pragmatism, trade-offs and deals.
It might help us to think afresh about some of the mistakes we have made in our recent past—such things as the perpetuation of colonialism; dispossession and denial of rights exemplified in the Native Title Act; destruction of our forests by the vandals in the forest industry, or our failure to take a stronger stance on the elimination of nuclear weapons.
In the absence of such a hypothetical debate I will turn to the particular bill we have to consider. The first thing to be said is that it is more about what happens here on the ground in Australia than about what happens in space. It licences sites for the commercial launch of satellites and provides for permits for the launch vehicles to get them into space. The sites for these launches are to be privately owned and operated. That does not mean to say people will be able to control where the bits of space vehicles will land.
This licensing of privately owned and operated sites in itself raises cause for concern. We are familiar with inherent conflict between commercial interests and safety and environmental protection. Maybe in Western Australia we will end up with a state agreement act should we have one actually in Western Australia.
Let us look at some examples. The bill as originally introduced had no process for environmental protection. We had serious concerns about that. The Labor amendment that the minister be satisfied that all necessary environmental approvals have been obtained and that an adequate environmental plan has 
 been made for the construction and operation of the launch facility goes some way to resolving that, but we would prefer to see the particular environmental laws specified.
Launch sites are, by their nature, most likely to be in relatively isolated areas, but this does not reduce the need for strict environmental control. There are other issues of indigenous rights, as we saw with the proposal for a launch site at Cape York.
We know that Christmas Island is considered by many to be a remote site, but it is also the site for very important bird and terrestrial life. It has flora and fauna that do not exist anywhere else on the planet. Therefore, we cannot afford to be blase about some of those environmental consequences if there is to be jettisoned material that can cause damage to those environments, or even noise or superheated steam that will impact on the breeding activities of local animals or birds.
We need to look at other issues, including the need for strict environmental control and indigenous rights, as we saw with the proposal for a launch site at Cape York, which is now supposedly in limbo. We would prefer no, never. Cape York raised the issue of a need for land rights legislation to empower Aboriginal people to deal effectively with major proposals. The Native Title Act does not do that, but it is important for Aboriginal people in the vicinity of these projects to have their interests protected. Perhaps the opposition might extend their amendment to refer to the relevant Aboriginal legislation as well as to environmental legislation.
The same company that was involved in the Cape York proposal, International Resource Corporation, has shifted its attention to Christmas Island. The intention is to launch between 12 and 46 Globalstar mobile satellites there, using Soyuz rockets, with some potential problems with the technology. It is, as I mentioned, an extremely important local environment. I have to declare my interest here. I have a great deal of admiration for Christmas Island. I have a small flat on Christmas Island because I like it so much, though I hardly ever get there.
Basically it is a very important environment. The process of developing an environ 
 mental assessment is now under way and, hopefully, it will provide answers as to just what is proposed, what its effect will be on people and the environment, and what will be done in the design, construction and management of the project to reduce the effect on the people and environment of Christmas Island.
I understand that there is already agreement between the Commonwealth and a private company for the launch site at Woomera—the Kistler project. I wonder what environmental and Aboriginal issues have been addressed, and remain to be addressed, in relation to that project.
The bill, we should note, excludes deals done before 11 November this year. Kistler has done a deal at Woomera, and the International Resource Corporation project at Christmas Island was announced by the government in March 1998. How will they be regulated? We do not know from this bill. How will we know when the contracts are, in fact, commercial-in-confidence?
Then there is the proposed project on an island off the coast of Gladstone in Queensland, about which it seems to be very hard to get any information at all. Perhaps the minister might like to tell us more about what is proposed there, and particularly if military payloads are involved.
Let us look at the granting of launch permits. This bill is about the commercial launch of commercial payloads into space. It is good that nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction are excluded from those things allowed to be launched, but why stop at nuclear weapons? Why are we allowing weapons of any kind in space? We have no enemies in space. We do not want space used to threaten imaginary or real enemies here on earth either.
This is not entirely a hypothetical issue. Billions of dollars were expended on the US Star Wars program before it was finally conceded it was a waste of money. Nevertheless, there are no shortages of military minds still harbouring illusions about deploying such weapons. Australia should ensure that Australia's laws do not allow such things to be launched from here. Please recall that Australia was a very important element of the 
 whole Star Wars strategy that many of us found totally abhorrent.
The US General Accounting Office reported last year that the US military would spend $US7.8 billion on upgrading its defence systems communications satellites and leasing time from commercial suppliers. Is this beginning to ring bells? No wonder there is such demand for launch facilities with that sort of budget driving the industry. It could be that the US military or other military will, in the future, buy time from launching facilities in Australia.
The difficulty for us is to know how such satellites, launched from Australia, are being used and will be used in future. The legislation gives the power to permit a launch and the minister can take into account the payload in deciding whether or not to grant the licence. But it does not allow the minister any say in the use of the satellites once they are launched. This is a very dangerous omission as far as we are concerned. The legislation goes only to the launch period and does not cover what happens with the satellites while they are in orbit.
This is a major problem. Communication satellites are able to be used for any communication and the nature of that can change to military use at any time. But that does not mean it cannot be controlled by legislation. Time is leased on satellites with clients whose purpose is known. There should be provision for the exclusion of whole ranges of activities which have the potential to contribute to the growth of militarism or to harm regional peace and security.
Fissionable materials can be sent into space under this legislation. Even with the ALP amendment, this can still happen. A requirement for permission from the minister does not impress me at all. One approach may be a ban on all radioactive material with exemptions spelt out in regulations for small quantities of specific types of isotopes. The idea that material capable of causing enormous harm in the event of an accident—the industry has had plenty of major accidents—could be included in the fuel or the payload of launch vehicles launched from Australia or allowed to return to earth on Australian soil 
 is one that would be opposed by the vast majority of Australians, and rightly so, as was the Cassini probe, by just about everyone who ever heard about it.
People were outraged. They could not believe that such a thing was proposed, yet it happened. It really did happen. People should thank whoever they pray to that that launch did not go wrong. That it could come about as a result, for example, of a request from the United States to allow a return to earth of one of its interplanetary missions begs the question of why they do not want it to come down in their own back yard.
We also have a number of serious concerns about other aspects of the bill, from the nature of the standard launch conditions to the role and independence of the launch safety officers. We want to see further extension of the administrative review provisions for a review of ministerial decisions, especially any decision to instruct a launch safety officer. We believe that a launch safety officer should be available in every launch safety facility, but it seems they are to be shared amongst the various potential sites in Australia.
These matters are ones about which we will be proposing some amendments, but the issue of most concern about this bill is the space activities it does not cover. It does not cover the uses of space objects after the 30-day launch period. It does not even put in place adequate coverage for liability in the event of an accident or the inadvertent return to earth of Australian space objects after the launch period.
Yes, we need legislation to ensure the safety and protection of the environment associated with space activity, but it needs to go further. It needs to set an example in the spirit of our internal commitment to the peaceful uses of space by going much further than this bill does in outlawing weapons in space and the use of space for military and military intelligence purposes—for Australia not to be involved, inadvertently or otherwise, in putting very dangerous material into the atmosphere, or likely to be causing harm if an accident occurs to very many people not covered under this agreement.
So there does need to be a lot more work done on this bill. Unfortunately, the indications have not been strong so far that the government is listening to these concerns.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-11-25,"—I am part-way through my speech on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions relating to Character and Conduct) Bill 1998. To recapitulate, this is a bill which, according to the second reading speech, does certain things. I will quote from the second reading speech as it sets it in context.
In a world of rapidly increasing people movements, our immigration arrangements must be designed to streamline the entry and stay of all genuine visitors, students, business people and permanent residents. However, a small proportion of non-citizens seeking to enter Australia do have substantial criminal backgrounds or criminal associations. Others commit crimes while they are in Australia.
What this bill does is to so change the law that those people can be dealt with more expeditiously than is presently the case. The 
 proposition that I put seems clear. I said the other night, and I say again now, that there are dangers in this legislation in so far as it reflects an attitude towards immigration and migration legislation that needs to be watched.
Very few people are going to be affected by this legislation. Some of them, in the past, who would have been caught by this legislation—if it had then been operative—would have been banned not so much because of criminal associations or of criminal acts but, in reality, because of what they represented or because of the particular philosophy they had adopted. At all times, no matter what the legislation, we should be very hesitant about taking an approach in Australia that would come down upon us and affect, either directly or indirectly, those civil rights and civil liberties that we enjoy.
I will quote from a decision of a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States of some time ago who was dealing with a case that concerned the Communist Party, a party not popular in the United States then or now. He had this to say in his judgment, which I think is worth quoting here today:
I do not believe that it can be too often repeated that the freedoms of speech, press, petition and assembly guaranteed by the First Amendment must be accorded to the ideas we hate or sooner or later they will be denied to the ideas we cherish.
In so far as this bill will be directed against people who fit within its terms, but who are not being banned because of their criminal conduct but rather because of their thoughts and what they represent, then there is danger. The tests that will be applied include tests that depend for their validity on decisions made by courts overseas which are not as full of integrity and fairness as our courts in Australia. So, although this proposed act may seem a reasonable piece of legislation, there are dangers in it.
The other issue that I raised the other night, and that I raise again now, is that of due process. If anybody is to be thrown out of the country, if anybody is to have their reputation besmirched, if anybody is to have action taken against them, that should be done only after the facts have been ascertained to a reasonable degree of proof. This bill endang 
 ers that proposition because it removes, in certain instances, the ability of courts to review decisions.
There is concern that this bill represents an unfortunate trend in migration law. I note, for example, a report in the Age last weekend of a speech to the Federation of Ethnic Communities' Council by the Prime Minister in which he said we have to toughen up on migration law. He said, as the paper reports, that:
. . . there was a need to balance integrity and compassion in the migration program.
Everybody would agree with that, but what do you mean by integrity? Does that mean that you are going to apply the law in a way that comes down too harshly?
Remember that our Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act contains provisions, as a schedule, which say that everybody, no matter who they are, should be treated with humanity and should be treated equally. If, in this legislation, we are going to choose certain people that we are going to move against in an unfair way, then we have something to worry about. (Extension of time granted) I think there is a need for a change in the culture of the administration and perhaps the legislative underpinning of our migration law.
As I said the other night, the minister who heads this legislation is a person who is noted for his fairness and for his dedication to civil liberties. He is a member of Amnesty International and has been for years, so what I am saying now is not an attack on the minister. It is an attack on the system and the culture that seems to have entered the migration area at this stage. We had the spectacle, and I use the word advisedly, of a person from Somalia being returned to that country. That person was not a refugee within the strict terms of the provisions of the Geneva Convention but, nevertheless, was a person who deserved compassion from this country, which is a compassionate country, and from the minister, who is a compassionate minister. I will finish with those few remarks, and I am indebted to the chamber.
The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT  (Senator Crowley )—I think the chamber is also indebted to you, Senator Cooney.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STRENGTHENING OF PROVISIONS RELATING TO CHARACTER AND CONDUCT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-11-25,"—I am indebted to Senator Cooney for enlightening us on this occasion even more than usual. We are addressing the second reading stage of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions relating to Character and Conduct) Bill. As Senator Cooney said in his contribution then and also, I think, in the first stage of his contribution a day or two ago, whilst a lot of this bill obviously seeks to make some concrete changes, many of the concerns the Democrats have about it actually relate to the culture that it promotes and the message that it sends out to the general community.
The issue of immigration and the perception and rhetoric around the motivation of migrants or potential migrants is one that has been in the news and in public debate a lot in the last couple of years, often in a negative way and a very misleading way. It is for that reason that I think we need to be very careful about the messages that we send out to the community about the intentions and the motivation of most potential migrants—there has been a lot of scapegoating and a lot of repeating of myths about migrants or potential migrants attempting to rort the system. Whether it is refugees or people wanting to enter the country for various reasons, the Democrats are concerned about the potential for a continuation of the momentum, if you like, towards more of a negative culture, more of a non-accepting and non-inclusive culture in relation to how we perceive potential migrants and people entering the country.
This bill makes a number of changes which have the effect of giving the minister more power, discretion and influence over granting or refusing visas on the grounds of character. It reverses the onus of proof in relation to character. It limits the time for the process of review by the AAT, albeit by a less severe limitation than was originally intended when this bill was first tabled in the previous parliament. It provides protection from disclosure of confidential security and criminal intelligence information that is provided by 
 various agencies. So basically it provides a lot more power and discretion to the minister.
The approach that I have taken since taking responsibility for the Democrats in the area of immigration is to try to work constructively with the government and with the minister, who I believe—as Senator Cooney said a number of times—is someone who tries to approach what everyone agrees is a very difficult area from as humane a perspective as possible. We recognise that there are difficulties in terms of the ability of the minister and the department to adequately address some of the issues that they are confronted with in relation to people applying for or holding various visas. We are happy to try and work constructively with the government in all sorts of areas to address the real problems, but of course the issue in this as with many issues—but perhaps this more than most—is one of ensuring that we do not unfairly restrict the rights of genuine or what one might call innocent people in the process of trying to catch the non-genuine or non-innocent, if you like. That is always a concern, and I think it is an issue here.
The Democrats accept that Australia has a right to monitor and restrict the entry of persons who are of what might be called bad character, and we do support the implementation of workable provisions to protect Australians from so-called undesirable or obviously dangerous entrants. Obviously, the government does have a responsibility to protect residents of Australia—anybody in Australia, residents or tourists or whatever—from people who are potentially dangerous. But we do believe that such provisions must be sufficiently flexible to be applicable in a wide range of circumstances, not pigeonhole people too severely and must be firmly founded on principles which include many of those that Senator Cooney elaborated on: compassion, empathy and natural justice.
We do have concerns about the direction of attitudes and the culture, as Senator Cooney mentioned, in relation to immigration in recent years. Probably the one that is most relevant in this bill is the issue of the changes to the character test and the reversal of the onus of proof. A number of witnesses told the 
 recent Senate committee that looked into this legislation in the previous parliament about the strong objections they had to the character test itself. Certainly, the inclusion of certain levels of criminal sentences as an automatic indication of someone's character does seem to me and to the Democrats to be a potential problem. Whilst the current minister may be a person of sufficient wisdom and fairness to be able to work his way through some of the minefields in this area, one can obviously never guarantee the integrity of future ministers in this area. That is always the danger when increasing the power and discretion of ministers in general.
In his second reading speech the minister said that decision making in relation to character judgments will be improved by deeming that certain levels of criminal sentences will lead to an automatic finding that the non-citizen concerned is not of good character. Then of course it becomes incumbent on that person to prove otherwise. In other words, the onus of proof is reversed automatically, based on certain criteria. It assumes a uniform system and standard of justice around the world, which clearly is not the reality.
The character test does not adequately take into account, in our view, that justice and criminality are defined very differently in various countries throughout the world. We have had pointed out to us during committee hearings and on other occasions that certain world leaders would, under the test to be imposed in this legislation, automatically be deemed to be of bad character and then would have to prove otherwise. Nelson Mandela is an obvious example, as is the President of South Korea, whose name escapes me, not being as learned in these matters as I should be.
—Kim Dae Jung.
—Thank you for your assistance, Senator. I am sure other world leaders and people who are now seen to be people of influence and significance would automatically be deemed to be of bad character. Obviously, on a case by case basis, the government would say that we would not have a problem with Nelson Mandela, but this points out the problems of having an across- 
the-board, automatic mechanism of determination. Perhaps even more importantly, people who are now world leaders will usually be fine. They obviously have that extra public profile to assist their cases, but for more anonymous people around the globe, many of whom have been caught in justice systems which are not as fair as ours, that is something which is not open to them. Perhaps even more relevant is the potential lack of a clear distinction in many areas between criminal behaviour and psychiatric illnesses, where people may have had psychiatric disabilities in various countries that are not as capable as ours of determining these differences and may have established criminal records as a result. In those circumstances, they will find it a lot harder to meet the reversal of onus of proof that is put upon them.
A number of submissions to the Senate committee which looked into this matter voiced a lot of opposition to the degree of personal power which will be given to the minister as a result of this bill. That is always a risk, as I mentioned earlier. The Law Council of Australia noted that the minister will have virtually absolute powers to exclude or remove non-citizens who are deemed not to be of good character. Again, this goes to trying to reach that middle ground between providing adequate powers to address a situation but not providing such absolute powers that it leads to the potential of overkill.
The minister will have the ability to set aside decisions of the AAT and to refuse or cancel a visa where the minister suspects that the person does not pass the character test and the refusal or cancellation is in the national interest. The flexibility of the definition of `national interest' again is another one that is potentially open to misuse and is one that is able to be used to provide the minister with extremely wide powers, which is always a potential concern.
I should mention again the Democrats support for the proposal to increase from 42 days, which was in the original bill, to 84 days the limit on reviewing character cases. This seems to us to be much more reasonable. Nonetheless, we share the concerns held by 
 many people who deal with people who are applying for visas of all sorts regarding the subjective nature of the term `national interest' on which the minister will be able to refuse or cancel a visa on character grounds.
The Ethnic Communities Council of Western Australia pointed out that, rather than having access to an independent review process, these people will now be subjected to the whim of the government of the day determining what is in the national interest. Whilst this government may be able to exercise that discretion with expert ability, perhaps a future government may not be able to do it so well. The term `national interest' potentially is so broad as to be able to justify almost any issue of a certificate of exclusion if the government deems it necessary. Obviously the politics of these things could come into the situation as much as the real facts.
I would now like to refer to the culture and the message that we send out to the community. I have been a bit disappointed by the statements—at least those of the Prime Minister, if not of the other ministers of the government—since the election which seem, to a large extent, to be continuing to send a message out to the community to reinforce a perception that there is a problem of large scale abuse of the system by people entering Australia and not playing by the rules or seeking to exploit the system. Whilst the Democrats certainly do not suggest that there are not people who are doing the wrong thing, I think it is always a danger, whether it is in this area, in social security or in anything else, to overstate a problem and affect community attitudes towards a whole class of people, the vast majority of whom are not doing anything wrong and are simply trying to follow appropriate process.
Those are some of the concerns that the Democrats have with the thrust of this legislation, whilst recognising that there are real issues that the government is trying to address. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Senator Patterson on being promoted to the position of parliamentary secretary for this area. I am sure we will be engaging in more constructive debate on 
 immigration issues over the coming months and years.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STRENGTHENING OF PROVISIONS RELATING TO CHARACTER AND CONDUCT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-11-25,"—I rise on behalf of the opposition to indicate that we support the passage of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions Relating to Character and Conduct) Bill 1997. In their remarks, the previous speakers—Senator Bartlett and my good friend Senator Cooney—raised the vexed issues of the balance between due process, human rights, the right of the individual vis-a-vis the state, the onus of proof and so on, which are all very relevant. Those issues have been debated at some length in the Labor Party and we, on balance, believe that what the government has proposed in this bill should be supported.
In the broader Australian community, irrespective of one's view, the due process and the natural inclination have always been to say that someone is innocent until proven guilty. In the situation where we face the onus of proof being reversed from the standard that most of us have always supported, that is, on balance, a reasonable thing to do in view of the clear evidence that there are people around the world in organised criminal activities who would find it useful to get permanent residency or a period of stay in Australia to carry out some form of criminal activity against the citizens of Australia.
We believe that it is very important to decide on the balance of probability of what is in the national interest as to whether the minister should have the power to ultimately overrule an appeal to the AAT. The opposition believes that in the national interest, where the minister overrules the AAT and that decision is provided to the parliament, it is on the minister's head—to use that crude term—that the decision be made public in the terms that it has been refused. The community can then debate whether the minister has used the character test appropriately.
At a personal level, I have always argued that ministerial responsibility to the parliament is the ultimate sanction in a properly functioning democracy. I have always been more interested in a minister standing up and saying, `I did it—or I did not do it—and I 
 take responsibility, and I will be judged accordingly by the community as well as by the parliament,' rather than having some tribunal elsewhere make a judgment.
I have noticed, by the way, that when the public disagrees with a finding of a quasi-independent tribunal, they still blame the minister anyway. It is a bit like the old saying in politics: a minister will always get the three jeers when something goes wrong and will be blamed, but he seldom gets the three cheers when something goes right.
In the end, it has to be a ministerial power as long as it is transparent that it is being used. If it were shown that a decision could be taken to overrule the AAT without it being made public in some form and for it to be acknowledged, we would not support that position. I do not think any person in a democracy should have the right to make a judicial decision in any form without it being publicly available for debate.
 This is an important issue. The opposition believes that, on balance, that protection is reasonable. Any minister from any government will stand to be judged accordingly. These issues of good character are always going to be matters of fine judgment. For example, I know that my colleague Senator McKiernan has raised the issue of the application for a visa by Gerry Adams, a member of Sinn Fein, who may or may not have some formal connection with the IRA. He was refused an application for a visa to visit Australia.
Before the peace settlement in Northern Ireland, one might have argued that it was a very reasonable position that previous governments and this government had taken. But now there is a peace settlement and Gerry Adams meets the ministers of the British government, and he is now a minister in the government of Northern Ireland in the reconstituted Stormont parliament. I therefore think he may have a stronger case to argue as to why he should be given a visa to come to Australia—even if that visa is given, as usual, with some caveats. We have no quibble with ministers from time to time putting caveats on those applications for a visa and that people must obey those caveats.
When Louis Farrakhan visited Australia recently, Minister Ruddock put some caveats on his being granted a visa. I understand that Mr Farrakhan accepted that and I do not think there was any breach of those caveats, instructions or restrictions. I stand to be corrected on this, but I think that was the case.
There is an equally celebrated case where previous governments—including a former Labor government—had refused a visa under the issue of good character to the British author and so-called historian David Irving. Mr Irving has written a number of books, some of which, to say the least, are controversially contested, about his view on such issues as the Holocaust and the Second World War.
He has also written other books on matters that do not deal specifically with the Holocaust and related areas that that are, other historians tell me, quite reasonable books in historical terms. In fact, I have read one of them myself. I think it was entitled The War Between the Generals.
—Don't ask me!
—No, I am not looking to you, Senator McKiernan, to vouch for this, but it was a very interesting book about the personal disputes between the various Allied generals from the time of Normandy onwards in the Second World War—Eisenhower, Montgomery, Bradley, Patton and others. That book was quite an interesting read and it gave new information.
Again, the argument of judgment about David Irving being granted a visa is a matter of fine judgment as to whether he should or should not. He clearly upsets a significant section of the Australian community because of his views about the Holocaust. He also would argue that in a democracy he should be entitled to have free speech. Others may say that they want to hear his views. But he is not a citizen of Australia and I believe it is a matter of judgment, so long as the ministerial decision to either grant or not grant him a visa is made public. The public will make a judgment, and that will be part of the public debate in a democracy.
We do not oppose the government's bill on the power of the minister to effect a decision, 
 even though the AAT may say something different. We do not have any objection to the government reversing the onus of proof. We believe it would be easier for some of the criminals who may be wanting to get into Australia to carry out their criminal activity to gain and maintain entry while a government tried to prove their background. I also accept, as a former Customs minister in particular, that unfortunately there are times when you cannot allow all the evidence before you to be made public about why some person does not pass the character test.
I know, as a former Customs minister, that if you divulge the information you have had internationally provided to you about why someone should be refused a visa and therefore at the customs barrier not be let into the country if they tried, you may put at risk somebody elsewhere in the world who has provided that information and you may put at risk the future arrangements Australia has with our services—the Federal Police, Customs, et cetera—for getting adequate information, because they would not want to have put at risk their sources. I understand that you cannot automatically provide all that information. It should not be made available for someone to defend themselves and probably to use the information indirectly or even directly to carry out and further extend their criminal activity, and to use it to threaten people who may have provided the information. I think the onus of proof in this case on balance, as I said, is reasonable.
I understand that when this bill was first proposed the time to lodge an appeal was 42 days. I think through work and negotiation that has now been extended to 84 days and we think that is a reasonable outcome. I think the minister also wanted an extension of some time to respond as well in certain procedural matters. We think on balance that that was reasonable.
I have no doubt that circumstances may be such in two or three years time, if this bill is carried—and I think it will be carried with the government and opposition supporting it—that there may be people debating that the bill has gone too much one way or not enough in another direction. There is no guarantee that 
 any bill in this area of balancing the individual's right against the collective right of the community to defend itself will always be perfectly reached. Circumstances will change from time to time.
If this bill goes through and if, after we have the experience of its operation, it does require further amendment in view of future experience, so be it. That is not a deficiency of this legislation. It means that from time to time the balances will be shifted around in debate in the community and in the parliament. That is a strength of our democracy, not a weakness of it.
I would always say in these areas dealing with judicial rights et cetera that although we should always err on the side of the individual, we cannot automatically forgo the rights collectively of the community if that individual who is not a citizen of this country is perverting our own processes to advance their criminal activity. I think the view in the community would be that the collective view must outweigh in this case the individual rights on the normal things that we would argue for, for our own citizens internally within Australia. Therefore, the opposition supports this legislation.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STRENGTHENING OF PROVISIONS RELATING TO CHARACTER AND CONDUCT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-25,"—The Migration Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions relating to Character and Conduct) Bill 1997 seeks to amend the Migration Act of 1958 to increase control over the entry into and presence in Australia of certain non-citizens who are unable to pass the character test and to strengthen the procedures used in dealing with such people.
The bill was introduced in the House of Representatives on 30 October 1997 and they passed it on 19 November of that year. There were six opposition amendments moved at the time, all of which were negatived. There was a relatively brief and narrow inquiry in the Senate. There were 23 submissions received and, subsequently, 11 witnesses appeared before the committee. Furthermore, Senators Bolkus and McKiernan wrote minority reports and the Democrats wrote a dissenting report, leaving only Senators Abetz, Coonan and 
 O'Chee, all coalition senators, to agree to the provisions of this bill.
Labor, I believe, has now had its amendments incorporated into the Senate bill and I understand it intends to pass the bill without further amendments. The character test at its minimum is whether a person has been sentenced to 12 months in prison. It would deem all visas of a person not meeting the character test to be cancelled or refused. It is, we believe, worth while to have an objective, standardised and legally binding character test with its potential for simplification and greater consistency in decision making but, in its current form, this test leaves no room for those who have since reformed, how long ago their sentence was given, or those who have been wrongfully imprisoned. That includes political prisoners.
Under this legislation, neither President Nelson Mandela nor Aung San Suu Kyi would have passed the character test. I wonder whether somehow this legislation will change in order to alter that situation if those people, or others in a similar position, ever apply to come to Australia. The length of time a person has been in Australia and the stable links they have formed with the Australian community, including family, are not taken into consideration, nor is a person being of good character and yet associating with those who have a criminal background; that is, community groups and church workers.
Senator Schacht, in his contribution, said that he was comfortable with the reversal of the onus of proof. I think that is a problem. The amendments would place the burden of proof on visa holders to convince the minister that they pass the character test. Since 1992 it has been up to the department to prove that the person did not meet the test. When you are dealing with refugees who may well have been wrongfully imprisoned, sometimes for several years at a time—which I must say I heard today in relation to Chilean refugees who were tortured and imprisoned—you put a very great burden on people who are already traumatised to prove and put up a case to the Australian parliament that they have been wrongfully imprisoned.
—It would not be difficult to prove, I would have thought.
—Senator Schacht interjects that it is not difficult to prove, but you are putting that onus on people to prove their wrongful imprisonment. The detail—the proof—is not so easy to get when people themselves may be under great distress and stress. What is considered to be proof under the law? Do you have to have witnesses to your torture? What kind of proof would be considered to be adequate proof for victims of wrongful arrest, torture or bad treatment? Should we put people through this when they may well be refugees who would normally be accepted?
It gives stronger ministerial powers to refuse or cancel a visa on character grounds. The minister may intervene in any case and substitute his or her own decision to refuse or cancel a visa on character grounds. This decision will be non-reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Applicants can be lawfully placed in detention following their failure to meet the character test. If the decision is revoked, they can subsequently claim against the Commonwealth because of their detention. We have had an example in recent days of a potential decision where the minister basically was trying to expel a person whose life was in danger. It is always possible that ministers make wrong decisions, and here we are removing the ability to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
It undermines the integrity, independence and public confidence in the work of the tribunal even if these powers are used only in rare cases. Theoretically, an independent tribunal could find the person to be of good character but the minister could decide they are of bad character, and the minister would not have to disclose the details of how he or she came to this decision.
The minister can intervene at any time during the review process even if the application is still being decided by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. No indication is required as to which individuals or groups should be excluded and on what grounds. A visa can be refused or cancelled if the 
 minister decides it is in the national interests, and the national interests are not defined. The applicants, we believe, should be able to claim for improper time in detention.
With the scheme for expedited review, the review application must be lodged with the AAT within nine days of notification of decision, with one set of all documents. The minister must provide non-disclosable documents within 14 days of being notified of the application by the AAT, and if no decision is made within 84 days of the person's original notification, the original decision is upheld. The 10-day limit for applicants to lodge a review is impractical and unrealistic, given language and postal barriers and the difficulties for individuals in getting their application together, especially in conjunction with an already overburdened legal aid system.
We have had many debates about that in the past, and Senator McKiernan can attest to the difficulties getting worse under our legal aid system. One aim is to ensure the review process is not used as a mechanism to prolong the person's stay in Australia. The majority of applicants will be in detention anyway whilst awaiting their review. It is not much of an incentive to stay on for review process.
There is a new test for conclusive certificates. The new standard test for all conclusive certificates will be the `national interest'. The minister will have the power to prevent a case being reviewed by the Immigration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal as well as the AAT if he or she deems that it is in the national interest—again, unspecified.
Again, this undermines the independence of the review process. National interest is not defined and gives the minister an unacceptably vague and broad base for excluding people to merits review. Currently, the national interest is defined in some degree as the security, defence or international relations of Australia. At least this degree of clarity should remain, and that is not here.
With protection from disclosure of confidential security and criminal intelligence information, the information provided by specified law enforcement or intelligence agencies for the purposes of assessing a person's character would be protected from 
 the Freedom of Information Act. It is a double bind. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies are reluctant to give information because of the government's inability to promise non-disclosure and, therefore, character assessments cannot be easily or properly done. Yet if the information does not have to be disclosed to anyone, including the parliament, it weakens an evaluation of the decision on the person's character. The AAT argues that the information should at least be available to them for the purpose of the review, and that sounds like a reasonable argument.
This could prevent people from applying for other visas. The amendments prevent, with limited exceptions, persons who have a visa refused or cancelled on character grounds from applying for further visas while they are still in the migration zone. A person could still apply for refugee status, which is an essential caveat to this provision.
The minister must notify the applicant of a decision and the process of coming to that decision and of any rights of appeal, much as before. Notification must also be accompanied by two copies of all relevant non-disclosable documents. Giving two copies enables the applicant to quickly apply for appeal to the AAT.
It does enhance the power to give binding directions. The minister's power, under section 499, to delegates and tribunals would be expanded, and the minister would be able to specify more precisely how a discretion should be exercised.
We are not sure how this would work out in practice. We are very concerned about the implications for basic human rights, and we think that it is very dangerous legislation. Therefore the Greens will not be supporting the Migration Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions relating to Character and Conduct) Bill 1997.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STRENGTHENING OF PROVISIONS RELATING TO CHARACTER AND CONDUCT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"McKiernan, Sen James",ALP,1998-11-25,"—I rise to support this Migration Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions relating to Character and Conduct) Bill 1997 in its amended form. We cannot be accused of acting in haste in the passage of this particular bill. Senator Margetts in her opening comments went through the dates 
 from the introduction of the bill through to its presentation to the Senate. It is now more than 12 months since we have seen the bill. I was very tempted to get a copy of the minister's press statement, which he released at the time, making all sorts of accusations about the Labor Party and where the Labor Party stands in regard to the control of criminals entering this country and what stance we might take on the bill.
In the sense of where we are going with the bill and in recognition of the very positive negotiations that have occurred, I have decided not to go down that track. But I do make mention of it. It might be better if those negotiations started or if there were at least some element of consultation with the parliament before the press secretary drafts, prints and issues those press statements. It might save some egg being tossed at the minister's face, because it is the minister who ultimately gets it. It might seem to be a good idea for the press secretary at the time, to justify the income they are on, but it may not necessarily be the right thing for the government in the long term.
With the passage of this bill we are clearly seeing a vindication of the stance that Labor has taken consistently over many years, and certainly in the years that I have been a member of this parliament. Labor stands very strongly for parliamentary control of who can enter this country and who can remain in this country. Those who have criminal records, who have been involved or engaged in criminal activity, are not welcome. We have not welcomed them and we will not welcome them as members of the opposition. Irrespective of what is contained in the ministerial press statements from time to time, action speaks louder than words. And the actions have been the negotiations that have gone on around this bill.
The bill, as Senator Margetts and Senator Schacht have said, was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which did conduct some public hearings on the bill. We took evidence on the bill in Perth, which is somewhat strange for a legislation committee because generally they take evidence in only Canberra. We also took 
 evidence in Melbourne and Canberra. We presented a report to the parliament before 23 March this year. The bill has languished since then despite the urgency of the message contained in the minister's press statement. Nothing has happened on it until today. It is proceeding today because there is, I understand, unanimity on where we are going.
—Ahem.
—Not quite.
—Thank you, Senator Margetts, I accept that interjection but I am not sure how Hansard will deal with it. Even you would accept that the bill is probably going to get relatively speedy passage.
The minority report by Senator Bolkus and me, which is attached to the committee's main report, is a short, very considered four-page document. In it we give some very considered advice to the department and to the minister. We are very pleased that, from what we have heard so far, the suggestions contained in that minority report have been taken up and will be actioned by the committee. I recognise that there are some in the chamber who do not necessarily agree with the stance we have taken on it. But we very clearly outlined in that very short 3½-page minority report that there would be considerable debate during the committee stages of the bill had the amendments not been presented to the chamber. The amendments are forthcoming so I do not need to dwell and delay the Senate much more on it.
I do need to follow up on the comments made by Senator Schacht when he mentioned some of the less desirable people that we would not be wanting to come into this country. Mr David Irving is one of those. Mr Irving has an international criminal record. He has been deported from Canada and also from Germany. That in itself is reason enough not to issue that particular individual with a visa. Mr Irving's lawyers have challenged both ministers' decisions—the current minister, Mr Ruddock, and the previous minister—in the Federal Court of Australia. Thankfully, those appeals have been dismissed. They are decisions that I hold to.
But not all ministerial decisions are necessarily correct in the fullness of time. Senator Schacht mentioned Mr Gerry Adams. He probably should have called him Mr Gerry Adams MP. Not only is Mr Adams a member of the new assembly in Northern Ireland; he is also an elected member of the Westminster parliament, which is said to be the mother of all the parliaments. He has not actually taken his seat but there are political reasons for that.
I have not been on the public record before saying that the Australian government—either Labor or Liberal—should grant a visa to Mr Adams. I have not until now. I now go on the public record and say that if Gerry Adams applies for a visa in the normal way he ought to be issued with one so he can enter this country to speak with his supporters in this country.
I am changing my mind on Mr Adams. There are some members of the community, particularly back in Western Australia, who will know that I have not previously supported Mr Adams in his quest to come to Australia. I certainly did not support the visa request when his book was being published. But things have dramatically changed in Northern Ireland and I pay great tribute to Mr Adams for what has happened in that very divided nation of Northern Ireland, and in Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Adams played a very crucial role in the peace process which culminated in an agreement on Good Friday of this year—a peace process which was later validated and vindicated by referendums in both the north and south of Ireland. Adams's role has been internationally recognised and he probably should have been included as one of the recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize along with the two recipients who were granted it. I understand there were political reasons why Adams could not be included in that.
Whatever reasons there were previously for Adams not being granted a visa on character grounds—a decision on which I understand there is a challenge still ongoing in the courts—I think those reasons have now been put behind us, and we have to move forward with the times. Times have changed, and I 
 hope the minister is receptive to pleas such as I am making.
I would stress and urge to Mr Adams and his supporters that the application be made in the normal way. There are millions of applications for visas to enter Australia made each year. Not all of them need to be done through the media; they can be done in the normal way according to the law. I know there are people in Australia who want to meet with Adams, want to talk with him and want to listen to his experiences in the lead-in to and actual happenings in the peace process in Northern Ireland. I hope that that visa will be granted and that members of parliament such as us assembled in the Senate of Australia might be given the opportunity to meet directly with him and hear his views. There are, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would quite well know, very strong links between Ireland and Australia and between the United Kingdom and Australia, and I hope that the passage of this bill will actually lead to some positive developments in that regard.
I made some remarks earlier about the benefit of consultation on matters before statements are announced. I am aware of a ministerial statement given yesterday during question time in the House of Representatives when the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs made some comment about alleged abuses of the special needs relative category. He said that the regulations are going to be tightened up—regulations, I might add, that are subject to examination by this chamber and indeed can be subject to disallowance if they are wrong.
I have from the Internet a copy of the Fuduche judgment, which I understand was the judgment the minister referred to when he said, in his answer to a question—which was more a ministerial statement—that the special needs relative category system was being abused because someone was allowed to stay because of homesickness. That is in the statement in the House of Representatives. From my quick glance through the judgment, and it is a fairly substantial judgment, I do not think that the minister is quite accurate in his description that it was merely homesickness. I do not want to distort the record either, 
 but there might be opportunity during the committee stages, if there is need to, to come back and look at that. But I think this particular case was a lot more serious than merely homesickness. I understand that an individual had a psychiatric disorder and the separation of the family had an enormous impact on the individual, and that was substantiated by medical opinion.
Maybe it is useful for ministers from time to time to grab a headline and get their name in the paper, to be seen from time to time to be doing something. But, if we are going down the wrong track—the wrong track in terms of the government, the wrong track in terms of protecting Australia—maybe it is better to sit and wait before we go for the headline. Certainly I have been tempted to do that, but in my latter years in the parliament I have not been issuing press releases on such a regular basis. We can make mistakes, and in this particular category of character testing it can be very decisive and have a great impact on the individuals concerned. We need look no further than July of last year and the case of Mr Lorenzo Ervin, and the embarrassment that that case caused to the then acting minister, Senator Vanstone, when she got it wrong, and the embarrassment of the department whose advice she was probably acting on who had got it wrong, and the embarrassment of the QC before the High Court of Australia because they had got it wrong.
Mistakes and errors can occur, and I think what we are doing now, the referral of a bill such as this to a Senate parliamentary committee, has vindicated the processes of the Senate. There were only three hearings of the committee to take evidence from different parts of Australia and it was not the biggest inquiry that the committee has ever participated in, but they were all very useful hearings. Very useful evidence was collected and a very useful report was presented to the parliament of Australia. I would argue there was a very useful minority report from Senator Bolkus and me, which I understand has been heeded. Perhaps this is a better way to go than racing to grab an immediate headline from ministerial statements, from press statements 
 and whatever. Ultimately, as I said, what we on this side of the chamber are about is protecting Australia, which I understand people on the other side of the chamber are about. We can work together on this, and I think the actions and the amendments that are forthcoming on this particular bill are living proof of how we are working together.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STRENGTHENING OF PROVISIONS RELATING TO CHARACTER AND CONDUCT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1998-11-25,"—I would like to thank Senator Cooney, Senator Short, Senator Bartlett, Senator Margetts and Senator McKiernan for their contributions to the debate. To sum up, I remind all senators that the objective of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions relating to Character and Conduct) Bill 1997 is to safeguard the Australian community. It implements a number of important policy measures in relation to the entry and stay in Australia of non-citizens who are of character concern. These measures continue the process of restoring community credibility in the management of immigration matters. It will enable the government effectively to discharge its duties and responsibilities to the Australian people and ensure a higher level of protection for the Australian community.
The bill sends a clear and unequivocal message on behalf of the Australian community, which expects that non-citizens coming to Australia should be of good character. To meet this expectation, the government must have the ability to act quickly and decisively wherever necessary and to remove non-citizens who are not of good character. This message is especially timely given Australia's hosting of the Olympic Games in less than two years time.
I would like to address a couple of issues that honourable senators raised during the debate. The other night Senator Cooney said in his remarks that the proposals in this bill would only apply to visitors to this country. I would like to clarify that the provisions can apply to all non-citizens in Australia, whether they are visitors or permanent residents. I would also like to clarify that the rights of 
 non-citizens to seek judicial review will not be changed by this bill.
Senator Cooney also said that the minister must apply the provisions of section 501 personally. I would like to clarify that the major power under section 501 to refuse or cancel a visa is exercisable either by the minister or by a delegate of the minister. Also, Senator Cooney pointed out that the power under section 501 is a discretionary power which allows the minister or delegate to exercise their discretion to refuse or cancel a visa. This means that, even if people like Anwar Ibrahim did not meet the requirements of a character test, they could still be granted a visa. I cannot quite remember but I think Senator Cooney actually referred to Anwar Ibrahim.
He also requested evidence of people who have come to this country and `done violence'. While the majority of visitors and permanent residents are law-abiding citizens, there are many instances of such conduct. I have been given a recent example of such behaviour where criminals from a particular country—and I do not think it does any of us any good to name that country—who travelled here and committed crimes of violence against members of their own ethnic groups who had settled in Australia. Senator Cooney may wish me to give him more detail about that. It is not appropriate here, but there are examples that can be given of that happening. I would like to add that this bill is not just about preventing physical violence in Australia by visitors or permanent residents; it is also designed to protect the community from other threats such as harassment, intimidation and vilification by preventing people with substantial criminal records or criminal associations from coming to or remaining in Australia.
Senator Bartlett raised the issue of the reversal of the onus of proof. I think Senator Schacht dealt with that in his contribution when he talked about the very delicate balance between the rights of individuals and the rights of a country, or the national interest. The reversal of the onus of proof reflects a general principle that, where a person is seeking a benefit, responsibility lies with that person to establish eligibility. One of the 
 requirements for a visa is that the non-citizen must demonstrate that they meet the criteria, one of which is character. This bill ensures that the objective of protecting the Australian community will take precedence, with the onus being placed on the non-citizen, as it was before 1992. This existed in 1992. It was a change then that actually led to a period where the minister or the delegate had to indicate that the person was not of good character. So it is really not earth-shattering or rocket science; it was in legislation before.
Senator Bartlett also referred to the minister's personal powers. The powers that are conferred by this bill on the minister to refuse or cancel a visa are subject to the requirements of natural justice. Non-citizens will still have the opportunity to make representations to the minister that they do meet character requirements. The only time that a non-citizen will not be entitled to make a representation or seek a merits review is where the minister decides that it is not in the national interest.
Senator Schacht, in his contribution, indicated maybe the difference between why the opposition is agreeing with the government in this case and why the minority parties are not: that is that members of the opposition, when they were in government, had to make the sorts of decisions that Mr Ruddock has to make now in government. It is, as Senator Schacht said, a fine balance between the rights of the individual and national interest. I think Senator Schacht put very clearly the dilemma we face in—if I can be a little bit rude to you, Senator Schacht—an uncharacteristically succinct way, because he did not take his whole 20 minutes. He was able to put forward a very clear case about why he is going to agree with us.
It speaks volumes that the opposition is supporting us on this—because you have been in the position of having to make these very difficult decisions. I will admit to Senator Margetts and Senator Bartlett that they are very difficult decisions and there is no real answer. It is an issue of judgment, but it is a judgment that has to be made to protect the interests of Australian citizens.
Senator Schacht indicated that the requirement for the minister to table reasons for the overturning of an AAT decision allowed transparency in that decision making. I think he was correct in saying that and I think that is appropriate. Senator McKiernan, I will draw your comments regarding Gerry Adams to the minister's attention. I am sure that he will make any decision, if there is an application, based on its merits.
—And mine too, if you wouldn't mind.
—Of course, Senator Schacht, I will bring your comments to his attention. I was just checking about a judgment that Senator McKiernan referred to. I have been advised that there may have been some confusion about whether the homesickness related to another case. I have not had time to have that checked, but if you would like a briefing on that the departmental officers would be only too happy to do that. There may have been some confusion, because I think there were two cases, but I have not had time to follow that up.
I would like to thank honourable senators for their contributions. I would also like to thank the opposition for their cooperation in supporting this bill. I look forward to working with the minister to ensure the integrity of our migration system and the granting of visas.
	 Question put:
	 That the bill be now read a second time.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STRENGTHENING OF PROVISIONS RELATING TO CHARACTER AND CONDUCT) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1998-11-25,"—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President Bartlett. Well done on your first day in the chair. This is a typical example of this government's inability to manage its business. Quite literally, notice was given us about this change to the program within the last 30 seconds. I have just had to ring my office 
 and, as people possibly observed, my staffer has just arrived with the notes I was using earlier.
There are a number of issues that I want to continue to canvass here about what this government's policies and the new directions that they are taking—or, rather, not taking—mean for people, and particularly what they mean for people in rural areas. I spoke earlier about the concerns of various groups about the impact the GST will have on them. In particular, charitable organisations and church groups with their op-shops and things like that—which they run for people's benefit—are expressing concern. Other groups also are expressing concern about the GST. Certainly local government bodies are expressing concern.
The Local News is a briefing paper for parliamentarians produced by the Local Government and Shires Associations of New South Wales. In the October-November issue, issue 7, they say:
Local Government has some concerns about the application of a GST on council activities. The extent to which the GST will apply to Local Government `commercial activities' is a major concern in the absence of clear definition. It is understood that water, sewerage, child care, nursing homes and domestic waste will remain GST-free, however, this leaves in doubt the status of a number of other activities for which councils collect fees.
The Voss inquiry was set up and given three weeks to answer these questions relating to health and what is in and what is out. These sorts of things are going to take Senate committees a number of months to sort out and work through, yet the Voss committee was given three weeks to do it.
I have extracts from local papers such as the Daily Advertiser in Wagga. Local disability groups and services in that town have expressed concern about the impact of the GST on them. I have seen press releases by groups like St Vincent de Paul deploring the lack of compassion for the poor in the GST. It is a pity, mind you, that they did not make these comments before the election to alert people to the very negative impact that the GST will have upon people on low incomes, but it is nice that they have done it now. 
 People are beginning to realise that the GST will have major impacts on the general community.
There is another issue that I want to take up: this government's treatment of health—or lack of treatment. I am referring to the government's cut, in its first budget in 1996, to its component of the Commonwealth Dental Scheme. That has had a major impact on many people and many services. I have here a copy of a letter to the editor of the Daily Liberal, which is the Dubbo newspaper. On 11 November, an Elaine Elliot wrote to the paper expressing major concern about what happened to her mother.
Her mother, who is an insulin-dependent diabetic, broke her false teeth. When she rang the dental clinic she was advised to superglue them so that they might last the necessary five months. Otherwise, she had to get a letter from a dentist or a doctor confirming her current health problems and explaining why she needed urgent attention. Even with a medical certificate she could only get a number and be placed on a waiting list. The clinic could not determine the time in which she would get treatment. Elaine Elliot finally found a private dentist who would repair the dentures, but it was at cost to her mother.
I know of another lady who lives in Orange and who has been waiting five months for replacement of a filling that has fallen out of one of her front teeth. She is on social security. She would like to get a job, but she cannot afford to get her tooth filled. She cannot get onto the emergency waiting list of the local dental health clinic, so she has to sit at home. She is not able to eat properly. She does not feel confident enough to go out and get a job.
—Raise it with Mr Carr.
—The parliamentary secretary says, `She should raise it with Mr Carr.' The parliamentary secretary does not understand that the reason this particular scheme was introduced by the Labor government when we were in power was that there were insufficient funds to all of the states, including the Liberal held states.
We had some compassion when we were in power and cared about dental health and, 
 therefore, the general health of people. We introduced the scheme whereby poor people and those on low incomes were able to have dental treatment more quickly than before. This callous, uncaring government scrapped the scheme because they said the Commonwealth had no role or responsibility for the dental health of the people of this nation. Teeth do not know state boundaries.
—I rise on a point of order. I was waiting to see whether Senator West would correct what she had said. I said that Senator West should raise it with Mr Carr, not the person to whom she was referring. It should be Senator West who raises it with Mr Carr.
—There is no point of order.
—The parliamentary secretary knows jolly well that it does not need to be the responsibility of me or anybody else to raise this with state premiers. The federal government should be accepting its responsibility for dental health, not passing the blame on to the state and flicking it off. This is typical of the attitude of this government. They do not want national schemes. They do not think that people in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania or Queensland have the same right of access to the same schemes.
People are being told, `Use superglue for your dentures' and people cannot even get an appointment for five months to see whether their case is an urgent one. This government stands condemned for their lack of concern and compassion for people. This is typical of what you would expect from a conservative government. For that they are to be condemned. People deserve better than that. But this government just does not care at all. They should be roundly condemned. In less than three years time they should be kicked out by the people of Australia because they jolly well know that they are not going to be cared for by a conservative government. They are an uncaring and uncompassionate mob of people.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Address in Reply,22,1
"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,1998-11-25,"—I rise to respond to an issue that the Governor-General touched upon in his address. His 
 Excellency referred to the government's so-called Tough on Drugs initiatives, asserting that the government will be maintaining its momentum on the fight against illicit drugs. To many from within the treatment field this must have come as a big surprise, considering that they were unaware that any momentum had ever been gained.
The Prime Minister rejected the recommendations of his own Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy last year when they concluded that the ACT heroin trial should go ahead. He has subsequently set about establishing a new body that might be more accommodating to his own personal opinions. The new Australian National Council on Drugs is chaired by Major Brian Watters from the Salvation Army, who was the other most prominent opponent of the heroin trial.
The Prime Minister has recently been asserting his commitment to addressing social policy issues and I think it is about time he had a second look at his stance on drug law reform. I find it particularly ironic that Mr Howard continues to pay lip service to the cause when he has repeatedly ignored the advice and direction of doctors, academics, workers from within the treatment field and indeed his own cabinet ministers with regard to possible avenues for reform.
Legislation governing illicit drug use in Australia has traditionally been steeped in attitudes of fear and prejudice. The very first laws enacted in Australia to restrict the consumption of drugs were initiated to prohibit the smoking of opium in the early 1900s. These laws were enacted largely as a knee-jerk reaction to the increased presence of Chinese immigrants in Australia at the time. The Chinese, who had come to Australia throughout the gold rush, were perceived with suspicion and trepidation by the broader population. Significant racist sentiment at the time reflected the belief that the Chinese were stealing jobs from `real Australians'.
It was from within such a climate that restrictions on opium were born. There were many stark and frightening contrasts between Australian and Chinese culture at that point and these were embodied in the denunciation of opium smoking. The smoking of opium 
 became a symbol for the breakdown of traditional values and norms within Australian society. It represented all that was unfamiliar and confronting about the new immigrants and their culture. Instead of trying to understand this new culture and integrate it into the established social fabric, early governments simply sought to legislate against unsavoury aspects of it.
The prohibition of opium smoking at the time reflected racist sentiment more accurately than it reflected any actual danger posed by the substance to the broader community. Similarly, in Australia today, people reject the notion of heroin as a legitimate pharmacotherapy because of their fear of and paranoia about heroin addicts—who are perceived as a dangerous minority. Meanwhile, after the prohibition of opium, a wide variety of medicines, the great majority of which contained heroin, morphine or cocaine as their active ingredients, were supplied with increasing popularity by chemists and doctors.
The history of illicit drug legislation in Australia bears testimony to a haphazard and reactionary approach to policy formulation that has continued to the present day as successive governments have bowed to both internal and external political pressures. Australia became a signatory to the 1931 Convention on the Suppression of Illicit Traffic in Dangerous Drugs in response to pressure from the United States. This decision was taken against the wishes of the Australian medical community at that time.
Especially in the 1990s it is worth wondering why we have mirrored the American approach to legislation on illicit drugs. I think it is widely recognised that North America has largely failed in its so-called war on drugs. The punitive war on drugs was launched in America in the 1970s by the Nixon administration. Decades later the war on drugs continues in America, and the casualties continue to rise unabated. Surely advocating the `just say no' message and putting your head in the sand is no longer a viable means of addressing the problem.
It is commonly accepted by many from within the treatment field that the punitive approach to heroin users and drug related 
 crime instituted under prohibitionist strategy may actually be exacerbating costs for law enforcement agencies. Prominent Australian lawyer Chris Murphy agrees with this argument and has emphasised the irony of incarcerating a person for crimes perpetrated in order to finance their addiction when often that person's addiction cannot be treated in gaol. By gaoling users under a prohibitionist policy instead of providing additional treatment services, the federal government is reinforcing a self-perpetuating cycle of crime and punishment for Australian heroin users.
Last year the ACT heroin trial proposal gave the government the opportunity to test a new treatment option for severely dependent heroin users. The trial would have yielded invaluable information for doctors and other treatment experts with regard to the potential for pharmaceutical heroin to be used in the treatment of addicts. Far from heralding the mass production and distribution of heroin by the government, the first stage of the trial would have been limited to 40 registered dependent users from the ACT. Far from being a radical movement, the ACT heroin trial proposal received support from a wide range of individuals and groups.
The report of the NSW commission into police corruption in 1997 recommended that the trial be allowed to go ahead. The report claimed:
Without such a trial its efficacy or otherwise would never be known. Until attempted, it is very difficult to move forward or to consider alternative strategies.
I believe that was a very sensible conclusion. The proposal had been further bolstered by the resounding success of the recent Swiss heroin trial. Retention rates and compliance with treatment were increased. The numbers of those with permanent employment doubled, the incidence of criminal activity among participants rapidly decreased and they experienced improvements in their general health. Perhaps most importantly, however, a significant number of participants decided to give up heroin and switch to abstinence therapy in the longer term. This is in stark contrast to methadone maintenance therapy, which few addicts ever fully recover from, even after 
 decades of treatment. A Swiss national referendum in 1997 saw 71 per cent of the population come out in favour of continuing the trial. Clearly the Swiss have found that hordes of desperate heroin addicts will not descend upon their country the instant a trial is initiated. Indeed the Swiss have found that crime has decreased as users are not forced to become criminals to support their habit.
Given all of this evidence and support for the trial, what happened? What incredible purveyor of knowledge was more authoritative than all of these experts, politicians, doctors, lawyers and scientists? What amazing all-powerful force could outweigh the evidence gathered by years of studying, compiling, fasting and contemplation? Our Prime Minister was listening to the likes of John Laws and Alan Jones when he made his decision. He had a health minister, Dr Wooldridge, who was telling him it should go ahead. He had the entire Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy telling him this was a good idea. He had the bipartisan support of a number of leading political figures, not to mention the support of countless doctors and treatment professionals. Apparently none of this stood up to the scrutiny of a minority of prominent media figures with dubious qualifications and a bigoted understanding of the issues.
While Laws and Jones launched a misinformed and misguided scare campaign against the trial on the airwaves, the Daily Telegraph followed suit in the print media. On 2 August a photo of ministers from the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy appeared under the heading `Drug pedlars in business suits'. On 18 August an editorial from the same paper referred to `the contentious, morally indefensible and profoundly evil heroin trial'. I find it particularly disturbing that the Daily Telegraph seems to have put itself up as the guardian of public morality. It will be a sad day in Australian history when a tabloid newspaper is the guardian of the moral fabric which binds our society, and it was rather presumptuous of the Telegraph to assume that role.
However, the Prime Minister was significantly swayed by the media storm that erupt 
 ed in response to the heroin trial proposal. With Dr Wooldridge out of the country and the Thredbo disaster a high priority, Mr Howard wavered under increasing pressure to abandon the trial. On 19 August federal cabinet released a statement indicating that it would not support the heroin trial, so years of research and expert recommendations were overturned after a media smear campaign that lasted a mere couple of weeks. Mr Howard rejected all of the recommendations placed before him. In doing so, he dashed the hopes and dreams of families and friends of heroin users throughout the country who had been eagerly awaiting a new treatment option that might eventually offer a lifeline to their loved ones. Even more cruelly, he offered no alternative on which they could pin their hopes for the future.
There are a number of new treatment options worthy of further examination in the Australian context. The drug naltrexone has been trialled overseas with very positive results and is currently being used in a number of Australian treatment facilities. Naltrexone has so far been linked primarily with the controversial ultra-rapid detoxification technique but has also been used in more conventional forms of maintenance therapy. Naltrexone blocks a person's opiate receptors so that the administration of an opiate has no effect. A patient on maintenance therapy with naltrexone would therefore be unable to obtain a high from injecting heroin. This helps people come to terms with their psychological addiction, even after the physical symptoms have gone.
A number of private treatment facilities have already incorporated naltrexone as a fundamental part of their treatment regime. Despite this, the government is yet to acknowledge its potential as an alternative treatment option for Australian heroin users. It is very difficult to take the Prime Minister's commitment to social policy seriously when he has failed to respond to a huge medical breakthrough that has the potential to make a big difference for heroin users and their families.
In addition, existing treatment facilities are seriously underfunded and are struggling to 
 provide even the most basic of support services to participants. One would assume that counselling services should be made available to all people trying to come to terms with a serious addiction, but the reality is that many of those on the methadone program continue to be maintained without proper counselling, guidance or supervision. There simply are not enough services to go around, and the Prime Minister seems unwilling to institute a reallocation of resources to fill the gaps.
So the dubious history of drug legislation in Australia continues in the 1990s along the same path it embarked upon in the early 1900s. Once again a section of the population has been marginalised and demonised to the point where the government can justify legislating against them instead of for them. In Australia today, heroin addicts are seen as a threat to the moral and social fabric; their lifestyle is completely alien to the understanding of most everyday Australians. Will we legislate against them, punishing them for their difference? Or will we legislate for them, with the ultimate aim of helping them and integrating them back into the community? The decision is now ours to take, and I trust we will consider it carefully.
The politics of this issue is a constant frustration to those dealing with heroin use. Families of heroin users and those in the treatment field need help now to address the problem, and the intricacies of party politics are just another barrier. I recently attended a national remembrance ceremony for people who have lost their lives through drug use, and let me assure you that the message there was one of unity, not one of politics. People expect us as their elected representatives to address the issues that are worrying them the most, and this is one of them. I therefore advocate a bipartisan approach to addressing the issue. This is a wide-ranging social problem that affects all Australians, and as their elected representatives we have a duty to work together to find a solution. The Prime Minister must learn to listen and become responsive to the needs of the Australian people. But first he must learn to listen to his own colleagues.
It is Mr Howard's responsibility to bring drug law reform back onto the political 
 agenda in Australia. The Australian people are looking to him for leadership and some plausible answers to this most debilitating problem that is stealing our children and threatening the very future of our society. Personally, I think Australia deserves better than John Howard. But since the Australian people are counting on him, I hope he is serious about his commitment to social policy and decides to reconsider his stance—not only on the heroin trial but also with regard to other alternative treatments.
We do not need a Prime Minister who is trying to win votes by declaring that he is tough on drugs. We need a Prime Minister who can look at the facts objectively and then respond with courage to the needs of the Australian people. While many heroin users supported the trial, it is not the free drugs that they were after. A young girl in an inner city treatment facility made this clear to me last year when she said:
I want more than free heroin from my life. I actually want to be happy and accomplish things.
Don't we all?",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Address in Reply,22,1
"McKiernan, Sen James",ALP,1998-11-25,"—The Senate is considering the address-in-reply. The motion reads:
May it please Your Excellency:
We, the Senate of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament.
I sincerely hope that is the last time that I will be addressing a motion such as that. I say that in the knowledge that some time next year there will be a referendum in Australia on whether or not this country shall become a republic. I have great confidence that that referendum will be carried and that, following that referendum, Australia will indeed become a republic. It is my fervent hope that that will occur prior to the next election. So when the opening of parliament next occurs, it will be `the President' or a person by some other name who will open this parliament and make the address which the parliament will then be pleased to receive and to thank His or Her Excellency for.
I do have great faith, and even greater faith following the Constitutional Convention which was held in Canberra earlier this year, attended by some 148 people—some of whom were elected and some of whom were appointed—who came down with recommendations on the direction in which Australia should go. I was not a supporter of the convention in the first instance, and certainly not a supporter of the appointment of people to the convention. I was not a supporter of the method of election of those who were elected to the convention. I think that, with the benefit of hindsight, those people who determined the methods of election would not have been quite so supportive of them had they known what the results were going to be. It is common knowledge now in my state of Western Australia that the representatives of the Australian Republican Movement significantly won the poll in that state under a voluntary voting method, and I am pleased to have made some small contribution to that success as a public representative of that state. The people whom we elected to come over to the convention from Western Australia made eminent contributions. One of them, a most significant individual, has since been elected as the member for Cowan and sits in the other place as the people's representative from that electorate in Western Australia. I am referring to Graham Edwards—the Hon. Graham Edwards, as he was a minister in a previous Western Australian government.
I make note of the address-in-reply out of courtesy to the parliament, because that is the motion before the chamber, but also I wish to use this opportunity to pay tribute to another great republican—but one who was also a great royalist—who unfortunately passed away on 2 October 1998. I am referring to Albert John Marks, or Jack Marks, or, as he was more commonly known, Marksy. Marksy was a republican. All his life, and certainly during the life I knew him, he was a republican. He was a royalist merely because he supported the East Perth Football Club, whose nickname was the Royals. So he had this dichotomy in life, which he didn't have a problem in explaining to people, and we were quite happy from time to time to remind him of the fact that he was indeed a royalist as 
 well. He took it in good humour, but not always without an argument. If there was one thing in life that Jack really enjoyed, it was a good, forceful argument.
Jack Marks was an extraordinary individual and I owe him more than I think I owe any other human being other than my immediate family. He probably is the person mostly to blame—or mostly to credit, depending on which way you look at it—for my presence in this parliament. Certainly it was his oratory that convinced me to not only become a member of the Amalgamated Engineering Union and on the same occasion become shop steward for that organisation in a place called Dillingham Shipyards, in Fremantle, Western Australia, but also to do so at a time when I was actually a member of the Australasian Society of Engineers. So it was a rapid introduction into the Australian trade union movement. Jack was a mentor in my life, as a member of the union, as a branch official, as a shop steward and as a conference delegate at both state and federal levels.
While he was a mentor and a father figure in many respects, he was also a very great mate and a very great confidant in times when a young, brash individual needed some guidance and needed some advice. He would certainly give that to me. He provided an enormous amount of support and wisdom, and indeed advice, at the time of my first marriage breaking up. For a time, he and I shared accommodation—bachelors together, both of whom had a penchant for red wine, and many other things.
—Is that where you got your ties from?
—At that time I used to be pretty tieless, but I still enjoyed the red wine. Jack was, as I said, an amazing individual. It was his oratory ability and his lifestyle that encouraged me to get involved in politics in Australia. My involvement in the union movement started first; my political involvement started afterwards, and both he and another official of the later Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, Harold Peden, were both members of the Communist Party of Australia, where I started my political thinking in this country.
I actually left the Communist Party before Jack did. It was something that I discussed with him at the time because I was frustrated by where it was going, and indeed his frustrations were brought to bear but he felt it was not the time for him to leave the party. He gave me great encouragement in joining the Australian Labor Party after a space of time, and he himself joined the Labor Party later on in life. Had he joined before or around the time that I had joined, perhaps he might have been, as Kim Beazley said in the oratory at his remembrance celebration in Hyde Park, a Premier of WA. Nothing was beyond Jack Marks. He lives very fondly in my memory.
We also have a living reminder of Jack Marks which shows the benefit of his persuasiveness. One afternoon, around 15 years ago, my present wife, Jackie, and her children were called over to his place in Stirling Street, Highgate, where he told us of a pending overseas trip to the United States. Jack had a cat, and his cat had kittens, and he convinced the children that they could save at least one of those kittens.
I do not, and did not at that time, have a love of cats, but I—and Jackie as well—got lumbered with this black furry thing which we called AJ after Albert Jack Marks. That cat is still with us. It is a very fussy cat. It does not share Jack's love of red wine, but it certainly shares his love of contrariness and can, in its own way, be particularly argumentative—to a certain extent, it has the characteristics of my mate Jack. He has gone, but his memory lives on.
I have spoken briefly about his trade union involvement and some of his political involvement. He finished his life as a very active citizen of Western Australia. He became the first mayor of the town of Vincent in Western Australia, a town which evolved after the metropolitan area of the city of Perth was broken up to form four different municipalities. Jack made enormous contributions during his life—in his personal life to his family and his loved ones, and to the trade union movement and workers generally right around Australia.
Jack was one of the individuals targeted by the then Premier of Western Australia in 1979 when he was arrested with Laurie Carmichael at the airport and charged under the infamous section 54B of the Police Act—an action which the government later very much regretted because the whole of Australia was brought to a standstill on a number of occasions as the working people defended their right to meet with more than three people at a time without having to ask for police permission.
Jack made that contribution, and I was very pleased to be at the memorial ceremony in Hyde Park, just opposite where he lived, on 9 October 1998 to share with his family and other loved ones the memory of a very remarkable man. He was one of a kind, the champion of the battlers, and a man who could break bread with either prince or pauper. As the tribute to him that was distributed on the day said, he had an irreverent sense of humour and there was no bulldust about him.
This was so even on his deathbed. I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to visit him in his final days. When the doctor revived him, he abused the doctor and said, `Don't you ever do that again. You've got enough film in the can. You're not filming Ben-Hur.' The doctor said he would not do it. That was the end of the life of Jack Marks, but his memory lives on.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Address in Reply,22,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-11-25,"—I want to respond to the speech by His Excellency the Governor-General on the occasion of the opening of the 39th Parliament on 10 November 1998. The Governor-General touched on a number of subjects and developed themes on others. The topics included economic challenges, a new tax system, reform in the community context, jobs and workplaces, our future generations, and so on. The address-in-reply looked to the future. It is interesting that it should do so, because a challenge is before the Australian people at the moment as to how we go into the future.
When the Governor-General spoke of a new tax system, he was speaking about the new tax system put forward by the coalition. Central to that new tax system is the goods and services tax. How new is the concept of 
 a goods and services tax? How new is the concept of a tax on consumption? I will read from a work by Thomas Paine, a great thinker in the 18th century. I will read from his work The Rights of Man.
Thomas Paine made two contributions in the work that is now called The Rights of Man. The one I will quote from is from 1792—well over 200 years ago. He was talking about taxes. This is what he had to say about taxes over 200 years ago. People might agree or disagree with what Thomas Paine said at that point in time, but what is clear is that he was talking about it over 200 years ago, and so to call the goods and services tax a new tax system is hardly accurate. Thomas Paine said:
Notwithstanding taxes have increased and multiplied upon every article of common consumption, the land-tax, which more particularly affects this `pillar,' has diminished. In 1788, the amount of the land-tax was £1,950,000, which is half a million less than it produced almost a hundred years ago, notwithstanding the rentals are in many instances doubled since that period.
Just to put that in context, he was saying there were two forms of taxes: there was land tax, which fell upon those who had landed estates—in those days the aristocrats—and there was a tax on consumption. What Thomas Paine was complaining about was that the taxes on the aristocrats were diminishing and those on consumption, which hit the poor, were increasing. He went on to say:
Before the coming of the Hanoverians, the taxes were divided in nearly equal proportions between the land and articles of consumption, the land bearing rather the largest share: but since that era, nearly thirteen millions annually of new taxes have been thrown upon consumption. The consequence of which has been a constant increase in the number and wretchedness of the poor, and in the amount of the poor-rates. Yet here again the burden does not fall in equal proportions on the aristocracy with the rest of the community. Their residences, whether in town or country, are not mixed with the habitations of the poor. They live apart from distress, and the expense of relieving it. It is in manufacturing towns and labouring villages that those burdens press the heaviest; in many of which it is one class of poor supporting another.
Thomas Paine is showing that through the tax system, and through taxes being thrown onto consumption, the effect is that those who are 
 most able to bear the burden of paying money for the proper running of the country are relieved of that obligation and those who are least able to do it, the poor, have it cast upon them. When in this address that the Governor-General gave to parliament it is said that there will be a new tax system, and when it is remembered that a central feature of that new tax system is the consumption tax, on reflection it hardly fits the description of a new tax system.
Not only that, what is pointed out in the Rights of Man by Thomas Paine is that, for the relief of those in distress, money is needed and if that money is taken from those who can least afford it there is an injustice. That is quite clearly the case not only in the 1790s but in the 1990s in Australia. There will be a lot of discussion over the next few months about taxes and there will be plenty of opportunity for me to address that issue again. I repeat that it is not a new tax, it is an old tax going back centuries, and a tax which over 200 years ago was condemned for the defects it had then—and there are holes now.
Another thing I want to talk about is that there is stress again and again in the economic policies pursued by this government and pursued not only by this government but by many people in the corporate sector which requires that expenses be cut, that employment be shed and that the interest that we should all have, according to this philosophy, is in the bottom line and nothing else. That again is not a new concept. I go this time to one of our own great authors, Banjo Paterson, Andrew Barton Paterson, who said in a poem that was published in the Bulletinon 20 December 1890, well over a hundred years ago—
—I like the poem A Bush Christening .
—This is On Kyley's Run , Senator Woodley. I think it is set in Queensland. A lot of his poems were set in Queensland.

"McKiernan, Sen James",ALP,1998-11-25,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I received this document only today and I find it to be an enthralling document, and also one that is particularly useful because of the number of letters that I am receiving in my electorate office and indeed the few letters that I am receiving in the parliamentary office. Let me in the first instance refer to the letters I am receiving. I am grateful for them because they have helped me make up my mind as to how I am going to vote on the proposed 30 per cent rebate for private health insurance.
—You haven't made up your mind recently.
—I note that Senator Macdonald is here. He looks so much like Noel Crichton-Browne it is amazing. Senator Macdonald has prompted me to declare that indeed I am a member of a private health fund. If there is a pecuniary interest I declare it at this point in time.
The letters did help me make up my mind. The fact is that the health funds went to some lengths—and I am particularly referring to the documentation that originated from the Hospital Benefit Fund in Western Australia that was sent to all their members to be sent on to me and other members of parliament—to encourage us to vote for the proposed 30 per cent reduction. I have looked at my own personal private health insurance in the past to see whether I could continue to afford to pay for it. I have examined that and tossed up whether, taking all risks into account, I could continue to support it.
Obviously, a fund such as HBF wants as many people as possible to remain in it. I wonder if I would want the taxpayer to come in with such a subsidy in what is essentially a private enterprise field. That is where this particular report comes to help me, because it tells me that the private health insurance 
 funds are in very serious decline and have been so for quite a period of time. This has all been happening as the contributions that I have been paying as a personal member of the funds have been increasing dramatically over the years. Indeed, as this report tells us, they have gone up by seven per cent in the last financial year, the year to which it refers. That is talking about the funds overall.
Membership has declined. Now just over 30 per cent of the population has private insurance. The Medibank Private fund—which comes up later in the papers list—has actually increased membership in the year. I suppose that might be attributable to all of the advertising that it does and to the $118.29 per person that it spends in servicing each member.	I also note that, despite the dramatic decline in membership and the enormous pressures that appear to be on the health insurance funds throughout Australia, this particular document tells me on page 16:
Management expenses for the year ended 30 June 1998 were $540 million representing a 1.9% increase over the prior year amount.
I find it extraordinary, when the funds are in such diabolical trouble, that their management costs are increasing. If the largest fund is actually increasing its management in a period when the overall fund numbers are declining, where is the money going? How is it being spent? Who is benefiting from it?
My initial thought when this proposal was mooted in the election was that this would be a lovely subject for a parliamentary committee inquiry. After the decision earlier today I am not going to move down that track—I think there are enough inquiries under way—but that is the way I would really like to go: to have the health funds and the health fund directors come in front of a parliamentary committee and tell us how they are spending their money.
I would also like to have Australian Medical Association representatives, who wrote to me today in Canberra offering me some submissions to support their proposal, in front of us and justify the costs that their members charge. I refer in particular to gap fees. People take out medical insurance and pay for the insurance but that does not pay the overall 
 hospital bill. Where does the extra money go? Where do the gap funds go? That is why I would like to see a parliamentary inquiry into this whole issue. (Time expired)

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,1998-11-25,"—As the Senate would be aware, there has been a resurgence of student demonstrations in Indonesia which left 14 dead at the hands of the army and hundreds wounded. Now, with the news this week of Muslim mobs attacking Christian churches and lynching Christians, it is fair evidence to what degree our neighbouring country has disintegrated. Indonesia's economic and political turmoil is a legacy of the Suharto regime. In a short space of time the Indonesian facade, which the Australian government has hailed for 20 years or more, has disintegrated into a poverty stricken country on the political precipice.
It is true to say that much of Australia's thinking over those years was designed to avoid the consequences of an archipelago with the multitude of ethnic communities and religions at war with each other, the consequences of which are obvious. The cornerstone of Australia's foreign policy towards Indonesia over the last 20 years plus has been designed to avoid this possibility. Our foreign policy therefore gravitated to the Suharto 
 regime, which it was believed would deliver a politically and economically secure Indonesia. But, like all good foreign policies based on self-interest, a balance is needed. And on any analysis, Australia lost its balance.
Within a generation, the policy has been shown to be a failure. Australia too frequently turned a blind eye to the corruption and only whispered its dissent to human rights abuses. For all this neighbourly bonding we saw nothing coming—not the economic, social or political collapse. The foreign policy we spent decades manicuring can hardly be said to have built up any useful insight into Indonesia. For all the achievements the department of foreign affairs would claim from their softly, softly relationship over the past 20 years, the lack of achievement has been greater. Just look at today's results. The truth is that the Suharto regime ploughed on regardless, without meaningful political, social or economic reform.
Now that fundamentally the power of the day has gone up in smoke, Australia's foreign policy requires a new approach to deal with the new circumstances. Ironically, given the precarious situation Indonesia finds itself in, a softly, softly approach is more relevant now than it was then. I accept that we must understand the dilemma the new government finds itself in. On one hand, law and order must be preserved and minorities protected from the street rioters; on the other hand, the military presence on the street must be kept from turning into brutal repression. Provided the new government of Indonesia is moving towards major reform, we should understand their dilemma and tailor our responses accordingly. Yet this is no time, nor any excuse, to diminish any effort to resolve the East Timor question. In fact, it has never been more timely for Australia to reassess its foreign policy regarding East Timor.
I urge a reassessment involving a stronger stance for a free East Timor—one that is more aligned to the international community and, more particularly, the United Nations. All the old arguments used to sustain Indonesia's occupation of East Timor are now either well and truly outdated or irrelevant to the emerging Indonesia of today. For exam 
 ple, the claim that Indonesia's invasion and continued occupation has been necessary to prevent a little Cuba developing can no longer stand. Perhaps in 1975, at the height of the Cold War, this had some validity. With the end of the Cold War, the tagging of East Timor as a little Cuba can no longer be justified. Another example is the claim that the Portuguese were `lousy colonisers' who are now just in it for themselves and therefore have no right to reclaim their colony. This has been debunked by the fact that Portugal does not seek to recolonise. Rather, they are pushing for a free East Timor at the United Nations—at the request of the East Timorese.
I believe the following steps are needed to increase pressure on the Indonesian government to accelerate a resolution of the East Timor question. First, support East Timorese participation at the United Nations-sponsored peace talks between Portugal and Indonesia. Second, Australia should offer to play a greater financial and administrative role in the United Nations-sponsored peace talks. Third, Australia should establish a consulate in East Timor which would enhance the monitoring of human rights abuses. Fourth, Australia should forge closer relations with the Portuguese government thereby dispelling the international perception that Australia may have a biased approach to the East Timor question. Fifth, seek the release of Xanana Gusmao. Sixth, maintain, into the foreseeable future, the suspension of military exercises with the Indonesian armed forces. This would maintain the pressure for meaningful progress on the Indonesian government. Seventh, support an Indonesian-Australian inquiry into the 1975 deaths of the five Australian journalists at Balibo. Those responsible must be brought to account for their crimes, as much for the sake of the families as for Australia's own code of justice.
I concede that if Australia were to do any immediate backflip on its foreign policy towards East Timor, it could definitely confuse the Indonesians and, perhaps, even create a hostile neighbour. So I am not asking for a backflip or a great leap of change in our foreign policy. But I believe, for the reasons I have given, that we need a definite shift in our foreign policy.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Indonesia</title>,Adjournment,24,1
