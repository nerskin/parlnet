The PRESIDENT

",Senate,<title>PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATION</title>,<title>Western Australia</title>,PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATION,2,1,speech
"Gallagher, Sen Katy",ALP,2017-03-27,"



Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (10:06):  Labor will be supporting the Treasury Laws Amendment (2016 Measures No. 1) Bill 2016. The bill contains five measures. Schedule 1 relates to Australia's terrorism insurance scheme. Australia's terrorism insurance scheme was established to minimise the wider economic impacts that flowed from the withdrawal of terrorism insurance in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the United States of America on 11 September 2001. The scheme was established under the Terrorism Insurance Act 2003 to ensure continued provision of terrorism insurance coverage for commercial property and associated business interruption losses and public liability claims.


The act requires that, at least once every three years, the minister must prepare a report that reviews the need for the act to continue in operation. Since its establishment in 2001, the terrorism insurance scheme, including the review process, has received bipartisan support. Labor will support this measure, which will put beyond doubt that the scheme applies in relation to losses attributable to declared terrorist attacks using chemical, biological or other similar means. This is in line with the scheme's original intent.


I now move to schedule 2, the public availability of employee share scheme documents. Labor will support this measure. However, in doing so, I note that the member for Chifley has raised concerns in the other place about how aspects of this measure will work.


I also note that his measure was originally announced as part of the government's so-called National Innovation and Science Agenda. It is worth remembering that, when Malcolm Turnbull replaced Tony Abbott as Prime Minister in September 2015, he adopted the term 'innovation' as a catchphrase. But in less than 12 months, when the nation voted in July last year, his innovation talk had fizzled out. The truth is that the Prime Minister was never really clear what he meant by it.


To take just one example that is especially pertinent in the week after we had the 'Science meets Parliament' events, the relationship the government envisages between its innovation goals and research policy is alarmingly short-sighted. We have seen this emphasis on commercialisation in the government's inept handling of the CSIRO. Under two prime ministers and four industry and science ministers, there has been a consistent preference for research outcomes that turn a quick dollar. This is not conducive to the outlook and practice of science. If you abandon basic research, you will diminish your ability to do applied research effectively. The history of science is full of examples. To cite one of the best known: the technology that gave the world wi-fi was developed by CSIRO astronomers studying black holes. A government that understood innovation, research and the relationship between them would have recognised that this narrow focus is self-defeating.


Schedule 3 adds six organisations as specifically listed deductible gift recipients. This ensures that gifts of $2 or more to these organisations will be tax deductible. 


Schedule 4 of the bill extends tax exemptions on disaster relief payments to New Zealanders working in Australia on a special category visa who receive these disaster relief payments. The Australian government makes certain payments to eligible Australians to assist when a major disaster happens and these payments are exempt from income tax, or an income tax rebate is available. The government may extend these payments and the equivalent tax treatment to New Zealand special category visa holders on an ex gratia basis. This bill ensures that, going forward, the exemption from income tax and the income tax rebate are similarly available on these ex gratia payments provided to these New Zealanders residing in Australia.


The New Zealand special category visa is a temporary visa allowing New Zealand citizens to reside, work and study indefinitely in Australia as long as they remain New Zealand citizens. New Zealand citizens arriving in Australia are generally eligible for a New Zealand special category visa, subject to meeting other eligibility criteria. New Zealand special category visa holders generally pay Australian tax because they are Australian residents for tax purposes. Tax relief for those in need is rare from a government eager to hand a $50 billion tax cut to multinational companies and large banks.


Schedule 5 amends the Corporations Act 2001 to provide greater protection for retail client money and property held by financial services licensees in relation to over-the-counter derivatives products. Client money is money paid to a financial services licensee—in this case, the broker—by the client for a financial service. It remains the client's own money, although it is held by the licensee. Typically, Australian financial services licensees are required to keep client moneys in designated client money accounts to which a statutory trust is applied by virtue of the client money regime.


This schedule will close an exception to this for retail clients in relation to derivatives. That exception means that, currently, client money or property held in connection with a product or financial service that is, or relates to, a dealing in a derivative may be used for the purpose of meeting obligations incurred by the licensee in connection with margining, guaranteeing, securing, transferring, adjusting or settling dealings in derivatives by the licensee, including dealings on behalf of people other than the client. The restrictions imposed on the use of derivative retail client money and property do not apply to derivatives cleared through a clearing and settlement facility.


Labor will support these measures on the basis that they will improve the protection for consumers. They will improve protection for retail investors who may not be able to assess the risks of their money being used by the financial services licensee to meet other obligations of the licensee.


While Labor supports sensible measures that improve the protection of consumers in the financial services sector, such measures, on their own, are insufficient. There is more to be done to resolve the issues surrounding culture and practice in the banking and financial services sector.


Just recently we had a report from ASIC in relation to how large institutions oversee their financial advisers. Key findings of the report include: failure to notify ASIC about serious non-compliance concerns regarding adviser conduct; significant delays between the institution first becoming aware of the misconduct and reporting it to ASIC; inadequate background and reference-checking processes; and inadequate audit processes to assess whether the advice complied with the best-interest duty and other obligations.


ASIC also noted:


… many of the institutions we reviewed did not ensure that their internal processes consistently supported the value of 'doing what is right' for the customer. Many of the failings we identified led, or had the potential to lead, to poor outcomes for customers.


Labor believe that the only investigation that can to get to the bottom of issues like these is a royal commission, and that is why we will continue to argue for one. We believe that any systemic issues need to be investigated in a thorough and transparent way. We need to give victims a chance to be heard, and we need to give Australians the confidence that these scandals will not continue to occur. So we will support this bill, including this measure that will improve protections in relation to retail clients for over-the-counter derivatives, while noting that there is a lot more to do.

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (10:13):  I rise to make a few brief comments in support of schedule 5 of this bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 1) Bill 2017, that relate to strengthening client money protection in the retail or over-the-counter derivatives area. This legislation brings Australia into line with global and industry best-practice regulations in handling client money and ensures retail investors are better protected. It fixes an anomaly where investors in CFD and FX products were potentially exposed to losing their funds in insolvencies, frauds or mismanagement as, until now, licensees in this area could actually use client money for their own purpose.


This was at odds with virtually all other jurisdictions around the world and other asset classes such as shares. These reforms provide ASIC with the power to effectively monitor the limitations on the use of derivative client money by enabling ASIC to make client money reconciliation and reporting rules. I commend ASIC for pushing for these reforms. It is now up to ASIC and the industry to work together to implement the new regulatory environment.


I would like to also commend the work of the industry body that has strongly supported and explained the need for these reforms, the Australian CFD and FX Forum, in particular a founder of the forum and a current director, Tamas Szabo, and his team. They have consistently called for this reform for almost a decade now, and the member firms of the forum long ago self-regulated to properly segregate their client moneys. Forum members also took the initiative to form themselves into an industry association with the goal of working with regulators to boost investor confidence. They have formulated best practice standards, had them examined and authorised by the ACCC and now all voluntarily adhere to them. Apart from segregating and properly handling all client moneys, the standards cover communications and education materials, client qualifications, risk management and collateral, trading policy, appropriate hedging and financing, and customer relations protocols.


As I have said many times, the key for better investor outcomes is transparency and regulatory protection to allow investors to educate themselves about and understand the investments they are making, while providing them with a secure regulatory environment that prevents losses outside their control and judgement. Schedule 5 of the bill is another step in the right direction and I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (10:16):  Let me firstly thank senators who have contributed to this debate. The Treasury Laws Amendment (2016 Measures No. 1) Bill 2016 is a bill that empowers Australians to participate in the economy with greater certainty. Schedule 1 of this bill makes an important clarification to the Terrorism Insurance Act 2003 to ensure it provides insurance against a declared terrorist incident, including when carried out by chemical, biological or other similar means.


Schedule 2 amends the disclosure requirements for eligible employee share schemes. These changes ensure that schemes' disclosure documents lodged by eligible companies will no longer need to be made public if all companies in the group are unlisted, have been incorporated for less than 10 years and have an aggregated turnover of less than $50 million.


Schedule 3 of this bill adds six entities to the deductible gift recipient specific listings in division 30 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Schedule 4 provides ongoing income tax relief to ex gratia disaster assistance payments made to eligible New Zealand special category visa subclass 444 holders. Finally, schedule 5 of this bill introduces amendments to the client money regime which will close a loophole to ensure that all retail client money is protected in the event of a firm's insolvency. I commend this bill to the Senate.

Last week the Turnbull government made a submission to the Fair Work Commission on its decision to cut penalty rates which will see up to 700,000 workers lose up to $77 a week.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:00):  I can confirm that you are wrong, Senator. That was not the purpose of the submission. As you know, Senator Cameron, or as you ought to know, the government did not make a submission in relation to the substantive hearing of the matter because we acknowledge that this is a matter for the Fair Work Commission to determine, an independent umpire established by your side of politics, not by the government. However, the government did make a submission limited to the question of transitional arrangements. The submission—and I can give you some information on that submission—was filed with the Fair Work Commission last Friday, and it stated that any final determination by the Fair Work Commission would, and I quote: 


… implement transitional arrangements which ensure the positive employment benefits flow to businesses and the Australian economy in a timely fashion, while at the same time taking into consideration the potential economic impact and effects on employees—


and mitigating any hardship that may be experienced.


So, Senator Cameron, far from the government making a submission of the kind you suggested, the government made no submission on the substantive matter. It made a submission asking the Fair Work Commission, in arranging for and making orders in relation to transitional matters, to ensure that it took into consideration the potential economic impact and effects on employees, and mitigating any hardship that may be experienced. The submission also asked the Fair Work Commission to ensure that transitional arrangements were as simple as possible so that they could be implemented in a way that was easy to understand and to execute by both businesses and employees.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:03):  What we support, Senator Cameron, is the independence of the Fair Work Commission. It may very well be that the Australian Labor Party, as part of its latest round of political stunts, made a submission at a time when the Fair Work Commission was dealing with transitional arrangements in relation to the particular industry which you reference. The fact is the government does not seek to influence those outcomes, in relation to the substantive determinations of the Fair Work Commission, as it did not in relation to the determination on Sunday penalty rates. What it does, though, is respect the Fair Work Commission's independence, as should you, Senator Cameron. We know that you have spent your career in the industrial relations area, so you, Senator Cameron, more than anybody in this chamber, ought to understand the importance of respecting determinations by the umpire, but evidently you do not.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:04):  The very submission which you asked me about in your primary question, Senator,  about transitional arrangements shows that the Prime Minister is doing that very thing, and I read you the quote. Your claim that the cuts in penalty rates go further than beyond the retail and hospitality industries is false. It is false. That is why I said to you, Senator Cameron, in answer to your first supplementary question that this was merely another Labor Party stunt. We know that we live—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, on a point of order?




Senator Cameron:
  My point of order goes to relevance. The minister has gone nowhere near the question I asked. It was in relation to the $50 billion handout to big business and refusing to advocate for ordinary workers who rely on penalty rates. The minister should be drawn to the question.



The PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order. Your question was, 'Why is the Prime Minister prepared to dig in,' and the Attorney-General answered that question up-front, at the commencement of his question. He said that the Prime Minister is not doing such a thing.




Senator BRANDIS:
  The person who is doing the wrong thing by workers, Senator Cameron, is Mr Bill Shorten and you and the Labor frontbench by causing unnecessary concern on the part of workers in other industries. The Fair Work Commission in its determination on the retail and hospitality industries made it perfectly clear—it made it explicitly clear—that it would not extend to other industries. There you go filing a gratuitous submission, misleadingly suggesting that it would. (Time expired)

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:04):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Senators Cameron and Urquhart today relating to penalty rates.


For anyone listening in, if you want to know the difference between a party that cares for ordinary families and workers in this country and a party who has absolutely no concern for ordinary families, look at Labor and the coalition. The coalition do not care about families that will lose penalty rates. The coalition do not care about families that rely on social security. The coalition do not have a bone in their body that worries about the implications of the ideological decisions on ordinary working families in this country. The coalition have an opportunity this week to support Labor's bill in this place to overcome the wrong decision by the Fair Work Commission that will take away from some of the poorest workers in this country—not just some of them but 700,000—and yet Senator Brandis today even tried to deny that they support the decision and that the Prime Minister supports the decision of the Fair Work Commission.


Senator Brandis says that the Prime Minister has never supported a cut to penalty rates. But I say that Senator Brandis should go and listen to the interview between the Prime Minister and Neil Mitchell on 3AWon 17 March 2017, when the Prime Minister said, 'Well, we do support it, Neil, and I've been very clear about that.' That is what the Prime Minister said, and Senator Brandis was just wrong. Senator Brandis is someone who is not unused to trying to mislead the Senate on a number of issues, but this is another misleading of the Senate. The Prime Minister was clear, and he went on later to say, 'The Fair Work Commission decided to back small business and we back small business.' So that is the position of this mob over here. They want to cut the wages of the lowest paid workers in this country.


When you see industrial groups like the AiG, the Australian Industry Group, going to the commission and arguing for cuts to penalty rates then you have to wonder who is next, because the Australian Industry Group are predominantly in metals and manufacturing. They have argued that penalty rates should be cut. As a former blue-collar worker in the manufacturing industry I know how important it is for manufacturing workers to have access to their penalty rates to be able to take home a decent rate of pay to make sure that their kids have a meal on the table, they can have a holiday once in a blue moon and they can take their kids on an excursion or let them go on a school excursion.


These are the battles that normal families have that that lot over there have not got a clue about. Most of them have lived in comfort and many of them have lived in luxury all of their lives. They do not know what it is like to front up at the Woollies check-out and wonder whether you have enough money on your MasterCard to pay the bill. They do not understand that and yet they would cut welfare for ordinary Australians and they would cut penalty rates for the poorest Australians. They do not have a caring bone in their body. 


At the same time they say they will give $50 billion in tax cuts to big business. So it is penalty rate cuts for the poorest in the country and $50 billion in tax cuts for business in this country, including the four big banks, which are going to get about $8 billion in tax cuts. What is fair and reasonable about that? Absolutely nothing. Labor have said in our submission that this decision should be set aside. If you compare our submission that looks after ordinary families and working people with the submission that this rabble of a government have put in, you will see that they are chalk and cheese. We stand up for workers; they put them down. (Time expired)

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2017-03-27,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (15:09):  One of the great Australian attributes is to accept the umpire's decision whether you like it or not. Senator Cameron quoted the Prime Minister on the Neil Mitchell program. Allow me to remind him of what his leader said on the Neil Mitchell program on 21 April 2016. He was asked: 'Would you accept the Fair Work Commission decision in relation to penalty rates if it were to reduce them?' In response Mr Shorten said yes, not once or twice but three separate times. So before the election he supported the right of the independent umpire to make the determination and then after the election he seeks to repudiate that promise to the Australian people.


Let us be clear. Why did the Fair Work Commission make this decision? This is a bench of five individuals, all of whom were appointed by the previous Labor government, headed up by a former assistant secretary of the ACTU. You could not have gotten a more favourable bench to the trade union movement. So why did they come to this decision? They were mugged by the reality that these penalty rates were hurting the really underprivileged within our community—the unemployed and the underemployed. They were also restricting benefits to the Australian consumer and the small business sector. 


Allow me to briefly explain. You see what occurred was the trade union movement, big unions, with big government traded away penalty rates on Sundays and public holidays. That is why big business does not mind the current award system where, for example, a small independent hamburger place run by mum and dad has to pay on a Sunday about $8 an hour more than the multinational McDonald's up the road. Where is the fairness in that? Where is the justice in paying workers less courtesy of a union agreement to the benefit of a multinational and help put the independent out of business?


We do support the decision of the independent umpire set up under Mr Shorten and Ms Gillard's own legislation. That legislation was specifically amended by Mr Shorten to consider penalty rates. That review was undertaken by the Labor Party appointed officials, including a former assistant secretary of the ACTU, and came to a determination which will assist the unemployed and the underemployed to get onto the ladder of employment.


Will they be relatively low wages? Yes, they will be, but that is as was determined by the umpire. Right, wrong or indifferent, when you live in a society based on the rule of law, you have to accept the umpire's decision. In those circumstances I ask myself: is it better that somebody be on a low wage or on welfare? The evidence is overwhelming. The mental health, physical health, self-esteem and social interaction not only of the individual but of their whole household is enhanced if they are in gainful employment. So there is the individual benefit, the social benefit and the economic benefit, which makes this decision of overwhelming good for the Australian people. That is something that needs to be embraced. 


In all of Senator Cameron's offerings in this place you never hear him talk about the plight of those who never get the opportunity of employment or those who are desperately underemployed. This decision seeks to assist those people in that category. They are never spoken about by those on the opposition benches. We on this side say in all these debates that we as a Liberal Party were formed for the forgotten people in these various debates. In this debate the forgotten people are the unemployed, the underemployed, the consumers of Australia, and small business. I invite the Australian Labor Party to put in a submission to the Fair Work Commission to deal with paragraph 3.5 of the Fair Work Commission's decision. I am on the record supporting grandfathering.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2017-03-27,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (15:14):  Yet again we are in this chamber having untruths spoken from those on the other side. Every day that we come into this chamber I am gobsmacked by the arrogance and how out of touch this government really is. When it comes to the lowest paid workers in this country, they have no empathy at all. It is as if they do not exist. I am not sure that they have ever met anyone who actually works in retail, other than being served by them. I do not think they understand the struggle that is facing so many of our fellow Australians, particularly those on low wages that rely on penalty rates.


The untruth that is spoken, yet again, in this chamber is that all of a sudden cutting penalty rates is going to create jobs. What a lot of nonsense! I do not believe that if you are to go out to your local cafe on a Sunday afternoon, after these penalty rates come into effect, your coffee or your lunch is going to cost any less. I do not believe that jobs will be created.


In my home state of Tasmania so many people rely on penalty rates. Under this government, who promised jobs and growth, there were going to be all these new jobs. There have not been new jobs. What we have is a vast amount of Australians, and particularly Tasmanians, who are underemployed.


The Attorney-General, the leader of the government in this place, who represents the Prime Minister, comes in here and tries to back away at 100 miles an hour, saying that the Prime Minister did not say he supported the cuts to penalty rates when, quite frankly, he did.


We should be talking about the facts of the situation. When unions go out and negotiate an EBA, they do that in good faith that they are going to improve the take-home pay and conditions of those workers that they represent. It is not like the minister, Senator Michaelia Cash, who comes into this place and cherry-picks what happens on a Sunday. The reality is that we know there are going to be too many Australians—700,000 Australians—who are absolutely going to be worse off.


When the government finally did put in a submission, last Friday, to the Fair Work Commission, they did nothing to mitigate the circumstances for those low-paid workers that are going to be affected by this cut.


Then we had the Attorney-General today trying to suggest that hairdressers and beauticians will not be caught up in this penalty rate cut. Once again, this is misleading and false. Next you will be trying to tell me that those people who work in the aged-care sector—where we are scrambling to try and get enough people to come and work in that sector as it is, because of the challenges in and the lack of remuneration for the very important work that they do for some of the most vulnerable people in this country—will not be affected. You may come in here and say that, but I can tell you that when you actually go out and meet people—I am sure I speak to more everyday Australians than you do, Senator Brandis—they do not believe you.


I am glad that we are yet again debating penalty rates and that you have yet again failed to address or answer the questions that we have asked of you in this place today, because one thing Australians understand is that this Prime Minister promised so much and has delivered nothing. He has been a complete disappointment. He is a dud. He is a fizzer.


We have heard from Senator Abetz, from my home state of Tasmania, in this debate. I cannot wait for him to tell the 40,000 Tasmanians that are going to lose on average $77 a week out of their pay packet. He has no idea what it means not to have enough money in your purse at the end of the week to pay for your kid's school excursion. He does not know what it is like not to have enough money in your pay packet to buy that last carton of milk before your next pay. The people on that side of the chamber are so out of touch. They are so arrogant. They will not even listen to the community.



I see Senator Bushby there, and I can imagine we will hear just more tripe coming out of the government side in this debate. The reality is if you have not walked in the shoes of those people who struggle, if you have not had to live on benefits from this government and if you have not had to go out and work on Saturday and Sunday while you are missing out on family time then you have no understanding of the real value of these penalty rates to everyday Australians— (Time expired)

"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2017-03-27,"



Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Chief Government Whip in the Senate) (15:19):  When Senator Polley stood up, I was pleased to hear that she was going to focus on the facts. In this postmodern era I suspect that the facts and the truth are pretty unpopular, but I continue to be a fan of the truth and of facts, and I was pleased to hear that Senator Polley also appeared to be. However, then she went on to spend the next five minutes just repeating the Labor Party spin and scare—trying to represent things as happening when they are not happening, and talking about threats to other industries when it has been made clear by the Fair Work Commission that those threats do not exist.


Then, as proof that she is right, proof that she is talking about the facts, she says that people do not believe us. The fact that people do not believe us does not prove anything other than the fact that you are good at spin, not what the facts are.


Let us have a look at some facts. Let us see what the facts are around this decision. The changes will affect around three to four per cent of Australia's total workforce. There are about 1.1 million workers in retail, accommodation and food services who are not on an enterprise agreement. It is estimated by the FWC that between 25 to 40 per cent of them work on Sundays, and not all of those would work every Sunday. So what we are talking about here is maybe 250,000 to 400,00 people who might be impacted.


Under the decision, Sunday penalty rates are being reduced in four industries only, and those industries are retail, hospitality, fast food and pharmacy—four out of 122 awards. Public holiday rates are proposed to be reduced from 250 per cent to 225 per cent for permanent workers and from 275 per cent to 250 per cent for casual workers in five industries: retail, hospitality, fast food, pharmacy and restaurants—that is a subcategory.


This decision reflects modern shopping trends, where many more customers want to shop and more people want to work on Sundays, especially young Australians. Those are facts. They are trends that are apparent and are happening. Workers in industries covered by enterprise agreements, such as those working in the major supermarket and fast food chains are not directly affected. I will get to that a little bit more if I have time. No other industries are affected. The commission specifically said in its decision that it sets no precedent for other workers who work on weekends, such as nurses or emergency workers. Affected workers will still get weekend penalty rates—that is another fact that has been misrepresented—but Sunday rates will now be closer to Saturday rates, which remain unchanged. I suspect there are people out there who, as a result of the spin and the scare campaign that has been run by the Labor Party and the unions, think they are going to lose all their weekend penalty rates. That is simply not true. For example, instead of getting double time on Sundays, casuals on the retail award will now get time and three-quarters, while permanent staff will get time and a half.


As I mentioned, this applies only to small businesses, not businesses that are dealt with under an EBA. The fact is that most large businesses have done a deal with the unions and have put in place a bargaining agreement under which penalty rates have on the whole already been reduced. Thousands of small businesses have been competing on an uneven playing field against those big businesses that have negotiated a highly advantageous bargaining agreement with unions. That means they already avoid paying high penalty rates on Sundays. Once again, let us focus on the facts, not on spin. For example, for permanent full-time and part-time staff on Sundays, a bed and breakfast must pay a worker $10 more an hour than a five-star hotel would pay an equivalent worker; a family chicken shop down the street, a family owned small business, must pay $8 more an hour to employees than its competitors KFC; a family owned takeaway must pay $8 more an hour than McDonald's; a family owned green grocer must pay $5 more an hour than the local Woolworths; a family pizza takeaway must pay $8 more an hour than Pizza Hut; a boutique clothes shop must pay $7 more an hour than David Jones; a family owned bookshop must pay $8 more an hour than Target; a family owned newsagent must pay $7 more an hour than Officeworks; a family owned bottle shop must pay $7 more an hour than Dan Murphy's; and a family owned hardware store, there are not too many of them left these days, and this is probably part of the reason why, must pay $5 more an hour than an equivalent worker in Bunnings. The Fair Work Commission decision will help small businesses open their doors and compete on a level playing field with these large businesses and create more jobs. (Time expired)

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2017-03-27,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (15:25):  I cannot believe what I have just heard from that guy over there. He spoke for five minutes, and he could not even speak about one of the biggest topics to hit the Australian community this year without reading his speech. My goodness me, the Libs must be so proud of your effort.


I want to correct some of the nonsense mentioned by Senator Bushby. I am going to defend the unions, because in my previous life, I, as you probably did too, Madam Deputy President, spent many, many hours, days, nights,  and weekends negotiating enterprise bargaining agreements with workers. The government comes out with this nonsense, asking why someone in a small family owned chicken shop is not paying the same as a bigger business. I will tell you why, Senator Bushby. I will make it very easy for you. Enterprise bargaining has been taking place since 1996. The first EBA I ever did was after I came off the road as a long-distance truckie in 1991. We traded off a number of clauses within the award, all ticked off through the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, because we wanted to give employees the opportunity for a pay rise but also give some flexibility in the workplace for the employers. Remember those days, Madam Deputy President? Senator Bushby, you talk about the family hardware store having to pay $7 more an hour on weekends than Bunnings. Did it ever occur to you that the hourly rate of pay in those big stores for the normal Monday to Friday, for the 7.6-hour spread of hours, is a significantly higher rate? Did it ever occur to you that that significantly higher rate goes onto overtime during the week, it goes to superannuation, it is calculated in annual leave, it is calculated on 10 public holidays a year? Did that ever enter your brain, Senator Bushby, through you, Madam Deputy President?


People on this side have done the hard yards. We have consulted with workers. Whether you on that side like it or not, there are a number of employees, not just the lowest paid but mums who may work on the weekend, while dad is at home looking after the kids, who enjoy that higher hourly rate of pay when they are serving food and drink to you and me. I must say this so that the people in the public gallery can understand: the lowest paid senator in this place is on $195,000 a year, yet there are 30 of them on the other side who cannot wait to stand proudly to drop the rate of pay on a Sunday for some hospitality workers, some pharmacy workers, some fast food workers, some restaurant workers and some bar workers. You are proud of that, Senator Bushby? What really annoys me is that you sit there and you boast about it. To listen, through you, madam Deputy President, to some of the nonsense that comes from over there: 'How dare these workers want to be paid at a higher rate of pay on a Sunday?' It is because that is what they have got.


Senator Abetz said that Labor wants to drive people out of business. What about those businesses that now open on Sundays and pay their workers the current rate of pay? This is what your mates are going to do, Senator Bushby. You may have a restaurant or you may have a cafe or you may have a bar that opens on a Sunday, does its trade and is happy to pay the rates of pay to its workers, the majority of whom may be students. Through your stupidity you are going to give businesses that have not operated on Sundays the opportunity to open their doors on a Sunday, yes, while offering a significantly lower rate of pay than the business who was already doing it. What will happen next is that that restaurateur or that bar owner is going to have to go to their workers and say, 'You know, I was paying double time and I was happy to do it, but now I have these other seven, eight, nine or 10 shops opening in a shopping centre or somewhere around here I can no longer afford it.' He or she is going to say to their workers, 'We've got two options. We're losing business because they are on the Liberals' new rates of pay for Sundays, so we are going to have to either drop your rate of pay,'—and what employer wants to do that? What decent employer wants to go to their loyal employees, who have given up their Sundays to work—and the employer has been happy to pay that rate—and face them and say, 'I've got three options. I drop your rate, I do not open on Sunday or I employ someone else who does.' You know how it works, Madam Deputy President, the majority of these bar workers and restaurant and cafe workers on Sundays are casuals. A lot of them are kids. A lot of them are students working through university. You must feel so proud of your contribution, Senator Bushby. (Time expired)

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT
 (15:35):  It is with deep regret that I inform the Senate of the death on 23 March 2017, of the Honourable Ian Louis Robinson, a former minister and member of the House of Representatives for the divisions of Cowper, New South Wales, from 1963 to 1984, and Page, New South Wales, from 1984 to 1990.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2017-03-27,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:35):  I move: 


That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 23 March 2017, of the Honourable Ian Louis Robinson, former minister and member for Cowper and Page, places on record its appreciation of his long and highly distinguished service to the nation and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. 


Ian Robertson was born on 27 March 1925—92 years ago today in Coraki in New South Wales. He spent all his life in northern New South Wales. Before entering parliament he worked as a dairy farmer, as a journalist and as a company director. His political career spanned an impressive 37 years. He was first elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the member for Cowper in 1953 at the age of only 28. He held that seat for 10 years. His initial political association on the north coast of New South Wales was with Sir Earle Page, the then member for Cowper, who was an early mentor of Ian Robertson.


Sir Earle Page lost the seat of Cowper to the Labor Party in the 1961 election—the only time the Labor Party has ever taken that prized Country Party, now National Party, seat. In 1963, Ian Robinson was endorsed as the Country Party candidate for Cowper, which he won at the 1963 federal election having resigned from the New South Wales parliament after 10 years of service. He was elected as the member for Cowper at the 1963 election, and successfully contested the seat at every election until 1984, when he changed to the seat of Page. There is a certain appropriateness in the fact that Ian Robinson, having been a protege of Sir Earle Page, first represented in the House of Representatives Sir Earle Page's seat of Cowper and then represented the seat named for Sir Earle Page. He continued as the member for Page until his defeat in 1990 in the Labor swing of that year.


A profile of Ian Robinson in the House of Representatives magazine of 18 September 1984 describes him thus, 'Ian Robinson is a strong speaker, particularly off-the-cuff, and says he has always taken the view that political statements should be based on the strongest facts.' If only that were always the case. On one occasion when he was elected, he was unopposed; on another occasion, so strong was his support that he was not opposed by an official Labor Party candidate.


During his 27 years of service in the House of Representatives, Ian Robinson served as Assistant Minister to the Postmaster-General, Sir Alan Hulme. In fact, his appointment to that position on 20 August 1971—after the first reshuffle of the McMahon government following the resignation of then Mr John Gorton as Minister for Defence—means that he was one of the very last members appointed to the frontbench of the coalition government that had served Australia for 23 years, between 1949 and 1972. Of course he went out of office with the election of the Whitlam government in 1972. During the period of Malcolm Fraser's leadership of the opposition, he served as the shadow spokesman on decentralised development, but, with the election of the Fraser government in December 1975, he was not included on the frontbench. He did, however, serve as deputy chair of committees from 1976 to 1983.


Upon his death, the current member for Page, Mr Kevin Hogan, had this to say in valediction of the late Ian Robinson:


Ian will be greatly missed …


[He] represented the community for 37 years with distinction – a community that he loved …


      …      …      …


In many ways he was a mentor [of mine] and I thank him for his encouragement, advice and support over the years.


Mr Gulaptis, the member for Clarence in state parliament, said:


Ian was true blue all his life. He was born in Coraki in 1925 and after a distinguished political career spanning 37 years … he never stopped fighting for country people right through his failing health.


He will be sorely missed by a community he loved …


I never had the opportunity to meet the late Mr Robinson, but it is very obvious, from the esteem in which he is held by those who knew him and from the political career of such a long span that he enjoyed, that he was one of the great old Country Party warriors for regional Australia. They are not a dying breed—we see them today in people like the Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce—but they are a particular type in Australian politics: a type of person who is patriotic, community minded, fiercely loyal to his constituents, fiercely loyal to and beloved of that part of Australia that he represents. So in reflecting on the life and career and achievements of the late Ian Robinson, we reflect upon all that is good in a public life well served and we offer our condolences to his widow, Florence, his family and his many friends.

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:42):  I rise on behalf of Senator Wong and the opposition to acknowledge the passing of the Hon. Ian Louis Robinson, who passed away last week. I note, as the Leader of the Government in the Senate has just said, that today would have been his 92nd birthday. At the outset I wish to convey the opposition's condolences to relatives and friends of Mr Robinson.


A Country and then a National Party member, Ian Robinson served in the House of Representatives from 1963 until 1990 representing the divisions of Cowper and, following the 1984 redistribution, the seat of Page. In his long parliamentary career, he served as Assistant Minister to the Postmaster-General in the government of Sir William McMahon before his time in executive office was cut short by the election of the Whitlam government in 1972. He also served in the shadow ministry and was an advocate for rural industry and regional services.


Born on the banks of the Richmond River in the mid-1920s, Ian Robinson was strongly connected to northern New South Wales throughout his life. Growing up where his grandfather had first settled in the early 1870s, he later resided in Grafton. Mr Robinson was first active in the Rural Youth Movement and the Agricultural Bureau, before joining the Country Party at a very early age.


Variously a farmer, journalist and company director prior to entering parliament, it seemed public service was to be his true calling. He first entered politics as the member for Casino in the parliament of New South Wales in 1953. He resigned from this position 10 years later to successfully contest the federal election. The division of Cowper had been a Country Party seat for many years until it was snatched by Labor in the closely fought election of 1961. However, unfortunately for Labor, Frank McGuren was to be a oncer. He was defeated soundly in the landslide victory of the Menzies government in 1963, which brought Ian Robinson into the Commonwealth parliament. Mr Robinson would go on to win re-election on a further 10 occasions. Upon entering the House of Representatives, Mr Robinson first addressed himself to the subject of Commonwealth-state relations. Whilst he observed that he believed in the rights of the states as allowed for in the Constitution, he was also quick to identify the need for the states to:


… accept more responsibility in their financial relations with the Commonwealth.


He went on to denounce buck-passing between different levels of government and to lament the negative effect this had on national and regional development and expansion.


Cowper was a largely rural electorate and naturally it was primary industries that dominated, in particular dairying—which was the greatest of these—grazing, timber, banana growing and fishing. Mr Robinson argued for greater attention to be paid to public works and rural infrastructure. Interestingly, despite his claim to 'believe very firmly in state rights', he also saw the need for the Commonwealth to 


… exercise more control … or at least have a larger hand in the determination of the overall public works programme.


He saw the need for improvements in communication, roads, education and employment if the potential of primary and secondary industry in rural and regional areas was to be realised. Hand in hand with this went increased investment in steps to increase productivity and he advocated:


… scientific research in co-operation with the States in the field of primary industry.


He also saw a need for:


… special financial assistance to all forms of industry … in regions such as the northern half of New South Wales …


This was to overcome hurdles to economic development in country areas.


In 1971, Ian Robinson became the Assistant Minister to the Postmaster-General. Unfortunately for Mr Robinson, his ministerial career was to be short-lived, as the government of the Liberal-Country Party coalition that had prevailed in Australia since 1949 came to an end in 1972. Finding himself in opposition, Ian Robinson served briefly in the shadow ministry prior to the election of the Fraser government in 1975 as the spokesman on decentralised industry. However, when the coalition returned to government, Mr Robinson did not re-enter the ministry and would instead serve as Deputy Chairman of Committees from 1976 to 1983. When Ian Robinson transferred to the new division of Page following the 1984 redistribution, there was an appropriate symmetry about that change. Sir Earle Page, after whom the seat had been named, had been an important mentor to Mr Robinson and was the last Country Party member to hold the division of Cowper, which Mr Robinson had reclaimed from Labor in 1963.


The 1980s were a turbulent time for the group now known as the National Party, especially as they operated under the shadow of the ill-fated Joh for Canberra push. In 1987, Mr Robinson found himself caught up in speculation about the replacement of then leader Ian Sinclair, touted as a potential leadership candidate sympathetic to a number of disaffected Queensland members. Ultimately, the changing mood of the electorate brought about Mr Robinson's exit from the House of Representatives. Faced with changing demographics in his electorate and criticisms about his own performance, he was defeated at the 1990 election by Labor's Harry Woods. The rise in green issues and green voters was an ill match for Mr Robinson. Having turned up to the opening of the Clarence Environment Centre, Mr Robinson was described by The Sydney Morning Herald's Mike Seccombe as having fitted in 'like a foot in a glove'.


Ian Robinson was a Country Party member through and through. As a representative of the Country Party and National Party in the House of Representatives for 27 years, he displayed the resilience that came from experiences of rural life, where you are not necessarily master of your own destiny. We again extend our deepest sympathies to his family and friends following his passing.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:49):  I rise to associate the Nationals with this motion and offer my condolences to the family and friends of the late Hon. Ian Louis Robinson who passed away last Thursday at the age of 91. Mr Robinson was born in 1925 in the northern New South Wales town of Coraki, and it was here that his guiding values for and understanding of regional living were instilled. Mr Robinson's upbringing contributed to his well-rounded and resilient character which, in turn, drove him to commit so much of his life to public life and improving outcomes for regional Australia.


Mr Robinson became involved in public life from quite an early age, becoming a member of the Rural Youth Movement and the Agricultural Bureau, as well as a youth member of the Country Party—the founding party of what is today the National Party, representing regional interests. From there he moved into roles including becoming secretary of his local Country Party branch, a member of the electorate council executive and a representative delegate to the NSW State Conference and Central Council. In these roles, Mr Robinson developed his political skills, a fine representative of regional constituent issues.


Mr Robinson grew up on the property held by his grandfather since the early 1870s and owned a family-run dairy farm. Before entering politics he spent time as both a journalist and a company director. It was experience beyond the oft-trod path of just being a political staffer. There is a lack of experience that I suspect infects those coming to this place since that time. He was a hardworking man who was determined to change things for the better. In regional and rural Australia, the compliment of being a 'hardworking man' is about as high as it gets, and it is really a terrific descriptor of Ian. He was elected to the New South Wales legislative assembly for the seat of Casino in 1953. He held that until 1963, when he contested the federal electorate of Cowper. Mr Robinson successfully regained Cowper and contributed to the Menzies-McEwen government's record majority government of the time.


Joining the House of Representatives chamber with a confident understanding of how parliament worked, Mr Robinson outlined his interests in resolving the uncertainty between state and Commonwealth responsibilities to ensure a workable system where states accept more responsibility for financial relations with the Commonwealth. I have to say that I am not sure that we have got that completely sorted. It is something that we continue to grapple with in this place today. Mr Robinson in his first speech said:


No matter how sound the policy of a government may be, it is nullified unless there is cohesion between various tiers of government in the country.


He was one of those men who actually ensured that, with every policy, there was an implementation plan to ensure that all of the jurisdictions held up to their particular part of the bargain He then went on to praise the government's investment in primary industry and its tremendous contribution to regional electorates. I am confident that Mr Robinson would be also pleased with my party's and, in fact, parliament's continued investments in the interests of regional citizens.


From 1963, Mr Robinson actively represented the interests of constituents in the electorate of Cowper at a federal level and fulfilled the role as Assistant Minister assisting the Postmaster-General, Alan Hulme, from 1971 to 1972. Mr Robinson continued to represent the interests of Cowper residents until 1984 when, as a result of the electoral boundary redistribution, he transferred to the new seat of Page. Mr Robinson said:


The only way to look fairly and squarely at the development needs is to ensure that representation in the Parliament provides a practical means of bringing into the Parliament the views and the requests of the people in the far flung corners of the Commonwealth.


Mr Robinson's values continue in the practices of the National Party today. We are proud to represent regional, rural and remote interests in this place.


An active member of so many parliamentary committees and a strong public speaker, Mr Robinson was an esteemed spokesperson for the National Party, standing and winning 13 elections, one of which was unopposed due to his renowned strength in representing his rural constituents. Serving in federal parliament until 1990, Mr Robinson had a distinguished career spanning 37 years—10 in the New South Wales state parliament and 27 in the Commonwealth parliament—and proudly stands as one of Australia's longest-serving politicians. Regional and rural Australia is much the better for Mr Robinson's contribution to the nation and our National Party.


We thank him for his remarkable service and advocacy for regional Australia. Our sincere condolences go to Mr Robinson's wife Florence, his family and friends. We are the luckier for him having lived. Vale the most honourable Ian Louis Robinson.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (15:55):  I seek leave to make a short personal statement.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  On 22 March 2017, last Wednesday, I tabled my second reading introductory speech regarding the Banking and Financial Services Commission of Inquiry Bill 2017. In this speech I stated:


IOOF have been charged with insider trading.


This statement is incorrect. This was an inadvertent mistake based on outdated information. I apologise for misleading the Senate.


What I should have said was that ASIC investigated IOOF in relation to allegations of insider trading.

 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (15:59):  I seek leave to make a short statement. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute. 




Senator McGRATH:
  Australia shares with the international community the goal of a peaceful and secure world free of nuclear weapons. Australia will not participate in the forthcoming UN conference on the negotiated treaty to ban nuclear weapons. This approach is consistent with Australia's clear and longstanding position on the proposed nuclear weapons ban treaty. Australia voted against the United Nations General Assembly resolution No. 71, calling for negotiations on a nuclear weapons ban treaty. Australia was among 83 countries that did not vote in favour of that resolution and among 38 countries to vote against it. The proposed ban treaty would not advance nuclear disarmament. It will be ineffective in eliminating or even reducing nuclear weapons arsenals. It would not enhance security. It would have no effective verification measures to ensure compliance, and it risks undermining the nuclear nonproliferation treaty by creating ambiguity and confusion through parallel obligations and by deepening divisions between nuclear and non-nuclear-weapon states.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2017-03-27,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:28):  I rise today to speak in support of this proposal. Let me begin by discussing what is at stake here. We are blessed to have one of the most incredible natural wonders on earth off the coast of Queensland: the Great Barrier Reef. This incredible jewel, this natural wonder, the only living organism that can be seen from space, is a magical underwater world that has brought so much pleasure to people not just here in Australia but right around the world. Indeed, it is a source of wonder and delight and something that we should all feel very privileged to have right here on our doorstep.


Yet here we are, in an age of catastrophic global warming, at a time when we know the window for action is closing, with a proposal for a jobs-destroying, polluting, climate-killing coalmine in Queensland that we know not only will spell disaster for the jobs that rely on the Great Barrier Reef but, indeed, may mean the end of the Great Barrier Reef as we know it. I say to those people who have not seen what is going on right now in Queensland: go and see it with your own eyes. Last year, Senator Larissa Waters and I did that. We went to visit some of those northern reefs, and what you see there is what were once vibrant ecosystems transformed into underwater deserts. You see the corals, which once showed the greens and other incredible hues, completely wiped of all colour and all life and effectively transformed into an underwater desert of a sickly yellow in some parts and a ghostly white in other parts.


Faced with the prospect of losing this incredible natural wonder, something that we are custodians of and should be handing to future generations, we have a government that, instead of acting with urgency, is proposing to destroy the Great Barrier Reef. Today we see evidence of a massive cyclone descending on the Queensland coast. We are going to see more of them if the Carmichael mine goes ahead—more intense cyclones and more extreme weather. That is the cost of global warming. That is a scientific fact.



Government senators interjecting—




Senator DI NATALE:
  We have members of the coalition disputing what the science is telling us. The consequence of the Carmichael mine going ahead will be more intense cyclones and more extreme weather.


You would think that one thing this government would understand is the notion of jobs. There are 70,000 tourism jobs in Queensland, compared to 1,400 jobs in the mining industry if this project goes ahead. We know what the outcome should be. We are now seeing a second, unparalleled bleaching event further south in Queensland and we know that there is hardly a reef that is not affected between the cities of Townsville and Cairns. If $1 billion of taxpayer money goes towards this mine to build the rail to support digging that coal out of the ground and shipping it overseas—indeed, through the Great Barrier Reef—what this government is doing is scandalous and it will trigger the biggest protest movement of this decade.


We have had a lot of debate about the rule of law, but, if people did not stand up when the Franklin was about to be dammed, we would have lost one of this nation's—indeed, the earth's—most precious wild rivers. It was the brave action of many of those protesters, who stood up in defiance of the law, that helped to save the Franklin. We, together with people from right around the world, will make sure that we again commit to standing against this government and against its proposal to ensure that the Adani mine goes ahead. We say to financiers who are looking at this right now: get ready for the fight of your life because, if you are going to contribute money to this mine, you will be faced with a backlash not just from the Greens but from the entire Australian community.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2017-03-27,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Social Services and Multicultural Affairs) (16:34):  It is great to speak after Senator Di Natale. Today, Senator Di Natale—we heard it just then and we heard it earlier in question time—continues with this extremist rhetoric about coal and seeking to shut down an entire industry. The nature of that extremist rhetoric was particularly well exposed in question time today, when Senator Di Natale compared coalminers to drug dealers. That is what he did: he compared coalminers to drug dealers. Coalminers, of course, provide tens of thousands of jobs in this country. They provide billions of dollars in exports. They provide billions of dollars in taxation revenue and energy security for Australians, and, as we export that coal, particularly to countries like India and others—




Senator McKim:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order about adverse reflection on another senator. Senator Seselja has just explicitly stated that Senator Di Natale compared coalminers to drug dealers. That is categorically not the case. What he did was make a comment on the lameness of the argument—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Reynolds
):  Senator McKim, that is not a point of order; that is editorialising. I was listening very carefully to Senator Seselja's comments and I also heard the comments in question time. You are making a debating point, not a point of order.




Senator SESELJA:
  They are very sensitive on this point. It was interesting that Senator Di Natale raised that because, when it comes to choosing between coalminers and drug dealers, the Greens choose drug dealers. They want to ban coal and they want to legalise drugs. We have seen it recently in the policies that the Greens have put forward. Senator Di Natale recently put forward a policy that would see the legalisation of drugs in this country, but one thing they want to do is ban coal. So, when it comes to choosing between those two realities, they choose the drug dealers over the coalminers.


We reject the premise of this matter of public importance. The suggestion that you cannot have a coal industry, as we have seen for decades and decades in Queensland, and a growing tourism sector is absolutely false. Let's go to the figures. Let's see how the tourism sector has done under the coalition government. Let's see how it is done in Queensland under the coalition government. There is nothing like facts to respond to the Greens' rhetoric. Let's respond with some facts. Since 2013, the Whitsundays saw an increase of 36 per cent in international visitors and an astonishing increase of 89 per cent increase in visitor spend—an 89 per cent increase! So we have seen a booming tourism sector co-existing with things like coalmines. That has been the case for many, many years. Tropical North Queensland saw an increase of 31 per cent in international visitors and an increase in visitor spend over three years of 34 per cent. These are very encouraging figures. I am sure the Greens do not want to hear them. 




Senator McKim:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, a point of order.




Senator SESELJA:
  I can feel a point of order coming on. I am not sure what it is going to be about.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Seselja, if you could take your seat. Senator McKim, a point of order.




Senator McKim:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, it is a point of order on the matter I raised with you earlier. I have reviewed standing order 193 and I do believe that it is a cut and dried case of a breach of that standing order that Senator Seselja has just engaged in. I would ask you to ask the President to review the tape of both Senator Di Natale's comments in question time this afternoon and Senator Seselja's quite blatantly inaccurate assertions. If there has been a breach, I ask you to request the President to take the appropriate action.  



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim, I will refer this as requested to the President. As I said, I listened very carefully to what Senator Seselja said and, in my opinion, it accurately reflected what was said in question time. But if it does not—




Senator McKim:
  In my opinion it doesn't.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim, you have asked me the question. As I have said already, I will refer it to the President, as you have sought, and the President can take the matter up further. 




Senator SESELJA:
  If Senator McKim wants to adhere to the standing orders, he probably should not be yelling at you as you are giving your ruling. I think a little more respect for the person in the chair would be—




Senator McKim:
  How about some truth from you, mate.




Senator SESELJA:
  I absolutely stand by what I said. I stand by it 100 per cent. You will have a chance, no doubt, to come and speak, and you can tell me which part I got wrong. Instead of appealing to the umpire, appealing to procedures, which you have gotten wrong, maybe you could come back and tell me which part of what I said was wrong. 



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Seselja, I just remind you—



Senator McKim interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim, you are not helping matters. Senator Seselja, I would ask you to refer all issues through the chair. Thank you. 




Senator SESELJA:
  Through you, Chair, if Senator McKim had a case, he could make it as a debating point, but why would the Greens start focusing on facts now? Why would they change the habit of a lifetime and start focusing on facts? I have given some facts about the tourism spend, so that debunks a lot of the claim that somehow these industries cannot co-exist; they absolutely can. They have done so for decades. We have seen a massive increase in the tourism spend at a time when we have seen a massive increase in coal exports from Queensland. Let's go through some of those facts. They have co-existed, side by side, over the last 60 years. International tourism to the reef grew from 214,000 in 1999 to 248,000 in 2016, in the same period that coal exports from Queensland grew from around 94 million tonnes to 221 million tonnes. So we have seen the growth of both industries. Isn't that a great thing? Isn't that something we should be celebrating rather than, as the Greens would like to do, kill an industry. That is what they want to do. 




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Talk about coral bleaching.




Senator SESELJA:
  I will talk about the facts in this matter. Senator Whish-Wilson, through you, Chair, may not like those facts. Perhaps if there is another Greens' contribution to this debate they could address the fact that we have seen growing tourism numbers and we have seen a growing amount of coal at the same time. 


I want to go to the Supreme Court ruling, which Minister Canavan mentioned today, because again it debunks the Greens' central claim. Their central claim is that, if the Adani coalmine goes ahead, there will be heaps more global emissions, therefore, the reef will suffer and, therefore, tourism will die. That has been debunked by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court of Queensland said: 


… the power stations would burn the same amount of coal and produce at least the same amount of scope 3 emissions whether or not the mine proceeded; if the mine proceeded it would not increase the amount of global greenhouse gases or any environmental impact resulting from those gases …


Again, you have the Supreme Court of Queensland—which is not known as a right-wing organisation—a judicial body, ruling on the facts, looking at the evidence and saying, 'No, actually, the Indian government, on behalf of the Indian people, are going to source coal, and they are going to source coal for their growing population so that hundreds of millions of Indian residents, Indian citizens, can get out of poverty, and so that hundreds of millions of Indians can for the first time perhaps have electricity where they live.' They are going to source that coal. They could source Australia's high quality coal from Queensland or they could source it from other parts of the world. What the Supreme Court found was that, therefore, this will not add to global emissions. But let's for a moment focus on that aspect. This goes to the complete inability of the Greens to have any sort of concern for poverty-stricken people in other parts of the world. 


The Indian government is seeking to drag large chunks of their population out of poverty. It is very easy if you are a comfortable green somewhere saying: 'I want to abolish coal. I want to kill the coal industry. I want to stop these exports, even though the Supreme Court has said it is not going to add to global emissions.' You have got such an ideological fixation as a green that you are prepared to ignore what the Indian government is trying to do in dragging hundreds of millions of people out of abject poverty. Why don't we, for just one moment, put ourselves in the shoes of those people who do not have access to some of the basics of life that we take for granted. If the Indian government could do it just through solar and if they could do it just through wind then they may well do that. They do have solar projects and they do have wind projects. But they have made the very rational judgement that the only way in the short term that they are going to drag these people out of poverty is by having base load coal and other sources of base load energy. What the Greens do not seem to care about is how transformative that would be for those individuals, for those families and for those communities. Just for a moment, take off the blinkers and put yourself in those circumstances. The Indian government is right to try and deliver that for their people. 


We have an abundance of coal. It is, in many cases, much cleaner than coal from other sources. The Supreme Court said it will not add to the overall greenhouse gas emissions. Yet we will be dragging people out of poverty; creating thousands of jobs here in Australia; and continuing to maintain a critical industry for this nation, which pays billions of dollars every year in taxes, so that we can spend money on things like roads, hospitals and schools and the defence of our nation. But the Greens would throw all of that aside, with no regard for the jobs here in Australia, with no regard for the flow-on impact for our economy, completely disregarding that it will have no environmental impact and absolutely oblivious to the needs of people who could only dream of having the kinds of living standards that we enjoy here in Australia.



I think we should see this for what it is. We should see the callousness of the argument that is made consistently by the Greens when they deal with the Adani issue. The Greens' case does not stack up environmentally, it does not stack-up economically and does not stack up when it comes to having some regard for some of the poorest people in the world— (Time expired)



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  One point of clarification in relation to Senator McKim's point of order that he raised with me. I wanted to confirm with the Senate that the President will only come back to the Senate if there is a further matter to raise in relation to the issue that Senator McKim raised.

Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (16:46):  This issue of protecting the Great Barrier Reef but also ensuring that there are job opportunities for regional Queensland is something that the Labor Party in Queensland has been at the forefront of. Labor has a proud record at both the state and federal level—and a better record than anyone over the last 30 years—of taking action to protect the Reef. But we also understand the importance of economic opportunity for regional Queenslanders, and it is the prism through which the Adani project is being looked at.


I understand Senator Di Natale said that he visited the Reef last year. I visited it with my family as well. It was the first opportunity that I have had to take my kids on that trip. I have also spent plenty of time in regional Queensland talking to people who are suffering unemployment at the moment. I dare say that, whilst Senator Di Natale visited the reef, I doubt he took time to go and talk to the people of Townsville who are suffering under high unemployment.


When you look at the unemployment rate in Townsville, it is at 11.6 per cent, and youth unemployment is at 16.8 per cent. This is of significant concern to me as a Queensland Labor senator, and something that I know is felt particularly in those local communities. The effects of high unemployment, with youth crime and associated social issues, are of concern. When you add falling house prices to that—I am just trying to paint a picture of the economic circumstances in North and Central Queensland—you get a sense of the doom and gloom that people in places like Mackay and Townsville are feeling as a result.


To exemplify the importance of this project, you only have to look at the trip to India, a number of weeks ago, by a group of mayors from that area. I know that Matt Burnett, mayor of Gladstone; Jenny Hill, mayor of Townsville; and Margaret Strelow, mayor of Rockhampton went on that trip. I had the opportunity to talk to the mayor of Rockhampton last week about how the trip went, and she was very excited about how successful it was and the opportunity that that group of mayors had had to put their case to the Adani Group about the importance of that project to regional Queensland.


I know that the state Premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, was also on that trip. I had the opportunity to speak to her last week about how that trip went. Annastacia is also excited about the opportunity that the Adani project presents for regional Queensland. Speaking from experience, from a Queensland point of view it is very rare to get a group of mayors from a particular region agreeing on anything! It shows how strongly they agree with this project and its economic importance to Central and North Queensland that they were prepared to make that trip and make the case for how important it is for their region that it go ahead.


It is important to note that the jobs and economic opportunities from these sorts of projects are vital to those communities. The state Labor government understands this. They have been very consistent supporters of the project from opposition and now whilst in government. But the consistent message from them has been that this project must operate on its own commercial merits. I want to emphasise the key point there—its own commercial merits. I have seen similar language used by other politicians as well.


The reality is that, when it comes to the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund, all those opposite see is a boondoggle that they can use to try and play politics and claim credit over local issues. But the sad reality of this is that the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund has not contributed one red cent to north Queensland, it has not created one job and it is a distinct failure by the ministers, and those that have been responsible for it, that they have not delivered anything of note to regional Queensland.


They have form in this regard, because what we saw before the 2015 state election was Campbell Newman and Jeff Seeney trying to play politics with public funds by saying that they would privatise the electricity network, ports and other associated government businesses in Queensland, and they would put some of that money into the rail line for Adani. We saw that before the 2015 state election. As we all know, they absolutely failed, and that government got wiped out. What we are seeing is a re-run of that, where Senator Canavan is trying to use that same rhetoric, saying that he is going to use the Northern Australian Infrastructure Fund to fund the rail line. But, as I said, with the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund, there is plenty of talk, but there is absolutely a lack of action when it comes to using that money.


Let us have a look at the evidence, what we have actually seen, when it comes to what politicians have been saying about the rail line. It is important to note that, post the 2015 state election, Adani issued a statement declaring that the Queensland election result would not influence the company's final decision-making and that the plan to build Adani's biggest coalmine would proceed regardless. When questioned about it, Minister Frydenberg, who was previously the minister responsible, said:


… it ""wouldn't be a priority project"" for funding under the Northern Australia Infrastructure fund. He also said that Adani was ""a commercial operation and it needs to stand on its own two feet"".


That was the line from minister Freudenberg before the federal election last year. What has changed? Clearly, the election result and the government's knowing that it is under significant pressure in regional Queensland. It sees this as a lifeline for it. The evidence from the previous state election is that the people of central and North Queensland, whilst I am confident they support this project, are not going to be hoodwinked by the government into believing that only the government that can get this project up. The company has said that it is not reliant on government funding and ministers have previously said that also, so it is a furphy for the government to look at that.


There is another, more recent quote from Adani in regard to the Northern Australia Infrastructure fund loan. The spokesperson said:


It's not critical. We have obviously applied for it because it's available … This is something that governments of all political persuasions have done in the past and I assume will do in the future. It doesn't necessarily mean it's make or break for the project.


It is important to note this when you look at the mandatory criteria written into the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund Investment Mandate Direction 2016, which state:


The Project Proponent must demonstrate to the Board’s satisfaction that financial assistance is necessary to enable the Project to proceed, or to proceed much earlier than it would otherwise.


So even when you look at NAIF's own guidelines you see there is a real failure in how this has proceeded from an Adani point of view, when it is on the record as saying it is not reliant on this government money. I emphasise that not a single dollar has been released from the $5 billion Northern Australia infrastructure fund, despite the development of Northern Australia being a key election promise in 2013. Those opposite talk a big game, but they fail to get any money out the door. It is no wonder that people in central and North Queensland are losing confidence in this government. The Adani project is the only project that has progressed under consideration at the moment. There are apparently five others, but Senator Canavan is claiming commercial in confidence. It may be that all the government sees Adani as being is a way to make one of its flagship funding programs slightly more complete other than the utter failure we have seen so far.


To rub salt into the wounds, two weeks ago the government set up a regional ministerial task force without one Queenslander on it. So at one level the government is saying that it understands regional Queensland, that it understands the importance of this project, but when push comes to shove and we actually see the actions of the government we see none of that follows up, and it leaves a sad tale.


The other aspect from a regional Queensland point of view is the jobs package that the government promised before the last federal election. Here we are, almost 12 months later, and not one cent has been spent in regional Queensland. I mentioned the high unemployment in places like Townsville. We see similar unemployment figures for the Gladstone area. The government has a really sorry tale of delivering on important local projects that it promised in the lead up to the election. We have seen nothing since.


To come back to my main point, Labor stands by its very proud environmental record in Queensland. No-one has done more to protect the reef over the last 30 years, but we also understand the importance of jobs. But it is Adani that has said that this project can stand on its own merits and does not need government support.

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-03-27,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (16:56):  At every opportunity the Australian Greens present themselves as more extreme, more anti-human, more antiscience, more anti-environment, more homophobic, more anti-Semitic, more anti-economy and antijobs. This motion proves the point. It is extreme. It is fringe dwelling. With this motion the Greens have taken a bridge too far. By coming into this chamber to tell untruths about our Great Barrier Reef being at risk they are trashing the reputation of our home state. I stand in this chamber to defend the reef. It is not in danger. It is healthy, it is stable and it is thriving. Data shows alkalinity, pH values, as randomly varying, naturally. The reef was bleached in 2008 during record cold temperatures and recovered entirely naturally. The Left perpetuates this misrepresentation of the reef, and these lies damage our economy, as tourist operators up and down the coast tell us that tourists think the reef is dead. The only risk to Queensland jobs is the Left.


As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I say to the Greens: your motions actually damage our international reputation. The rot spoken through the Greens motions actually portrays to the world that the reef is damaged beyond repair or should not be visited. I beg the Greens, on behalf of Queenslanders, to stop trashing my home state's reputation.


Arrogantly, the Greens refuse to debate their views, instead they cast their crazy ideas as gospel. Senator Larissa Waters—a so-called Queensland senator—refuses to reply to any request to debate her party's wacky ideas and theories. Just yesterday, the science entertainer Doctor Karl Kruszelnicki refused to debate me on climate science, after a two-hour discussion. He originally agreed but then pulled out. The green movement know they are cornered. Their tricks have run dry. By refusing public discussions they have forfeited. They have lost the climate change debate.


The CSIRO, which disseminates clearly incorrect and fabricated information to journalists, still fails to correct gross errors it has released to the media, which I brought to their attention. The CSIRO refuses to turn up and be kept informed of any evidence that is contrary to the opinions it has formed about climate change. We need debate on the reef, debate on its health and debate on climate, because this science is not settled. We need not suppress opinions that are contrary to what a group of compromised climate academics have been sprouting. Senator Macdonald said we have never had a debate on climate science in this chamber until our party came along, and he is correct. Through debate real facts can be found.


One person who needs assistance with facts is the Greens MP Adam Bandt. He point blank misrepresented and misled Queenslanders in claiming that cyclone Debbie in North Queensland is the result of coal fired power stations. What a laugh. We have had our first death, unfortunately, from Cyclone Debbie. It was a tragic death, and Mr Bandt skips around parliament claiming—wait for it!—the cyclone has been caused by coal fired power stations. It is bizarre, cruel, heartless and dishonest. Who, Mr Bandt, caused the 1880s cyclones? I call out Mr Bandt for telling untruths in a time of tragedy. We Queenslanders always weather storms. We will weather this cyclone and we will do it without puerile lectures from the Greens about closing power stations.


Again, the Greens are seeking to advance their political agenda by damaging the economy of our home state. It is no secret that primary production, in particular mining, is key to our economy. We need coal, which poses no environmental threat, to keep the lights on, the factories working and people employed. Damaging our economy is keen, control-oriented, left-wing ideology. This is the real rift in the Labor Party—ideology. While at a federal level the Labor Party are cosying up to the Greens and are turning their policies decidedly more anti-coal, the reality is the Labor Party state division of Queensland is on a different hymn sheet.


Premier Palaszczuk is running around claiming she support the Adani mine, but at the same time she is desperate to strike a preference deal with the Greens Party. You cannot hunt with the hounds and run with the foxes, Premier Palaszczuk. Either you follow your manifesto and close down coal or you support coalmines and the jobs created. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi: Premier Palaszczuk, you are failing Queenslanders and your fate awaits you at the next state election.


It is Queenslanders who are being sold out by the deals that the Labor Party is creating with the Greens. If Premier Palaszczuk and Mr Shorten were to show they care one little bit about our state, they would place the Greens last on their how-to-vote cards. This motion is the very reason why the Greens must go last. We will call for a return to reality and truth. (Time expired)

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2017-03-27,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (17:01):  Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, does it not say a wonderful thing about this chamber that dissident crossbenchers, such as yourself, can chair a debate like this? I am sure you do it very well.


Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to hear the contributions of all of the previous speakers, but, just out of an abundance of caution, I have decided it might be helpful to put some facts on the record in a calm and considered manner. The substance of this debate is about an application for a loan from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility to build a railway line. An application has been made and the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility is considering that application. The government has not made a decision, and nor will the government make a decision in this matter, because it is a decision for the infrastructure facility. So those in this debate who have sought to betray the fact that the government has already approved or is about to approve a concessional loan through the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility are not correct. It is a matter for NAIF to consider against the rigorous criteria they have to assess all applications for infrastructure development in Northern Australia.


It is worth just spending a moment to think about what the purpose of NAIF is, why it was established and why it is, I think, a very sensible and measured way to northern development. Australians from across the political spectrum have shared a concern that we have not taken advantage of the unique opportunities in Northern Australia for development. For a range of reasons for many years, many opportunities in Northern Australia have not been captured by Australia, and this government's proposal to, in part, deal with that is to establish an infrastructure facility that can fund worthy projects of economic infrastructure in northern Australia. It is not all that different to the infrastructure that governments fund elsewhere in Australia. The roads that we fund, the bridges that we build and the dams that we build are all funded, in part, by government funding. The Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility is just a special vehicle to help ensure that is happening in northern Australia as it should happen.


It is also worth pointing out that sometimes in this debate it is put forward that the potential construction of this railway line from the Galilee Basin is for the Adani coalmine only. But one of the criteria of loans under the NAIF is to ensure that it has multiple purposes and that it cannot just be for the benefit of one company—the applicant in this case. It has to be able to be shared and used by others. Because it is economic infrastructure supported by the taxpayer, it has to be something that is made available generally to those who wish to utilise it. If this is approved and if this is constructed, it will not just be Adani that will benefit from it; other coalmining operations or similar operations in the Galilee Basin will also benefit from it. The Galilee Basin has huge economic potential, which I will come to in a moment.


These loans from the NAIF are made under commercial-like terms. They have to be paid back. Only 50 per cent of the debt can come from NAIF. The other 50 per cent of it has to come from the private sector. That ensures that private sector rigour is brought into the decision making. It is not just going to be a decision of government. It is not just going to be an interjection suggested before a slush fund—or political in its decision making—because private sector financing must also be made available. In my experience, private sector loan makers—banks and other institutions—do not typically put up money just for political purposes, and they do not put up money if they do not expect to get a decent return on it. In effect, these applications have to jump a double hurdle. They have to demonstrate to NAIF that they are worthy economic infrastructure for northern Australia and they have to demonstrate to a private sector partner that it stacks up on economic grounds that there will be a return on investment.


It is worth noting that this application is supported by the Queensland Labor government very strongly, and that this mine has been approved by the Queensland state government and has passed all the federal approvals too. In fact, I doubt there is a mining project in Australia which has been subject to greater difficulties in receiving its permits, not because of anything about the nature of the project itself, but because of the nature of the political opposition to it. Case after case after case has been run by environmental activists who often have no genuine or legitimate connection to the region or the area, but who construct a connection for legal purposes to try and obstruct this coalmine. They have singled it out for particular activism and attack through the legal system, and are taking advantage of the laws as they are today in an attempt to disrupt it, and they have failed. In every instance they have failed. The only thing that they have succeeded in doing is delaying the construction and start-up of this project through their extraordinary legal strategies to disrupt and delay the project, but they have never been successful in any of their legal challenges, nor does it appear that they are likely to be.


I think the truth of this matter is that the Greens are opposed not just to the Adani coalmine and not just to a Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility loan for a Galilee Basin rail project but to coalmining in general. That is their right. That is their view. They are entitled to strongly argue for that case, but they should be honest. This motion should not be about taxpayer financing for a railway. It should not just be about Adani. It should be about coal altogether. It should be about the fact that they believe that no more coalmines should ever be built, no more coal fired power stations should ever be built and no-one should burn coal ever again in the future to generate power. That is an ideological position that they hold; it is one that I do not think is supported by evidence. It is certainly not one that is formed taking into consideration the many nations in the world that still depend on coal-fired electricity, and who will depend on coal-fired electricity for many years to come according to every projection.


The minister, in commenting on this issue in question time earlier today, pointed out that in this century, in just the 17 years we have had in this century so far, there has been a 60 per cent increase in coal consumption. That is an extraordinary statistic when you consider all of the emphasis placed on renewable energy and the growth of renewable energy and the idea that that would somehow displace coal-fired generation. There is no realistic prospect that it will actually displace coal-fired generation for many years to come, so, in the meantime, the coal-fired power stations that exist today and the many more that are being built in countries like China and Japan and India will need to be supplied with coal.


We have a choice before us as a country. Do we want to supply that coal and be the economic beneficiaries of selling our resources? Do we want to supply that coal, which is a higher quality than much of the coal mined elsewhere in the world and which will be mined under much stricter environmental approvals and regulations than anywhere else in the world? Or do we want to surrender that economic opportunity, surrender the jobs and the export income that comes with it? Do we want to surrender the opportunity to ensure that higher quality, better coal is supplied to these coal-fired power stations? Do we want to ensure that they mine in countries with less stringent environmental standards, lower quality coal—ultimately to the detriment of the planet?


Perhaps when the Greens are running the world government, as they aspire to one day do, they will be able to stop coalmining everywhere and they will be able to stop coal-fired power stations everywhere. But in this day and age, all they do is have a few senators here in this chamber in an attempt to influence Australia's politics. So even if they were successful in stopping it in Australia, the reality is they are not going to stop it elsewhere in the world. It will occur; it will continue. It might as well continue to our benefit and to the environment's benefit with high-quality Australian coal.


I want to finish by making one point: we should bear in mind who the ultimate beneficiaries of the coal mine in Australia and of the exported coal are, other than those who will directly benefit from the jobs and investment in Australia. They are the obvious beneficiaries, but the ultimate beneficiaries are the people in countries like India who will be able to access electricity at low costs as a result of this mine. My former colleagues and friends at the Institute of Public Affairs did a report on this issue a number of years ago. It demonstrated that the coal mined and exported from the Adani coal mine alone could bring cheap, reliable, low-cost energy to 82 million Indians. In condemning this mine today, in condemning the infrastructure necessary to facilitate this mine and its construction, you are also condemning 82 million Indians to continue to burn dung and biomass and other low-quality fuels in their homes. You are condemning them to be, as the World Health Organization has found and identified, poisoned by burning those low-quality fuels in their homes when, alternatively, they could be connected to a reliable grid, a reliable energy source, that is much healthier for them, that is much cheaper for them and that is much more reliable for them. That is the choice we face today. There are still hundreds of millions of Indians today, to take one country as an example, who do not have access to reliable baseload low-cost energy. We can be part of the solution in ensuring that they are. We can be part of improving human health, which the World Health Organization has identified, by removing those poor-quality fuels that many countries still rely upon. I think Australia should make that choice. It is a good choice for Australia to make. We benefit from it; the world benefits from it; the poor of the world in particular benefit from it. I urge the Greens to reconsider their ill-conceived opposition to quality low-cost Australian coal.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2017-03-27,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:11):  Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, I share the words that came from Senator Paterson in congratulating you on your ascension to Acting Deputy President. I note that at one point today we were sitting on the same side of the chamber when we voted, and I believe that did as much damage to my reputation as it did to yours.


I find it unbelievable that I would be the one here making an argument to a former advocate from the IPA about what the role of public funds should and should not be. There is a whole host of issues regarding a proposed Adani mine. There is a whole host of environmental issues, there is a whole host of environmental concerns—legitimate concerns I believe. Some of them may be exaggerated at times, but they are legitimate concerns about the possible impact on the Great Barrier Reef and the possible impact on tourism jobs and they need to be properly addressed. Fundamentally though, the bit that needs further scrutiny at this point in time is the role of the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility and the lack of transparency in how it is going about making its decisions. When you are looking at a fund that has been given $8 million, compared to the $23 million that is the Clean Energy Finance Corporation's operating figure, it really makes you wonder how and what processes are being undertaken.


The fact is this is a secretive process, this is a process where there has been a complete lack of disclosure, lack of information; how these decisions are being made are not being made in a transparent way. If we are seriously talking about $1 billion of taxpayer funds being put up as a loan for a project to make it commercially viable, the first question you have to ask yourself is: why isn't it commercially viable to begin with? Why is it the private sector is not underwriting and providing these funds? If that is the case, then it needs that intervention. Ask yourself: should we be intervening in areas and policy areas that we do not necessarily want or need to be encouraging?


There is a lack of transparency in how these decisions are being made. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation has repeatedly come before Senate estimates and, in a very open and transparent way, has answered legitimate questions that should be asked when taxpayer funds are being put up in these types of projects. When it comes to the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, nothing of the kind has taken place. We really run the risk that this just becomes a pork-barrelling exercise for the government to find another way of funding projects, but doing it off budget, off the balance sheet, and doing it in a way that is not realistically feasible to see how this money will ever be repaid. Are we talking about a $1 billion loan or are we talking about a $1 billion investment to a private corporation simply for the purpose of their own project? If that is what we are doing, then let us at least be upfront with the Australian people and let us be upfront in how this decision has been made and how this decision has come about, because I believe that there is a right for people to know.


With the huge concerns over the Adani proposal when it comes to environmental considerations—again, we are not going to have time in this debate or in this chamber now to be able to adequately cover the different debate that is going on around the environmental concerns—surely we can agree that transparency over $1 billion of taxpayer funds is a good place to start. I think the Senate should have and needs to have a much bigger role in getting to the bottom of what potential loan is taking place, especially when you look at the concerning tax arrangements that Adani has used around the world. Frankly, these are things that we should get to the bottom of.


I want to note too that we heard some beautiful words from Senator Malcolm Roberts a little bit earlier. I have to say I was a bit confused, because I thought Senator Roberts had gone on strike. It was exciting to see him say a few words. I just want to say this, because I know the One Nation senators will be listening to this: I completely support their right to take industrial action. I do note, however, that it appears to be a secondary boycott. If the ABCC was being applied to them right now, this would be unprotected action—unprotected action in the industrial sense, not in the other sense—and that the legislation that they themselves have voted on would make the type of action they are taking, the strike that they are on, potentially illegal. We heard from Senator Abetz earlier today: apparently there are some laws that some people—be it Mahatma Gandhi, be it Rosa Parks or be it Pauline Hanson—are prepared to break. I think the secondary boycott provisions are the law that Pauline Hanson has decided she wants to break in the chamber. That is really matter for her. I support the right of trade unionism—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  It is Senator Hanson, thank you.




Senator DASTYARI:
  Sorry, if Senator Hanson wants to break the secondary boycott provision, but that is really a matter for her. She did say it was all in the national interest, that she was not going to come here and horse trade. Trade unionism has a role in the place. When she gets a group of four senators together and they decide to go on strike—be it a secondary boycott or not; be it a law that she is breaking or not—that is really just a matter for them. With that, I note that the two following speakers do have a few things they want to say, and I will cede my time to them.

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (17:17):  I am going to leave my colleague, Senator Whish-Wilson, to conclude the debate. I have only had the privilege of visiting the Great Barrier Reef once. It was just over a decade ago. I was there with my family, with my kids. They were just entering their teens. They were wide-eyed, amazed at the world. We had an incredible time, just like so many hundreds of thousands of tourists and so many hundreds of thousands of Australians who have visited the reef. It is an incredible, amazing place. Last year, we had extreme destructive coral bleaching, the sort that only happens highly irregularly and very infrequently. Then, this year, the bleaching has occurred again. I hate to think what the reef will look like when my children are in the situation of wanting to take their children to the Great Barrier Reef. Even in a much shorter time period than when my kids have kids, we are going to see the death of this world treasure.


What makes me so angry about this debate is the disregard for the science, the fantasy world that so many of my fellow senators live in and the fact that they can be asserting that total fantasy is fact. There are irrefutable facts that are here that are accepted by the academies of science all over the world, which Senator Roberts, the Liberal Party and government senators are just in complete denial about. We know that there is increasing carbon dioxide that is caused in the atmosphere; it is caused by the burning of coal, gas and oil. We know that that is warming our global atmosphere. It is warming the global temperatures and warming water temperatures, which is causing coral bleaching. The science is very clear. It is also causing bushfires, it is also causing floods, it is also causing sea level rises, it is causing crop failures and it is going to cause irreparable dangers to all of us—to all of our civilisations on this planet and all of the species that we share this planet with—unless we take action. I am extremely concerned about the wellbeing of the people of India, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Australia when we are not going to be able to feed ourselves and when our homes are going to be underwater.


We know what we need to do. We have got to stop burning coal, gas and oil. We have absolutely got to stop subsidising the burning of coal, gas and oil, such as is proposed by this government with the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund. If we have got $1 billion to spend, let us spend it on rapidly transitioning to a clean energy future and to renewable energy. We could go a long way with that. That is what would be giving us a future, that is what would be saving jobs, that is what would be saving the Great Barrier Reef and that is what is in the interests of all us—workers and the rest of the species we share this planet with alike.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (17:20):  I reflected today, prior to this, on my first speech in parliament, nearly five years ago. One of the key reasons I wanted to go into the parliament and become a Greens senator was to protect the ocean, focus on marine conservation and clean up the ocean. I refuse to accept that one of the biggest living organisms on this planet, the Great Barrier Reef, is going to be destroyed on our watch. I appreciate that politics, this chamber and global politics, has suffered from a severe outbreak of mass moronity, but I will not accept—for my children's sake and for future generations—that we are just going to roll over and let the coal industry and those too stuck in their ideology not take action on this problem in the Great Barrier Reef.


In the last months I have been chairing a Senate inquiry into warming oceans and the impact that climate change is having on the oceans and our fisheries. Let us state very clearly: it is irrefutable that increasing emissions are driving higher water temperatures and it is irrefutable that higher water temperatures are destroying and impacting our marine ecosystems. My committee, the Senate Environment and Communications References Committee, has heard that Tasmania has only recently lost its 10,000-year-old giant kelp ecosystems that used to stretch from Eddystone lighthouse at Eddystone Point at the top of north-east Tasmania all the way down to southern Tasmania. I was contacted by Mick, from the Eaglehawk Dive Centre, last year and he said to me, 'Senator, if you are going to come diving on these giant kelp forests, you had better come soon' Well, unfortunately, I missed the boat. He appeared as a witness at our inquiry only a couple of months ago and he said, 'They are gone. The giant kelp forests are gone.'


Let me tell you about the similarity between giant kelp forests in the south of our country, in the southern oceans, and the Great Barrier Reef. They are not just reefs and seaweed kelp forest; they are cities underwater for marine creatures, for biodiversity. That is where our productivity for our fisheries come from—for rock lobsters, for abalone, for fin-fish. If the reefs die, our fisheries industry goes with them. Let us be really clear about this: it is not just tourism jobs that we are debating here today in this motion. We have been going into scientific evidence about the impact that warming waters are having on our fisheries around the country. The committee still has other states to go to, including to Far North Queensland. A scientist who spoke to the committee at One Tree Island in Queensland has been there for 25 years monitoring ocean temperatures, and the committee was told that we are in unchartered territories, that no-one could have possibly predicted that we would have back-to-back bleaching events. No-one could have predicted that.


And it is not just the bleaching events. It looks bad because the corals look like they have died. It takes a long time for these corals to bounce back. They are severely weakened by their condition. So, when we get a dump of nutrients into the water and we get physical degradation from cyclones and other systems, it makes it a lot harder for the coral to recover—and that is exactly the situation we are facing now. I watched Professor Terry Hughes on 60 Minutes last night. I generally have a policy of not responding to the idiocy of Malcom Roberts, but I will say to Malcolm Roberts that it was actually—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Order! Senator Roberts; thank you, Senator Whish-Wilson.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Sorry; Senator Roberts.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! I would also suggest that your description of Senator Roberts is unparliamentary and I ask you to withdraw.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I would dispute that, Acting Deputy President, if I could, because of the context. I did not say that he was an idiot; I said the idiocy of his—




Senator Dastyari:
  They are not mutually exclusive.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Dastyari! Senator Whish-Wilson, I do not mean to be disruptive. I will refer this to the Clerk, just in the interests of not reflecting poorly on another senator. Please continue and I will get some advice.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Thank you, Acting Deputy President. Senator Roberts seemed to think that this is a Greens conspiracy theory and that we are out to destroy the tourism industry in Queensland. Well, it was 60 Minutes that did the documentary last night—not the Greens. I would not say that 60 Minutes are exactly an ally to the left and to the conservation movement; yet I have to say that it was actually an excellent program. It nearly brought me to tears watching it last night, I was that saddened by what I saw.


I have been hearing the evidence all around the country of this happening in other parts of Australia. The coral bleaching that we have seen in previous events has also happened in other great reef systems, such as the Caribbean corals off the coast of Western Australia. This is a crisis, and those who deny that we need to take action to prevent this situation getting worse are, in my view, climate criminals. There is other way around that, from my point of view—they are climate criminals.


I have to say that the idea that Senator Canavan can come in here during question time and repeatedly, ad nauseam—with an emphasis on the word 'nausea'—talk about clean coal, which I understand only Clive Palmer is a believer in, as though it is some sort of infomercial for the coal industry, really makes me sick. It makes my stomach turn. I have to be honest that I have found myself in recent weeks getting really angry during question time—as no doubt you have noticed, Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi. I will try to refrain from interjecting, but this issue, I think, is going to be the most important issue for our generation.


Let me tell you—another comment about Senator Roberts—that you do not need proof to be prudent. The insurance industry was founded on the concept that you do not need proof to be prudent; you need to manage your risks. Climate change, under any analysis, is a severe risk.




Senator Gallacher:
  What do the re-insurers say about climate change?




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  The re-insurers are exactly the same concept. Liberal senators came into the Senate today and talked about the impact on India if we do not burn coal and develop the Adani mine. 60 Minutes talked about the reef and, during the week, Four Corners ran a movie, a short film, that is being shown around the world that was put together by ex-US military generals and admirals. They are acting on climate change. It is a really good documentary. It is going to film festivals all around the world. I suggest to anyone listening that they watch it. It talks about how climate change is acting as the accelerator for global instability and that it is the biggest threat to global security. They talked about the Arab Spring and they gave examples of how the sea level rise predicted could, in Bangladesh alone, displace 20 per cent of their population as climate change refugees. That is 30 million people from Bangladesh going into places like India—where, by the way, they have built the world's first climate wall to keep out refugees. So do not come in here and give us all this nonsense about burning coal being good for people in poor countries. Climate change is the biggest threat to these countries—with extreme weather events and wars over precious resources—and we owe it to these countries to act. This concept that somehow it is about jobs: well, I have been and dived off the Great Barrier Reef, and I have been to dive off lots of reefs around the world, and I know that, based on what Professor Terry Hughes said on 60 Minutes last night, the latest surveys on the middle section of the reef show that damage to the reef from coral bleaching has gone from moderately damaged to severely damaged. There are 70,000 jobs in the tourism industry on the Great Barrier Reef. I understand why the tourism industry has not wanted to enter this political debate in the past for fear of talking down their industry and loss of visitations to the Great Barrier Reef. I say to them: 'I understand that, but you are going to have to get engaged and get involved if this proposition is going to be viable into the future.' The reef is still going to continue to be a global tourism attraction. We have to actually act to protect the reef and the marine life that lives in the reef. 


These warming waters are damaging marine life and marine ecosystems all around the country. It is an irrefutable fact that if we do not cut down on our emissions then this is going to continue to get worse. And, as a large bald-headed man who was a singer for Midnight Oil once said, 'Sometimes you have to take the hardest line'. We will take the hardest line on any new coal fired power stations, the clean-coal myth and any new coalmines because someone has to stand up for future generations and our marine creatures to make sure we have a planet that is liveable for the next 50 years. (Time expired)



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Before I invite the Deputy President to resume the chair, Senator Whish-Wilson, during that conversation I asked you to reconsider the use of a term that you used. I am advised by the Clerk that it is not unparliamentary. However, there is a standing order that suggests that we should not be reflecting poorly on other senators simply for voicing their opinions. As the chair, that is how I seek to uphold the standing orders. But you have done nothing incorrect. I merely remind senators that this is a debate of substance rather than reflecting on other individual senators. 




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  If I could just add to that ruling for the record that I was referring to the senator's arguments. 



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Yes, I perfectly understand that, Senator Whish-Wilson, and you are within your entitlements to do that. I am just trying to maintain as much decorum within the debate as we possibly can. 




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Thank you.

 (Queensland) (17:33):  by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the 25th Annual Meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum held in Natadola, Fiji from 15 January to 19 January 2017. I also seek leave to make a short statement. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for two minutes. 




Senator MOORE:
  I was a member of the delegation, along with the delegation leader, the member for Leichhardt, and the member for Paterson in the other place and Senator Williams from here. The APPF is an assembly of members of national parliaments in the Asia-Pacific region, which has met every year since 1993 to discuss matters of mutual concern. Issues the APPF deals with are mainly strategic, economic, social and cultural in nature. The APPF is important to the Australian parliament as a parliamentary association of members who share Australia's region. Key regional countries with which Australia has strong links send delegations to APPF meetings. Such countries include Canada, China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, South Korea and Thailand, and a number of Pacific Island countries, including this year's host, Fiji. 


Each conference is structured around a number of plenary sessions and working groups and a drafting committee that considers a range of resolutions from the discussions. Participating countries submit draft resolutions that form the basis of the discussion sessions and subsequent conference resolutions finalised through consensus. The sessions were under the themes of 'political and security matters', 'economic and trade matters' and 'regional cooperation'. 


The four draft resolutions forwarded by the Australian delegation reflected the interests of the delegation members. The member for Paterson and I took carriage of two resolutions: one on gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls in the region, and the other on increasing the participation of women in politics. Through several meetings, and with the active support of all of the Australian delegation, Australia lobbied for an initiative call for future APPF meetings to include a meeting of women parliamentarians as a standing agenda item. The member for Leichhardt took special responsibility for carriage of a draft resolution on regional and subregional strategies for combatting communicable and non-communicable diseases in the Asia-Pacific region—

THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT (2016 MEASURES No. 1) BILL 2016


SECOND READING SPEECH


I am pleased to introduce the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2016 Measures No.1) Bill 2016, which amends the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989.


A number of the measures in this Bill support the recommendations made by the Expert Panel Review of Medicines and Medical Devices Regulation about improving key aspects of the regulatory scheme for therapeutic goods. 


The reforms reflect extensive consultation undertaken by an Expert Panel led by Emeritus Professor Lloyd Sansom AO, a distinguished educator, researcher and policy adviser in the health and pharmaceutical sectors. Professor Sansom was assisted by Mr Will Delaat AM and Professor John Horvath AO. 


The Review found that the Therapeutic Goods Administration is well respected internationally and benchmarks well against overseas regulators. However, it also identified areas for improvement, particularly in relation to providing industry with more flexible and timely pathways to market; enabling patients to access new medicines and medical devices faster; increasing collaboration with overseas counterparts to minimise regulatory burden; and enhancing post-market monitoring of the safety of products. 


The purpose of this Bill is to make a number of such changes that will enable members of the public to have access to medicines and medical devices more quickly, while continuing to maintain high standards of safety and efficacy which the public expects - and decrease the regulatory burden on industry and on medical practitioners.


The Bill includes measures which support the introduction of new expedited pathways for the marketing approval of certain medicines and medical devices, by providing a regulation-making power to set out the details of the new pathways for priority review. The detail will be set out in the regulations and will include, for example, the criteria for goods to utilise these pathways, how to apply, what fees may apply etc. Such details will be the subject of extensive consultation with industry and other relevant stakeholders before any such regulations are made.


Expedited pathways for the registration of certain new medicines are intended to facilitate earlier access for patients with serious and life-threatening conditions who have unmet clinical need. Expedited review processes will also be available for certain medical devices that are identified as novel, such as a device which represents a use of a breakthrough technology and also meets the criteria of addressing an unmet clinical need. The criteria for these pathways are currently being developed in close consultation with consumers, health professionals and industry. 


Recognising that some important new medicines will be available to patients at an earlier stage, the Medicines and Medical Devices Review recommended that the current post-market monitoring framework in Australia be enhanced through a more comprehensive monitoring scheme for medicines and medical devices. The Bill supports the implementation of this measure by enhancing compliance requirements for medicines sponsors. 


The Bill supports another Review recommendation to allow certain kinds of variations that do not impact the quality, safety or efficacy of medicines to be made through notification. This approach is similar to practices adopted overseas. The Bill provides for regulations to identify what are likely to be low-risk, straightforward changes to product details. 


The Bill also contains measures to support the Review recommendation to allow easier access to certain unapproved therapeutic goods by health practitioners through notifying the TGA rather than by requiring pre-approval. 


The Bill provides for regulations to be made to allow Australian companies to undertake conformity assessments of the manufacture of medical devices in Australia, rather than the TGA or overseas-based assessment bodies being the only ones able to do such assessments. The precise nature of these details will be the subject of extensive stakeholder consultation before any regulations are made. 


The Bill also provides for regulations to prescribe time periods within which decisions in relation to listed complementary medicines must be made. 


These timeframes would be the subject of industry consultation before being implemented in regulations. This change removes a barrier to bringing innovative products to market – statutory timeframes provide a degree of certainty and allow sponsors to plan for the roll-out of a new listed product containing the new ingredient. 


The Bill provides review and appeal rights for sponsors seeking approval for the use of a new ingredient in listed medicines. 


The Bill includes measures to support the intent of other Review recommendations in relation to consolidating TGA advisory committees. A number of minor amendments in the Bill aim principally to achieve greater consistency between the regulation of different types of therapeutic goods and to reduce health risks to the public. 


TREASURY LAWS AMENDMENT (ENTERPRISE TAX PLAN) BILL 2016


SECOND READING SPEECH


This Bill forms a key component of the Government's reform agenda to improve Australia's tax system for businesses.


These actions will provide the encouragement needed for Australian businesses to grow and create jobs.


The amendments contained within this Bill provide much needed support to businesses by: 


immediately reducing the tax rate to 27.5% for 870,000 businesses with turnover of up to $10 million and who employ 3.4 million Australians; 


reducing the company tax rate for all businesses to 25 per cent by 2026-27;


increasing the unincorporated tax discount for small businesses from 5 per cent to 16 per cent by 2026-27; and 


increasing turnover thresholds so that more businesses can access lower tax rates.


These amendments will enable Australian businesses to reinvest more of their earnings in employing more Australians and growing their businesses – this will benefit all Australians. 


This will drive investment, allowing us to keep our living standards high and improve wages. 


Since 2001, Australia has gone from having one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the world to now offering one of the highest. There are only five advanced countries with higher corporate tax rates than Australia. 


This Bill therefore is an important step for Australia – it will allow Australian businesses to once again be globally competitive. It will assist our businesses to succeed both at home and internationally. And it will encourage businesses to remain in, or relocate to, Australia.


We are improving the tax system for business and better aligning it with a culture of business investment and development to foster jobs and growth. 


As productivity rises, more than half the economic benefits of a lower company tax rate will go to workers in the form of higher real wages. 


Complementary Government initiatives will ensure businesses are not able to avoid paying tax and are required to pay their fair share. Whilst the Government is keen to support businesses with lower taxes, those businesses which seek to pay no tax will be caught and punished. Initiatives include tougher rules for multinationals that shift profits offshore, enhancing the ATO's enforcement capabilities, and changes to improve corporate transparency. 


We are also making sure that small businesses, that is 96 per cent of all businesses in Australia, improve their cash flow and reinvest in their business, should they choose to do so. 


Small and medium businesses are the prime drivers of jobs and growth in our economy. They are also overwhelmingly Australian owned and more likely to reinvest their earnings in future growth as they seek to build their businesses.


A tax on their business is a tax on their enterprise which ends up being a tax on the jobs that they create. A national economic plan for jobs and growth must back these businesses. When they invest and grow, we all win. 


These are some of the businesses I have been visiting since I have become Treasurer, which will benefit from the changes put forward by this Bill:


The precision engineering business in Adelaide that is successfully transitioning from the decline in the automotive industry to new clients in the electrical industry. 


The chocolatier in Emu Plains, the cheese maker on the Mornington Peninsular and honey producer in Launceston that are expanding their business into new Asian markets.


The engineering company in Berwick and the circuit board manufacturer in Queanbeyan who form part of the national defence industry supply chain.


The electrical contracting business from Seven Hills started by migrants from Eastern Europe and Lebanon, during a recession in nineties, now employing a young refugee from Nepal, who came through our formal humanitarian programme. 


The truck repair business in Burnie and the tyre retailer and auto repairer in the Adelaide Hills that want to take on new apprentices.


The sports floor manufacturer from Somersby on the Central Coast who built the courts for the Netball World Cup, is building them for the Commonwealth Games and rebuilt the floors and staging here at the National Press Club.


The Bridgestone Select Tyre & Auto franchisee in Perth bought less than a year ago but their turnover is already $2 million.


They are all small, family businesses. They are all growing and looking to employ more Australians.


Our economic plan, which this Bill is part of, does not punish these businesses for growing. 


We do not believe that they become multinationals when their turnover increases to more than $2 million and neither do they. The prize for their growth should not be a higher tax rate. 


That is why this Government supports the introduction of this Bill to bring down taxes for Australian businesses.


I will now turn to the specifics of the Bill. 


Schedule 1 to this Bill amends the Tax Rates Act 1986 to reduce the company tax rate. 


In the 2016-17 income year, businesses with turnover below $10 million will face a tax rate of 27.5 per cent. The turnover threshold to qualify for the lower tax rate will be raised to $25 million in 2017-18, $50 million in 2018-19, $100 million in 2019-20, $250 million in 2020-21, $500 million in 2021-22, $1 billion in 2022-23 and removed entirely in 2023-24. 


The corporate tax rate for all companies will then be progressively cut to 27 per cent in 2024-25 and by one percentage point in each subsequent year until the corporate tax rate reaches 25 per cent in 2026-27.


Schedule 4 to this Bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to align the maximum rate for the distribution of franking credits to be consistent with the rate of tax faced by the company making the distribution.


Schedule 5 to this Bill makes consequential amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Assessment Act1997 to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate.


Schedule 2 to this Bill increases the small business unincorporated income tax discount to 16 per cent from the 2026-27 income year. In the 2025-26 income year and earlier income years, a lower rate will apply.


For the 2016-17 to 2023-24 income years, the unincorporated tax discount will be 8 per cent. 


For the 2024-25 income year, the discount will be 10 per cent. For the 2025-26 income year, the discount will be 13 per cent. 


The tax discount will continue to be capped at $1,000 per year.


Providing unincorporated small businesses with a reduced rate of tax improves their cash flow and enables them to retain more earnings, which can be reinvested into their business. It also ensures that small businesses benefit from a reduced rate of tax regardless of whether they are operated as companies, sole traders, partnerships or trusts.


Schedule 3 to this Bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act1997 to increase the aggregated turnover threshold for access to many small business tax concessions to $10 million. 


The aggregated turnover threshold for access to the unincorporated small business income tax discount will be increased to $5 million, and the current aggregated turnover threshold of $2 million will be retained for the small business capital gains tax concessions. 


More than 90,000 additional small businesses will be able to access a range of small business concessions. These include simplified trading stock rules, a simplified method of calculating Pay-As-You-Go instalments by the Australian Taxation Office and the option to account for GST on a cash basis and pay GST instalments as calculated by the Tax Office.


On average, smaller businesses face higher costs of complying with their regulatory obligations as a proportion of their turnover and income, compared to larger businesses. 


Eligible businesses can use the small business concessions to reduce their tax liability and compliance costs and improve their cash flow.


Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum.


Debate adjourned.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (17:47):  Prior to question time, I was speaking about Apple and how, through Apple Sales International and a tax haven in Ireland, it can get away with an average tax rate of just four per cent. The huge multinationals Facebook and Google seem no different. Although Google earned an estimated $2.5 billion in income from local Australian online advertising in 2015, it only declared revenue in Australia of one-fifth of that. Google paid just $16 million of tax that year, a paltry 0.64 per cent of its estimated revenue of $2.5 billion. This means that Google is only paying $1 in tax for every $157 they earn in revenue. This is a tax rate that any person in this chamber, and certainly any Australian, would either be envious of or appalled by, or maybe a bit of both. It is wrong, and it needs to change. Facebook Australia is wholly owned by Facebook, its parent company in the United States. By market capitalisation, Facebook is a $400 billion company, and it makes more than $1 billion in profit every three months.


These figures are absolutely staggering in their size. Yet, in 2015, Facebook Australia's gross revenue figures were reported to be a measly $33.5 million. Investment bank Morgan Stanley estimated that Facebook Australia actually earned between $500 million and $600 million from advertising in our country in 2015, yet Facebook Australia only paid $814,000 in tax. Many would find that absolutely disgraceful. 


Facebook, Google, Apple and a plethora of other multinationals are absolutely dudding the Australian people. So, what can we do? Well, a diverted profits tax is an important reform to ensure companies in sectors like high-tech and pharmaceuticals are not able to shift profits offshore by using schemes like having inflated charges for their intellectual property located in low- or no-tax jurisdictions. This deals with that intellectual property being based offshore in order to avoid paying tax.


When it comes to a company like Facebook, we have another problem—one that will not be dealt with by the diverted profits tax, and one that ought to be dealt with sooner rather than later. This applies to Google as well. That is a business model where local news content is being overtaken by news content hosted and driven by an offshore company, where that offshore company does not have to follow the same rules and regulations, such as local media content standards, as onshore-based news content makers and distributors. Effectively, these companies can cannibalise Australian media content paid for by Australian media companies employing journalists, whether it is TheGuardian, News Limited, Fairfax, the television networks and a whole range of other media companies that have a strong Australian presence here; and whether they are locally owned or overseas offshoots of media companies that do provide a lot of local content, such as Guardian Australia, BuzzFeed and Huffington Post. 


We need to level the playing field, and one way that can be done is to have a withholding tax that is targeted at the revenue generated by online news content makers and distributors operating in Australia but based offshore. I note that the European Union is now looking at changing modern EU copyright rules for European culture to flourish and circulate, and we ought to look at what is happening there. The European Commission's press release issued out of Strasbourg on 14 September 2016 indicates the level of concern that the Europeans have in relation to this. Any withholding tax should be set at a rate that means these companies are making a payment on the revenue they generate and will have a sufficient amount to be able to cover their costs and still have a reasonable profit, but they need to be transparent about it. This is something that is posing an existential threat to Australian media in this country. If the withholding tax is at too high a level in a year, then the company can apply to the ATO to demonstrate that, and be able to gain a refund so that they are not having the withholding tax eliminate their profit altogether or even eat into the revenue needed to pay for their costs.


The reason why this is not covered by regular corporate tax is that this is not revenue going to their Australian arm, so regular corporate tax will not capture the profits made by the company. The reason why this may not be captured by the diverted profits tax is that this is likely to be a regular transaction—in other words, it is not one designed to avoid paying tax on their profits in Australia but a genuine transaction by customers to their offshore company.


When you consider that, for every new online advertising dollar, 90c of that is going to Facebook and Google, that is almost a duopoly the likes of which Coles and Woolworths would be envious of. That is something that needs to be dealt with. It cannot be dealt with in the context of this bill. It ought to be dealt with in the context of media reform laws in this country, but it is indicative of the approach in this bill that there may be a useful way forward, looking at the approach that the government has had in respect of the diverted profits tax.


These measures in this legislation are an important step in the right direction. They are a step towards ensuring that everyone who directly benefits from the Australian economy pays their fair share of tax so that those who do the right thing do not have to bear an unfair burden compared to those who do not.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2017-03-27,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (17:53):  Firstly, I would like to thank those senators who have contributed to the debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Bill 2017 and the Diverted Profits Tax Bill 2017. The legislation continues the government's strong stance against multinational tax avoidance. It implements three new measures announced in the government's 2016 budget. Most taxpayers, of course, comply with Australia's tax rules and pay the right amount of tax. However, there are some who do not. There are some who try to avoid paying Australian tax by diverting Australian profits to low-tax countries. The measures in this legislation will help ensure that the Australian tax payable by significant global entities properly reflects the economic substance of the activities that those entities carry on. This legislation also encourages multinationals to provide relevant information and cooperate with the ATO to ensure faster resolution of tax disputes.


The diverted profits tax will strengthen Australia's anti-avoidance rules and complement our transfer pricing rules by targeting multinationals who enter into agreements with offshore related parties that lack economic substance to avoid Australian tax by diverting profits to lower tax countries. It is expected that the diverted profits tax will apply in very limited circumstances. Most companies do the right thing and meet their tax obligations. The diverted profits tax is focused on tax avoidance arrangements that are artificial or contrived.


The diverted profits tax will, firstly, allow the commissioner to impose the diverted profits tax on the basis of a reasonable assessment of the available information and, secondly, impose an up-front tax liability payable on the amount of the diverted profits at a penalty rate of 40 per cent. Thirdly, where a multinational challenges a diverted profits tax assessment through an appeal to the Federal Court of Australia, it will generally be unable to introduce information that was not previously made available to the ATO.


We will also introduce tough penalties for multinationals who fail to comply with their tax-reporting obligations. From 1 July 2017, large multinationals that breach their tax-reporting obligations will now face penalties of $525,000 rather than $5,250. The increase is much more in line with the financial size and capacity of large multinationals and will provide greater incentive to comply with their tax-reporting obligations.


The transfer pricing rules will also be updated to give effect to the 2015 OECD transfer pricing recommendations. These changes will ensure that our transfer pricing rules remain in line with international best practice and, together with the diverted profits tax, will help ensure that profits made in Australia are taxed in Australia.


These changes also send a clear message to multinationals and the international tax community that Australia is absolutely committed to combating multinational tax avoidance. We continue to be a leader on the world stage in this regard. We have been at the forefront of international progress in implementing the OECD's base erosion and profit-shifting agenda. We have been an early adopter of the Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and are taking steps to ensure that our rules not only comply with our agreed minimum standards but are effective across all BEPS issues. We continue to implement the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Package and are currently progressing work on new rules to enhance the ATO's ability to detect tax avoidance by requiring advisers to report aggressive tax schemes to the ATO.


The government is taking a strong and world-leading but balanced approach to multinational tax avoidance. The Turnbull government has said that enough is enough when it comes to multinationals diverting profits offshore and failing to meet their tax disclosure responsibilities. I commend this legislation to the Senate.

I just want to briefly speak to this and ask Senator Cormann a couple of very quick questions. I understand that the current threshold of diverted tax that the ATO commissioner will use is 20 per cent of diverted tax. My question, Senator Cormann, is: why was 20 per cent chosen? I understand that the commissioner still has discretion, even at 20 per cent or above, as to whether they will pursue a tax ruling or an investigation, if you like.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (17:59):  It was chosen, firstly, based on the consultation and, secondly, because this is following the precedent that was set in the United Kingdom in their equivalent diverted profits tax scheme. The view is that, if you capture more, you end up tying up the ATO in audits and investigations in relation to lower risk businesses. We want to focus, obviously, at the right end and we want to make sure that the scheme is properly targeted. But the short answer is: it is based on consultation and it is based on what was chosen in the United Kingdom, where this measure was introduced a while ago.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:00):  From what I understand you have just said, the 20 per cent threshold was chosen because it was in the UK bill, which is often called the Google tax. I think that was the first of its kind in the world. The threshold that the Greens propose to introduce is a lower threshold so that, if 10 per cent or more of tax has been diverted or the ATO suspects it has been diverted, it can choose to begin an investigation or seek redress. I note that, whether it is 20 per cent or 10 per cent, or even 50 per cent, the commissioner has discretion. No doubt they will use that discretion based on risk return and what they expect to gain from the investigation versus the costs of that investigation and the opportunity cost more broadly. I understand that, even at 20 per cent diverted profit, the commissioner is not guaranteed that they will seek investigation.


We have been speaking to our own stakeholders and we believe a 10 per cent threshold is more appropriate considering that there is still discretion as to whether the commissioner will pursue an investigation. Could you clarify for me, Minister, whether it is the case under the current 20 per cent provision that the ATO commissioner has discretion as to whether they will pursue an investigation or whether they actually have to if they believe 20 per cent or more of tax has been diverted.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:02):  My clear advice is that the tax commissioner does not have the discretion that you are suggesting. Why don't I talk you through the reasons the government is opposing your amendment. The government does not support increasing the foreign taxes carve-out from at least 80 per cent to at least 90 per cent of Australian taxes paid, firstly, because we have extensively consulted on this and we believe that we have the right balance here. It is, of course, the precedent in most countries and specifically the UK, which was the first to legislate this diverted profits tax and has the equivalent 80 per cent threshold in its legislation.


This amendment is a bit of policy on the run, we suggest. Increasing the carve-out will not actually help us fight tax avoidance. The companies that the tax office and Treasury have identified as the greatest risk are those companies that are paying 80 per cent or less of the company taxes they would be paying had they been recognising the profit in Australia. Increasing the test to 90 per cent would bring in lower risk companies that are doing the right thing. It would increase compliance costs for the Australian Taxation Office and mean their audit processes would be less targeted. It would also increase the cost of compliance for businesses doing the right thing and reduce business certainty and confidence.


The other point that I would make in response to the issues raised by Senator Whish-Wilson is that it is important to remember that transfer pricing rules will still apply, that the general anti-avoidance provisions will still apply and that this comes over and above all of the other anti-avoidance measures that are already enshrined in our relevant tax laws.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (17:47):  Prior to question time, I was speaking about Apple and how, through Apple Sales International and a tax haven in Ireland, it can get away with an average tax rate of just four per cent. The huge multinationals Facebook and Google seem no different. Although Google earned an estimated $2.5 billion in income from local Australian online advertising in 2015, it only declared revenue in Australia of one-fifth of that. Google paid just $16 million of tax that year, a paltry 0.64 per cent of its estimated revenue of $2.5 billion. This means that Google is only paying $1 in tax for every $157 they earn in revenue. This is a tax rate that any person in this chamber, and certainly any Australian, would either be envious of or appalled by, or maybe a bit of both. It is wrong, and it needs to change. Facebook Australia is wholly owned by Facebook, its parent company in the United States. By market capitalisation, Facebook is a $400 billion company, and it makes more than $1 billion in profit every three months.


These figures are absolutely staggering in their size. Yet, in 2015, Facebook Australia's gross revenue figures were reported to be a measly $33.5 million. Investment bank Morgan Stanley estimated that Facebook Australia actually earned between $500 million and $600 million from advertising in our country in 2015, yet Facebook Australia only paid $814,000 in tax. Many would find that absolutely disgraceful. 


Facebook, Google, Apple and a plethora of other multinationals are absolutely dudding the Australian people. So, what can we do? Well, a diverted profits tax is an important reform to ensure companies in sectors like high-tech and pharmaceuticals are not able to shift profits offshore by using schemes like having inflated charges for their intellectual property located in low- or no-tax jurisdictions. This deals with that intellectual property being based offshore in order to avoid paying tax.


When it comes to a company like Facebook, we have another problem—one that will not be dealt with by the diverted profits tax, and one that ought to be dealt with sooner rather than later. This applies to Google as well. That is a business model where local news content is being overtaken by news content hosted and driven by an offshore company, where that offshore company does not have to follow the same rules and regulations, such as local media content standards, as onshore-based news content makers and distributors. Effectively, these companies can cannibalise Australian media content paid for by Australian media companies employing journalists, whether it is TheGuardian, News Limited, Fairfax, the television networks and a whole range of other media companies that have a strong Australian presence here; and whether they are locally owned or overseas offshoots of media companies that do provide a lot of local content, such as Guardian Australia, BuzzFeed and Huffington Post. 


We need to level the playing field, and one way that can be done is to have a withholding tax that is targeted at the revenue generated by online news content makers and distributors operating in Australia but based offshore. I note that the European Union is now looking at changing modern EU copyright rules for European culture to flourish and circulate, and we ought to look at what is happening there. The European Commission's press release issued out of Strasbourg on 14 September 2016 indicates the level of concern that the Europeans have in relation to this. Any withholding tax should be set at a rate that means these companies are making a payment on the revenue they generate and will have a sufficient amount to be able to cover their costs and still have a reasonable profit, but they need to be transparent about it. This is something that is posing an existential threat to Australian media in this country. If the withholding tax is at too high a level in a year, then the company can apply to the ATO to demonstrate that, and be able to gain a refund so that they are not having the withholding tax eliminate their profit altogether or even eat into the revenue needed to pay for their costs.


The reason why this is not covered by regular corporate tax is that this is not revenue going to their Australian arm, so regular corporate tax will not capture the profits made by the company. The reason why this may not be captured by the diverted profits tax is that this is likely to be a regular transaction—in other words, it is not one designed to avoid paying tax on their profits in Australia but a genuine transaction by customers to their offshore company.


When you consider that, for every new online advertising dollar, 90c of that is going to Facebook and Google, that is almost a duopoly the likes of which Coles and Woolworths would be envious of. That is something that needs to be dealt with. It cannot be dealt with in the context of this bill. It ought to be dealt with in the context of media reform laws in this country, but it is indicative of the approach in this bill that there may be a useful way forward, looking at the approach that the government has had in respect of the diverted profits tax.


These measures in this legislation are an important step in the right direction. They are a step towards ensuring that everyone who directly benefits from the Australian economy pays their fair share of tax so that those who do the right thing do not have to bear an unfair burden compared to those who do not.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (17:53):  Firstly, I would like to thank those senators who have contributed to the debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Bill 2017 and the Diverted Profits Tax Bill 2017. The legislation continues the government's strong stance against multinational tax avoidance. It implements three new measures announced in the government's 2016 budget. Most taxpayers, of course, comply with Australia's tax rules and pay the right amount of tax. However, there are some who do not. There are some who try to avoid paying Australian tax by diverting Australian profits to low-tax countries. The measures in this legislation will help ensure that the Australian tax payable by significant global entities properly reflects the economic substance of the activities that those entities carry on. This legislation also encourages multinationals to provide relevant information and cooperate with the ATO to ensure faster resolution of tax disputes.


The diverted profits tax will strengthen Australia's anti-avoidance rules and complement our transfer pricing rules by targeting multinationals who enter into agreements with offshore related parties that lack economic substance to avoid Australian tax by diverting profits to lower tax countries. It is expected that the diverted profits tax will apply in very limited circumstances. Most companies do the right thing and meet their tax obligations. The diverted profits tax is focused on tax avoidance arrangements that are artificial or contrived.


The diverted profits tax will, firstly, allow the commissioner to impose the diverted profits tax on the basis of a reasonable assessment of the available information and, secondly, impose an up-front tax liability payable on the amount of the diverted profits at a penalty rate of 40 per cent. Thirdly, where a multinational challenges a diverted profits tax assessment through an appeal to the Federal Court of Australia, it will generally be unable to introduce information that was not previously made available to the ATO.


We will also introduce tough penalties for multinationals who fail to comply with their tax-reporting obligations. From 1 July 2017, large multinationals that breach their tax-reporting obligations will now face penalties of $525,000 rather than $5,250. The increase is much more in line with the financial size and capacity of large multinationals and will provide greater incentive to comply with their tax-reporting obligations.


The transfer pricing rules will also be updated to give effect to the 2015 OECD transfer pricing recommendations. These changes will ensure that our transfer pricing rules remain in line with international best practice and, together with the diverted profits tax, will help ensure that profits made in Australia are taxed in Australia.


These changes also send a clear message to multinationals and the international tax community that Australia is absolutely committed to combating multinational tax avoidance. We continue to be a leader on the world stage in this regard. We have been at the forefront of international progress in implementing the OECD's base erosion and profit-shifting agenda. We have been an early adopter of the Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and are taking steps to ensure that our rules not only comply with our agreed minimum standards but are effective across all BEPS issues. We continue to implement the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Package and are currently progressing work on new rules to enhance the ATO's ability to detect tax avoidance by requiring advisers to report aggressive tax schemes to the ATO.


The government is taking a strong and world-leading but balanced approach to multinational tax avoidance. The Turnbull government has said that enough is enough when it comes to multinationals diverting profits offshore and failing to meet their tax disclosure responsibilities. I commend this legislation to the Senate.

Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (21:50):  I wanted to spend some time this evening raising an issue that has stunned the people of the Northern Territory. I have been reading through the Commonwealth Grants Commission: report on GST revenue sharing relativities 2016 update, particularly in terms of what is going to happen in the Northern Territory. This has created a real concern for not only the Northern Territory government but the people right across the Territory about truly understanding what this means. 


The Northern Territory is a big place. It is over 135 million hectares. Only about 245,000 people live there. In fact, our population density is one person for every five square kilometres. The reality of life for many Territorians is a life in remote areas. The Territory is certainly a wonderful place to live but not an inexpensive place to live and raise your family. Territorians take these challenges in their stride: living out bush in remote areas, where kids have to move thousands of kilometres away from home to go to high school; relying on the Royal Flying Doctor Service for emergency medical services; and the cost of living.


Now this government has just dealt the Territory a very savage, budget heavy hit—a $2 billion cut to our GST revenues over the next four years. This is an unprecedented cut to the Northern Territory's budget. Let me be clear: the Northern Territory has the smallest population base; the highest level of disadvantaged people; and the biggest deficits in health, education, infrastructure and housing—in particular, in the bush. And the Territory is certainly more reliant on Commonwealth revenue than any other jurisdiction. The Commonwealth revenue makes up around 70 per cent of the Territory's total revenue at 50 per cent untied GST revenue and 20 per cent tied payments.


The principle underlying horizontal fiscal equalisation is that all Australians can expect to receive a comparable level of schooling, access to hospitals, justice services, transport infrastructure and public housing availability regardless of what state or territory they reside in. But that principle seems to have gone out of the window with this $2 billion cut to the Northern Territory. The reality is that this decision treats Territorians unfairly, precisely because of where they live, and this government should recognise that.


I know that the Michael Gunner Labor government are certainly excellent economic managers and are looking at how to shield Territorians as much as possible from these vicious cuts. The Territory Labor government have committed to delivering their election commitments in the face of these cuts, and they will be out there fighting for a better deal for Territorians. The Territory's federal Labor representatives—Warren Snowdon, the member for Lingiari; Luke Gosling, the member for Solomon; and I—will certainly be fighting for the benefit of the people of the Northern Territory and alongside the Northern Territory government.


I call on my fellow senator for the Northern Territory here in the house, Senator Nigel Scullion, to stand with us in standing up for the Northern Territory. It is absolutely critical that he does. He is the only member in the federal government cabinet, and he must stand up for the people of the Northern Territory. It is certainly an opportunity for Senator Scullion to show leadership and to prove to the people of the Northern Territory that he does have their best interests at heart by showing that he is prepared to go toe to toe with the Treasurer and to fight to ensure economic development opportunities for the people of the Northern Territory.


What impact will a $2 billion cut have on programs and services for people? We know what that is going to do. This brutal cut will have incredible impacts on closing the gap of Indigenous disadvantage. We stood in the house here only a month ago to talk about closing the gap in life expectancy, health and education for Indigenous people in this country, and we know that that is still an enormous challenge in the Northern Territory. How is it that we could experience, just in the 2014 Tony Abbott budget, a $500 million cut to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander services across Australia, which has been particularly felt in the Northern Territory? On top of that were the cuts to the Indigenous Advancement Strategy and the difficulties that the IAS has been found to have in terms of what that program is doing across Australia. The Auditor-General's report showed some severe concerns around the IAS, another blow to the people of the Northern Territory. It really is a budget double whammy for Indigenous Territorians especially.


When we look at the development of northern Australia and how the federal government wants to push the growth of northern Australia, one questions how that is going to be really possible, especially now, with this significant cut to the GST for the Northern Territory. We talk about the $5 billion Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. Since that program was announced in the 2015 budget, we have not seen one red cent hit the ground in the Northern Territory. Territory Chief Minister Michael Gunner and Treasurer Nicole Manison are certainly going to be knocking on doors here in Canberra, and they are going to be looking to us to help them to get a better deal.


In the few minutes that I have left, I want to just highlight some of the things of concern for me in relation to the Commonwealth Grants Commission report. Lots of questions still come from this—questions that still need to be answered—and these are largely in relation to the indicators that the Grants Commission uses, like community health, the taxable payrolls and the Commonwealth payments. Which of the roads in the Northern Territory is it referring to? There are more questions that come from these pointed statistics, in particular about the decline in school enrolment.


I think that, again, we know the challenges in trying to get our kids to school across many of our remote regions in Australia, and it is no different in the Northern Territory. What does this mean when we talk about the reduction in school enrolment and how that is then linked to the decline in GST revenue? These are the things that the people of the Northern Territory want to understand. What is the fall in the enrolments? Where did those enrolments take place? How were they measured? I know that ACARA is one indicator that the Grants Commission has used, but when was this taken?


In terms of the population growth, looking at the decline in the population growth, when was that measured? How was that taken? Are we talking about the population of the whole of the Northern Territory or specific places? There are so many unanswered questions that still come from this report, which I will certainly be keen to ask over the coming days.


On reflection, in terms of the roads, we certainly know about Infrastructure Australia and the funds that come into the Northern Territory in the Commonwealth payments. How is it that we can, on the one hand, as a territory seek to be funded for the best of roads and transportation to be able to get food into the communities and have bridges built so that there can be access and yet, because we have received a certain amount of funding to build that infrastructure, it is then taken away with the other hand? These are the things that do not seem to add up.


The question of fairness is one that will certainly be asked over coming days. We will certainly be asking about all these things from the commission's report.
