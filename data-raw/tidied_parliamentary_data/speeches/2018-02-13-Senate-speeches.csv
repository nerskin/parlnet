Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (12:02):  I rise to speak on the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2017. This bill puts in place a number of changes arising from the 2017 budget, including price disclosure arrangements, but it also represents a significant win against this government's continued attacks to make health more expensive for every Australian. With the 2017 budget, the government finally dropped their senseless measure to push up the price of prescription medications for every Australian by up to $5.


Labor will be supporting this bill because we know how important access to affordable health is, including the critical and life-saving medicines on the PBS. The price reductions enabled by this bill will deliver savings to the budget and price reductions to consumers. But we note serious concerns that the government is not being up front with Australians about whether they have already spent the savings that were negotiated as part of this bill.


The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is one of the hallmarks of Australia's universal healthcare system, a system that is the envy of many countries across the world. Labor is incredibly proud of the PBS. It was first established in 1948 by the Chifley government and has been in place in various iterations ever since. Labor fought to create the PBS. We have fought to strengthen the PBS and we will always fight to protect the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It is only through the PBS that most Australians can afford to access the medicines that they need.


As I've flagged, there are serious concerns about whether the savings in this bill have already been spent. This bill represents around $1.8 billion in savings. But with the new listings in the budget and throughout the year, it's possible these funds have already been exhausted. The government needs to be up-front about this. Labor have repeatedly questioned the government on the existence of these savings, but they have failed to provide adequate information. We also note that the government tried for three years to increase the price of all PBS medicines, even for pensioners. Their 2014 budget measure would have increased co-payments by $5 for general patients and 80c for concessional patients. Only Labor's opposition in the Senate prevented the Liberals from implementing this policy, and, while they've taken it off for now, we know they will introduce it at the first opportunity. So, while we support this bill, we will continue to guard against the government's broader policies on medicines and Medicare. 


This bill makes a number of changes to the pricing of medicines and drugs. The existing five per cent price reduction that applies for single brand drugs on the F1 formulary on the fifth anniversary of listing will be extended for another two years, now applying until April 2022. There is the introduction of two new anniversary price reductions for drugs on the F1: a 10 per cent reduction after 10 years of listing on the PBS, and a further five per cent reduction after 15 years of listing. On 1 June 2018, medicines that have already reached their 10-year or 15-year anniversary by that date will be subject to catch-up reductions, and, subsequently, anniversary reduction days will occur on 1 April of each year. The bill increases the price reduction that applies on listing the first additional new brand of a medicine. When a first new competing brand is listed alongside an existing brand of an F1 drug, both immediately have their prices reduced. This bill will increase the reduction from 16 per cent to 25 per cent. 


The bill adds new provisions around ministerial direction for price reductions, with previous price reductions able to be taken into account before a statutory price reduction is applied. The bill also adds a new measure around price disclosure arrangements. These arrangements mean the drug companies must report data on sales, with the sale price information used to adjust the price for all brands of a medicine. The new measure provides that, after a medicine has had seven full cycles of price disclosure data collection and reduction days, the threshold for price disclosure price reductions will increase from the current 10 per cent to 30 per cent. Finally, the bill allows a company to list another version of its own original brand without being subject to a new brand price reduction. 


While much of this bill focuses on enabling pricing changes for medicines and drugs, it also makes a notable change to the so-called Pharmacy Location Rules. Since 1990, rules have existed to limit how close a new pharmacy can be to an existing pharmacy. These rules have a sunset clause. In the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement, this bill will remove the sunset clause, meaning existing arrangements will continue post 2020. Labor will not stand in the way of this change. 


In conclusion, as we've said, more affordable medicines are good for the budget and for consumers, and we acknowledge the work of the industry in agreeing to the savings. While we support this bill, we will continue to note our concerns that the government is not being up-front about whether the savings have already been spent. We also note that investment in medicines and the PBS must be made in tandem with broader investment with health. The government has consistently attacked health at every turn. Despite saying at the last election that he had 'listened to the community concerns around health', the Prime Minister has failed to drop a single part of his Medicare freeze. In fact, the government's freeze won't be fully lifted until 2020. 


This has a particular impact in communities where bulk-billing is lowest, such as my home state of Tasmania, where only 73.9 per cent of unreferred GP visits are bulk-billed—more than 10 per cent lower than the national average. Average out-of-pocket costs to visit a GP in Tassie have now become more than $36, up almost $6 since the conservatives were elected. You can't boast about making medicines more affordable while keeping measures in place that are driving up out-of-pocket costs and making health less accessible for every Australian.


Labor is incredibly proud of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and we will always fight for it. Today we tell the government that every dollar of savings generated by the passage of this bill must be re-invested in new medicines.

I also thank Medicines Australia, the Generic and Biosimilar Medicines Association and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia for their efforts in developing the agreements with the government.


I would also like to make particular mention of the contribution made by the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee. The committee's consideration of the bill included a number of questions on the proposed new power for the minister to exercise discretion in making certain pricing decisions. At the recommendation of the committee, additional information regarding the operation of these provisions has been included as an addendum to the explanatory memorandum. The addendum also contains further information in relation to transparency and scrutiny of written determinations made by a minister using discretional powers. I can confirm that these determinations will be made publicly available via registration on the Federal Register of Legislation. This is in addition to the publication on the PBS website.


I thank the senators for their interest and support, and commend the bill to the Senate.

I have some questions for the minister. Minister, this removal of location rules, or the sunset clause on location rules, has been the subject of multiple inquiries, including one by the Productivity Commission. Can you provide an explanation to the Senate as to why those reviews, which have invariably recommended removal of location rules—and in particular the Productivity Commission's recommendations—aren't being applied?

Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (12:13):  Thank you, Senator Leyonhjelm. The pharmacy location rules are a longstanding and fundamental part of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme as we know it today. In 1985, there were just under 5,500 pharmacies in Australia, and an inquiry conducted by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal in 1998 found that there was a marked inconsistency in the location of community pharmacies supplying PBS medicines. It found that many urban areas had clusters of pharmacies while access in rural and remote communities was relatively poor, with significantly lower pharmacy-to-population ratios. For some rural and remote communities, the distance to a pharmacy made it difficult or expensive to access PBS medicines.


The introduction of location rules in 1991, with the first Community Pharmacy Agreement, resulted in a restructure of the industry that reduced the number of pharmacies, in the short term, but encouraged greater efficiency and economies of scale in individual pharmacy businesses. The objective of the pharmacy rules, and the government sees no need to change this, was to encourage a widely distributed network of PBS pharmacies that matched the demographic spread of the Australian community.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (12:14):   Thank you for that, Minister. I'm Chair of the Select Committee on Red Tape, which recently examined this issue in an inquiry, and the committee was told much the same thing. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the same people wrote the submission to the committee as just wrote your response to my question. But the committee was unable to determine how restricting the right to establish or preventing the establishment of clusters of pharmacies in metropolitan areas would somehow help access to pharmaceuticals in rural and regional areas. Nobody was able to provide a coherent answer to that question. On the other side of the equation, of course, is that clusters of pharmacies are not inherently bad. Indeed, clusters of food shops often result in better choice and lower prices. Clusters of clothing shops are not at all uncommon and similarly result in better choice and lower prices. So I'm wondering if you've been provided an answer to the question as to how avoiding clusters of pharmacies in metropolitan areas somehow helps access to pharmaceutical medicines in rural and regional areas.

Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (12:16):  The objective of the location rules is to encourage a widely distributed network of PBS pharmacies that matches the demographic spread of the Australian community, and I'm advised that there is certainly evidence that the distribution has improved. Since June 2013, the pharmacy-to-population ratio in rural localities has in fact been better than the pharmacy-to-population ratio in urban areas.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (12:17):  What my amendment would do would be to remove something which is quite unnecessary in this bill we are considering. The rest of the bill is fine, but this rather sneaky little provision removes the June 2020 sunset clause that regulates the location of pharmacies and establishes whether an application to establish one can be granted.


There have been seven reviews, if I'm correct, since 2000 into these Pharmacy Location Rules. I don't think any of them have found the Pharmacy Location Rules to be well founded. Certainly the Productivity Commission didn't think so. The Grattan Institute has warned about a 15-year cycle of review that's creating 'public cynicism and disengagement'. It argues:


Pharmacy regulation is overdue for reform, not further review with implementation stymied by vested interests.


The Department of Health, on the other hand, says:


The Location Rules ensure that the community pharmacy sector remains viable and able to meet consumers' needs throughout Australia, including … in rural and remote areas …


It just defies logic. The Australian Medical Association says pharmacy rules are unnecessary. The Pharmaceutical Society of Australia says, yes, the pharmacy rules are necessary, but on the other hand 'they prevent our members from establishing pharmacies'. Indeed, the only industry group that the committee heard from that thinks the pharmacy rules are a good idea is the Pharmacy Guild. The Pharmacy Guild is comprised of existing pharmacy owners—so, as someone once famously said, 'You would expect them to say that, wouldn't you?' It defies belief that an industry organisation, the Pharmacy Guild, can determine, under both the Liberals and Labor, that existing pharmacies are entitled to be protected from competition by location rules on the fig-leaf justification that somehow or other people in regional and rural areas will have better access to pharmaceuticals as a consequence. It is absolute nonsense, and review after review has said it is nonsense. The only ones who don't say it's nonsense are the Pharmacy Guild. I cannot believe the government is falling for this nonsense.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:04):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Communications (Senator Fifield) to a question without notice asked by Senator O'Neill today relating to the National Broadband Network.


Since our return this year, we've had Senator Fifield coming into the chamber and rabbiting on about the great success of his NBN rollout. However, we need to let him in on the secret that the rest of Australia knows: what a dog he's rolling out. It's a lemon. It was only supposed to cost $29 billion—that's what they said. They said that the market would come in and put in any additional funds that were required to finish the job. Instead of that happening, because what they'd rolled out was so bad the government couldn't get people to invest, they've had to tip in another $20 billion themselves. So now, at a cost of $49 billion, we've got a copper-loaded lemon distributed across the country.


And this morning the government's second-rate NBN took another hit. The NBN CEO, Mr Morrow, has been quoted overnight as saying that already he's considering building a 5G wireless network to bypass the copper NBN, the one that this minister keeps coming in and telling us is really good, bragging about his numbers—except that, every time he says another 10,000, another 15,000, another 20,000 Australians have had the Malcolm Turnbull model of the NBN inflicted on them, I feel the pain and suffering of our local communities, all of those people out there who have had a terrible time managing their connection to the NBN, and all of those businesses. Let me just say that 83 per cent—not a small number—of small businesses say they lack confidence in the government's NBN delivery. Now that's got to be a fail by any measure, yet this minister, this senator, keeps coming in and telling us what a great job he's doing. The gap between reality and Mr Fifield's version of it is absolutely unfathomable. I cannot understand why he doesn't understand the Australian people's concerns about this copper based technology he is rolling out.


The reason that we had Mr Morrow say that he's going to have to go to 5G is that he knows what the government has been trying to deny for a long time—that parts of the Malcolm Turnbull version of this NBN are unreliable and corroding. There are thousands of Australians out there who have what the NBN euphemistically call 'service class 0'. That means they don't know when they're going to get to you, because they've got big problems. And why have they got big problems? Because they're trying to force information down a copper line that's landing at a node at the speed of light. They're trying to splice together 21st-century technology with a technology that should have been left in the last century, and, where those two things meet, it's not working out. Mr Morrow even knows it. He's saying: 'It's failing. We might have to go to 5G.' But this minister didn't want to answer those questions; he doesn't understand the dog that he is inflicting on the Australian people.


Today we've seen Senator Fifield failing once again to take responsibility for the mess that's been created by this Turnbull government, and, by doing so, he is absolutely failing to understand or recognise the real impacts that this mess is having on ordinary Australian men and women and the businesses right across this country. Every single member and senator who is in this place will have had hundreds and hundreds of Australians contact them in their offices and say: 'Please help me out. I'm about to lose my absolute patience with the NBN. I cannot survive this any longer.' We had evidence given to the NBN committee on the Central Coast of New South Wales of one gentleman at Masters Beach who lost in the order of $70,000 from his business in the lead-up to Christmas because this government just doesn't get it. It just doesn't understand, and it continues to deny the reality that businesses right across this country are being compromised in their capacity to compete in a global market. They're being compromised by constant dropouts. They're being compromised by slow speeds because the technology that this government's inflicted on them won't deliver what they need to do business in the 21st century.


Australians are concerned about the costs, and our government should also be concerned about the costs to maintain an old copper technology that is redundant. We know that our company, NBN, is an Australian company—it belongs to all of us. And yet, under the custodianship of this government, it has failed to deliver us the technology we need for the 21st century. They can call it Malcolm Turnbull's multi-technology mix, but we know it's Malcolm Turnbull's mess.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (15:09):  I simply remind the honourable senator opposite that hyperbole is never a substitute for facts. The simple facts are these. Labor missed every single one of its NBN rollout targets. Let me remind the Senate of that: every single Labor target for the NBN rollout was missed, was not achieved and was not delivered, whereas the coalition government has in fact been smashing the targets. Let's not forget that, under Labor, the NBN fell 83 per cent short of its 2013 rollout target. So it failed to deliver that which it promised the Australian people by not just one or two per cent—a rounding error—but 83 per cent.


You would think that the Australian Labor Party, clothed with that shameful record, would have some sense of decency and seek to sidestep any debate about the NBN. But, in typical Australian Labor Party style, what they seek to do is mislead the Australian people. They do it time and time again. At the last election they did it so despicably with the 'Mediscare' campaign—a false and dishonest campaign seeking to mislead the Australian people—and now today they are doing it again with the NBN. Their policy was developed on the back of an envelope and, whilst they were in government, they failed to deliver by 83 per cent. However, I am pleased to report that, as we speak, 7,000 premises are being connected every working day.




Senator Reynolds:
  How many?




Senator ABETZ:
  Senator Reynolds, 7,000 premises are being connected every single day.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  Of course, when you roll out these facts, what do you get? A cacophony of interjections from those opposite. When you hit them with the facts, they are unable to deal with reality.


I simply say to those opposite and, more importantly, to the Australian people: don't look at what the Australian Labor Party promise; look at what they actually deliver. They promised us this grand National Disability Insurance Scheme. It was completely underfunded but they had to roll it out on the basis of cheap politics. They had a health policy without any funding attached to it. They also had an education policy without any funding attached to it. They will always speak using hyperbole, trying to get the Australian people to vote for them. You then ask: does the rhetoric match the delivery? You have to give the Australian Labor Party 100 per cent for their consistency. They constantly fail to deliver on that which they promise the Australian people.


The simple facts are: they failed by 83 per cent their 2013 rollout target. That is what Labor had when they were in government. There was a change of government and we have now sought to clean up the mess that we inherited. What a lemon we inherited from former Senator Conroy and the Australian Labor Party. Today we are seeking to clean up the mess of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, just as we are trying to clean up the mess Labor left us in relation to the budget and just as we are trying to clean up the mess they left us in the health and education portfolios. Having left us with all of these messes, the Australian Labor Party then come in here and pontificate to us and the Australian people on how we should be doing better. There is the phrase that actions speak so much louder than words. I simply say to the Australian people and those opposite: don't listen to Labor's words, don't listen to their hyperbole and rhetoric; have a look at what they actually deliver. (Time expired)

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (15:14):  Today we have heard about another saga with regard to the NBN rollout, which that side of the chamber know as the multi-technology mix and this side of the chamber obviously know as Malcolm Turnbull's mess or even the multi-technology mess. I've said in a number of speeches in this place, over quite a number of years, that, given the increasing demand of Australian businesses and households for fast broadband, Mr Turnbull's second-rate copper national broadband network will largely be redundant by the time it's built. Now, with the emergence of 5G mobile services, we face the prospect of more homes and businesses abandoning the network in favour of mobile-only services. 


The 5G providers like Telstra and Optus know what consumers need and want, and they're willing to provide it. A study by Venture Insights, co-funded by the ACCC, reports that as many as 30 per cent of households could abandon the NBN and switch to wireless—30 per cent. Yet NBN's corporate plan continues to cling to the assumption that only 15 per cent of users on the inferior multi-technology mix network would abandon the NBN for wireless services. NBN Co's recent announcement about 5G technology is obviously an admission that the second-rate copper network has failed. The MTM rollout has been a disaster from the beginning. The cost of the rollout has increased from $29.5 billion to $49 billion—a $20 billion blowout—including a recent potential $450 million blowout to the cost of the troubled HFC network.


But the problems with the government's second-rate network don't end there. Oh, no! The copper based network costs more to maintain over its lifetime, yet it generates less revenue because it cannot reach the high speeds that consumers are willing to pay for. It's a less reliable service with slower speeds. In some cases, users who have purchased a copper NBN service have ended up with a slower and less reliable service than their previous ADSL plans. Senator O'Neill mentioned concerns of people in New South Wales. Well, in Tassie, let me tell you—and Senator Brown, I am sure, will attest to this—there are areas in Tasmania which are 20 minutes from the city centre—Hobart—that the NBN left off the map to start with. When we had consultations, it took them months and months and months to be able to get these people any form of access to the network. There are other areas in Tassie that I know have been left off the map altogether. Tasmanians, I think, are really underwhelmed with the government's approach to the NBN. 


As I said, the copper network costs more to maintain over its lifetime, yet it generates less revenue because it cannot reach the highest speeds that consumers are willing to pay for. It's a less reliable service and it's much, much slower. In some cases, the economics of copper are nothing short of a liability. It's no wonder that consumer complaints to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman have gone through the roof. Demand for broadband speeds are such that it's inevitable that most Australians will soon require and demand a full fibre network. But the rollout of the copper network means that the pathway to the fibre network will be expensive and wasteful—an expense that could have been avoided under Labor's plans. 


So we see lots of dissatisfaction with Mr Turnbull's second-rate NBN reflected in a number of surveys. Let me put some facts on the table to refute some of the things that Senator Abetz stated. According to Recon, 83 per cent of small businesses lack confidence in the delivery of the network—83 per cent—and 54 per cent of small businesses believe they will be left behind as the digital economy develops, with technology infrastructure identified as a key barrier to starting a new business. According to the New South Wales Business Chamber, 43 per cent of businesses are either dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the NBN—43 per cent. So we've already wasted enough money and opportunity on the farce that is the MTM. The longer we take to commit to Labor's plan for a full fibre rollout to 93 per cent of premises, the more we risk being left behind in the global economy. 


I just want to point out that Rebecca White, the Labor leader in my home state of Tasmania, understands this. That's why Tasmanian Labor has committed to working across all levels of government and the private sector to facilitate the rollout of fibre-to-the-premises across northern Tasmania. (Time expired)

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (15:19):  I too rise to take note of Minister Fifield's answer. After nearly four years in this place, the chutzpah of those opposite never ceases to amuse me, talking about the NBN and other projects that they implemented, developed and completely stuffed up. The list is long: pink batts, school halls, unfunded NDIS programs, and the NBN is yet another one of their failures. I remind those opposite of exactly the mess you left us. Here we have probably one of the largest infrastructure projects ever in this country—and how was it developed and planned? It wasn't on the back of a wine-stained coaster in a VIP jet with some great idea your colleague Stephen Conroy had, 'Let's do this NBN'?




Senator Carol Brown:
  He doesn't even drink.




Senator REYNOLDS:
  He hadn't been drinking? It was just a wine-stained coaster?




Senator Bilyk:
  He doesn't drink alcohol.




Senator REYNOLDS:
  How does it explain this project? That's even worse, if he came up with this plan sober. Good Lord! After all of their pontificating, let's have a look at what they left this government four short years ago. After six years of Labor, how many households do you think were connected?




Senator Anning:
  None.




Senator REYNOLDS:
  No, there were more than none; 51,000 were connected across the entire country under Labor. Labor's fibre-to-the-premises NBN policy would have cost $30 billion more, under their own figures, and taken six to eight years longer to complete. This project, like so many of the others, shows that there are two maxims in politics: never let the Labor Party near taxpayers' money, because you know they're going to stuff it up, and never let them near any large-scale project management, particularly infrastructure, because they will waste taxpayers' money and completely stuff it up. We've seen that with the NDIS and the NBN.


Let's look at the facts that not even those opposite can dispute. Labor paid $6 billion for the NBN to reach just three per cent of Australian premises. In fact the rollout was so badly managed by those opposite that the contractors downed tools and stopped construction in four states. Remember that? Those opposite try very hard to whitewash history, how much you spent, how little you delivered, 51,000 households. Tell me I'm wrong. It cost $6 billion to roll it out for three per cent of premises. How many rollout targets, on their own dodgy planning, do you think Labor met? When they spent $6 billion to reach three per cent of households and 51,000 households taking it up, how many of their milestones do you think they met? Not a single one.


What is it like under the coalition after four years? The NBN is now available to half of all Australian premises, or more than 6.2 million—six years, 50,000 households; four years, 6.2 million premises. It has over three million active connections, and all Australian premises will be connected by 2020. The facts are irrefutable, and nobody over there can deny these reported facts. Our NBN is connecting more users every two weeks than Labor connected in six years. We are connecting 30,000 premises per week—two weeks, 60,000 premises; six years, 51,000 premises. Despite all the howling of those opposite, trying to rewrite the history of this project, the NBN is on track to be available to two-thirds of Australian premises this year, with more than nine out of 10 premises in 2019 and, as I said, all Australians connected by 2020. Those are the facts. (Time expired)

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2018-02-13,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:24):  I too rise to take note today of the appalling answers from Minister Fifield to the very serious question from Senator O'Neill on the parlous state of broadband communications under his watch and under the watch of Prime Minister Turnbull. Senator O'Neill sought a simple answer from Minister Fifield on the cost of the NBN Co CEO's thought bubble to potentially build a 5G network because the copper network is already not up to standard. Minister Fifield had no idea—just like Minister Fifield and Mr Turnbull have no idea about how much their multimedia technology mess is going to cost. Minister Fifield said that the NBN has a mandate to conduct the rollout under the multi-technology mix—or multi-technology mess, as it's currently known—which he says will see it rolled out fastest and at lowest cost but not best quality. The Liberals and Nationals are happy with quick and dirty broadband—definitely a direction from the top. The minister found it hard to mention 5G in his answer. One wonders why. Does he not support the CEO? Does he not want Australians to harness the immense opportunities that would be afforded by 5G? Does he not want NBN Co to invest? We just don't know—and he probably doesn't know either.


One thing the minister did say is that he believes that his broadband rollout will cost $30 billion less under a full fibre rollout. But the minister never presents the rationale behind his ridiculous argument. That's because the minister's argument just doesn't stack up. NBN Co's CEO, Bill Morrow, and CFO, Stephen Rue, said to a Senate committee that the $30 billion figure is not a continuation of Labor's full-fibre NBN but what it would have cost if it had been restarted in 2015. I repeat: stating that Labor's full-fibre NBN would cost $30 billion more than the multi-technology mess is just not true. It wasn't true when Malcolm Turnbull first said it, and it isn't true today. It's a bad political argument with no logical underpinnings. The minister should consult with his NBN Co executives—who, it has to be said, are doing the best they can with a very bad statement of expectations from Minister Fifield and Minister Cormann.


I want to share four simple facts about the NBN rollout that Minister Fifield should also address in the near future—four facts that tell the story of how the man who supposedly created the internet in Australia completely fell into a pit of rotten copper, dashed hopes and bungled deadlines. Fact No. 1 is that three-quarters of all fibre-to-the-node premises will not be able to reach 100 megabits per second. Fact No. 2 is that over 200,000 premises on copper will not be able to receive the minimum 25 megabits per second that was promised by Prime Minister Turnbull. Fact No. 3 is that there are around 80 million hours of network downtime per year across the multi-technology mix. Fact No. 4 is that about $100 million has been spent purchasing almost 17,000 kilometres of copper wire. They're not my numbers. These are numbers that were provided to the Senate committees by the government and NBN Co. These four facts are part of the reason that NBN Co's CEO is out in the press today saying he is considering his options: copper isn't working, it's not actually cheaper than fibre, it's not as effective as fibre and it can never be more effective than fibre. The overuse of copper is all about a bad political argument made by Mr Turnbull and Mr Abbott almost a decade ago. They were so desperate to find a point of difference with an excellent Labor government policy—and the people of Australia are now suffering as a result of that political point of difference.


In Tasmania, the Turnbull government claims that the network is complete. But there are still thousands of premises that can't get connected. No matter how many phone calls people make, and despite NBN promising that the micronodes would be connected by October last year, it is not finished. And, worse still, for most on the north-west coast of Tasmania—where I live—which is one of the poorest parts of this country, there is no upgrade path from fibre to the node to full fibre. So while the big cities of Launceston and Hobart skate ahead with gigabyte connections, the north-west coast is left behind by this government. And then when the minister is asked about 5G as an alternative, all he can do is bleat incorrect facts and political spin. Thank goodness this government's time is almost up! (Time expired)

Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (15:30):  On the issue of the NBN, I heard Senator O'Neill saying that the NBN is a lemon. It is a lemon, but what the Labor Party doesn't understand is that it was their lemon first, and at least the government has tried to make lemonade out of it. I find it surprising that people during question time waste their questions. Senator Fifield was attempting to answer the question and trying to answer it correctly with his version of the facts. But it shouldn't surprise me when it comes to question time and answering questions like this. Even Senator Cormann today, in answering a question I was putting through him to the Minister for Defence, said that my question was 'bordering on inappropriate'. I suppose he would think it was bordering on inappropriate when the Dorothy Dixers on his side of the chamber come up and the first question is usually some anodyne, milquetoast Dorothy Dixer that that side puts up. Question No. 1 is a milk sop, question No. 2 is usually just excruciatingly boring and question No. 3 is some saccharine sort of press release. If we get rid of questions Nos 2 and 3 in question time, we could get more questions in, we could have more transparency from the government, and the Labor Party on the opposition benches and the crossbench especially would be happier for it.

  The Australian government strongly supports the open and unrestricted use of internet for lawful purposes, which is a key principle of net neutrality. In Australia, we already have strong rules to address anticompetitive conduct and a watchdog to enforce these rules in the ACCC. We have a competitive internet service provider market in Australia. Consumers have the ability to easily change providers. This delivers strong disincentives to inhibit providers from engaging in this type of conduct.

  The provision of local community sporting facilities is absolutely integral for our communities.

The City of Darebin is struggling to meet the demand of its population growth and to provide adequate sporting facilities for its residents. Despite the Victorian state Labor government promising additional facilities in the lead-up to the 2014 election, four years later the community still is holding its breath for the 64 competition-compliant netball courts they had been promised in Northcote, in Reservoir, in places that we know desperately need them. I urge the Victorian state government to deliver on their commitment to the people of Darebin in the electorate of Batman rather than to continue the broken promises they have become known for.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AG,2018-02-13,"



Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (16:24):  The matter before the Senate at the moment is indeed a matter of great public importance. The damage done to communities, individuals and families around the country by the massive continued expansion of harmful and predatory gambling is something that I'm sure we are all aware of, and we also must be aware of the fact that it is not being adequately addressed as things stand. One of the things that I think many in the community find most frustrating and irritating when they are raising a persistent problem that is not being addressed by elected representatives is when people try to pass the buck between state and federal level and say that it's a state issue, or a federal issue, or a local issue, and there's nothing we can do about it. The simple fact is there is something that needs to be done about this, and it can be done at federal level with more federal leadership.


The Greens have long campaigned for winding back the extraordinary expansion of poker machines in Australia. Australia is home to 0.3 per cent of the world's population but 18 per cent of the world's poker machines. Australians lose more money per capita to poker machines than do people anywhere else in the world. This isn't some manifestation of a quirk of the Australian character where we somehow or other love a punt more than anyone else in the world or have a compulsion to put coins into a machine; this is the result of an explicit policy choice by governments of both major party political persuasions, at federal as well as state level, for many years. This is an almost inevitable outcome of the regulatory regimes at state and federal level and a lack of political will to tackle this problem.


It is no coincidence that the gambling lobby in general—the pokies, the casinos and the like—put in literally millions of dollars of political donations at state and federal level. We need not just greater transparency about those donations but to eliminate those donations. The Greens have long campaigned to eradicate political donations from the gambling sector, as we did long ago in the tobacco industry—well, not so long ago in regard to the coalition in particular, who seemed keen to keep taking money from that sector for quite a long time. It is clear that this is a harmful industry and needs to be better regulated at federal level, with incentives, assistance and support for states to wean themselves off the revenue stream that they themselves have become addicted to.


A 2010 study by the Productivity Commission, hardly a bleeding heart social welfare body, found that problem gamblers account for 40 per cent of losses to poker machines. Most countries around the world—226 out of 238—do not have poker machines in pubs and clubs. Suicide rates among problem gamblers are twice the rates among those with other addictions. Problem gamblers are far more vulnerable to depression, relationship breakdown and job loss. Parts of our criminal justice system are being affected by this as well. This is a failure of the political system, because there's a lack of political will to tackle a major problem. It's not just about pokies. The expansion of online gambling is another serious concern with regard to the lack of protections for people. It's not a wowserish anti-gambling approach; it's about recognising that some forms of gambling are predatory, deliberately and knowingly causing harm to people and families. We need to stop that.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2018-02-13,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (16:28):  If ever there were a demonstration of the fact that the Greens live in a parallel universe, this motion is it. As Senator Seselja said just a moment ago: while criticising the government and the opposition for taking donations from the gambling sector, the good senator admitted to the fact that the Greens take donations from a professional gambler, noting that one of the things that particular gentleman, David Walsh from MONA, wants to do is set up a new casino in Tasmania. So not only do they live in a parallel universe but they also don't come here with clean hands.


Then, when you consider the context of the matter of public importance itself, it seems as though they've been living under a rock for the last 12 months. It's no secret that I haven't been in this chamber for the last 18 months, but I have seen firsthand during that period of time the efforts that the government has been going to, working at a national level, sometimes with the cooperation of the states and territories and sometimes not, with the gambling industry and with those who don't support the gambling industry—like the community services sector, who have concerns about those who can't manage their own gambling—to make some changes.


Minister Fifield, for example, has successfully negotiated and legislated through this place changes to broadcasting laws that will see a welcome change in gambling advertising on television—a clear demonstration of the activity of government over the last 12 months in relation to the management, at a national level, of gambling. It demonstrates that this motion by the Greens doesn't really reflect the reality of what's occurring, the work happening now that was instigated by the former minister, Minister Tudge, who I know actively sought to put in place a national consumer protection framework for those who were engaging in gambling—in particular in online gambling but also in gambling across the board—so that there were some protections in place.


That is national leadership taken by this government. It was taken by the former minister, Minister Tudge, because he was passionately involved with a case where one of his constituents had been hurt and because he wanted to make a difference during his time in the portfolio. I saw firsthand that passion and desire. I worked with him to achieve the principles of a national consumer protection framework, which had things like a national self-exclusion register, which worked across the online platforms, and the removal of credit betting. These are measures that are making a difference.


The Greens motion today doesn't even stand up in the context of being in the real world, because this government is actively taking measures to protect people who need that protection, because they can't manage it themselves. It's been good to see both the gambling sector and the community services sector working closely to make sure that the intentions of the government's reforms are actually met, because there are those, and they're not necessarily those you might expect, that are opposed to some of the changes.


We're looking at things such as voluntary precommitments: the opportunity for a consumer, at an early stage in their involvement with a gambling entity, to set their own targets. That is the best way for these things to work. We are not going to change the world overnight—and not by putting in some artificial measures that the Greens might like to think would work—but we are actively working in this space to provide the measures that will make a genuine difference, and some of those I've already mentioned. Precommitment—when someone signs up for a gambling account—is an important part of that process. They know what they can afford to spend. They know what their patterns are. The opportunity for them to be advised of how much they're spending, through reports back to them that are easily accessible, is also an important part of the process.


It's quite confounding to me that just last night the Greens voted against the cashless credit card, a process and a mechanism that might not be a silver bullet but is something that has already been proven to significantly reduce spending on gambling in communities that are at risk. So we see not only the blindness to what is actually happening but the hypocrisy of the Greens when they vote against something that government has put forward for communities that has already clearly been demonstrated to provide a significant reduction in gambling. In fact, 48 per cent of gamblers in the communities where the card has already been trialled are gambling less, and yet the Greens vote against that and then come in here to criticise the government for not doing enough while they themselves are inhibiting government attempts to improve outcomes for those who are susceptible to gambling. You really cannot understand where the logic comes from. I know logic and the Greens in the same sentence really don't mix, but it is helpful that they continue to demonstrate that through their actions.


This government, through Minister Fifield, is providing a reduction in gambling advertising on television, and I don't know too many people who don't welcome that. In fact, in the Great Hall on budget night last year the fact that we won't be pestered by gambling advertising before 8.30 of an evening was probably the only announcement that received spontaneous applause from those present. It is a real measure that will improve the lot. It is outlawing credit betting and has measures to block international betting sites. If you look at the current debate in Tasmania, where the Labor Party is proposing to ban pokies, you see the naivety of that policy. The Labor Party is looking to take pokies out of pubs and clubs, and the naivety of that will just see people move to online gambling on overseas gambling sites with no taxation to the Australian government, no protections in respect of their spending and a real likelihood that their financial details will fall into the wrong hands and they will end up in further pain.


So the policy that's currently being proposed in Tasmania by the Labor Party is completely naive and supported, I might say, by the Greens in their own parallel universe. And yet they come in here and criticise the government that over the last 18 months has taken real, practical actions that will work, that are supported broadly by the community and that, might I add, have had support from the gambling sector. So the complete hypocrisy of the Greens is again demonstrated along with that life in a parallel universe where they don't understand what's actually going on and yet they themselves voted against a measure in this place last night that will improve the lot of those susceptible to gambling.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2018-02-13,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (16:38):  I am pleased to be able to participate in this afternoon's MPI, moved by Senator Siewert, about the need for the federal government to take a stronger, more active and direct role in the regulation of harmful and predatory gambling. I want to take the opportunity to put on the record just how powerful the sharing of life experiences from older adult Australians with younger children can be as an interrupter to the sorts of behaviours that we are seeking to discuss here today. People fall into gambling addiction because there are harmful and predatory practices in this industry.


I recall living as a young girl on Targo Road in Western Sydney, not very far from the Pendle Hill Catholic Club, where there was a wonderful woman I was very proud to know—one of those adoptive aunts. Her name was Gwen Carroll. She was a great nurse. She came from Toowoomba. She moved to Sydney and worked at Crown Street. She delivered thousands of babies, had a great social conscience, married a lovely Irishman and became a part of our family.


Aunty Gwen worked at the Pendle Hill Catholic club, and one evening we went to pick her up and bring her home. She had plates of food she was carrying out, and instead of getting into the car she gave the plates of food to a man who put them into his car. It was leftover food from the club. When she got into the car for us to give her a lift home, I asked her what was going on. I was a very impressionable eight-year-old at the time. She said, 'Well, that man hasn't got enough money left to feed his family,' because he'd gambled it away on poker machines in that club. To this day I applaud her social conscience and her practical action to deal with the issue for that family, but it's a few years since I was eight, and here we are discussing this matter still. Gambling is a significant social problem for far too many Australians.


Now, as a mother of 20-somethings, I know that the culture amongst many young Australians at this time is one in which rabid social advertising is drawing them more and more into the world of gambling, to the point where addiction to gambling is absolutely increasing. Just this week, there was an amazing article, in my view, which was related to the royal commission. You might say, 'Well, what's that got to do with harmful and predatory gambling?' But I will take the part of the MPI about 'a stronger and more active direct role in the regulation'. We need to think about where people are getting money and free access to money. The story that I want to cite was written by consumer affairs reporter Sarah Farnsworth and the ABC Specialist Reporting Team's Naomi Selvaratnam. It was uploaded two days ago, and it's in the public domain. The caption under the photo of a young man is:


By the time he was 20, Mitchell Spiteri was placing daily bets on gambling websites.


The article goes on to note:


As of February 17, laws banning gambling companies from giving credit to people will come into effect


But it also indicates that this young man, despite his full profile of spending being available to his bank, was still approved for a $25,000 loan when he was at the peak of his addiction.


So we have a long, long way to go in creating a context for a punt—and let's face it: Australians really make the best of that, particularly on Melbourne Cup Day, and the whole of the racing industry, to a degree, really relies on the entertainment value of horseracing and the dogs et cetera, and there are many other forms of betting that people do manage in moderation. But the context in which we live right now is one that Labor acknowledges is very concerning from the point of view that the growth in gambling advertising and online betting, including sports betting, is just rampant.


We recognise, as a party, that well-regulated gambling absolutely has a place in Australian society. I've only got five minutes, so I won't tell you about the wonderful times I had going to Royal Randwick with my family, including my father, seeing and enjoying the races. People there were having a great day. But we are concerned because times have changed and the growth of digital technology, including smartphones, allows Australians to wager and gamble whenever and wherever they choose, so social protections that once might have existed no longer exist. We're in a digital age. We can't change that. It's an age of rapid change with regard to technology. Pretty well all of us have at least one handheld device; many of us have multiple devices. Smartphones allow us to do remarkable things, including going to the MoneySmart website, and I'm sure the MoneySmart website from ASIC would have some good guidance for young people who want to think about managing their money. It's not the technology that is flawed but what we're allowing to happen with it and within it. It's important that we acknowledge that the new technological realities have increased the likelihood of problem gambling. We simply cannot deny that that's the reality.


Labor also believes that the advertising of legitimate sports bets can and should be well regulated, with appropriate harm-minimisation measures in place to protect children against problem gambling. This is because, as I started to recount in my opening remarks, we know that gambling in our community can in some cases have devastating consequences not just for the individual but for their family—social consequences, financial consequences and emotional consequences that don't remain with the individual whose choice it is but are transferred by their connection to others, to entire families, and can race through entire communities in small regional areas.


Research undertaken by Deakin University gives us this vital information in very digestible form and points out that there are a number of very concerning issues with regard to children in particular and gambling advertising on television. Deakin found that over 90 per cent of children can recall having seen an advertisement for sports betting. That's pretty much market saturation of a youth market. Three-quarters of children aged eight to 16 years can recall the name of at least one sports betting brand and approximately one-quarter can recall four brands or more. So when 75 per cent of children think gambling is normal, to the point that it's part of something that they can just name off the top of their head, it shows you the level of exposure that our entire community is being subjected to. Parents who participated in that survey and study from Deakin University also conveyed their concerns, including that gambling advertising is so prevalent that it's changing the way kids think about sport and talk about sport.


All the language that we use arrives into our world in a context—and this is not a context that exists in every country around the world but it is certainly the reality that we confront right now. That's why Labor has continued to maintain a very strong stance to ensure that appropriate harm minimisation measures are in place and that we protect and assist our community. It was Labor, when in government, that commissioned the Productivity Commission report to update its previous report on the gambling industry in Australia. And it was Labor that rejected recommendations to water down Australia's online gaming laws until harm minimisation strategies were adopted. It is a while since we were in government—sadly. We've been watching the demise of so many important parts of the fabric of our society. When we were in government we understood this was an issue, and we led the introduction of new rules to limit the promotion of betting odds and gambling advertising during live sports broadcasts on both television and radio because we know that what kids hear and see has an impact on them. We are listening to the concerns people in our community have around gambling.


I go back to that memory of a single conversation as an eight-year-old in a car park at Pendle Hill. The context that you grow up in, the kinds of words and stories that people tell you and the way you understand how the world works will have an impact on your behaviour. I have to say that I became very cautious about what gambling might do. It doesn't mean I haven't enjoyed the odd bet from time to time but, I'm very glad to say, gambling addiction has never come close. But this is a reality that needs to be considered and the government needs to take some responsibility for the context in which gambling addiction is on the rise.

"Griff, Sen Stirling",NXT,2018-02-13,"



Senator GRIFF
 (South Australia) (16:48):  Predatory gambling has always been a key issue for former Senator Nick Xenophon and the Nick Xenophon Team, and we are proud to have made a number of positive inroads that help protect consumers. We most recently secured gambling ad bans during televised sports matches and bans on credit betting. But that is just the start. Problem gambling is a huge blight on our society and we will never stop pushing for reforms to tackle predatory gambling and the deep harm it causes.


Pokies are, of course, the biggest culprit when it comes to problem gambling. It is an industry that preys on the vulnerable and is a major driver of household debt and family and personal dysfunction. We need to progressively reduce their numbers and we need to urgently remove their addictive features. This is why we have backed the Productivity Commission's recommendations for a $1 maximum bet per spin to try and cap losses at $120 an hour. This is an urgent issue because poker machine players in South Australia alone can currently lose up to $5 per spin every 2.8 seconds or so and can easily lose $1,000 an hour. We also need to get ATMs and EFTPOS machines out of pokie venues.


But this is not the end game. We need to wean state governments off their $5-billion-a-year gambling taxes, and this is where the Commonwealth can very much play a part. We have been pleased to work constructively with this government to achieve some significant reforms, such as a siren-to-siren ban on betting advertising during televised sports matches. We also secured a ban on credit betting, which takes effect from this Saturday.


However, defeating this manipulative industry can feel like a game of Whac-A-Mole. As an example, I'd like to draw senators' attention to a particularly deceptive gambling product known as Lottoland. Despite its misleading name, Lottoland is not a lottery. It's a glorified bookmaker that bets on lottery outcomes. Lottoland is registered in Gibraltar and pays no income tax on the money it earns overseas. It also avoids paying any local taxes—such as, for instance, Tatts pays.


The Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016 made it illegal for overseas gambling companies to offer gambling products to Australians unless they hold a licence issued by a state or territory. Lottoland has secured its licence through the Northern Territory, allowing it to reach most Australians. Thankfully, it has been banned in my home state of South Australia.


What is galling is seeing this gambling product advertised on morning television, when mums and dads are getting their kids ready for school. Many of us would have a talk show blaring in the background in the mornings, particularly to distract one from the noise of young children. But those who tune in to Sunrise will be hit with promotions for Lottoland and a new product, Kenoland, before the weather is even presented. It's gambling in another guise, and we think it deserves to be looked at more closely.


We've banned sporting ads during G-rated programs. We obviously need to take this one step further and ban all gambling advertising while children are watching. When it comes to predatory gambling, NXT will never tire in its efforts to fight against the damage this industry causes to so many people and their families.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2018-02-13,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (16:52):  Consistency and integrity have never been a strong suit of the Greens. When you have a look at this matter of public importance, you can see where the Australian Greens are coming from—



Senator McKim interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  And right on cue, the Australian Greens cannot help but interject. Senator Bartlett introduced the MPI and, I understand, made some comments about the donations received by political parties as though that might somehow influence the particular stance or view on matters. I do not ask rhetorically—and I stress this—whether the Leader of the Australian Greens has actually approached major gambling organisations for donations. Not a squeak out of the Australian Greens! So it seems that it's appropriate for the Australian Greens to seek donations from major gambling organisations but then condemn those who may receive support from various sectors.


Indeed, in my home state of Tasmania at the moment there is a state election, and the Australian Labor Party have adopted Australian Greens policy, as is always their wont. If you want to know what Labor policy is going to be in about five years time, have a look at what the Australian Greens policy is today. What we have seen in Tasmania is Labor and the Greens seeking to ban poker machines from pubs and clubs. This policy has been widely lauded by the Tasmanian racing industry. I wonder why? It is because they see an opportunity. If you cut out one part of the market, people will transfer to another part of the market.


I agree that gambling is a problem within our community. So is alcoholism. But it would be a bit like saying, 'Alcoholism is a problem in our community so we will ban beer, but not wine or spirits or alcopops; we will just ban one particular product,' and then saying: 'Aren't we good? This somehow cures the problem.' Of course it doesn't.


Who are the greatest champions of the Green-Labor policy in Tasmania? None other than the racing industry and a person who is, in fact, seeking to establish another casino in Tasmania and who has made substantial wealth through gambling. The person involved has made all his money courtesy of other people losing theirs. And, of course, how does the racing industry continue? By people losing money on their gambling. So it is hardly with clean hands that the Greens approach this issue and assert that somehow, if you get rid of one sector of the gambling product, you will overcome the problems.


The Review of Illegal Offshore Wagering, in 2016, estimated that some $400 million worth of betting was undertaken in 2014. This is expected to grow to $910 million by 2020. The review found that the rate of problem gambling for online gamblers is three times higher than the rate of problem gambling elsewhere. So, let's keep in mind where some of the real problems are. You can, today, lose your home through gambling without even leaving your home, because the online gambling facilities are there.


We as a federal government have been seeking to deal with these matters in a manner that is consistent and has some degree of policy integrity about it. The amazing thing is that in this debate you hear about the vulnerable people—and there are vulnerable people, I accept that—but when you seek to protect vulnerable people from their own actions, such as through the cashless welfare card, the Australian Labor Party and the Greens vote against it.



Senator Hanson-Young interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  The Greens, of course, express their faux exasperation, but can I simply remind the Australian Greens that where the cashless welfare card has been introduced there has been a 48 per cent reduction in gambling. If you honestly believe that gambling is a problem, why would you not say: well, here is one way of protecting vulnerable people from themselves? At the end of the day, whilst government has a role in this area, the individual does as well. Individual responsibility is a matter of concern where, within the community, I think we have to invite people to start taking more responsibility for their own actions rather than saying: here's a problem; the government's got to do something about it.


What we're saying in relation to the issue of gambling is that it is widespread within the community and, in the Tasmanian context, just seeking to get rid of one form of gambling will not overcome the sorts of problems that people have had in losing money, be it on the horses, on the dogs, on the card tables or, indeed, in personal gambling, where people play cards and lose their week's wages or their fortnight's wages. As a former lawyer, I've dealt with people that, unfortunately, lost a lot of money and got themselves into problems in circumstances where they were never near a poker machine, so this attempt to pick on poker machines is hardly going to resolve the issues that we, as a country, face today. 


I commend to my colleagues the speech by Senator Colbeck, who gave some very interesting insights in this discussion before I did. Whilst the Productivity Commission was referred to, I think, by Senator Griff in relation to $1 bets, the Productivity Commission also noted that pre-commitment is 'the most'—I want to underline the word 'most'—'targeted and potentially effective measure'. But, as soon as you start talking about things like pre-commitment, people taking responsibility and realising that they have to do something about it, you cannot see Labor and the Greens for dust, because they always want to have government banning something, government stopping something, government controlling something, rather than saying, 'How can we deal with this situation?' I remember the former member for Hume, Alby Schultz—rest his soul—taking me to a club in New South Wales where there were technologies in place to protect their membership. I believe that that is a way that local clubs and individual clubs can, in fact, take responsibility in these areas. 


As part of the broader media reform, we as a government have announced restrictions on the level of gambling advertising and seeking to control those areas that are appropriate. The sort of sledgehammer approach on just one area of gambling by the Australian Greens and the Australian Labor Party in Tasmania is a policy that clearly will not work.




Senator McKim:
  Singing for your supper again! How much did they pay you for this speech? 




Senator ABETZ:
  And, what's more, it is designed to ensure that the people in Tasmania who might be concerned—and there are many genuine people who are concerned about poker machines—will support them. I simply remind them: if there were a minority Labor-Green government elected on 3 March, the human misery of unemployment would be there for all to see. The dysfunction would enter our prisons, hospitals and schools yet again. And what's more, we would be lumbered with a Safe Schools program. So I simply say to people: do not be distracted by the Labor-Greens campaign in this area. (Time expired)

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2018-02-13,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:02):  I am very pleased to participate in this MPI on the issue of whether or not there is a need for the federal government to take a stronger, more active and direct role in the regulation of harmful and predatory gambling. I just want to talk from a personal perspective in commencing my remarks in this debate to indicate that, whilst I understand the theoretical argument in Senator Abetz's contribution that individuals should take responsibility for their own behaviour, the issue of children now being involved in online gambling is, I think, a matter that we all, as parents, need to be concerned about. 


Labor's position is that we understand that there are community concerns about the growth of gambling advertising and online betting, including sports betting. I know that one of the problems that we see is that young people, particularly teenagers, are looking at the growth of gambling advertising, particularly around sporting events, and this then becomes an entree into the world of gambling. I must say, from my own personal concerns, I have seen friends of my own children being involved in online gambling. There have been some concerns expressed to me by my children about the impact that this is having on their friends to the extent where you see young people, with their access to smartphones, having the opportunity around the clock to participate in gambling activities. 


I'm not aware of the specific gambling sites that young people are accessing, but I do know the impact that gambling is having on some young people. It impacts on their studies. It impacts on the activities they do in the real world and their opportunity to participate in sporting activities. It can get to the stage where young people spend a great deal of their time online and involved in this type of addictive behaviour. This is a concern to me personally as a parent. I think it behoves all of us to look at that aspect of this issue. 


I want to talk a little bit more a little later on about Labor's position, particularly with respect to the interactive gambling bill that was considered by this parliament a couple of years ago. As I said, we believe that advertising of legitimate sports betting can and should be well-regulated so that we don't see the levels of addiction to gambling arising that I talked about. As I said, we believe that a well-regulated gambling industry must be underpinned by harm minimisation measures. My personal view is that children should be protected from this addiction. 


We know that gambling in our community can have, and in some cases has had, devastating social, financial and emotional consequences. That's why we on this side of the chamber maintain a strong stance to ensure that appropriate harm minimisation measures are in place that protect and assist our community. In fact, when we were last in office we commissioned the Productivity Commission to update its previous reports on the gambling industry in Australia. We rejected recommendations to water down Australia's online-gaming laws until harm minimisation strategies were adopted. In fact, it was Labor that led the way with gambling advertising reform in 2013, when we were in government, by limiting the promotion of betting odds and limiting gambling advertising during live sports broadcasts on television and radio. 


I acknowledge the work that Mr Stephen Jones, the member for Throsby, did to drive those reforms at that time. The bill that was introduced then was designed to limit those gambling ads. Mr Jones was a member of the parliament's Joint Select Gambling Reform Committee and had the intention of rallying support amongst his Labor colleagues to back his private member's bill at the time. It's interesting to note though that, from the other side of the chamber, Mr Frydenberg, the Victorian Liberal, who sat on the gambling reform committee, told the AFL witness at a hearing in March:


… I just think you have not got the balance right. Personally I think there is too much advertising and promotion. I think it is invidious to the sport and I think it is affecting younger people who are exposed to it.


Those are interesting comments. Hopefully, at some point in time there will be bipartisan support for looking more closely at this issue of children being protected from the impacts of online gambling. 


We know that there are these harmful and predatory aspects of the gambling industry, but we also need to understand that there is responsible gambling—when people do it in a manner where there is no harm involved—and that there are benefits to communities across the country from revenue raised through gambling, from the horseracing industry to pokies or pub poker nights. I want to stress, though, that that needs to happen in a responsible way. I acknowledge that there is always the potential for individuals to be caught up in gambling and for there to be devastating consequences. I'm not seeking to make light of that. I understand that, and that is something that we all need to be cognisant of. But responsible gambling can also have some benefits for the community. In my home state of Queensland, the Gambling Community Benefit Fund provides grants to community organisations of between $500 and $35,000, and there are examples across communities of various grants being given to very worthwhile organisations—the Animal Welfare League Queensland, for example. Parents and citizens associations and men's sheds are organisations that are beneficiaries of this particular initiative.


But I want to stress, again, that I'm not making light of gambling. I understand that there are some devastating examples of where individuals are caught up in it and it has significant impacts on the families of individuals. I'm particularly concerned about, as I say, the impact on young people. We also have the country horserace meetings in Queensland which, it's been said, are the lifeblood of many Queensland towns. Queensland has a long history of gaming regulation going back to the 1840s, when we first had it.


So a balanced approach on this particular issue is absolutely essential. We have an approach, on this side of the chamber, of being balanced and productive in these matters. In contrast, we've seen the government having a piecemeal approach, which is typical of their side of politics.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-02-13,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (17:10):  I rise to contribute to this important discussion today. This matter of public importance is calling for stronger and more effective action from the federal government in relation to the scourge that is gambling and gambling addiction across the country. I want to focus most of my contribution today on the harmful effects of poker machines, particularly in my home state of South Australia.


But I just want to pick up on one point first, and that is in relation to the disappointing loopholes that remain in the government's legislation that is meant to be banning gambling during live sport on television. We know, now that we've seen that legislation, that there are carve-outs and exemptions, and it allows for gambling advertising to continue. It allows for gambling advertising to continue on pay TV, where a lot of sport is shown, and it allows gambling advertising to continue until five minutes before the game starts. So you can have all the prematch entertainment going, with kids sitting in front of it and watching, and they'll be bombarded with gambling ads. We need to close those loopholes, and the Greens will be moving amendments to do so, because this type of gambling and predatory advertising of gambling is damaging to viewers, it's damaging to Australian families, and we know how bad it is to have it rammed down our throats and the throats of our children.


We know the enormous, harmful effects that poker machines have caused to Australians right across the country. In my home state of South Australia, we have more poker machines than ever before. It is disgusting to hear the arguments and the squeals from the industry that they can't possibly have a phase-out of poker machines and that it would damage the bank balances of the hotels and the pubs. If you need to rely on people's addiction—on families not being able to afford their rent, their kids' lunchbox meals or their kids' uniforms, because you're sucking and hoovering up money from families through your poker machines—I'd suggest you've got a bad business model. It's one that's corrupt; it's one that's morally bankrupt; and it's a scourge on our community.


Of course, in South Australia we did have a politician once upon a time, Nick Xenophon, who said that this was his No. 1 priority. We're in the middle of a state election right now, and one of the Nick Xenophon Team's own candidates, Paul Brown, reckons it's unrealistic to ban pokies. He said, 'You just can't remove them from every hotel and every pub.' Well, why not? If they're a scourge on the community, then they should be phased out, which is why the Greens in South Australia, through our MLC Tammy Franks, have a very strong policy to phase out pokies in hotels and pubs over five years. She is standing up for the vulnerable South Australian community. She is standing up against the wickedness of the gambling industry. It is the Greens that are leading the way in South Australia. We should phase out the pokie machines. We should get rid of them. They are a scourge on the community. They suck people's livelihoods, their incomes, and it's time that they went.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (17:16):  Thank you to Senator Hanson-Young for ceding the floor to the Liberal Democrats in this debate on gambling. I don't really gamble. The money I'd waste on gambling is no more than the cost of an occasional Lotto ticket. Gambling is not something I find entertaining or worthwhile, but that doesn't mean that I look down on those who consider gambling to be entertaining and worthwhile. Each to their own.


Unfortunately, some people think that whatever they do others should do, and whatever they reject others should reject. Such people seem not to have learned what most babies learn in their first months: that they are different from other people. These people want to ban gambling or severely restrict it, not because they feel empathy for others. They want to do this because they cannot come to terms with other people having a view different from their own.


People with this mindset—and it really is a mind set in clay—don't just apply it to gambling. They apply it to their views on soft drinks, alcohol, smoking and drug taking. They apply it to their views about the shooting community, about supporters of the traditional definition of marriage and about men who flirt with women. They don't like it, and they think that no-one else should be allowed to like it either. This is an infantile mindset, and it is the mindset of an authoritarian.


My party, the Liberal Democrats, is based on libertarian values. We share the view of John Stuart Mill:


That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant.


It is not the purpose of the government to restrict everyone from going about their business in a hopeful attempt to protect a small number of people from harming themselves and their families. We regularly hear of the small numbers of people who gamble unwisely, and figures are tossed around claiming to show how much this problem gambling costs, but we never hear of how the majority of gamblers are not problem gamblers. And no-one ever bothers to estimate the benefits generated from gambling, including the value of the pleasure to those who enjoy it.


Focusing restrictions on problem gamblers while letting the majority of gamblers do what they want is the caring position. It is the grown-up position, and it is the position of those who believe in freedom rather than authoritarianism. But, for the alternative view, let's resume normal programming in the Senate as I cede the floor back to my esteemed colleagues in the Greens.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-02-13,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (17:19):  It's less than three weeks until the Tasmanian election, and the merchants of misery in the pokies sector are trying hard and spending hard to protect the money they are leeching from Tasmanian families, Tasmanian communities and Tasmanian small businesses. Here's a bit of Tasmanian history: since the Labor Party allowed the Federal Group to build the Wrest Point Casino in Tasmania and later handed them a monopoly licence for the state's poker machines in pubs and clubs, we have seen this mutually beneficial relationship deliver the Federal Group and the Farrell family hundreds of millions of dollars. Of course, in return, they funded Labor's election campaigns with tens of thousands of dollars in political donations. If you want a definition of 'corruption' you don't have to look much further.


While Labor has finally and belatedly called time on their relationship with the Federal Group, there are signs going up in the pokies bars around Tasmania right now that basically declare how the Federal Group has bought the Liberal Party lock, stock and barrel. Make no mistake: under the pokies policy the Liberal Party are taking to the Tasmanian election, the Federal Group stand to reap an incredible $75 million windfall—money sucked off the tables of gambling addicts, away from the school levies, away from the power bills, away from the food on the tables, and into the pockets of one of Australia's richest families.


The Federal Group also have questions to answer about their relationship with Michael Kent, the Jacqui Lambie Network candidate, probably one of the most transactional politicians ever seen in Tasmania—believe me, that is really, really saying something. Mr Kent is a strong supporter of poker machines and recently defied reality by denying the existence of pokies addiction in regional Tasmania. The people of Lyons should know that a vote for Michael Kent is a vote for the Federal Group, it's actually a vote for the Liberal Party and it's a vote to lock in pokies harm and misery in Tasmania.


The question is: how much money are the Liberal Party going to get in dodgy donations from the Federal Group in compensation to encourage them to hand over this $75 million windfall? The tragic answer, of course, is that we just don't know. We don't know how much Senator Abetz was paid for getting up in here recently and singing for his supper, as he did earlier in this debate. We don't know how much the Tasmanian Liberals are getting paid—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Order! Senator McKim, Senator Abetz is not here to defend himself, but I must uphold some form of dignity as the Chair. I think at this stage that's seemingly a rather wild accusation, and I'd ask you to carefully choose your words. What I probably would encourage from you, Senator McKim, is that you just withdraw that comment.




Senator McKIM:
  If I might, Chair, what I actually said, if you review the Hansard, was that we do not know how much in donations Senator Abetz has received from the Federal Group. That's a fact, because Tasmania does not have state based political donations disclosure laws.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  A point of order, Senator Gallacher?




Senator Gallacher:
  I clearly heard the imputation that Senator Abetz had 'sung for his supper' and how much he was being paid. I think that is highly disorderly, even though it's very unusual of me to leap to the defence of the other side of the chamber.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Gallacher. I would remind Senator McKim, on that point of order, under standing order 193, it is not appropriate to—what is the word, Clerk?—impute. Senator McKim, I would ask, under those circumstances, for you to please withdraw that comment.




Senator McKIM:
  If it's of assistance to you, Acting Deputy President, I withdraw the assertion that he sung for his supper, but I maintain that we don't know what political donations have been given by the Federal Group to Senator Abetz or any other member of the Tasmanian Liberal Party. We just don't know, and that is not good enough. Who pays the price? The Tasmanian people pay the price. The Tasmanian people are the ones that are losing out, have lost out for decades—



Senator Williams interjecting—




Senator McKIM:
  and will keep losing out, Senator Williams, if the Liberals get into government after the next election. It's crucial for the Tasmanian people—the voters of Tasmania—to understand that the only election result that's going to allow this leeching of food off the table of Tasmanians, this sucking of money out of Tasmanian small businesses, is a Liberal majority government. Any other outcome and the pokies are gone out of pubs and clubs—and so they should be. The Labor Party should never have given that monopoly deal to Federal Hotels in 2002. They had no mandate to do so. They received massive donations in return for it. And now, thankfully, the Labor Party has recovered itself, via the Greens, and the acid is now on the Liberals.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! The time for the discussion has expired.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:25):  I present the report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee on the postal survey concerning same-sex marriage, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee. I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


I will keep my remarks brief. I wish to start by congratulating all of those people who worked so hard to bring about marriage equality for Australia. Many people put their personal stories on the line and were most courageous in standing up to discrimination and pressure to keep quiet about the reality of their lives. People fought bravely and the outcome was well deserved. I really look forward over the coming decades to attending weddings of friends and colleagues who, for the first time, will be allowed to have their love recognised in the way that's been available to the rest of us for so long.


However, this committee was not concerned with the substantive question of marriage equality; it was concerned with the process established by government to determine this question. The committee is disappointed, to say the least, in that process. The government's approach, from the outset, was more concerned about resolving internal political problems than it was about delivering a good policy result for any of the affected groups or for the Australian community as a whole.


The government was warned repeatedly about the problems that might arise if a plebiscite was initiated and, indeed, if the survey was initiated, and specifically about the problems that would arise in terms of hateful material being directed at the LGBTIQ community. And so it came to pass. All of the warnings proved to be correct, and many people reported to our committee the hurt and distress that they and their families experienced from having hateful material propagated throughout their communities, outside their schools, in their shopping centres and on the walls of local buildings and hateful mail in their letterboxes. This process was entirely unnecessary because, at every stage in the process, the parliament needed only to do its job. The parliament needed only to take the opportunity to vote on legislation to bring about marriage equality. The parliament, under the leadership of Malcolm Turnbull, chose not to do so.


Our committee makes just three recommendations: We recommend that questions of human rights for minority groups should never again be resolved by public vote. We recommend that, given the evidence of harm done to the LGBTIQ community, the government consider how further funding and support could be offered to mental health and LGBTIQ communities and organisations to help address the consequences of the postal survey. And, given the evidence around participation in remote areas—and particularly Indigenous participation—we recommend that the AEC act urgently to engage with those communities to increase the number of enrolled people in remote areas and to increase the participation of those enrolled people in local, state and federal elections.


I know other senators wish to contribute on this same matter. I will leave my remarks there. I thank my fellow senators for the serious and sober way that they approached this question and the diligence with which they applied themselves to it.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2018-02-13,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (17:30):  I also seek to take note of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee report on the postal survey concerning same-sex marriage. I congratulate Senator McAllister for her chairing of this committee, because I think this report is a very comprehensive assessment of the issues associated with holding a postal survey, a public vote on an issue of human rights. Achieving marriage equality was a massive achievement at the end of last year—certainly the highlight of my 3½ years in the Senate so far—but it was achieved at a cost, and it was an unnecessary cost.


There is great joy around the nation now as people are getting married. I haven't got to any of the wonderful weddings yet—the first one that I'm going to is in a fortnight's time—but the photos, the videos and the sharing on social media as people can finally marry the person they love are terrific. But we should not have had to go through the process of having a public vote in order to achieve this, and this report outlines the reasons why that pathway to achieve marriage equality was far from optimal. It was up to this parliament to vote on marriage equality. We could have had the vote in the parliament that we had in the last sitting weeks of last year without going through the harm and the tortuous process of this postal survey, but that was the process that the government headed us down. That's what we all had to grit our teeth and get through in order to get to the prize of people's human rights being respected and celebrated so that people, regardless of their gender or sexuality, were able to marry.


So the first finding of this report is the most pertinent one. The experience of that postal survey makes it very clear that questions of human rights for minority groups should not be resolved by a public vote, and there is so much documentation that's outlined in this report as to why that's the case. Having this public survey unleashed such an avalanche of hateful and discriminatory material—material which was inciting hatred towards lesbian, gay and bisexual people and particularly towards transgender, gender-diverse and intersex people.


I just want to read some of the accounts that are outlined in our committee report. Firstly, just to set the context of why this matters, it's not just that these were hurtful, harmful things for my community to have to endure and put up with. It had a huge impact on the mental health of that community. The New South Wales Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby provided a catalogue of material which had already been disseminated prior to the survey being mailed out, and they noted:


Such material … has significant impact on the mental health of so many LGBTIQ Australians. Young LGBTIQ people are at a six times greater risk of suicide, and this material which perpetuates hateful and offensive comments is not likely to improve this situation.


That's an understatement. They also note:


The rates of suicide among young trans and intersex people are even higher, with young trans people being 35% more likely to attempt suicide.


Then this committee received submissions from people who outlined their experience of what they went through during this survey period. A 42-year-old transgender man from rural Queensland submitted his experience of the postal survey to the committee. He said:


After the Survey was announced, my world becomes hell. It was the hate and vitriol of the 1990s that I experienced, but this time our Prime Minister gave this hatred a name—respectful debate.


Another submitter described the broader effect of the postal survey on LGBTIQ people. They said:


The Postal survey to a gay and lesbian person was never just about … [same-sex marriage], it seemed like it was a survey on whether gay and lesbian people were good enough for the Australian people. Having the whole Country vote on this was a horrible feeling and having them judge you, brought up all sorts of emotions from my youth.


There were a number of surveys that various LGBTI advocacy organisations conducted on the impact of the study. The National LGBTI Health Alliance did a survey of nearly 10,000 LGBTIQ people, and they found that more than 90 per cent of respondents reported the postal vote had a negative impact on them to some degree. It said:


The most shocking finding of the study was that LGBTIQ respondents said that experiences of verbal and physical assaults more than doubled in the three months following the announcement of the postal survey compared with the prior six months.


They reported an increase of more than a third in depression, anxiety and stress during the same period.


Almost 80% of LGBTIQ people and almost 60% of allies said they found the marriage equality debate considerably or extremely stressful.


These survey results were replicated in other surveys, including ones undertaken by SHINE South Australia and just.equal.


The committee received a really heartbreaking letter, which was in the submission from Rainbow Families in New South Wales. It shared the experience of Kate and her family. It said:


We received two personalised letters from our neighbours expressing their traditional views on marriage and their negative thoughts about our family and the wider LGBTIQ community … The letters spoke about ""militant lesbians storming our churches and mosques demanding to get married"" …


It said:


We cried for that whole weekend and were scared to check our letter box on the Sunday … We started to think about moving out … We stopped going to the local parks … avoided going to the local supermarket. We became hermits and didn't want to be seen in the local community. My heart rate went up every time I opened the front door and went out the front for fear of seeing the neighbours. We tried to shield our 2-year-old son from our pain - but he could see it. One night he said ""I’m scared of the neighbours"". This was so upsetting to hear. Neighbours who we had been friendly with started being less friendly - or were we just being paranoid? My partner and I both took sick days off from work and we also left our home and area for safer more accepting areas to try and get away from it all.


This typifies the impacts of this survey on so many people. I think it's a really important learning that has been documented in this committee report as to why such a survey should never be done again.


The second important finding of our inquiry is that, given this impact on LGBTIQ people and their mental health, there is an urgent need to invest more money in mental health services for the LGBTI community. In fact, we're in a situation where not all of the budget allocation of $122 million for the postal survey was spent. It came in $41 million under budget. So the second recommendation of our committee report is that the government should consider how further funding and support could be offered to mental health and LGBTIQ organisations to help address the consequences of the postal survey. The Greens go further than that. We think that all of that $41.5 million should all be allocated to mental health services and other support services for the LGBTIQ community, to at least try to make up for some of the pain and the suffering and the hurt and the discrimination and the prejudice that was felt during this postal survey.


The final recommendation of the report reflected on how not all people got to participate in this survey equally, and that people in remote communities and Indigenous people were much more likely to not vote in the survey. We are recommending that the Australian Electoral Commission actively engaged with remote communities and Indigenous peak bodies to increase the number of enrolled people and to increase their participation. That's another very important finding. Our democracy in Australia is to be treasured. It works mostly; we have to make sure we can make it work even better.


Sadly, having plebiscites isn't the best way to make our democracy work for us. We know that we are here and that we should have been able to vote. But we need to make sure that more people are actively involved in voting and more people are actively involved in expressing their views constructively and positively so that we can have a more informed community. I'm hoping that, having put this experience in the past, we can move on from this and really celebrate the diversity of our community, celebrate the rights of our community and vow to work forward together to make sure that those rights are genuinely appreciated by everybody in our society.

"Kitching, Sen Kimberley",ALP,2018-02-13,"



Senator KITCHING
 (Victoria) (17:40):  I'm pleased to have this opportunity to comment on the report of the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee on the conduct of last year's postal survey on the question of marriage equality. I commend Senator McAllister as the chair and the other members of the committee on the work done in the limited time made available to the committee.


Now that marriage equality is a reality in Australia, it would be very easy for us on this side of the chamber to say, 'Well, all's well that ends well,' and let this matter drop. Despite our objections, the postal survey took place. It seems to have been managed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics without major problems—in fact, the ABS was thrown into the deep end in a little bit of a surprise manoeuvre from the government. There was an 80 per cent turnout, and more than 60 per cent of Australians voted for marriage equality. Finally, after some mostly respectful debate, marriage equality was put into law by this parliament last December.


But I think we should resist the temptation to put this episode behind us, especially without any analysis. Although the process insisted on by the government eventually produced the outcome that the majority of Australians wanted, the criticisms that we on this side made of this process remain valid. Before I look at some of the points made in the committee's report—and some of those have been mentioned by Senator McAllister and Senator Rice—I want to restate some of those objections. The most fundamental of our objections to the postal survey was that it was a complete, unnecessary waste of $80 million and an abdication of the responsibility of this parliament. The people of Australia elected this parliament to carry on their business, to debate and to vote on legislation.


The original Marriage Act was passed by parliament in 1960. It was amended by parliament in 2004 to preclude the possibility of same-sex marriages being recognised in Australia. On neither occasion was a plebiscite or survey thought necessary. If the Marriage Act was to be amended again to create marriage equality, it was the job of the parliament to amend it. Why were we forced to accept the waste of time and money represented by the postal survey? Why was the parliament not allowed to do the job it was elected to do? There was only one reason, and that was the weakness of the Prime Minister in his own cabinet and in his own party, which made it impossible for the government to allow the parliament to debate and vote on this question, even on a private member's bill. There was too great a risk that the deep split in the Liberal Party and the lack of support that the Prime Minister enjoys in his own cabinet and in his own party would be exposed. This is why the committee said, in its first recommendation:


… questions of human rights for minority groups should not be resolved by a public vote.


That is a basic lesson to be learned from this exercise. While I don't have much confidence that the present government will accept it, I hope future governments will not repeat this folly.


We also objected to the idea of a plebiscite or postal survey because of the likelihood that such an exercise would lead to campaigns of abuse and denigration against people from the LGBTI community. One of the reasons we have a representative democracy rather than a so-called direct democracy based on plebiscites is that representative democracy allows the passions and prejudices that exist in any political community to be mediated through the parliamentary process. Not for nothing is the plebiscite known as the tool of despots and demagogues.


Sadly but predictably, our fears on this front were fully justified. Let me quote from the committee's report:


This committee has received evidence from a large number of submitters about offensive and misleading behaviour and material that has been deeply distressing to the LGBTIQ community and highly divisive within the community more broadly. It is the committee's view that this behaviour and material is a direct result of the postal survey process and would not have occurred had the parliament simply debated and voted on legislation to legalise same-sex marriage.


The committee's report comments on the Marriage Law Survey (Additional Safeguards) Bill 2017, which was the government's response to the torrent of abuse provoked by the decision to hold the postal survey. The committee noted that this bill proved insufficient to curb much of the offensive material distributed by mail and throughout social media.


I agree with the committee's conclusion:


… much of this material was offensive not by accident but by design … the authors intended to … cause offence and hurt to others. It is disappointing that the government gave them an excuse to do so by pursuing a public vote on the question of same sex marriage.


In the light of all of this, the committee report recommends:


… the Australian Government consider how further funding and support could be offered to mental health and LGBTIQ organisations to help address the consequences of the postal survey.


Senator Rice has spoken at greater length about this.


I would strongly support the whole of the report and the recommendations contained at the back of that report, and I hope the government can act upon that report promptly.

There is great joy around the nation now as people are getting married. I haven't got to any of the wonderful weddings yet—the first one that I'm going to is in a fortnight's time—but the photos, the videos and the sharing on social media as people can finally marry the person they love are terrific. But we should not have had to go through the process of having a public vote in order to achieve this, and this report outlines the reasons why that pathway to achieve marriage equality was far from optimal. It was up to this parliament to vote on marriage equality. We could have had the vote in the parliament that we had in the last sitting weeks of last year without going through the harm and the tortuous process of this postal survey, but that was the process that the government headed us down. That's what we all had to grit our teeth and get through in order to get to the prize of people's human rights being respected and celebrated so that people, regardless of their gender or sexuality, were able to marry.


So the first finding of this report is the most pertinent one. The experience of that postal survey makes it very clear that questions of human rights for minority groups should not be resolved by a public vote, and there is so much documentation that's outlined in this report as to why that's the case. Having this public survey unleashed such an avalanche of hateful and discriminatory material—material which was inciting hatred towards lesbian, gay and bisexual people and particularly towards transgender, gender-diverse and intersex people.


I just want to read some of the accounts that are outlined in our committee report. Firstly, just to set the context of why this matters, it's not just that these were hurtful, harmful things for my community to have to endure and put up with. It had a huge impact on the mental health of that community. The New South Wales Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby provided a catalogue of material which had already been disseminated prior to the survey being mailed out, and they noted:


Such material … has significant impact on the mental health of so many LGBTIQ Australians. Young LGBTIQ people are at a six times greater risk of suicide, and this material which perpetuates hateful and offensive comments is not likely to improve this situation.


That's an understatement. They also note:


The rates of suicide among young trans and intersex people are even higher, with young trans people being 35% more likely to attempt suicide.


Then this committee received submissions from people who outlined their experience of what they went through during this survey period. A 42-year-old transgender man from rural Queensland submitted his experience of the postal survey to the committee. He said:


After the Survey was announced, my world becomes hell. It was the hate and vitriol of the 1990s that I experienced, but this time our Prime Minister gave this hatred a name—respectful debate.


Another submitter described the broader effect of the postal survey on LGBTIQ people. They said:


The Postal survey to a gay and lesbian person was never just about … [same-sex marriage], it seemed like it was a survey on whether gay and lesbian people were good enough for the Australian people. Having the whole Country vote on this was a horrible feeling and having them judge you, brought up all sorts of emotions from my youth.


There were a number of surveys that various LGBTI advocacy organisations conducted on the impact of the study. The National LGBTI Health Alliance did a survey of nearly 10,000 LGBTIQ people, and they found that more than 90 per cent of respondents reported the postal vote had a negative impact on them to some degree. It said:


The most shocking finding of the study was that LGBTIQ respondents said that experiences of verbal and physical assaults more than doubled in the three months following the announcement of the postal survey compared with the prior six months.


They reported an increase of more than a third in depression, anxiety and stress during the same period.


Almost 80% of LGBTIQ people and almost 60% of allies said they found the marriage equality debate considerably or extremely stressful.


These survey results were replicated in other surveys, including ones undertaken by SHINE South Australia and just.equal.


The committee received a really heartbreaking letter, which was in the submission from Rainbow Families in New South Wales. It shared the experience of Kate and her family. It said:


We received two personalised letters from our neighbours expressing their traditional views on marriage and their negative thoughts about our family and the wider LGBTIQ community … The letters spoke about ""militant lesbians storming our churches and mosques demanding to get married"" …


It said:


We cried for that whole weekend and were scared to check our letter box on the Sunday … We started to think about moving out … We stopped going to the local parks … avoided going to the local supermarket. We became hermits and didn't want to be seen in the local community. My heart rate went up every time I opened the front door and went out the front for fear of seeing the neighbours. We tried to shield our 2-year-old son from our pain - but he could see it. One night he said ""I’m scared of the neighbours"". This was so upsetting to hear. Neighbours who we had been friendly with started being less friendly - or were we just being paranoid? My partner and I both took sick days off from work and we also left our home and area for safer more accepting areas to try and get away from it all.


This typifies the impacts of this survey on so many people. I think it's a really important learning that has been documented in this committee report as to why such a survey should never be done again.


The second important finding of our inquiry is that, given this impact on LGBTIQ people and their mental health, there is an urgent need to invest more money in mental health services for the LGBTI community. In fact, we're in a situation where not all of the budget allocation of $122 million for the postal survey was spent. It came in $41 million under budget. So the second recommendation of our committee report is that the government should consider how further funding and support could be offered to mental health and LGBTIQ organisations to help address the consequences of the postal survey. The Greens go further than that. We think that all of that $41.5 million should all be allocated to mental health services and other support services for the LGBTIQ community, to at least try to make up for some of the pain and the suffering and the hurt and the discrimination and the prejudice that was felt during this postal survey.


The final recommendation of the report reflected on how not all people got to participate in this survey equally, and that people in remote communities and Indigenous people were much more likely to not vote in the survey. We are recommending that the Australian Electoral Commission actively engaged with remote communities and Indigenous peak bodies to increase the number of enrolled people and to increase their participation. That's another very important finding. Our democracy in Australia is to be treasured. It works mostly; we have to make sure we can make it work even better.


Sadly, having plebiscites isn't the best way to make our democracy work for us. We know that we are here and that we should have been able to vote. But we need to make sure that more people are actively involved in voting and more people are actively involved in expressing their views constructively and positively so that we can have a more informed community. I'm hoping that, having put this experience in the past, we can move on from this and really celebrate the diversity of our community, celebrate the rights of our community and vow to work forward together to make sure that those rights are genuinely appreciated by everybody in our society.

"Kitching, Sen Kimberley",ALP,2018-02-13,"



Senator KITCHING
 (Victoria) (17:40):  I'm pleased to have this opportunity to comment on the report of the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee on the conduct of last year's postal survey on the question of marriage equality. I commend Senator McAllister as the chair and the other members of the committee on the work done in the limited time made available to the committee.


Now that marriage equality is a reality in Australia, it would be very easy for us on this side of the chamber to say, 'Well, all's well that ends well,' and let this matter drop. Despite our objections, the postal survey took place. It seems to have been managed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics without major problems—in fact, the ABS was thrown into the deep end in a little bit of a surprise manoeuvre from the government. There was an 80 per cent turnout, and more than 60 per cent of Australians voted for marriage equality. Finally, after some mostly respectful debate, marriage equality was put into law by this parliament last December.


But I think we should resist the temptation to put this episode behind us, especially without any analysis. Although the process insisted on by the government eventually produced the outcome that the majority of Australians wanted, the criticisms that we on this side made of this process remain valid. Before I look at some of the points made in the committee's report—and some of those have been mentioned by Senator McAllister and Senator Rice—I want to restate some of those objections. The most fundamental of our objections to the postal survey was that it was a complete, unnecessary waste of $80 million and an abdication of the responsibility of this parliament. The people of Australia elected this parliament to carry on their business, to debate and to vote on legislation.


The original Marriage Act was passed by parliament in 1960. It was amended by parliament in 2004 to preclude the possibility of same-sex marriages being recognised in Australia. On neither occasion was a plebiscite or survey thought necessary. If the Marriage Act was to be amended again to create marriage equality, it was the job of the parliament to amend it. Why were we forced to accept the waste of time and money represented by the postal survey? Why was the parliament not allowed to do the job it was elected to do? There was only one reason, and that was the weakness of the Prime Minister in his own cabinet and in his own party, which made it impossible for the government to allow the parliament to debate and vote on this question, even on a private member's bill. There was too great a risk that the deep split in the Liberal Party and the lack of support that the Prime Minister enjoys in his own cabinet and in his own party would be exposed. This is why the committee said, in its first recommendation:


… questions of human rights for minority groups should not be resolved by a public vote.


That is a basic lesson to be learned from this exercise. While I don't have much confidence that the present government will accept it, I hope future governments will not repeat this folly.


We also objected to the idea of a plebiscite or postal survey because of the likelihood that such an exercise would lead to campaigns of abuse and denigration against people from the LGBTI community. One of the reasons we have a representative democracy rather than a so-called direct democracy based on plebiscites is that representative democracy allows the passions and prejudices that exist in any political community to be mediated through the parliamentary process. Not for nothing is the plebiscite known as the tool of despots and demagogues.


Sadly but predictably, our fears on this front were fully justified. Let me quote from the committee's report:


This committee has received evidence from a large number of submitters about offensive and misleading behaviour and material that has been deeply distressing to the LGBTIQ community and highly divisive within the community more broadly. It is the committee's view that this behaviour and material is a direct result of the postal survey process and would not have occurred had the parliament simply debated and voted on legislation to legalise same-sex marriage.


The committee's report comments on the Marriage Law Survey (Additional Safeguards) Bill 2017, which was the government's response to the torrent of abuse provoked by the decision to hold the postal survey. The committee noted that this bill proved insufficient to curb much of the offensive material distributed by mail and throughout social media.


I agree with the committee's conclusion:


… much of this material was offensive not by accident but by design … the authors intended to … cause offence and hurt to others. It is disappointing that the government gave them an excuse to do so by pursuing a public vote on the question of same sex marriage.


In the light of all of this, the committee report recommends:


… the Australian Government consider how further funding and support could be offered to mental health and LGBTIQ organisations to help address the consequences of the postal survey.


Senator Rice has spoken at greater length about this.


I would strongly support the whole of the report and the recommendations contained at the back of that report, and I hope the government can act upon that report promptly.

That these bills be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speeches read as follows—



MIGRATION AMENDMENT (SKILLING AUSTRALIANS FUND) BILL 2018


The Migration Amendment (Skilling Australians Fund) Bill 2018 amends the Migration Act 1958 to provide for the collection of a nomination training contribution charge from employers nominating overseas skilled workers.


This measure is a critical element of the Government's employer sponsored skilled migration reforms, which ensure that Australian workers have priority for jobs in this country.


I now turn to examine the Bill in more detail.


Concurrent with the introduction of the Temporary Skill Shortage visa, the Government is introducing a nomination training contribution charge, to be known as the Skilling Australians Fund levy.


The purpose of the Skilling Australians Fund levy is to require employers seeking to access overseas skilled workers to contribute to the broader skills development of Australians.


From March 2018, it is intended that the Skilling Australians Fund levy will be payable by employers nominating workers for the:


 Temporary Skill Shortage (TSS) visa;


 Employer Nomination Scheme (ENS) (subclass 186) visa; and


 Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme (RSMS) (subclass 187) visa.


The Skilling Australians Fund levy will replace the current training benchmark requirement, reducing the regulatory burden on employers and providing improved training outcomes for Australians.


Since 2009, employers sponsoring an overseas worker for a Subclass 457 visa have been required to demonstrate expenditure of at least one per cent of their business' payroll annually on the training of Australians, or alternatively, pay an amount equivalent to two per cent of their business' payroll into an industry training fund.


This system is overly complex and lacks transparency.


The Skilling Australians Fund levy will fully replace these training benchmark arrangements.


The creation of the Skilling Australians Fund aligns with recommendations by the 2014 Azarias Review of the Integrity of the Subclass 457 Program, and the 2016 Senate Inquiry into the exploitation of temporary workers in Australia (Temporary Worker Senate Inquiry).


The Skilling Australians Fund levy will offset expenditure from the Skilling Australians Fund, a training fund administered by the Department of Education and Training (DET), to support the skills development of Australians.


The levy is expected to generate $1.2 billion revenue for the training of Australians over the forward estimates.


As the levy will not be charged until March 2018, the Government will provide an additional $261.2 million in 2017-18 to the Skilling Australians Fund.


From 2018-19 onwards, the Skilling Australians Fund will funded by revenue raised from the levy.


The establishment of the Skilling Australians Fund will create a direct link between skilled migration and the training of Australians.


The Government is committed to skilling Australians so they can get jobs at all levels and occupations across the Australian economy. With matched funding from the states and territories, the Skilling Australians Fund will support up to 300,000 more apprentices, trainees, and pre- and higher-level apprenticeships and traineeships.


Spending from the Skilling Australians Fund will be prioritised towards projects brought forward from states and territory governments which support training in key areas, including:





occupations in demand






occupations with a reliance on foreign workers






industries and sectors of future growth






trade apprenticeships







rural and regional areas






people from targeted cohorts, and






industries experiencing structural adjustment.



All project proposals will need to demonstrate engagement with, and support from, employers and industry.


This represents a significant Government commitment to ensure Australians can gain the skills to fill Australian jobs and succeed in a valuable career.


Employers will be charged the Skilling Australians Fund levy for each overseas worker nominated to fill a vacancy in Australia.


The amount of the levy will depend on the size of the business and the type and duration of the visa that the worker is nominated for.


It is intended that small businesses, those with annual turnover of less than $10 million, will be required to pay:


$1200 per year for each temporary overseas worker


a one off Skilling Australians Fund levy of $3000 for each permanent overseas worker


Businesses with an annual turnover of $10 million dollars or more will be required to pay:


$1800 per year for each temporary overseas worker


a one off payment of $5000 for each permanent overseas worker


While the Skilling Australians Fund levy will vary depending on the size of the business and the intended length of stay of the overseas worker, it is in the order of magnitude of $4000 per worker recommended by the Temporary Worker Senate Inquiry.


The Skilling Australians Fund levy for the entire proposed period that the temporary worker intends to work in Australia will be collected at the time the employer nominates the overseas worker for sponsorship.


There will be no levy exemptions, reflecting the policy intent that employers seeking to access overseas skilled workers contribute to the broader skills development of Australians.


However, the Skilling Australians Fund levy will be tax deductible, and it will not be applied retrospectively —employers will not be liable to pay a levy for existing overseas workers unless the worker is nominated by that business for a new visa.


It is intended that refunds of the Skilling Australians Fund levy will be available in certain circumstances, such as where an employer's sponsorship application is refused.


The Bill also includes amendments which will improve the visa application process.


Specifically, the Bill amends the Act to formalise the current practice of accepting nominations for temporary overseas skilled workers by


businesses that have applied to be a sponsor or entered into negotiations for a work agreement,


rather than waiting for the outcome of that process.


These amendments will result in improved efficiency for both employers and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection.


The Bill also amends the Act to provide that the Minister may prescribe the manner in which labour market testing (LMT) must be conducted.


The Act requires that evidence of LMT must be provided with a nomination by a standard business sponsor unless:


 an exemption applies due to a major disaster;


 an exemption applies on the basis of the required skill level and occupation for a nominated position; or


 it would be inconsistent with Australia's international trade obligations.


The Bill amends the Act to provide that the Minister may, by legislative instrument, determine the manner in which labour market testing in relation to a nominated position must be


undertaken and may determine the kinds of evidence of LMT that must accompany a nomination.


The matters to be prescribed in an instrument are expected to include the language in which a job advertisement must be written, the method of advertisement, the period the advertisement occurs in, and the period the advertisement must run for.


This Bill will ensure a uniform approach to LMT from employers seeking to access an overseas worker.


It will also ensure that the quality of the LMT being conducted is properly assessed.


This amendment will help ensure that, where LMT is required, businesses properly test the labour market before nominating an overseas worker for a prescribed visa and provide evidence of that LMT.


The Skilling Australians Fund is a further demonstration of the Government's commitment to Australian businesses and workers.


It will support targeted investment in critical skill needs in key regions and industries in the economy.


The administration of the Skilling Australians Fund levy will also increase the transparency and accountability of training contributions made by employers utilising the skilled migration program.


This will increase public confidence that skilled migration, and the businesses that bring in skilled migrants, are doing their part to help Australians prepare for the workforce.


I commend the Bill to the Chamber.


MIGRATION (SKILLING AUSTRALIANS FUND) CHARGES BILL 2017


The Migration (Skilling Australians Fund) Charges Bill 2017 imposes the nomination training contribution charge, as payable under new section 140ZM of the Migration Act. 


This charge is to be known as the Skilling Australians Fund (SAF) levy. 


The Bill is a complementary measure to the Migration Amendment (Skilling Australians Fund) Bill 2017, which amends the Migration Act to provide for the collection of the SAF levy. 


The Bill provides that the amount of the SAF levy is the charge set in the Regulations. 


The Bill also provides that the SAF levy must not exceed the charge limit. 


The charge limit in the financial year beginning on 1 July 2017 is $8000 for a nomination relating to a temporary visa, and $5,500 for a nomination relating to a permanent visa. 


In subsequent financial years the charge limit will be indexed by reference to the Consumer Price Index. 


This charge limit provides flexibility for the Australian Government to make increases to the SAF levy in future while providing certainty for business as to the limited scope for a potential increase.


For temporary visas, the intention is that the SAF levy payable will be calculated according to the number of years, or part thereof, set out in the nomination. 


The charge limit for temporary visas is therefore calculated with reference to the SAF levy for a large business, $1800 for each year of nomination, for a total of 4 years.

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (18:27):  Before my speech was interrupted, I was saying that my Labor colleagues in the House of Representatives Terri Butler and Tim Watts introduced a private member's bill to create new offences in relation to the use of a carriage service for sharing private sexual material. Sadly, this bill didn't get any further than Mr Watts introducing it and delivering his second reading speech before it lapsed because of the proroguing of parliament. But, despite Labor's private member's bill lapsing, we have continued to pursue this issue.


Labor went to the last federal election promising Commonwealth legislation to criminalise non-consensual sharing of intimate images within the first 100 days of being elected. In October 2016, we reintroduced our private member's bill. However, it was removed from the Notice Paper in May last year because the government continually refused to bring it on for debate. While the national conversation about the need to criminalise this behaviour has gone on for years, the Abbott-Turnbull government has been dragging its feet. This bill comes two years after Labor introduced its private member's bill—two years!—and we've been calling for stronger measures by the Commonwealth to tackle this problem for some time.


I'm in no doubt that my disappointment at the delay in the government's response is shared by the victims of this horrendous behaviour. The non-consensual sharing of intimate images is a gross breach of privacy. What makes this crime particularly horrific is that the consequences for victims can potentially last a lifetime, because once an image has been shared online it becomes almost impossible to retrieve and destroy every copy of that image. Even if the shared content is successfully erased, the victim is left with the fear that the image may still be out there somewhere. And destroying the image does not erase the shame and the humiliation that the victim has suffered.


The Australian Information Commissioner summed up well the impact of this behaviour in a submission to the Department of Communications' consultation on this bill. The commissioner said: 'The non-consensual sharing of these images is a serious invasion of privacy which has the potential to cause severe harm, distress and humiliation to victims. Further, the harm that can be caused through the sharing of such images is exacerbated by the rapidly increasing technological capacity for capturing images and making recordings and the ability to distribute digital material on a vast scale.' This behaviour needs to be criminalised because it is a form of abuse. It is an increasingly common manifestation of family violence and it is used by perpetrators to use the threat of humiliation to exercise power and control over their victims.


A recent study published by RMIT in May last year found that a high level of psychological distress was experienced by victims of image based abuse. For many victims this was accompanied by a moderate to severe level of depression and/or anxiety. Twenty eight per cent of victims reported that they feared for their safety as a result of image based abuse. While the number of male and female victims was roughly the same, women were more likely than men to report being fearful for their safety; and those fears were greater when there was a threat to distribute an image, rather than the actual distribution of the image. Women were more likely than men to experience image based abuse from a male perpetrator; and the study suggests that, for women victims, it is more often associated with stalking or domestic violence victimisation.


Another reason for the urgent need to address this behaviour is that it's becoming more and more widespread. In his second reading speech to the House, Mr Watts pointed out that one in 10 Australians reported that someone has posted online or sent to others a nude or semi-nude image of them without their consent. The RMIT study to which I referred earlier, with is more recent, found that one in five Australians has experienced the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. With the problem so widespread and having such a profound impact on its victims there is a compelling case for a strong response. And, as if it isn't bad enough that the Turnbull government has dragged its feet for so long, the bill before us now does not go nearly far enough in addressing this problem.


It is important that the parliament sends a strong message to the community that sharing intimate images without consent is not acceptable. But the message needs to be a lot stronger than just a civil penalty regime. The strength of a criminal offence is not just in the severity of the penalties or the fact that it is the police that take action against the offender; it is also in the statement it makes to the public about the seriousness of the behaviour.


The Top End Women's Legal Service in Darwin, which made a submission to the Senate revenge porn inquiry, pointed out that 'a criminal offence also serves a symbolic and educative function, and a tailored offence would clearly highlight and reinforce the wrongfulness of this behaviour. The government's refusal to make this behaviour a criminal offence is out of step with the Australian community.' The RMIT study I referred to earlier also found that four in five Australians agreed that it should be a crime to share sexual or nude pictures without permission. This attitude is fairly consistent throughout the community, regardless of whether the respondents were victims or not.


This is a gap in the law that has to be addressed. It is currently a criminal offence in Victoria and South Australia to share an intimate or invasive image without consent. It is also an offence in both of those states to threaten the distribution of such an image. Without a Commonwealth offence, this leaves a gap in the law across the remainder of the states and territories. It is just not good enough to leave the legislative response to the states and territories. Like most things that happen in the online environment, it is more appropriately dealt with through the Commonwealth Criminal Code. Not only would a Commonwealth law be a simpler way to ensure national consistency in how these offences are dealt with; it would also make it clearer how these crimes are to be dealt with when they happen across state borders.


The government argues that there is no need to introduce a new criminal offence, because section 474.17 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code makes it an offence to use a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offence. As the RMIT study points out, many legal experts in their research said this offence is broad in scope and is not enforced well when it comes to image based offences. A civil penalty could actually make the situation worse as it may encourage police to refer cases to the eSafety Commissioner instead of prosecuting.


Labor has asked questions in Senate estimates about how many charges have been proven against defendants for non-consensual sharing of intimate images, and the response from the Australian Federal Police was that, for prosecutions brought about by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, 844 charges have been proven against 410 defendants between the introduction of section 474.17 in 2004 and 5 December 2016. But it's unclear how many of these prosecutions were for image based offences, and without this information we have no evidence that a significant number or, indeed, any instances of image based abuse are resulting in successful prosecutions by the Commonwealth.


The application of this section to image based abuse was also explored in the revenge porn Senate inquiry. The Australian Federal Police told the inquiry that this section had not been used in relation to non-consensual sharing of intimate images. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions also gave evidence to the inquiry and raised questions as to how effectively the section could be applied in the context of non-consensual sharing of intimate images. There are a number of aspects of non-consensual sharing of intimate images that were not contemplated in the legislation, such as whether the victim 'held and maintained an expectation of privacy in relation to the image'. The CDPP also pointed out that the section would not apply to image based abuse unless it takes place online, so it would not address behaviour such as sharing hard copies of images. Even if since the inquiry section 474.17 has been tested for image based abuse, considering that one in five Australians report experiencing such abuse, those prosecutions would be a drop in the ocean. 


The need for a specific Commonwealth offence was also explored by the RMIT study, which consulted legal experts. The study's report observed:


Overall, in Australia there is a piecemeal legislative approach to image-based abuse, with no nationally consistent criminal laws, the majority of jurisdictions do not have specific offences, and the civil law is out of reach for most Australians without the financial resources to seek justice. The harms associated with image-based abuse further warrant it being specifically classified as a federal telecommunications criminal offence.


The case for a Commonwealth criminal offence is obviously compelling. A civil penalty simply does not go far enough in recognising the seriousness of image based abuse. Introducing a criminal offence sends a strong signal to the perpetrators that not only is the behaviour they're engaging in abuse and unacceptable but it is a crime. While we're disappointed that this bill does not go far enough, Labor will, however, support this bill because it is at least a step in the right direction, and it's better than doing nothing to prevent the hurt and distress that image based abuse causes to victims.


While the bill fails to make non-consensual sharing of intimate images a criminal offence, it includes a number of other important provisions. One of these is a legally enforceable take-down notice to try to remove images from websites. While a take-down notice is a useful mechanism for non-complying content providers, I acknowledge that social media platforms have worked hard to put in place policies and practices that quickly respond to instances of image based abuse. In January 2013, Labor in government signed an agreement with Facebook, Google, Yahoo and Microsoft to develop robust processes to deal with complaints of cyberbullying and to undertake education and awareness-raising activities. Some of the take-down policies of major social media platforms provide for faster removal of offensive content than the 48 hours stipulated in this bill.


The eSafety Commissioner will of course seek to use established relationships with internet service and social media providers to informally seek the taking down of images, but it helps to have enforcement action as a backup option. It's also important to have a one-stop-shop complaints mechanism administered by the eSafety Commissioner, and this bill complements the online complaints portal pilot that was launched by the commissioner last October.


As I've stated, this bill is a step in the right direction, but the government need to go further. They need to send a much stronger message to the perpetrators of this abuse that society will not tolerate their behaviour. Labor believes, and legal experts and the Australian public agree, that there is a need for a specific Commonwealth criminal offence for the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. I urge the government to revisit the private member's bill put forward by Mr Watts and Ms Butler in the House, and to work with Labor on further strengthening our response to the despicable practice of the sharing of intimate images without consent.

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (18:40):  I rise to speak to the Enhancing Online Safety (Non-consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Bill 2017. As noted earlier today by my colleague Senator Jordon Steele-John, the Australian Greens welcome and support this bill because we support action to protect those who experience or may experience the abuse, threats, extortion or other harm caused by the non-consensual sharing of their intimate images or threats to share such images. I'm heartened that the government has listened to the voices in this chamber and across Australia who have been calling for a long time for legislation that deals with non-consensual sharing of images.


While this bill is a welcome step in protecting people from the non-consensual sharing of images, the Greens consider that this bill has been brought on for debate far too quickly. Yes, we need legislation, but it would have been much better for this legislation to have had the opportunity to go through the standard Senate process of a committee inquiry, because then this bill would, I am certain, have been improved from what it is today. We have some amendments that we're going to be moving to this bill that will improve it, but I'm certain that if we'd had the chance to have the scrutiny of a Senate inquiry process we would have ended up with much better legislation. I think it's disappointing the government has brought this bill on before it is ready.


In-depth research conducted by RMIT University found the issue of non-consensual sharing of images affects a wide cross-section of the community. The key findings of the research demonstrate the extent of the problem and why we must address it. One in five Australians have experienced image based abuse. Victims of image based abuse experience high levels of psychological distress. Women and men are equally likely to report being a victim. Perpetrators of image based abuse are most likely to be male and known to the victim. Men and young adults are more likely to voluntarily share a nude or sexual image of themselves. Women are more likely than men to fear for their safety due to image based abuse. Abuse risk is higher for those who share sexual selfies, but they aren't the only victims. One in two Australians with a disability report being a victim of image based abuse. Let that sink in: one in two Australians with a disability. One in two Indigenous Australians report image based abuse and victimisation. Image based abuse and victimisation is higher for lesbian, gay and bisexual Australians. Young people aged 16 to 29 years are also at high risk of image based abuse. Critically, given the impact of this, it is heartening to know that four out of five Australians agree that it should be a crime to share sexual or nude images without permission.


It's worth noting that men make up the majority of perpetrators when it comes to non-consensual sharing of intimate images, and that women are more likely than men to be victimised by an intimate partner or ex-partner. It's in this context that I am talking tonight, as the Greens spokesperson for women. Importantly, the research showed that those most likely to be targeted by non-consensual sharing of their intimate images are those in our community who are likely to be dealing with discrimination, prejudice and injustice, including disabled people, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and lesbian, gay and bisexual people.


On top of this the research found that the victims of non-consensual images may have also experienced domestic or family violence, sexual violence, stalking, sexual harassment and other forms of interpersonal violence. The psychological impact of this abuse can be significant, and negative implications can affect victims' reputation, family, employment, social relationships and even personal safety. And, as noted by the chief investigator of the RMIT University research project, Dr Nicola Henry, this isn't just about revenge porn. Images are being used to control, abuse and humiliate people in ways that go well beyond a relationship-gone-sour scenario.


This research, undertaken by RMIT, goes to the heart of why this bill is so important. Statistically, we know that the most dangerous place for a woman is in her home. Women are more likely to be killed by their current or former male partner than by any other cause. And we know from the #MeToo movement and the ongoing campaigns for women's rights that women across the world—on the streets and in their workplaces; young and old—face daily sexual harassment, abuse and violence. And so, in a broader cultural context of disrespect and harassment, the non-consensual sharing of intimate images is a particularly targeted, insidious and damaging form of abuse. Women are more likely to experience this form of abuse at the hands of a partner or ex-partner, and this exemplifies a particularly horrifying version of controlling and humiliating behaviour.


I want to share a case study with you, an example of the harm that can be caused by the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. It is a case of two women in a regional town whose intimate images and videos were posted without consent to a pornographic image board. The victims identified the same man as responsible for disseminating the intimate images. The man had also targeted other women in the town. He had posted their images to the same link, which identified the town and, in some of the cases, the names and the workplaces of the victims. Just imagine being the subject of that harassment.


The civil penalties that this legislation proposes would provide a range of options to deal with a perpetrator's behaviour, including issuing a warning; issuing a removal notice, requiring the perpetrator to remove the images; issuing an infringement; and preventing the further publication or dissemination of images through an enforcement mechanism, such as an undertaking or a court injunction. So the Greens are welcoming action on this important issue that, as the research indicates, affects many people from many demographics. However, as my colleague Senator Steele-John has indicated, we are very concerned about the implications of this proposed civil penalties regime for people who are under 18. For that reason, we're going to be moving an amendment about this issue, for which we are seeking the Senate's consideration of support.


In conclusion, I'm pleased that the government has brought on this legislation. It could be better legislation. It would have benefited from having gone through a thorough Senate inquiry process, but it is legislation that is absolutely worth supporting. I am pleased to be able to join Senator Steele-John in saying that the Greens will be supporting this important legislation.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-02-13,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (18:48):  I'm really happy to speak on the Enhancing Online Safety (Non-consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Bill 2017. This bill has come almost 10 years after my own experience of the degrading, embarrassing and false depiction of me, courtesy of Neil Breen, on the front page of The Sunday Mail and The Sunday Telegraph in March 2009. It was one week—actually it wasn't even a week; it was six days—out from the 2009 Queensland state election in which I was standing as a candidate. I woke up on that Sunday morning. I bought the paper and saw these images of a woman who was partially nude and the claims that they were pictures of me. Of course, I contacted the newspapers and said, 'They are not pictures of me.' I was getting calls in regard to this. Of course my immediate family knew. Even my ex-husband made it quite clear, 'That's not her.' This went on for a week. The newspaper stood by that they were images of me. The dates, the times and the ages did not add up. This was all because it was political. To go through this experience was terribly embarrassing—imagine what the public thought—so I can understand how people feel about their own images.


I remember the last time I was in parliament there was another image put up of me. The image was of me—as the head of another woman being held by the arms by two black men—and I was delivering a baby. I went to the minister with regard to this—this organisation was funded through the ABC—and nothing was done about it. So, yes, it is well and truly overdue for something to be done about this.


I explain with this that, as the old saying goes, sometimes it takes two to tango. I say to anyone out there who thinks that intimate images of themselves are okay to send via text message or email: 'Stop it. Keep it for the bedroom.' People, regardless of your age, it's in what is told to you by your parents and how you feel about yourself: people have to take responsibility for their own actions. Young people who get requests for intimate images of themselves early in relationships should not do it. Relationships don't always last, and the person they are with may very well turn nasty on them. I'm very pleased to say that One Nation are a part of putting a dent in this abhorrent trend of shaming people using online methods and intimate images, but I reiterate: I want every man, woman and young adult to know that they too must play a role in ensuring their private photos are kept private. 


There are some amendments that will be moved today. The Xenophon amendment will make this a criminal offence. One Nation will not be supporting that amendment, on the basis that we have a Criminal Code that covers a lot of this. We have to be very careful here. The younger generation—those under 18 years of age—are taking pictures of themselves and their friends. If you make it a criminal offence, this will be a mark against them for the rest of their lives. We know they do some stupid things, but a criminal record affects your visa, job applications, profession and blue card, and travelling overseas. I suggest we don't make this a criminal offence. Another thing: if you don't make it a criminal offence for those who are under age, people who are of adult age will then blame someone who is under age. I just don't feel that we should be making it a criminal offence.


Labor has put up an amendment to review this in three years time. I do support that. I think it should be reviewed. Let's look at the bill as a whole as it is at the moment. I think the civil penalties will go far enough. We can then review it. If it's not working, then we can address it in three years time.


There has been talk in the chamber today of whether it should be an offence to take a photo of anyone wearing a burqa. We have an Australian standard. If they are photographed wearing a burqa, that's not offensive to the Australian people and it should not come into the act. The burqa is not a religious requirement, so I don't believe that should even come into it. We have our standards—what we find offensive and what intimate images should not be shown and put across or texted. I commend the bill. We will be supporting this.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:54):  It doesn't look as though any other colleagues wish to contribute to the second reading debate, so I thank all colleagues for their contributions. As has been canvassed in the contributions of colleagues, Australians are immersing themselves in the online world through social networking sites, online games, smartphones and tablets. We all agree that the internet is a vital tool for education, research, entertainment and social interaction; however, we have witnessed in recent times that the internet can be used for the wrong purposes, which can lead to very tragic consequences.


Creating a safer online world requires broad community involvement from industry, schools, parents, children, support agencies and government. We all play a role in ensuring that Australians can safely and confidently take advantage of the great benefits of the internet and other digital technologies. The government will continue to consult with stakeholders and consider other actions that can be implemented to address online harms. I think all colleagues would concur that, when it comes to the online space and potential misuse, there is no single response; there needs to be a range of responses, which include education, civil and criminal remedies, and government, non-government and community efforts.


The Enhancing Online Safety (Non-consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Bill 2017 reflects part of the government's contribution to those efforts: our ongoing commitment to keep Australians safe online, in this case from a very specific abuse—that of the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. This is a significant issue that can have an adverse impact on victims, their families and the community. The psychological impact on victims can be significant and can have very negative implications affecting their reputation, family, employment, social relationships and even personal safety.


The reasons for non-consensual sharing of intimate images are varied. It can often occur as a result of a victim's ex-partner seeking revenge; it can also involve acquaintances or complete strangers distributing the images either maliciously or for other nefarious reasons. Whatever the reasons for sharing intimate images without consent, the practice is intended to cause harm, distress, humiliation and embarrassment, whether through the actual sharing of intimate images or through the threat to share. Often such threats are made in an attempt to control, blackmail, coerce, bully or punish a victim. Other motives might include personal gratification, some sort of strange notoriety or even financial gain. The sharing of images can occur over various electronic services, including email, text, multimedia messaging, social media services, websites including other material of an explicit nature, message boards, forum websites and websites specifically designed to host images shared without consent.


The bill seeks to create a prohibition against non-consensually posting or threatening to post an intimate image on a social media service, a relevant electronic service such as email and text messaging, or a designated internet service, which includes websites and peer-to-peer file-sharing services. The bill establishes a complaints and objections system to be administered by the eSafety Commissioner, where victims or persons authorised on behalf of victims will be able to lodge a complaint directly to the eSafety Commissioner where there is reason to believe that an intimate image has been posted without consent or where a threat has been made to do so. The bill will facilitate the removal of an image where a person who initially consented to an image being shared has subsequently changed their mind and now wishes to have the image removed. People in this situation will be able to lodge an objection notice with the commissioner. The bill will introduce a civil penalty regime to be enforced by the eSafety Commissioner. Penalties of up to $105,000 for individuals and up to $525,000 for corporations can be incurred for a breach of the prohibition or failure to comply with a removal notice or other remedial direction issued by the eSafety Commissioner.


On 16 October 2017, the government welcomed the pilot launch of a new national portal for reporting instances of non-consensual sharing of intimate images. The portal is a world-first for a government-led initiative, developed by the Office of the eSafety Commissioner, and provides immediate and tangible support to victims of image based abuse. The portal gives victims a place to seek assistance and report instances of image based abuse. It provides clear and concise information about the practical steps victims can take to reduce the impact of the abuse. Since the launch of the portal, the eSafety office has received over 115 reports of image based abuse which related to nearly 220 separate URLs and locations where the images were made available. In addition, the eSafety office has received almost 60 queries regarding the non-consensual sharing of intimate images and had over 48,000 total visits to the image abuse portal. Noting these statistics, it is essential that the eSafety Commissioner has the legislative backing to enable quick removal of intimate images shared without consent and to administer a civil penalty regime targeting perpetrators and content hosts who knowingly engage in this behaviour.


The sharing of intimate images without consent is a major concern in the community. This bill sends a clear message to all Australians that the non-consensual sharing of intimate images is unacceptable in our society. The bill has been developed in consultation with many stakeholders, including women's safety organisations, mental health experts, schools and education departments, victims, the eSafety Commissioner and members of the government's Online Safety Consultative Working Group.


I should just take a moment to put this bill in the wider context of the government's efforts in relation to online safety and make mention of the fact that when Mr Fletcher, from the other place, was the Assistant Minister for Communications and Mr Turnbull was the communications minister, they legislated the establishment of what was then called the Office of the Children's eSafety Commissioner to be a one-stop shop for children, parents, schools and other organisations so that if bullying of young people was taking place online there was a place they could go for assistance. Also legislated as part of the establishment of the Children's eSafety Commissioner was the world's first legislated mechanism for take-downs of cyberbullying material as it concerns children. The Office of the eSafety Commissioner has, so far, had a 100 per cent success rate in having that material taken down.


I take the time to mention this because the tools and support that the Office of the eSafety Commissioner have are not as well-known as we would like them to be. Where children are in difficulty, there is a place they can go. Over time, the role of the Children's eSafety Commissioner has expanded to cover, in particular, services and support for women and for victims of domestic abuse. As a result of that expanded mandate, we legislated and changed the name of the Children's eSafety Commissioner to the Office of the eSafety Commissioner to reflect the fact that they do have a broad remit. Julie Inman-Grant, as the eSafety Commissioner, is providing great leadership to the organisation and great support to members of the community. We're all very aware of recent instances of online abuse which have been in the media and some of the tragic circumstances that we have seen as a result of the contribution of those activities to the distress that individuals have.


In the context of this legislation, it's important that the civil penalties regime is seen as another tool, another avenue, another opportunity for people who are subject to image based abuse—the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. Civil penalties are an optional remedy that sits alongside criminal provisions which are in place at Commonwealth level and are in place in most state jurisdictions. There is a process underway under the auspices of the ministerial Council of Attorneys-General to achieve consistency in the state and territory legislation when it concerns criminal provisions. Sometimes, when we're talking about civil penalties, they're presented as though these are being put forward instead of criminal sanctions. They're not. They're being put forward as another option that is available to address this scourge.


So, with those comments, I encourage my colleagues to support the bill. I know colleagues have a range of amendments that they will be seeking to move, and I'm sure we will have a good discussion in that context.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the second reading amendment moved by Senator O'Neill, on sheet 8363, be agreed to.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2018-02-13,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (19:15):  I move opposition amendment (1) on sheet 8364 revised:


(1) Page 2 (after line 11), after clause 3, insert:




   
4 Review of operation of amendments



   (1) Within 3 years after the commencement of this section, the Minister must cause to be conducted an independent review of the operation of the amendments made by this Act.


   (2) The Minister must cause to be prepared a written report of the review.


   (3) The Minister must cause copies of the report to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the day on which the report is given to the Minister.


I'd like to put a few remarks on the record. Labor circulated sheet 8364 containing a review clause. This sheet was today revised and recirculated to deal with the contingency that the amendments proposed by the Nick Xenophon Team are yet to be determined in this place or agreed to in the Senate. Whether or not a civil or a civil and criminal scheme is established by this bill, Labor believes that it should be reviewed in due course. I appreciate the commentary in contributions by others that they will support that.


As I stated in my speech on the second reading of the bill, Labor believes that, within three years of its commencement, the minister should cause a review to be conducted of the new statutory regime for the non-consensual sharing of intimate images, along with the preparation and tabling of a report in each house of the parliament.


While the Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015 already includes a review clause, at section 107, this review is due to commence in the very near future, and we believe that would be an inadequate time frame for the proper testing of this piece of legislation. If conducted in a timely fashion, that review will assess the cyberbullying regime that first commenced in 2015 but will be of limited efficacy given that the new regime for image based abuse won't have been in operation for very long at all.


I detailed the concerns of various stakeholders in my second reading contribution this morning. These included commentary from the DIGI Group, who gave evidence about the efficacy of measures in this bill. In accordance with best practice, Labor thinks there should be a further meaningful review of any new regime for image based abuse once it's been in operation for a substantial period. I seek the support of the Senate for Labor's detailed amendment.

Senator STEELE-JOHN
 (Western Australia) (19:17):  As I mentioned in my speech on the second reading, the Australian Greens are disappointed that this legislation was brought on for debate in such haste that it didn't allow for scrutiny, despite our best efforts to refer the bill to an inquiry. The government, as I mentioned earlier today, has tried to dismiss our request for a review, citing previous consultations; however, as I have also previously noted, consultation does not negate the need for scrutiny. You consult, you formulate and then you scrutinise the result. I'm sure that isn't a concept beyond anyone in this chamber and I find the fact that we are bypassing that critical final step to be a really sad reflection on the ways in which other, external political motivations sometimes drive the process of legislative review in this place.


We're also disappointed, I have to say, that this kind of approach has been taken despite repeated attempts, both within this chamber and without, to have that be otherwise. In the absence of scrutiny, it seems that we are left with this review process. Therefore we support the ALP's amendment to put in place an independent review to examine the effectiveness of the regime and the operation of the amendments made by this legislation.


Question agreed to.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2018-02-13,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (18:27):  Before my speech was interrupted, I was saying that my Labor colleagues in the House of Representatives Terri Butler and Tim Watts introduced a private member's bill to create new offences in relation to the use of a carriage service for sharing private sexual material. Sadly, this bill didn't get any further than Mr Watts introducing it and delivering his second reading speech before it lapsed because of the proroguing of parliament. But, despite Labor's private member's bill lapsing, we have continued to pursue this issue.


Labor went to the last federal election promising Commonwealth legislation to criminalise non-consensual sharing of intimate images within the first 100 days of being elected. In October 2016, we reintroduced our private member's bill. However, it was removed from the Notice Paper in May last year because the government continually refused to bring it on for debate. While the national conversation about the need to criminalise this behaviour has gone on for years, the Abbott-Turnbull government has been dragging its feet. This bill comes two years after Labor introduced its private member's bill—two years!—and we've been calling for stronger measures by the Commonwealth to tackle this problem for some time.


I'm in no doubt that my disappointment at the delay in the government's response is shared by the victims of this horrendous behaviour. The non-consensual sharing of intimate images is a gross breach of privacy. What makes this crime particularly horrific is that the consequences for victims can potentially last a lifetime, because once an image has been shared online it becomes almost impossible to retrieve and destroy every copy of that image. Even if the shared content is successfully erased, the victim is left with the fear that the image may still be out there somewhere. And destroying the image does not erase the shame and the humiliation that the victim has suffered.


The Australian Information Commissioner summed up well the impact of this behaviour in a submission to the Department of Communications' consultation on this bill. The commissioner said: 'The non-consensual sharing of these images is a serious invasion of privacy which has the potential to cause severe harm, distress and humiliation to victims. Further, the harm that can be caused through the sharing of such images is exacerbated by the rapidly increasing technological capacity for capturing images and making recordings and the ability to distribute digital material on a vast scale.' This behaviour needs to be criminalised because it is a form of abuse. It is an increasingly common manifestation of family violence and it is used by perpetrators to use the threat of humiliation to exercise power and control over their victims.


A recent study published by RMIT in May last year found that a high level of psychological distress was experienced by victims of image based abuse. For many victims this was accompanied by a moderate to severe level of depression and/or anxiety. Twenty eight per cent of victims reported that they feared for their safety as a result of image based abuse. While the number of male and female victims was roughly the same, women were more likely than men to report being fearful for their safety; and those fears were greater when there was a threat to distribute an image, rather than the actual distribution of the image. Women were more likely than men to experience image based abuse from a male perpetrator; and the study suggests that, for women victims, it is more often associated with stalking or domestic violence victimisation.


Another reason for the urgent need to address this behaviour is that it's becoming more and more widespread. In his second reading speech to the House, Mr Watts pointed out that one in 10 Australians reported that someone has posted online or sent to others a nude or semi-nude image of them without their consent. The RMIT study to which I referred earlier, with is more recent, found that one in five Australians has experienced the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. With the problem so widespread and having such a profound impact on its victims there is a compelling case for a strong response. And, as if it isn't bad enough that the Turnbull government has dragged its feet for so long, the bill before us now does not go nearly far enough in addressing this problem.


It is important that the parliament sends a strong message to the community that sharing intimate images without consent is not acceptable. But the message needs to be a lot stronger than just a civil penalty regime. The strength of a criminal offence is not just in the severity of the penalties or the fact that it is the police that take action against the offender; it is also in the statement it makes to the public about the seriousness of the behaviour.


The Top End Women's Legal Service in Darwin, which made a submission to the Senate revenge porn inquiry, pointed out that 'a criminal offence also serves a symbolic and educative function, and a tailored offence would clearly highlight and reinforce the wrongfulness of this behaviour. The government's refusal to make this behaviour a criminal offence is out of step with the Australian community.' The RMIT study I referred to earlier also found that four in five Australians agreed that it should be a crime to share sexual or nude pictures without permission. This attitude is fairly consistent throughout the community, regardless of whether the respondents were victims or not.


This is a gap in the law that has to be addressed. It is currently a criminal offence in Victoria and South Australia to share an intimate or invasive image without consent. It is also an offence in both of those states to threaten the distribution of such an image. Without a Commonwealth offence, this leaves a gap in the law across the remainder of the states and territories. It is just not good enough to leave the legislative response to the states and territories. Like most things that happen in the online environment, it is more appropriately dealt with through the Commonwealth Criminal Code. Not only would a Commonwealth law be a simpler way to ensure national consistency in how these offences are dealt with; it would also make it clearer how these crimes are to be dealt with when they happen across state borders.


The government argues that there is no need to introduce a new criminal offence, because section 474.17 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code makes it an offence to use a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offence. As the RMIT study points out, many legal experts in their research said this offence is broad in scope and is not enforced well when it comes to image based offences. A civil penalty could actually make the situation worse as it may encourage police to refer cases to the eSafety Commissioner instead of prosecuting.


Labor has asked questions in Senate estimates about how many charges have been proven against defendants for non-consensual sharing of intimate images, and the response from the Australian Federal Police was that, for prosecutions brought about by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, 844 charges have been proven against 410 defendants between the introduction of section 474.17 in 2004 and 5 December 2016. But it's unclear how many of these prosecutions were for image based offences, and without this information we have no evidence that a significant number or, indeed, any instances of image based abuse are resulting in successful prosecutions by the Commonwealth.


The application of this section to image based abuse was also explored in the revenge porn Senate inquiry. The Australian Federal Police told the inquiry that this section had not been used in relation to non-consensual sharing of intimate images. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions also gave evidence to the inquiry and raised questions as to how effectively the section could be applied in the context of non-consensual sharing of intimate images. There are a number of aspects of non-consensual sharing of intimate images that were not contemplated in the legislation, such as whether the victim 'held and maintained an expectation of privacy in relation to the image'. The CDPP also pointed out that the section would not apply to image based abuse unless it takes place online, so it would not address behaviour such as sharing hard copies of images. Even if since the inquiry section 474.17 has been tested for image based abuse, considering that one in five Australians report experiencing such abuse, those prosecutions would be a drop in the ocean. 


The need for a specific Commonwealth offence was also explored by the RMIT study, which consulted legal experts. The study's report observed:


Overall, in Australia there is a piecemeal legislative approach to image-based abuse, with no nationally consistent criminal laws, the majority of jurisdictions do not have specific offences, and the civil law is out of reach for most Australians without the financial resources to seek justice. The harms associated with image-based abuse further warrant it being specifically classified as a federal telecommunications criminal offence.


The case for a Commonwealth criminal offence is obviously compelling. A civil penalty simply does not go far enough in recognising the seriousness of image based abuse. Introducing a criminal offence sends a strong signal to the perpetrators that not only is the behaviour they're engaging in abuse and unacceptable but it is a crime. While we're disappointed that this bill does not go far enough, Labor will, however, support this bill because it is at least a step in the right direction, and it's better than doing nothing to prevent the hurt and distress that image based abuse causes to victims.


While the bill fails to make non-consensual sharing of intimate images a criminal offence, it includes a number of other important provisions. One of these is a legally enforceable take-down notice to try to remove images from websites. While a take-down notice is a useful mechanism for non-complying content providers, I acknowledge that social media platforms have worked hard to put in place policies and practices that quickly respond to instances of image based abuse. In January 2013, Labor in government signed an agreement with Facebook, Google, Yahoo and Microsoft to develop robust processes to deal with complaints of cyberbullying and to undertake education and awareness-raising activities. Some of the take-down policies of major social media platforms provide for faster removal of offensive content than the 48 hours stipulated in this bill.


The eSafety Commissioner will of course seek to use established relationships with internet service and social media providers to informally seek the taking down of images, but it helps to have enforcement action as a backup option. It's also important to have a one-stop-shop complaints mechanism administered by the eSafety Commissioner, and this bill complements the online complaints portal pilot that was launched by the commissioner last October.


As I've stated, this bill is a step in the right direction, but the government need to go further. They need to send a much stronger message to the perpetrators of this abuse that society will not tolerate their behaviour. Labor believes, and legal experts and the Australian public agree, that there is a need for a specific Commonwealth criminal offence for the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. I urge the government to revisit the private member's bill put forward by Mr Watts and Ms Butler in the House, and to work with Labor on further strengthening our response to the despicable practice of the sharing of intimate images without consent.

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (18:40):  I rise to speak to the Enhancing Online Safety (Non-consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Bill 2017. As noted earlier today by my colleague Senator Jordon Steele-John, the Australian Greens welcome and support this bill because we support action to protect those who experience or may experience the abuse, threats, extortion or other harm caused by the non-consensual sharing of their intimate images or threats to share such images. I'm heartened that the government has listened to the voices in this chamber and across Australia who have been calling for a long time for legislation that deals with non-consensual sharing of images.


While this bill is a welcome step in protecting people from the non-consensual sharing of images, the Greens consider that this bill has been brought on for debate far too quickly. Yes, we need legislation, but it would have been much better for this legislation to have had the opportunity to go through the standard Senate process of a committee inquiry, because then this bill would, I am certain, have been improved from what it is today. We have some amendments that we're going to be moving to this bill that will improve it, but I'm certain that if we'd had the chance to have the scrutiny of a Senate inquiry process we would have ended up with much better legislation. I think it's disappointing the government has brought this bill on before it is ready.


In-depth research conducted by RMIT University found the issue of non-consensual sharing of images affects a wide cross-section of the community. The key findings of the research demonstrate the extent of the problem and why we must address it. One in five Australians have experienced image based abuse. Victims of image based abuse experience high levels of psychological distress. Women and men are equally likely to report being a victim. Perpetrators of image based abuse are most likely to be male and known to the victim. Men and young adults are more likely to voluntarily share a nude or sexual image of themselves. Women are more likely than men to fear for their safety due to image based abuse. Abuse risk is higher for those who share sexual selfies, but they aren't the only victims. One in two Australians with a disability report being a victim of image based abuse. Let that sink in: one in two Australians with a disability. One in two Indigenous Australians report image based abuse and victimisation. Image based abuse and victimisation is higher for lesbian, gay and bisexual Australians. Young people aged 16 to 29 years are also at high risk of image based abuse. Critically, given the impact of this, it is heartening to know that four out of five Australians agree that it should be a crime to share sexual or nude images without permission.


It's worth noting that men make up the majority of perpetrators when it comes to non-consensual sharing of intimate images, and that women are more likely than men to be victimised by an intimate partner or ex-partner. It's in this context that I am talking tonight, as the Greens spokesperson for women. Importantly, the research showed that those most likely to be targeted by non-consensual sharing of their intimate images are those in our community who are likely to be dealing with discrimination, prejudice and injustice, including disabled people, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and lesbian, gay and bisexual people.


On top of this the research found that the victims of non-consensual images may have also experienced domestic or family violence, sexual violence, stalking, sexual harassment and other forms of interpersonal violence. The psychological impact of this abuse can be significant, and negative implications can affect victims' reputation, family, employment, social relationships and even personal safety. And, as noted by the chief investigator of the RMIT University research project, Dr Nicola Henry, this isn't just about revenge porn. Images are being used to control, abuse and humiliate people in ways that go well beyond a relationship-gone-sour scenario.


This research, undertaken by RMIT, goes to the heart of why this bill is so important. Statistically, we know that the most dangerous place for a woman is in her home. Women are more likely to be killed by their current or former male partner than by any other cause. And we know from the #MeToo movement and the ongoing campaigns for women's rights that women across the world—on the streets and in their workplaces; young and old—face daily sexual harassment, abuse and violence. And so, in a broader cultural context of disrespect and harassment, the non-consensual sharing of intimate images is a particularly targeted, insidious and damaging form of abuse. Women are more likely to experience this form of abuse at the hands of a partner or ex-partner, and this exemplifies a particularly horrifying version of controlling and humiliating behaviour.


I want to share a case study with you, an example of the harm that can be caused by the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. It is a case of two women in a regional town whose intimate images and videos were posted without consent to a pornographic image board. The victims identified the same man as responsible for disseminating the intimate images. The man had also targeted other women in the town. He had posted their images to the same link, which identified the town and, in some of the cases, the names and the workplaces of the victims. Just imagine being the subject of that harassment.


The civil penalties that this legislation proposes would provide a range of options to deal with a perpetrator's behaviour, including issuing a warning; issuing a removal notice, requiring the perpetrator to remove the images; issuing an infringement; and preventing the further publication or dissemination of images through an enforcement mechanism, such as an undertaking or a court injunction. So the Greens are welcoming action on this important issue that, as the research indicates, affects many people from many demographics. However, as my colleague Senator Steele-John has indicated, we are very concerned about the implications of this proposed civil penalties regime for people who are under 18. For that reason, we're going to be moving an amendment about this issue, for which we are seeking the Senate's consideration of support.


In conclusion, I'm pleased that the government has brought on this legislation. It could be better legislation. It would have benefited from having gone through a thorough Senate inquiry process, but it is legislation that is absolutely worth supporting. I am pleased to be able to join Senator Steele-John in saying that the Greens will be supporting this important legislation.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (18:48):  I'm really happy to speak on the Enhancing Online Safety (Non-consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Bill 2017. This bill has come almost 10 years after my own experience of the degrading, embarrassing and false depiction of me, courtesy of Neil Breen, on the front page of The Sunday Mail and The Sunday Telegraph in March 2009. It was one week—actually it wasn't even a week; it was six days—out from the 2009 Queensland state election in which I was standing as a candidate. I woke up on that Sunday morning. I bought the paper and saw these images of a woman who was partially nude and the claims that they were pictures of me. Of course, I contacted the newspapers and said, 'They are not pictures of me.' I was getting calls in regard to this. Of course my immediate family knew. Even my ex-husband made it quite clear, 'That's not her.' This went on for a week. The newspaper stood by that they were images of me. The dates, the times and the ages did not add up. This was all because it was political. To go through this experience was terribly embarrassing—imagine what the public thought—so I can understand how people feel about their own images.


I remember the last time I was in parliament there was another image put up of me. The image was of me—as the head of another woman being held by the arms by two black men—and I was delivering a baby. I went to the minister with regard to this—this organisation was funded through the ABC—and nothing was done about it. So, yes, it is well and truly overdue for something to be done about this.


I explain with this that, as the old saying goes, sometimes it takes two to tango. I say to anyone out there who thinks that intimate images of themselves are okay to send via text message or email: 'Stop it. Keep it for the bedroom.' People, regardless of your age, it's in what is told to you by your parents and how you feel about yourself: people have to take responsibility for their own actions. Young people who get requests for intimate images of themselves early in relationships should not do it. Relationships don't always last, and the person they are with may very well turn nasty on them. I'm very pleased to say that One Nation are a part of putting a dent in this abhorrent trend of shaming people using online methods and intimate images, but I reiterate: I want every man, woman and young adult to know that they too must play a role in ensuring their private photos are kept private. 


There are some amendments that will be moved today. The Xenophon amendment will make this a criminal offence. One Nation will not be supporting that amendment, on the basis that we have a Criminal Code that covers a lot of this. We have to be very careful here. The younger generation—those under 18 years of age—are taking pictures of themselves and their friends. If you make it a criminal offence, this will be a mark against them for the rest of their lives. We know they do some stupid things, but a criminal record affects your visa, job applications, profession and blue card, and travelling overseas. I suggest we don't make this a criminal offence. Another thing: if you don't make it a criminal offence for those who are under age, people who are of adult age will then blame someone who is under age. I just don't feel that we should be making it a criminal offence.


Labor has put up an amendment to review this in three years time. I do support that. I think it should be reviewed. Let's look at the bill as a whole as it is at the moment. I think the civil penalties will go far enough. We can then review it. If it's not working, then we can address it in three years time.


There has been talk in the chamber today of whether it should be an offence to take a photo of anyone wearing a burqa. We have an Australian standard. If they are photographed wearing a burqa, that's not offensive to the Australian people and it should not come into the act. The burqa is not a religious requirement, so I don't believe that should even come into it. We have our standards—what we find offensive and what intimate images should not be shown and put across or texted. I commend the bill. We will be supporting this.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:54):  It doesn't look as though any other colleagues wish to contribute to the second reading debate, so I thank all colleagues for their contributions. As has been canvassed in the contributions of colleagues, Australians are immersing themselves in the online world through social networking sites, online games, smartphones and tablets. We all agree that the internet is a vital tool for education, research, entertainment and social interaction; however, we have witnessed in recent times that the internet can be used for the wrong purposes, which can lead to very tragic consequences.


Creating a safer online world requires broad community involvement from industry, schools, parents, children, support agencies and government. We all play a role in ensuring that Australians can safely and confidently take advantage of the great benefits of the internet and other digital technologies. The government will continue to consult with stakeholders and consider other actions that can be implemented to address online harms. I think all colleagues would concur that, when it comes to the online space and potential misuse, there is no single response; there needs to be a range of responses, which include education, civil and criminal remedies, and government, non-government and community efforts.


The Enhancing Online Safety (Non-consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Bill 2017 reflects part of the government's contribution to those efforts: our ongoing commitment to keep Australians safe online, in this case from a very specific abuse—that of the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. This is a significant issue that can have an adverse impact on victims, their families and the community. The psychological impact on victims can be significant and can have very negative implications affecting their reputation, family, employment, social relationships and even personal safety.


The reasons for non-consensual sharing of intimate images are varied. It can often occur as a result of a victim's ex-partner seeking revenge; it can also involve acquaintances or complete strangers distributing the images either maliciously or for other nefarious reasons. Whatever the reasons for sharing intimate images without consent, the practice is intended to cause harm, distress, humiliation and embarrassment, whether through the actual sharing of intimate images or through the threat to share. Often such threats are made in an attempt to control, blackmail, coerce, bully or punish a victim. Other motives might include personal gratification, some sort of strange notoriety or even financial gain. The sharing of images can occur over various electronic services, including email, text, multimedia messaging, social media services, websites including other material of an explicit nature, message boards, forum websites and websites specifically designed to host images shared without consent.


The bill seeks to create a prohibition against non-consensually posting or threatening to post an intimate image on a social media service, a relevant electronic service such as email and text messaging, or a designated internet service, which includes websites and peer-to-peer file-sharing services. The bill establishes a complaints and objections system to be administered by the eSafety Commissioner, where victims or persons authorised on behalf of victims will be able to lodge a complaint directly to the eSafety Commissioner where there is reason to believe that an intimate image has been posted without consent or where a threat has been made to do so. The bill will facilitate the removal of an image where a person who initially consented to an image being shared has subsequently changed their mind and now wishes to have the image removed. People in this situation will be able to lodge an objection notice with the commissioner. The bill will introduce a civil penalty regime to be enforced by the eSafety Commissioner. Penalties of up to $105,000 for individuals and up to $525,000 for corporations can be incurred for a breach of the prohibition or failure to comply with a removal notice or other remedial direction issued by the eSafety Commissioner.


On 16 October 2017, the government welcomed the pilot launch of a new national portal for reporting instances of non-consensual sharing of intimate images. The portal is a world-first for a government-led initiative, developed by the Office of the eSafety Commissioner, and provides immediate and tangible support to victims of image based abuse. The portal gives victims a place to seek assistance and report instances of image based abuse. It provides clear and concise information about the practical steps victims can take to reduce the impact of the abuse. Since the launch of the portal, the eSafety office has received over 115 reports of image based abuse which related to nearly 220 separate URLs and locations where the images were made available. In addition, the eSafety office has received almost 60 queries regarding the non-consensual sharing of intimate images and had over 48,000 total visits to the image abuse portal. Noting these statistics, it is essential that the eSafety Commissioner has the legislative backing to enable quick removal of intimate images shared without consent and to administer a civil penalty regime targeting perpetrators and content hosts who knowingly engage in this behaviour.


The sharing of intimate images without consent is a major concern in the community. This bill sends a clear message to all Australians that the non-consensual sharing of intimate images is unacceptable in our society. The bill has been developed in consultation with many stakeholders, including women's safety organisations, mental health experts, schools and education departments, victims, the eSafety Commissioner and members of the government's Online Safety Consultative Working Group.


I should just take a moment to put this bill in the wider context of the government's efforts in relation to online safety and make mention of the fact that when Mr Fletcher, from the other place, was the Assistant Minister for Communications and Mr Turnbull was the communications minister, they legislated the establishment of what was then called the Office of the Children's eSafety Commissioner to be a one-stop shop for children, parents, schools and other organisations so that if bullying of young people was taking place online there was a place they could go for assistance. Also legislated as part of the establishment of the Children's eSafety Commissioner was the world's first legislated mechanism for take-downs of cyberbullying material as it concerns children. The Office of the eSafety Commissioner has, so far, had a 100 per cent success rate in having that material taken down.


I take the time to mention this because the tools and support that the Office of the eSafety Commissioner have are not as well-known as we would like them to be. Where children are in difficulty, there is a place they can go. Over time, the role of the Children's eSafety Commissioner has expanded to cover, in particular, services and support for women and for victims of domestic abuse. As a result of that expanded mandate, we legislated and changed the name of the Children's eSafety Commissioner to the Office of the eSafety Commissioner to reflect the fact that they do have a broad remit. Julie Inman-Grant, as the eSafety Commissioner, is providing great leadership to the organisation and great support to members of the community. We're all very aware of recent instances of online abuse which have been in the media and some of the tragic circumstances that we have seen as a result of the contribution of those activities to the distress that individuals have.


In the context of this legislation, it's important that the civil penalties regime is seen as another tool, another avenue, another opportunity for people who are subject to image based abuse—the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. Civil penalties are an optional remedy that sits alongside criminal provisions which are in place at Commonwealth level and are in place in most state jurisdictions. There is a process underway under the auspices of the ministerial Council of Attorneys-General to achieve consistency in the state and territory legislation when it concerns criminal provisions. Sometimes, when we're talking about civil penalties, they're presented as though these are being put forward instead of criminal sanctions. They're not. They're being put forward as another option that is available to address this scourge.


So, with those comments, I encourage my colleagues to support the bill. I know colleagues have a range of amendments that they will be seeking to move, and I'm sure we will have a good discussion in that context.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the second reading amendment moved by Senator O'Neill, on sheet 8363, be agreed to.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (19:20):  Before I begin, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be aware that my speech contains the name of a deceased person.


In times of uncertainty, leaders reveal themselves. They do not walk a path already set out for them. They pave the road themselves with the boldness and the measuredness of their actions. Australia has emerged as a world leader in addressing the impact of HIV and AIDS. We've certainly come a long way on this journey, from being the home of the Grim Reaper to pioneering management treatment and response. Indeed, leaders in this field are confident Australia could well be the first country to virtually end the transmission of HIV. Significantly, we may be on the cusp of achieving the ambitious 90-90-90 goal introduced by UNAIDS less than five years ago. The most recent development of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee—just in the last few days—recommending PrEP be listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is welcome news for those living with HIV in our country. For that and so many other achievements we should be proud.


But we know there is much work yet to be done. No-one understood this more than two trailblazers we recently lost, Levinia Crooks and Neville Fazulla, whose focus and optimism have been instrumental in Australia's success as a leader in the fight against HIV and AIDS.


Much has been said about the late, great Levinia Crooks. She was adjunct associate professor and CEO of the Australasian Society for HIV, Viral Hepatitis and Sexual Health Medicine for almost 20 years. When you talk to those who knew Levinia or even knew of her, the word 'visionary' is used a great deal. She threw herself into learning about, researching and taking action on HIV and AIDS in the 1980s at a time when people were afraid for their lives. Levinia, all the while, must have known there was hope on the horizon—a visionary indeed. Levinia was a well-acknowledged and tireless advocate whose compassion and determination not only guided but propelled her into effecting change. She had an uncanny ability to bring people together and collaborated for the best possible result. Her boundless support for those living with HIV and ongoing engagement with doctors and healthcare providers ensured that Australians were able to not only manage their health and wellbeing but enjoy life. Importantly, she pushed the debate in directions that led to outcomes.


Levinia, sadly, passed away in October last year, but her incomparable contribution to Australia's response to HIV/AIDS and sexual health continues to inspire and lead many of us. Because of her activism and her actions, we can continue to address sexual health issues in our country without fear.


Another giant in the response to HIV and AIDS was Neville Fazulla. For three decades, Neville Fazulla was at the front line of advocacy. He fought tirelessly for people living with HIV, campaigned for a community response and was a proud representative for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In living his life openly as a man with HIV, he was an inspiration to so many whose fears of stigma and discrimination often prevented them from getting tested or seeking treatment. Neville Fazulla was a champion for self-management and the implementation of self-management programs so people could be independent, self-sufficient and confident about their quality of life.


Neville was, importantly, a vital voice in Australia's conversation about HIV and its impact on Indigenous communities, notably through his work as Chair of the Anwernekenhe National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander HIV/AIDS Alliance and Anwernekenhe conferences. He was a founding member of the steering committee for the all-important Anwernekenhe I, in 1994, the first Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander gay men and transgender sexual health conference ever held in our country.


We lost Neville last month. As the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations eloquently phrased it, 'The magnitude of Neville's contribution is impossible to capture and will be felt for years to come.' As chair of the parliamentary liaison group for HIV/AIDS, blood-borne viruses and sexually transmitted infections, I wanted to acknowledge the indelible mark that both Levinia and Neville have left on a community that regarded them so highly—two warriors for whom the fight against HIV/AIDS was defining and, in so many respects, personal. In remembering them, let us think what we can do.
