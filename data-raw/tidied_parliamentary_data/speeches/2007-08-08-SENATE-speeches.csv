"Abetz, Sen Eric (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",LP,2007-08-08,"—I move:
That consideration of the business before the Senate on Wednesday, 8 August 2007 and on Wednesday, 15 August 2007 be interrupted at approximately 5 pm, but not so as to interrupt a senator speaking, to enable Senators Fisher and Cormann, respectively, to make their first speeches without any question before the chair.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-08-08,"—I rise to conclude my remarks from last night on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (National Investigative Powers and Witness Protection) Bill 2006 [2007]
. This legislation, with its ‘sneak and peek’ powers for the Australian Federal Police, enables the Federal Police to enter people’s premises, confiscate property and documents and access their computer equipment—and to do all of those things without any obligation to let the people know. This is quite an extraordinary power to be given to the Federal Police, particularly in light of all the mistakes that we have seen in the case of Dr Haneef.
This is the first choice of the government for the legislation that we as a parliament should deal with. This legislation means that people will end up in court, with evidence that has been collected against them, and will have no capacity to challenge whether or not that evidence was collected legally. As the current legislation operates, if a search warrant is issued on your home, you are there and you are able to have a lawyer there to check that the search is carried out properly. For people who have evidence collected against them and brought against them in a court, this legislation removes the protection for them to be able to challenge that evidence, because they do not know that a search has occurred. Under this legislation, they do not need to be told for six months, 12 months or maybe 18 months—indeed, if the minister approves, they may never know that the search has been carried out.
There is no other comparable country around the world that has that kind of legislation. In the United States, there is a system for covert warrants where there are ‘sneak and peek’ powers for their police, but the police are not given anywhere near this length of time not to tell people. The USA PATRIOT Act is not as strong as this piece of legislation. We heard last night that it is a piece of legislation that is not only put forward by the government but supported by the opposition. As we see time and time again when it comes to security legislation—anything related to terrorism—it is a ‘me too’ loud and clear from the opposition, and we see that in relation to this legislation as well.
What the Greens say is that our civil liberties are important. The Greens say that the rule of law is important. The Greens say that we should not be removing people’s right to know what is going on in their homes and to be able to challenge evidence against them in a court. This is pretty fundamental and pretty straightforward. It is the way our legal system has operated forever in this country and in the countries on which our legal system is based. We are asking for the rule of law to be abided by, for our legal system to be upheld, for justice to exist, for civil liberties to be defended and for people’s rights to be defended. This piece of legislation says no to that, from both the government and the opposition. The Greens disagree. We do not agree with holding up people’s civil liberties, the rule of law or people’s right to know what is going on in their homes, that they are being investigated and that evidence might have been collected against them illegally. This legislation allows that to happen. It is not on, it is not acceptable and the Greens will play no part in this whatsoever.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE POWERS AND WITNESS PROTECTION) BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>Third Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2007-08-08,"—In the debate on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (National Investigative Powers and Witness Protection) Bill 2006 [2007], the Democrats have not supported the legislation. We have acknowledged throughout the debate that the intended primary aim of this legislation—to harmonise controlled operations, assumed identities and protection of witness identity regimes across Australia—was an important and positive aim. Our concern, however, as we have expressed during the committee stage and in my speech during the second reading debate, is that this legislation goes too far. This legislation has some extraordinary powers—arguably, extreme powers—for our law enforcement agencies and does not counter those new and extraordinary powers with what we consider appropriate accountability, protection mechanisms or a safeguard for individual liberties, privacy rights and, indeed, human rights.
The Democrats have outlined repeatedly in this chamber this week our principal position, which is to acknowledge the need for changes to our legislative regime particularly in relation to antiterrorism laws enacted over the last few years. We have acknowledged that there is an argument for law enforcement and other investigative agencies to talk about new, arguably improved and maybe modern powers, but that debate has to happen in this place in a comprehensive and balanced way—that is, how will these laws impact on the rights and privacy of Australian citizens? How do we balance those rights with national interests and, yes, importantly, national security? We have been happy to have those debates, but I look over the last few years and see that more than 40 pieces of antiterrorism legislation, for lack of a better term, have been debated and passed in this place. When you add up some of the extraordinary and, indeed, extreme powers—and the ‘sneak and peek’ powers in this legislation do constitute extreme powers in a democracy such as ours—there are very good grounds for a new and comprehensive assessment.
I put on record that this is why the Australian Democrats have given notice of a Senate select committee proposal. The vote on that will happen tomorrow. That would be an opportunity for us to talk about, to re-examine, to assess and to scrutinise all of these laws not only in the context of various legal and other events that have taken place in modern times but specifically, I acknowledge, in light of the handling of the Dr Mohamed Haneef case. We need to see how these pieces of legislation interact with each other, but we also need to examine and understand the impact, if any, good or bad, that they are having on our democracy and on fundamental rights, such as the rule of law and habeas corpus as well as those human rights generally and specific privacy and security rights to which I refer.
This bill is another example of the government’s attempt to extend the unsupervised, in some cases, powers of law enforcement agencies, and it does so at the expense of privacy rights of Australian citizens. If you do not want to take that from the Democrats or from other minor parties then look at some of the submitters to the recent Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs inquiry. Look at the submissions and protestations from groups such as the Law Council of Australia. They have said:
... a manifest need for these extended powers has not been demonstrated and that ... no further erosion of Australian citizens’ rights should be sanctioned by the Australian Parliament.
I would hope that the parliament would listen to that.
I want to place on record, as did Senator Ludwig, commendations, congratulations and thankyous to the legal and constitutional committee for their ongoing and comprehensive work, and particularly for their help at a time when the Democrats were working very hard over time to get a supplementary report into that inquiry. I thank my colleagues who have participated in this debate. I think Senator Ludwig described it as a robust debate—I am not sure how robust—but we need an even more robust debate. We need a debate that actually looks at the laws that we have passed and examines them within this context. Until we do that, this parliament should not be passing any more legislation that enhances in such an extreme way the power of law enforcement and investigative agencies in this country, and certainly not without better justification than some that we heard in the chamber yesterday during the committee stage—even in things such as the explanatory memorandum—which do not adequately explain the need for some of the changes and certainly do not justify them adequately for the Australian Democrats.
We have participated constructively in this debate. We moved a raft of amendments designed to ameliorate what we considered the worst, the most difficult and the harshest aspects of the legislation. Those amendments were not passed. Some of the amendments that came through as recommendations from the Senate committee were adopted by the government in full or in part, and I commend the government and acknowledge that it did that. But I still think that there is a long way to go with this legislation, and that is the reason that the Australian Democrats have voted against this bill. It is not because we do not care about national interests or because we do not care about national security; it is because we are passionate about that and passionate about ensuring that we do not jettison some of the basic and fundamental human rights and principles on which our nation and democracy are founded. It is with a heavy heart that I make that explanation, but that is why the Democrats have opposed the legislation before us. We look forward to Senate support tomorrow for a Senate select inquiry into the broad-ranging pieces of antiterrorism law that have been introduced to this nation post-2001.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-08-08,"—I say at the outset that the Democrats abhor the sexual abuse of children. We want something done about it, and we want it done urgently. We wanted it done urgently last year, and the year before that, and 10 years before that. That is the point I want to make today: this is not a crisis which has arisen in the last five minutes or even in the last six months. And it is not a crisis about which the Commonwealth knew nothing. It is an ongoing neglect of a problem which has been around for a very long time.
By all accounts, action is being taken. Doctors, nurses and Army personnel have moved into Aboriginal communities, and that is not a bad thing. It is appropriate for children to be examined and for medical assistance to be provided where necessary. It is appropriate to turn so many dysfunctional communities into places which are safe for children, for women, for those who have been subject to abuse in the past, and to turn the situation around.
The legislation that we are dealing with today—the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Welfare Payment Reform) Bill 2007 and related bills—as well as for the rest of this week and next week, is part of the government’s response to the Little children are sacred report by Pat Anderson and Rex Wild QC. It is just one report in a very long line of reports that have been presented to this government. I have lost count of the reports, on various websites, that outline the horrible abuse that has been taking place in these communities.
Like so many others, the Anderson and Wild report is nuanced. It is wise. It demonstrates a deep understanding of the complexity of abuse in communities that have suffered for a very long time from the processes of colonisation: processes such as land grabs, stolen children and the fundamental lack of respect and racism from the dominant white culture in this country. But their report did not call for a declaration of war. It did not call for the Army and the police to be sent in in the first instance. It did not call for the jackboot approach to this problem, with all of those reminders of domination and crisis. The report called for a thoughtful, consultative process that stood some chance of achieving meaningful short-, medium- and long-term change.
I have listened to the debate so far, and I have not heard anybody say that there is no need for change. No-one is questioning the need to act. The plight of Indigenous children and the dysfunctional communities are a national disgrace. They are an international disgrace. Countries around the world point to the way in which we have failed Indigenous communities, and they have pointed to the fact that they are akin to the Third World in every possible imaginable way. So, whether we are talking about poverty, housing, health status or educational or economic status, our Indigenous community has a problem of huge dimensions, and it has had for a very long time.
Living standards are appalling. Many in this chamber will have been into many Aboriginal communities in the course of our work on inquiries into health or education in Indigenous communities. So we are reasonably well informed on this issue, I would argue. We have been to and seen the worst of them. And we have seen some good ones as well. I am not suggesting that every Aboriginal community is dysfunctional. Many are not. Some are fantastic, and they provide models that should be adopted elsewhere. But it is hard work that gets them there, and we need to find out how to achieve that for those communities that have not got there.
I have been particularly interested in some of the health issues that go with the poverty associated with many Aboriginal communities. Typically, on going into one of these communities—to a school, for instance—I ask about the rate of scabies infection amongst children. The usual response is, ‘Somewhere between 70 and 80 per cent of our kids will have scabies.’ I remind the Senate that scabies is a Third World disease. It is a mite that gets under the skin and causes insufferable itching and pain and has long-term effects on the major organs of the body. It is probably responsible for a lot of the very early deaths that we see in Aboriginal communities. And guess what? It is actually easy to fix. There is an ointment which you can rub on a scabies infection which pretty much eliminates it.
We went to a school on Elcho Island. I am not sure, Senator McLucas, whether you were on this delegation, but I will never forget it. I asked the principal, ‘How many of your children have scabies?’ The answer was, ‘Five per cent at the most.’ I asked, ‘How do you do it?’ and he said: ‘We close down the school twice every semester’—it might have been for one or two days; I forget the details exactly—‘and we go out into the community with the clinic, with the teachers, with the kids and with the families, and we make sure that anyone with any sign of scabies receives the ointment treatment. The dogs are cleaned up. The bed linen is cleaned up. We do this on a regular basis in order to keep that rate down.’ In other places, I have been told: ‘That is impossible. We can’t do anything about it. It is not a problem that can be solved.’ And we have taken no notice of that. We have not used the best examples and said, ‘This is what we should do to avoid the problem.’
Otitis media is another infection which causes children to become deaf, which makes it impossible for them to learn in school. It is why they wander off. It is one of the reasons that they are often not there at school; they cannot hear. That is because of a simple infection that we have eliminated in our society, but we apparently cannot find the wherewithal to go out and do it in Indigenous communities. We have heard about petrol sniffing. The exploitation of children in petrol sniffing is a dreadful blight on our society, in my view. It is the same with alcohol abuse. Why is there so much alcohol up in the Northern Territory? It is because a lot of people are making big profits from it. So there are things that we can do, and we are long overdue in introducing the policies and the actions that would improve the wellbeing of our Indigenous populations.
The Little children are sacred report joins a long line of reports that found evidence of child sexual abuse in every one of the 45 communities visited in the Northern Territory. The report identified poor health, alcohol and drug abuse, unemployment, poor education and housing, and disempowerment as contributing to the violence. Housing is critical. Even on Elcho Island, we were told that there were 18 to 20 people in every single household. To keep such an environment clean and healthy, much less provide meals on the table for people, is obviously an absurd proposition. If we do not solve the housing problems then we are never going to get to the child abuse problems, the health problems or all of the other problems that arise in these communities, where overcrowding just makes life impossible. Imagine your own house with 18 people in it. It does not bear thinking about, especially as these houses are quite small.
The Prime Minister was right when he said that anyone who had read the report would be horrified by that level of abuse. And, yes, people have been horrified by all the reports that they have shown that level of abuse. Everyone wants to save children from abuse, whether they are Indigenous or not. So it is good in many ways that the government, in coming out in the way that it has, has finally highlighted the appalling reality for many Aboriginal people. That situation, as I said, is not new, and many reports previous to the Little children are sacred report have made similarly shocking findings and called for similar urgent action.
Aboriginal women were calling on governments to address violence back in the mid-1980s in investigations commissioned by the Commonwealth and the state governments. The 1988 report of the rape of a 17-month-old Aboriginal child in a Cape York community exposed the widespread nature of child abuse in Indigenous communities. A task force was established, comprising 50 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women who consulted widely and who produced a report with 123 recommendations across nine areas. I ask the government: what happened to those recommendations? How is it that it is almost two decades later and they appear not to have been picked up or acted upon?
Again in 2003, Indigenous family violence was placed on the agenda following an impassioned plea by Mick Dodson, Chair of the ANU Institute for Indigenous Australia. The Prime Minister convened a summit with 15 Indigenous leaders to discuss the issue and identify a way forward. One of the proposals put to this summit was the need for a national Indigenous children’s wellbeing and development task force. What happened to that task force? Who knows? But that task force would have included representation from all governments and from Indigenous organisations. The proposed goal of this task force was to develop a package of measures to reverse the overrepresentation of Indigenous children in child protection and their underrepresentation in early childhood and other essential health and education services.
In 2004 the Council of Australian Governments agreed on a national framework on Indigenous family violence and child protection, which had six principles: safety, partnerships, support, strong resilient families, local solutions and the need to address the cause. Alice Springs Crown Prosecutor Nanette Rogers released a report last year describing a culture of violence and abuse of women and children. In response, Minister Mal Brough called for an urgent summit with the leaders of the states and territories to draft a national plan to eliminate this violence. An Intergovernmental Summit on Violence and Child Abuse in Indigenous Communities, involving ministers from the Australian government and all states and territories, was held in June 2006. So what happened to the outcomes of that summit? Yet another summit; yet another talkfest—where are the results from it?
The promise of $130 million from the federal government on the condition the states and territories matched the dollars was focused on law and order. There is a report from the Child Sexual Assault Working Party, which contained representation from FaCS, the former Department of Families and Community Services, which outlines a coordinated response to child sexual assault in the Top End. I seek leave to table this report so we can get it on the record as one of the many reports into this issue.
Leave granted.
—As I said, FaCS was involved in this working party and outlined a coordinated response on children in the Top End. But all of that was forgotten when it came to the announcement that suddenly we must do something—the minister claimed the Northern Territory had not acted so it was time for the Prime Minister to step in.
The latest report, Little children are sacred, contains many recommendations on what action needs to be taken—in fact I think there were 97 recommendations altogether, only two of which the Prime Minister mentioned in his announcement, and they were: schools providing food programs and boarding schools. Neither of those appear to be in the legislation we are dealing with here, and they seem to have dropped off the agenda. So none of the recommendations has been picked up in the way that they were presented in that report.
So there is information out there and it has been out there for a long time. We do not need more talk; we need to act on the basis of evidence and the best possible advice. That is why people are questioning what the government is doing. At the present time there is no suggestion that the input of Indigenous people will be taken seriously in all of this. Why is the government taking this particular action right now and why is it taking the action at all? What does the work permit system have to do with child abuse? What do the five-year leases have to do with protecting Aboriginal children? The government has not adequately answered those questions. This leaves people to assume that there must be another motive; that this is yet another excuse to attack Indigenous people and to take away some of their very hard fought-for rights. They are not peripheral questions. The government’s motivation shapes the action it takes and will affect the community’s response to government actions.
How can it not be seen as a headline-grabbing, election-year fix designed to wedge Labor when these problems have been known about by governments for years? Aboriginal leaders and many others have been asking for action over the entire life of the government. I ask the minister to explain, when he gets a chance, just why it has taken so long. And why is the government’s intervention flying in the face of the comprehensive approach recommended by the very report that has finally prompted the government to act after more than a decade of neglect? Pat Anderson, the co-author of the Little children are sacred report, has been reported as saying:
There is no relationship between all these emergency powers and what is in our report.
And that they:
... feel betrayed, disappointed, hurt and angry - pretty pissed off all at the same time.
The government’s record of throwing children into refugee detention centres suggests that the government’s concern about the wellbeing of young people in general is very recent. Child abuse is a difficult area for policy intervention wherever it occurs. Remoteness and the greater relative scale of these issues in Indigenous communities are additional barriers for policy intervention. But vulnerable children should not be used as a political tool, and legislation that contains ideologically inspired measures unrelated to the protection of children increases cynicism and undermines any good that might come from government action.
Many people are asking: what is the logic in the proposal to remove the permit system whereby Aboriginal leaders decide who can come onto their land? Surely that will only enable non-Indigenous paedophiles to have easier access to Aboriginal children. Yet we understand that non-Indigenous paedophiles are a significant part of the problem.
Our children deserve our best efforts. The principles and strategies for effective action are known and the evidence for what will work is available. But there does have to be change, and that will only happen if Aboriginal people are listened to, respected and fully involved in the planning and the strategy. So rather than sending in the Army and the police—they are surely part of the action—we need long-term commitment so that we do not again walk away from Indigenous communities after a talkfest or after that initial assault. We need to have that commitment and it needs to be clear that that is what the government is about. The last thing that should happen is that after the next election we drop all of this and another report in a couple of years time finds that nothing has improved.

"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2007-08-08,"—I wish to raise today an important matter of public interest that is of concern to so many Queenslanders. The forced amalgamation of local councils in Queensland from 156 to 72 is causing great angst in most of the communities affected. Premier Beattie’s Labor government is acting as though drunk with power and simply shutting down the viability and local identity of many Queensland communities. The decentralised nature of the state means that Queenslanders beyond Brisbane have a strong and enduring attachment to their local institutions, social and business networks and self-governance. They are fiercely independent and self-reliant and are demanding a say in their own future. Premier Beattie has rammed through the local government amalgamations in state parliament, so I do not ever want to hear anyone from Labor stand up in this place and accuse the government of rushing legislation through.
The Queensland Premier is so out of touch and arrogant that he is reported in this morning’s Courier-Mail as declaring that he could govern Queensland for another century if he wanted. That is the most extraordinary statement. It would have done Stalin proud. The federal government has restored the right of any Queensland council to express their opinion and to run a plebiscite on the amalgamation if it wishes. The Premier says it will not stop the involuntary amalgamations. The point is that people will get a say. Just like we provided them with a say on the Traveston dam issue, the federal government is letting the people speak because Premier Beattie has denied them this basic democratic right.
Unlike the Queensland Premier, I want to hear what Queenslanders are saying. Since the announcement of federal funding for the referenda, Queenslanders have been saying plenty. The Redcliffe mayor, Allan Sutherland, says his city wants the plebiscite. Councillor Sutherland says that he and other councillors are pushing a wheelbarrow to state parliament today filled with 22,000 signatures on an anti-amalgamation petition. Councillor Allan Sutherland told Brisbane ABC radio this morning:
You know, when we were walking across the highway this morning, there’s our big glowing city sign in full light–Redcliffe, first settlement city. Well it won’t be, it won’t be a city, and I’m just so upset that the government are hell-bent on pushing this through.
He says the City of Redcliffe will take up the Prime Minister’s offer to pay for a plebiscite, saying:
All of the councillors are on the phone last night saying bring it on, absolutely. And I notice that there’s still the threat of the fine, no matter what, even if the federal government are paying for it. Well I’ll write out my cheque now. I just want the people of Redcliffe to have their say. And I do think that’s what the government is scared of.
The ABC also reported that Noosa residents who are fighting the amalgamation of the shire say they are disappointed with the federal opposition leader’s response to forced council reforms. Kevin Rudd, who is a former Sunshine Coast resident, has called for Beattie to make any amalgamations voluntary. He placed ads in Queensland newspapers calling on Beattie to change his mind, but to no effect. So much for federal Labor getting things done with state Labor. What a divided mess! Friends of Noosa spokesman, Bob Ansett, told ABC radio that Mr Rudd’s lack of intervention is likely to lead to a backlash against Labor from local voters. He said:
It’s been very disappointing because I think initially he seemed to think that there was certainly an argument for some of the councils anyway to avoid the amalgamation process. I suspect that there’s going to be a real backlash against the opposition, the Labor Party, in the federal election coming up in a few months.
The new seat of Flynn is one which will suffer greatly if the forced amalgamations go through. The number of councils in the Flynn division will be slashed from 28 to nine whole councils. The whole state of Queensland will be represented by more state members—89—than local shires, of which there will be 73. Brisbane radio 4BC reported that Aramac mayor, Gary Peoples, believes many councils will take up the offer. Councillor Gary Peoples said:
There’s a lot of people across Queensland would like to voice their opinion on it, and I think ... it would be their right to let them have their say.
The Premier said this morning that his initial legal advice is that the federal government does not have a head of power to do the referenda. He threatened that it could end up in the courts and that there may be an injunction of some kind sought. As the Redcliffe councillors said, ‘Bring it on.’ Bring it on, Premier, and see where you end up by challenging the rights of Australian citizens to express their opinion. Every Australian citizen has a right to conduct their own public affairs. Is the Premier of Queensland really going to go to court and argue against that? Is he going to jail local mayors? You could forgive Queenslanders for thinking that Premier Beattie cares more about the rights of Dr Haneef than about them.
If Premier Beattie fights in the courts to deny hundreds of thousands of Queenslanders a voice, he will not govern Queensland for the next century; he will not last till Christmas. If he goes down that track, he will be hounded from office and will take the federal Labor Party with him. At the Nationals’ Federal Council last weekend, we passed the following resolution:
That this Federal Council of the Nationals calls upon the federal government to provide sufficient immediate federal funding to enable Queensland local councils to: (a) conduct a referendum within the boundaries of their existing council on the decision by the Beattie government to destroy their local council; (b) allow local elected councillors to prepare a case of objections to show how the draconian boundary changes do not work for local communities.
The Nationals were listening and we acted promptly to address the concerns of Queenslanders. Within days, the Prime Minister announced that the Australian Electoral Commission would conduct these plebiscites free of charge to those councils that wished to take up the offer. This move has great support in Queensland. An independent market facts survey taken following the announcement of changed boundaries found that 58.9 per cent of respondents wanted a local referendum regardless of cost. The survey found that 60.5 per cent said that community identity would suffer under the changes, with 59.6 per cent expecting a lower quality of council service.
The other ramifications, which have not really surfaced yet, are that the transition committees to set up the new councils are stacked with union members. It looks like local council employees will no longer exist as such. The Queensland local government minister has said that they will ensure that council workforces are considered as local government employees and not constitutional corporations. Does that mean that they will come under a statutory authority that would just be part of a recruitment drive for the AWU? The federal Leader of the Opposition appears to be happy about supporting the AEC process, according to comments made as recently as this morning, but will he have the power to stop Premier Beattie challenging that basic democratic right?",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Local Government</title>,Matters of Public Interest,5,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2007-08-08,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
Let us be clear about what has happened today to Australian families, because while this government tries to blame everybody else for its own failings the Australian public, working families, have been slugged by this government. They have been slugged by the impostor of a Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Minchin, who is incapable of saying no to the Prime Minister. He is a doormat to the Prime Minister. As Alan Mitchell said in an article yesterday:
The Prime Minister’s claim that his government is in the clear because it is running a budget surplus and that it is all the fault of the states and their budget deficits is nonsense.
He went on to say:
After adjusting for Treasurer Peter Costello’s accounting fiddles, the federal government’s cash surplus is budgeted to fall by almost 1 per cent of gross domestic product this financial year. However, even that does not fully capture the extent to which the Howard government’s budget decisions will add to the pressures on the economy.
Let us be clear: yesterday the Financial Review exposed the impostor of a minister for finance. Jim Cairns did a better job than you are doing; you look profligate next to Jim Cairns, Senator Minchin. You cannot say no to a Prime Minister.
Let us go through the list of the $7 billion of expenditure since the budget—not included in the budget but since the budget: for the Northern Territory Indigenous community intervention, $2 billion; for Commonwealth Disability Assistance, $1.4 billion; for broadband access, $358 million; for school solar tank revamps, $336 million; for the RAAF Amberley redevelopment, $331 million; for the C-17 facilities, $268 million. And it goes on and on, totalling nearly $8 billion. There has been $8 billion of new expenditure since the budget, which was already out of control. Is it any wonder that the Australian public thinks, according to Mark Textor, that this is a deceitful government and that the Prime Minister is untruthful? Is it any wonder that the Prime Minister’s own pollster is telling him that?
You just have to go to the recent biography of the Prime Minister, where Mr Costello was talking about the lavish expenditure engaged in by the Prime Minister during the election campaign three years ago. What did Mr Costello have to say about Mr Howard’s promises during that election? He said:
I have to foot the bill and that worries me. And then I start thinking about not just footing the bill today but if we keep building in all these things, footing the bill in five, and 10 and 15 years and you know I do worry about the sustainability of all these things.
The Australian public are worried about it. The financial markets are worried about it. And, most importantly, today the Reserve Bank showed it is worried about it. The Reserve Bank showed that it is so concerned that it put up interest rates for the ninth time in a row. And you just have to listen to the economists in the market passing their judgement on this government, on Senator Minchin—the man who is in charge in this country of saying no.
What do the economists say? They had warned that a pre-election spending binge coming on top of the additional $36 billion of tax cuts and higher benefits in May’s budget could feed inflation by fuelling demand at a time when the economy is already stretched. What did Ken Henry, the Secretary to the Treasury, say to his own troops this year? He said that expansionary fiscal policy in such an environment would tend to ‘crowd out private sector activity putting upward pressure on prices and interest rates’. Because this finance minister is a failure, because he makes Jim Cairns look like a good Treasurer of this country, because he cannot say ‘no’—
—I am not that bad!
—You are that bad, Senator Minchin! You have put upward pressure on interest rates because you cannot say ‘no’ to the Prime Minister. No wonder the Reserve Bank had to put a missile across the bows of this government today. (Time expired)

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2007-08-08,"—What a very silly speech from someone who I think should have known better. It is interesting that the only people who are actually concerned about the interest rate rise today, delivered by an independent Reserve Bank, are those on this side of the House because we are aware of the pain that will cause. Quite frankly, I have seen nothing but crocodile tears from the other side. You are actually pleased about the interest rate rise today because you can talk about it for political reasons. You are shedding crocodile tears, your hands are over your mouth, but underneath you are smirking about the fact that there was an interest rate rise.
The RBA made it quite clear today that this interest rate rise is due to the strength of the economy. It strongly reinforces the message that even with a strong economy there are challenges and pressures, and they have to be very carefully managed. It does require the commitment of senior government financial managers. It requires experience, dedication and commitment from the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the finance minister. It is not the sort of management that you would trust to inexperience. It reinforces the point that even a strong economy needs safe hands to make sure that the levers are pulled properly. What you need is a Prime Minister and a Treasurer who are working together for short-, medium- and long-term gains. You do not need a Prime Minister without policies and you do not need a Treasurer without any ideas.
That effectively is what Senator Conroy is acknowledging today—their alternative is a Prime Minister with no policy and a Treasurer with no ideas. The cat was let out of the bag today—the inexperience of this alternative team. The shadow Treasurer, the would-be Treasurer, and his leader, who will be required to work together to manage this economy, cannot even get their lines right. The shadow Treasurer indicated today that he would, as Treasurer, maintain balanced budgets but only at the moment and in the current economic circumstances. When pressed by a journalist as to what his response would be in different circumstances he had no idea. His leader needed to step in over the top of him and say, ‘Our policies mirror the government’s policies.’ I can tell you quite clearly that this government’s policy does not under any circumstances countenance non-balanced budgets—deficit budgets. We have made that quite clear and we have stuck to that. That indeed has delivered to this country the sorts of outcomes that the Labor Party can only dream about. It has delivered low inflation and unemployment rates which are their lowest in 33 years. Already the shadow Treasurer, the would-be Treasurer of this country, has acknowledged that he may well deliver deficit budgets.
 I am sure there is no-one listening to this today who would, under any circumstances, countenance the delivery of deficit budgets. This government has been able to maintain strong economic growth, low inflation, low employment and low interest rates on the back of surplus budgets. But three or four months out from an election we have an acknowledgement from the would-be Treasurer of this country that he will potentially run deficit budgets. I do not need to tell you what the outcome of that would be. It would be higher inflation and higher interest rates. (Time expired)

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2007-08-08,"—On a number of occasions today in question time we put to Senator Minchin, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, the Minister representing the Prime Minister, that famous promise that this coalition government—the Liberal Party and the National Party—made to the Australian people: they would keep interest rates at record lows. That was the promise; that was the advertisement. ‘We will keep interest rates at record lows.’ How hollow does that sound now as Australian families struggle with the fifth consecutive interest rate increase since that promise was made and the ninth interest rate increase under the Howard government? Keep interest rates at record lows. How does that promise sound today? What we see in response from the Howard government is just more of the same, more ducking and weaving, more blame shifting—let us blame anyone but ourselves; let us not take responsibility.
One of the things that the Australian people will be very clear about as they deal with the impact of this interest rate increase on their mortgage repayments and the increasing financial pressure of rising childcare costs, rising grocery costs, the rising cost of living and an increase in their mortgage repayments due to the ninth consecutive interest rate increase is that this Prime Minister cannot take credit fast enough if interest rates go down. Do not get between John Howard and a microphone if interest rates go down. He cannot take credit quickly enough. But, as soon as interest rates go up, what do you see? You see this government yet again ducking and weaving and trying to blame everyone but themselves because they do not want to take responsibility. The contrast could not be starker: the government want to take all the credit when interest rates are low and then, when interest rates go up, all of a sudden the government are missing in action and trying to blame everybody else.
We have had nine consecutive interest rate increases under this government and five since that famous promise of, ‘We’ll keep interest rates at record lows.’ What we now see from the government, and the Prime Minister confirmed this yesterday, is that suddenly that is no longer the line. Yesterday, the Prime Minister said:
What I promised, and what I repeat here today ... was that in Australia interest rates will always be lower under a coalition government than under a Labor government.
Suddenly’ it is no longer, ‘We’ll keep interest rates at record lows,’ because the Australian people know that that is simply not true after nine consecutive increases. All of a sudden it is a sneaky, probably poll driven, line where the government try to get out of the fact that interest rates have risen five times since the last election.
Let us talk about record interest rates. Let us talk about who really holds the record on interest rates. Let us be clear about who really is the record high interest rate holder over the last few decades. The highest interest rate in the last 30 years was 22 per cent. And who was that under? It was under the then Treasurer, John Howard. So much for the history lesson that we get from the Howard government and their claim that interest rates will always be at record lows. What we know is that when John Howard was Treasurer interest rates were 22 per cent. We know that he promised to keep interest rates at record lows and we know that since he made that promise we have had five consecutive increases. When they made that promise the Liberal Party were either lying or simply wrong.
Today in question time I asked Senator Minchin what his advice was to working families like those of Mrs Spooner, who appeared in the Daily Telegraph today talking about the impact of interest rate increases. What was his advice to her and families like hers who are going to be hit with an increase in their repayments on top of rising fuel, childcare and grocery costs? I might have misheard Senator Abetz’s interjection, but what I heard him to say was very simply, ‘Vote Liberal.’ That’s it—vote Liberal! This government is extraordinary. They say, ‘Vote Liberal,’ and ‘Working families will never be better off.’ That’s what Australian families will understand. They will understand you made a promise you have not kept and they will understand that you arrogantly stand there and say, ‘Working families have never been better off.’ It simply shows how out of touch this Prime Minister has become and how out of touch this government has become if it honestly thinks that working families who are struggling with interest rate increases, and with the blow-out in the percentage of families who are suffering  from housing stress, have never been better off.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2007-08-08,"—Senator Minchin, the greatest Minister for Finance and Administration that Australia has ever seen, is sitting at the desk at the moment. I would like to put on the record that the outrageous claim by Senator Conroy that Senator Minchin is the equivalent to Jim Cairns simply highlights what many of the public still have in their minds—that is, Labor cannot manage the economy. The comparison that Senator Conroy made was that the finance minister of Mr Gough Whitlam, the great icon from his own side, was a fool and that he wrecked the economy. That is the sort of comparison that those on the other side wish to make. Many Australians still remember how the economy was run by Labor governments.
No-one, as the finance minister said, welcomes a rise in interest rates, least of all those with mortgages. But many people have mixed mortgages, with both fixed and variable rates, and those who have savings, particularly those on a pension, have another view about interest rate rises. We agree that no government, particularly in the political cycle that we are in, seeks an interest rate rise. But what the other side fail to understand, as they always have, is that what we have is the integrity of the Reserve Bank making a decision for the good of the whole economy. The independence of the Reserve Bank was one of the first reforms that this government introduced when it first came into office. The Reserve Bank makes decisions with no fear, favour or political influence at all for the good of the whole economy. Its objective is to maintain inflation within the two to three per cent band and it is carrying out its objective.
As mortgage holders and Australian householders know, nothing eats into their savings, wages and business profits like runaway inflation. But the other side come in here and try to say that the government has jacked up interest rates with some voodoo economics when in fact we have an independent, non-political Reserve Bank making that decision on the grounds of strong demand and a strong economy. There is no feel in the marketplace of a boom-bust cycle. We have had 10-plus years of record growth, we have strong demand and we have a strong economy in which the Reserve Bank has independently undertaken its objective to maintain inflation. That is the basis of its decision. The Reserve Bank bases its decision on a strong economy. The fundamentals are that interest rates are—in comparison to those under the previous government—low, inflation is within the two to three per cent band, employment is at its lowest rate, growth is expected to continue at record levels and this government has zero debt and runs surplus budgets. They are the fundamentals of any economy and the Reserve Bank makes its decisions based on those fundamentals—fundamentals that are good. The economy is in a strong state.
Naturally, households, governments and businesses understand that there are fluctuations in interest rates, but these have not been the 1.5 per cent interest rate hikes made by the previous government and visited upon Australian households and businesses. The decisions to lift interest rates by that 1.5 per cent level were made by the previous government. They were made by the Treasurer of the time. What a disgraceful way to run the economy! The current government brought in reforms such as industrial relations reform and the independence of the Reserve Bank so as not to get the boom-bust cycle that we had in the past. The greatest danger to interest rates is not a surplus budget and zero debt, about which those on the other side are trying to mount some crazy economic case; the greatest threat to interest rates is debt raising by the states. This is acknowledged by the former Reserve Bank governor himself. Time does not allow me to develop the case relating to the states, but rest assured that others on this side of the House will. The states are the greatest danger when it comes to further and higher interest rates.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,12,1
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2007-08-08,"—It is breathtaking arrogance that the government decry the Labor Party for politicking on interest rates when it was they who set the agenda at the last election campaign which led them to make foolish promises that they have been unable fulfil. The background to this is that the interest rate rise in August this year appears not to have slowed consumption but there is some evidence to show that the tax cuts that came into effect at the beginning of July are boosting household spending. On top of that, and after repeated warnings against just this occurrence, the Howard government have gone on an election year spending spree. As the Australian Financial Review pointed out, they have outspent the Labor Party something like three to one in populistic political spending. That is what is creating pressure on interest rates and that is what has resulted in the increase that we have seen today.
In his press conference today, the Prime Minister was noticeably tetchy when asked about political spending this year because he does not like being held to account. He likes to blame others, and preferably the Labor Party. The best evidence of this, of course, is the pre-emptive strike—the Liberal Party’s ads which blamed state spending on infrastructure for interest rate rises. I notice that Senator McGauran parrots this without supplying any evidence of it. The ANZ Chief Economist, Saul Eslake, had it right when he said that there was little connection between state government borrowing and interest rates. He said:
It’s true state governments will be borrowing money over the next four years but there’s very little historical evidence between government borrowing and the cash rate. It’s political propaganda. It’s not economic analysis.
I think that encapsulates my response exactly. The Liberal Party and Senator McGauran know that that kind of argument is complete nonsense.
The Prime Minister does not seek to explain economic matters to the Australian public; he tries to hoodwink them with confusions and half-truths. That is what he is about, in the last election and currently in dealing with the latest interest rate rises. But it is crystal clear to Australian families that they are finding it increasingly difficult to manage their household finances. They may not understand the economic background of why they are finding it difficult to manage, but they know that they are. They know that this interest rate rise will make it far more difficult for them to manage those finances—not only with regard to housing costs, whether they be mortgage or rental, but also with regard to their credit card debt. Households are paying much more on a range of costs, like education, private health, child care and petrol. Unfortunately, for many families credit cards have become part of their income stream. That debt has now reached something like $40 billion in Australia and that has to be repaid at higher interest rates.
Where is the government on this? Mr Howard says that Australians have never had it better. Mr Howard and the Liberal government have ridden on the back of an unprecedented period of excellent terms of trade and the productivity gains initiated by a former Labor government. Mr Howard has never had it better, but too many Australian families have been left behind, and they know it. Despite the Liberal government’s great good fortune in being in power during a world upturn, after this term of government they will leave behind much to be done in attracting investment to Australia, increasing productivity and improving the quality of life for working families. Working families are now faced with the double jeopardy of steadily rising prices and the government’s Work Choices system eroding their wages and conditions. All the while, the Prime Minister refuses to acknowledge that there might be a problem with his management of the economy.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,12,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-08,"—For the last half-hour or so we have heard backwards and forwards sledging about whether Labor is better on the economy or the Liberals are better on the economy, and who is best on interest rates, inflation and all those sorts of things. People can make their judgement on that, but my feeling is that the great majority of Australians who are battling more and more with the impacts of these interest rate rises frankly could not care less about that sledging backwards and forwards. They are interested in how they are going to deal with the severe financial consequences many of them are facing because of not just interest rate rises but a whole range of factors that have created a massive housing affordability crisis in Australia. That is what we should be dealing with.
The core question that I asked Senator Minchin today was: what is the government now going to do to help people, in particular people in the private rental market, many of whom in recent times have suffered very severe increases in the price they have to pay for their rental and many of whom have had to shift cities because they can no longer afford to pay private rental on flats and houses they have lived in for decades? And that is where our debate should be.
I am really sick of people going back to what the average was under the Hawke-Keating government, what the average was under the Fraser-Howard government, what the average was in different eras and what the situation was with inflation figures. There are a whole lot of big economic figures around the place that people throw backwards and forwards as some sort of statistical justification. I am sure there is some value in assessing that in a general, intellectual sense but it obscures the immediate reality that many Australians are suffering enormous hardship as a result of financial stress caused by the housing affordability crisis. Frankly, we hear very little from either of the major parties about what they are going to do about that. I do acknowledge that the Labor Party in recent times has at least accepted that housing affordability is a national crisis and has made some moves towards proposing to adopt a national strategy in this area. That is a partial step forward from where the coalition has been at—which is basically, ‘We’ll do our bit over here. All the rest is the state’s fault. We’ll just tinker around where we can with some general economic management and leave it up to the market to fix it.’ That approach has clearly failed. It has been failing for many years. Frankly, that is a clear legacy and a very sad legacy of the Treasurer, Mr Costello’s, mismanagement and lack of interest in this serious area. We saw that years ago with the cynical action by the Treasurer in responding to the housing affordability crisis, which is much worse now than it was then, by initiating an inquiry by the Productivity Commission into first-home ownership. He then totally ignored all of the recommendations from the Productivity Commission which applied to the federal government and simply blamed the states for not dealing with those recommendations that related to them. That was his approach three years ago: blame the states, ignore the evidence from the inquiry that he called himself and continue to fiddle while the housing affordability situation burned.
Now we have a far worse crisis three years later with a massively increased gap between those who own their own home, those who have significant and huge mortgage burdens, and those who cannot even manage that and are in the private rental market. That was usually the broad safety net between those who could afford their own home and those who were in public and community housing. The private rental market has now itself become unaffordable for many people. We need to do something about that now. The simple question that was asked of the Leader of the Government in the Senate was: what is the government going to do now to help those people who are suffering enormously? There was no answer. That is the most serious non-response out of everything that was said today in question time from all sides about this issue. This is impacting cities and towns across Australia. In my own state of Queensland—in towns like Mackay, Townsville, Cairns, Maryborough and Hervey Bay—it is different in different areas but the common thread is a dramatic increase in private rental and people being forced out of homes they have rented for decades. People are being forced to move away from communities which they had been part of for decades. Worst of all, there is no sign of any relief down the track—there are no signs other than that it is likely to get worse. (Time expired)

Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,12,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-08-08,"—I move:

That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:


An imminent deal between the United States and India that will exempt India from restrictions on nuclear trade will pave the way for Australia to commit to a bilateral agreement with India on the export of uranium, recognising:

the dangers of undermining nuclear weapons safeguards by selling uranium to a non-signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty;
the extent to which nuclear energy provides a solution to the problems associated with climate change;
the prospect of the Government taking control of uranium reserves from anti-mining states.
For this government, uranium mining is an ideological act of faith. Very early in its term of office, it declared that restraints on uranium mines should go. Roxby Downs would subsequently expand fourfold, and in situ mines like Beverley and Honeymoon would get the go-ahead. China would be encouraged to come to Australia and open up new uranium mines to be part of the great mining boom that is filling government coffers right now. And then, more recently, it has declared that Australia itself will go down the nuclear power path, leading the world in a resurgence of interest in nuclear power.
The nuclear power industry is on its last legs. No new reactors have been commissioned in the United States, for instance, in the last 25 years. They cannot deal with the depleted uranium that comes from the uranium enrichment process or the highly radioactive waste from their reactors around the country. Yucca Mountain Repository, which is being imposed on the state of Nevada, is already oversubscribed—and it has not even been agreed to, let alone constructed. No doubt, Mr Bush would love to unload his radioactive waste on another hapless but willing country like Australia, and no doubt this country would be willing, given half a chance.
The Howard government went ahead with the new reactor at Lucas Heights without having a repository to take the waste from either the old reactor or the new one. But the push to export uranium to India is what this current motion is all about. My question today is: is it worth the risk? The price of uranium has certainly increased, but it is not big dollars in the scheme of things. Estimates for the deal with China, for instance, are that, at most, it will be worth $300 million to Australia. Most countries will conclude that nuclear reactors are too expensive, and they will look for other options. China wants to expand its nuclear power from two per cent of total energy generation to six per cent by 2020, but it will be increasing its target for solar and wind energy from 12 per cent of total energy generation to 15 per cent by the same date.
But the most serious problem with the proposal to sell uranium to India is the proliferation of nuclear weapons. India is one of four countries outside the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons that are known to have nuclear weapons. A United Nations report earlier this year said the international community is approaching a point at which the erosion of the non-proliferation regime could become irreversible and result in a cascade of proliferation. At least 40 countries have the technology now to build nuclear weapons at relatively short notice.
The nuclear non-proliferation treaty has already been weakened by the attitude of the United States—and, indeed, of Australia—which accuses the new weapons states of North Korea and, possibly, Iran of going against the treaty but not the existing nuclear weapons states with their 27,000 nuclear warheads. The last nuclear non-proliferation treaty review was a chest-beating exercise that went nowhere on disarmament, and Australia was happy to sit back and do whatever America asked. It will not get behind the middle-power initiatives, the nuclear-free zones or the new weapons convention proposals as far as I can see, and now we see why. The nuclear non-proliferation treaty is being undermined so that we can sell our uranium to India with impunity by providing some false guarantees about making sure our uranium does not get into bombs. We have to ask the question: why is India being given an exemption from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty? And the answer, I am afraid, is that it is expedient.
Another question that has been raised is about Pakistan. Pakistan is already asking: ‘Why not us? We’d like Australian uranium as well.’ The answer, typically, is because India has been good and has not passed on technology to non-weapon states. That is a good thing, but India is still outside the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and its acquisition of nuclear weapons is a demonstration that it can be done and the sanctions will be no more than a slap on the hand. Not long ago it was thought likely that the first nuclear weapon to be exploded since 1946 would be by one or other of these two warring countries—that is, India or Pakistan. The tensions are still there, and who is to say that this little act of generosity on the part of the Australian government to one of them, namely India, will not inflame them and lead to that most feared of outcomes? What are Australia’s responsibilities under other international agreements such as the United Nations resolution 1172 or the Rarotonga treaty? In May this year—just three months ago—Minister Macfarlane emphatically ruled out exporting uranium to India on the grounds that it would undermine the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. What has changed in the last three months? Why is it now okay when then it was not?
Nuclear power is not the answer to climate change: it is too expensive, it is too slow, it uses too much water and, finally, Australians do not want it. If the Prime Minister’s polling says otherwise, why not put it to the test? I challenge the Prime Minister to take his referendum, or his plebiscite, to the people on this issue at the upcoming election, particularly to those most likely to have a reactor in their suburb, on their bit of coast. Instead of running around and pretending to oppose council amalgamations and offering to give people a say in the matter, what about doing this for one of the most contentious issues of our time? What about asking people’s views on going to war without the consent of parliament as well? Or what about selling Telstra? Put that to the people as well. What about asking the people of Western Australia how they feel about their state government being overruled so that uranium can be mined there? Perhaps there is a limit to the Prime Minister’s recently discovered push for democracy. We certainly know that Indigenous people are not getting a say on how they are being treated in the child abuse intervention. The list of ways in which this government has denied democracy is far too long for this debate.
Whilst low in emissions at the generation of electricity stage, other aspects of the nuclear cycle are very heavy greenhouse gas emitters, and that is another reason for opposing nuclear power. Everything from mining to enrichment to facility construction to reprocessing to waste management to transport is incredibly greenhouse intensive. Dr Jim Peacock, the Australian Chief Scientist, said:
Expansion of nuclear fuel cycle activities need not be part of a response to climate change.
That is what scientists have said around the world, but for some unknown reason—or reason best known to this government—the Prime Minister still keeps saying that nuclear has to be part of the answer. Again, it is a case of the Prime Minister intervening in state responsibilities, and I ask the question: where is this likely to end? Does the Constitution allow the takeover of the mining of uranium in Western Australia? I doubt it. We are already exporting 30 per cent of the world’s uranium, and it seems unlikely that there is any pressing need for us to override any state responsibilities to open up new mines.
So there is a can of worms in the government’s proposal on its deal with India. There are real risks and serious dangers in further undermining the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The guarantees that have been talked about are hardly worth the paper that they are written on. We know that if India is supplied with Australian uranium there will be tensions in the region, particularly with Pakistan, and it is not at all clear what this will do in terms of relations in that part of the world.
To summarise, there are serious dangers in us supplying India with uranium. The nuclear power industry is not going to solve the world’s climate change problems. It is certainly not a solution for Australia, and we should not be going down that path. The prospect of the federal government takeover of uranium reserves from WA in order to facilitate more uranium there is an assault on democracy, a very silly approach in terms of Commonwealth-state relations and not something that would appear to be easy to do under our current Constitution.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Nuclear Nonproliferation</title>,Matters of Urgency,22,1
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2007-08-08,"—I note that Senator Allison made the observation that the most serious problem to be dealt with in this debate is the question of the potential increased proliferation of nuclear weapons. As anyone would acknowledge, the question of increased proliferation of nuclear weapons is not what anyone is seeking in this process—not the government nor any other participants in discussions like the 123 Agreement nor even, I should imagine, India. But what may be a very serious issue that has not been contemplated in the comments made thus far is, in what I think is a very short-sighted view of where we are in the world now, some acknowledgement of the changing place of India in the world and some acknowledgement of the reality of the shifting relationships and the development of India’s role. Part of that is dealing with its phenomenal growth, with its burgeoning economy, with its changing position strategically and with its energy needs, all of which need to be addressed in any contemplation of this particular discussion but which were not. Instead, we were treated to what some might say was a dissertation on why everything is bad and why there is nothing good in exploring enhanced relationships in any way in this process.
This afternoon I want to talk about Australia’s longstanding role in this particular area. We have a strong record of demonstrated achievement on nuclear nonproliferation and on the advocacy of practical nuclear disarmament measures. For example, the non-proliferation treaty was opened for signature in 1968 and came into force in 1973, and we signed up in 1970 and ratified in 1973.
In the last few years, from 2005 until just recently, we had the role as the chair coordinating international efforts to promote entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. We have also played a long-term leading role in efforts underway to secure negotiation of a fissile material cut-off treaty, which would ban the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. The fact that that treaty, for one, is still in the works and still awaiting agreement by the Conference on Disarmament shows that these are not easy processes; these are complex processes of international engagement. They cannot be dealt with and dismissed easily, and so the processes underway between the United States and India and, similarly, between Australia and India are part of that complexity.
As a nation we also spent some time playing a very prominent role in the negotiation of the additional protocol on strengthened IAEA safeguards. We were in fact the first country to conclude an additional protocol in that process. With other countries from the G8 and other participants we are a founding partner in the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. That group includes Canada, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Britain, the United States, Russia, China, Turkey and Kazakhstan, amongst others. We continue to work towards universal application of the additional protocol, including an active program to assist countries in our region with their implementation of the additional protocol. That indicates to me that we take a serious and long-term interest in these issues and these processes, but at the same time we acknowledge that they are inherently complex; they are not simple.
A suggestion that pursuing the discussion of engagement with India on the sale of uranium should flow on to an opening up of the NNPT—with the number of signatories that it has and the sorts of processes that would be required there—is not looking at the reality of where we are in the modern world and of the role that India plays.
We have said publicly that we welcome the conclusion of the negotiations on the text of the US-India Bilateral Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement, which is known as the 123 Agreement. That is intended to establish a framework for full civil nuclear cooperation between the United States and India. That agreement was completed relatively recently, just last month in fact, and then approved by the Indian cabinet some days later. It is understood that the agreement will ensure that India is brought more fully into the nuclear non-proliferation mainstream, with separation of its civil and military nuclear facilities and with an expanded application of International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.
One of the matters I mentioned in my initial remarks concerned the economic development of India, which is obviously vital for its viable future and for the sake of its people. That growth and development has in recent years helped in alleviating what has been very destructive poverty and in ensuring a better future for its citizens. India’s economic development also demands an enormous increase in energy to continue, and it is not possible to turn our backs on that and ignore it.
In the last decade we have seen significant structural reforms which have turned India into one of the world’s fastest growing emerging economies, with boosts to living standards and reductions in poverty in certain places—although, as some of us heard in a briefing this morning, there are still many people in the Indian community living on less than $US2 a day. That is with an average growth rate of more than seven per cent in the decade since 1996 and a reduction in poverty by about 10 percentage points. With that expansion, with that growth and with those endeavours India also needs new and clean forms of energy to pursue its economic development while it addresses significant environmental challenges, most of which are on the record in other discussions. The situation is that, in 2006, India was drawing just over 2½ per cent of its electricity from nuclear power, which is expected to reach over 25 per cent by 2050, in just over four decades.
We are viewing this agreement as a constructive approach and framework to provide India with the materials that it requires to make full use of civilian nuclear power. As part of this process, I understand that we have, from the Indian side, a pledge of a ‘no first strike’ policy and a pledge not to strike non-nuclear states. Before any move towards nonproliferation for India can be secured, the US-India initiative requires India and the IAEA to enter into new safeguards arrangements and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, of which Australia is a member, to agree by consensus to make an exception to its guidelines to enable international civil nuclear supply to India. Flowing from that, the 123 Agreement requires approval by the US congress. I understand that the foreign minister and other members of the government have indicated that there is a likelihood that Australia would support a US proposal to create an exception for India in the NSG, the Nuclear Suppliers Group, subject to those new safeguards arrangements being satisfactory from the perspective of nonproliferation. But I do not believe that the NSG members have yet been formally asked to take a decision on this issue.
We find ourselves, as a country with an enormous resource of uranium, in the context of changing relationships and new agreements between the United States and India, wondering where we go next. The reality is that we are required to take a very serious look at what steps we might wish to take.
There is a very strong relationship between Australia and India as economic partners. On security and strategic issues we are collaborating at a very high level. Our cooperation ranges across a number of areas, not just economics but also defence, counterterrorism, law enforcement, air services, technology and so on. The reality of the advance of the 123 Agreement is that Australians are in a position where we need to address what happens to our uranium. This is a matter of current policy debate in Australia and I think that is a very good thing, whether or not we go all the way down the road that Senator Allison suggests and have popular consultations, for want of a better turn of phrase, on a whole range of issues. That begs the question of what being a government actually means. Being a government usually means taking the hard decisions and governing, and that is not necessarily the approach the Democrats would enjoy or recommend. Hard decisions would be unfamiliar to them.
In relation to the question of state bans on uranium mining, the Commonwealth is not intending to rush around overriding those bans. We would rather see the state premiers in the relevant states drop what is fundamentally ideological opposition to uranium mining. That is a matter which I am sure my colleagues will take up further.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2007-08-08,"—I rise to speak on the Democrats urgency motion, moved by Senator Allison. I must say at the outset that I think it lacks a bit of clarity. I am inclined to vote for it, but I am not quite sure what it meant to say. It is an interesting discussion document. I think I will vote for it, because I basically agree with all the assertions, but it does not hang together very well. With all due respect to whoever drafted it, it needs a bit of drafting work. But we are not allowed to do that. Essentially, I support the sentiments and most of the claims made in the motion. On that basis, on balance, we are going to vote for it.
At the outset, it is important to note that the US-India uranium deal is not really imminent, as it still requires ratification by the US congress and the Indian parliament. Indeed, the US  congress will examine the 123 Agreement against safeguards and conditions laid out by congress in the Henry Hyde Act—the US legislation which paved the way for the deal to be signed. Before any supply of uranium can occur, the Nuclear Suppliers Group—of which Australia is an important member, as a major uranium supplier—will receive a submission from India to be granted exemptions under the NPT. For India to import uranium, the rules of the Nuclear Suppliers Group will need to be changed. Why? Because the present arrangement is that the Nuclear Suppliers Group will only support the export of uranium to nations which have signed the NPT. Britain, France and Russia are supporting India at the Nuclear Suppliers Group, and the indications so far, although they have been a little all over the place on it, are that the Howard government may also support India in that forum. A Rudd Labor government would not do so. Labor’s national platform on uranium exports clearly states that Labor will allow the export of uranium only to those countries which, inter alia, are signatories to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Therefore, Labor would not support the export of uranium to a nonsignatory as it would further undermine and weaken an already fragile non-proliferation regime and, in my view, equally undermine the Australian uranium industry.
Labor recognises that security weaknesses exist in monitoring the global use of uranium. The director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Dr Mohamed ElBaradei, has made it clear how much work is required to strengthen the nuclear safeguards regime. Labor have recognised this and acknowledged it with recent changes to our national platform, which now includes a strengthening of our policy on safeguards. Labor will actively pursue more effective international export control regimes, through the IAEA, and tighter controls on the transfer of nuclear technology. Our 2007 national platform commits Labor to reinvigorating diplomatic efforts towards nuclear disarmament and the responsible use of nuclear technology.
Labor does not believe India is responsible for the illicit trafficking or proliferation of nuclear technology. Indeed, we understand why India is frustrated by the current non-proliferation regime. But there can be no doubt that the NPT, although requiring reform, is the bedrock of the international nuclear safeguards regime and further undermining of the treaty would not be in our best interests. Instead of writing cabinet submissions seeking approval for the export of Australian uranium to India, Labor believes the foreign minister should be urging and leading the way to greater global nuclear safeguards cooperation.
The Howard government should join Labor in campaigning for wide-ranging reform of the NPT to encourage India to join. The Howard government’s exuberant promotion of nuclear power is cause for concern, particularly given its weakness on the issue of nuclear nonproliferation. For instance, in 2006, with two other nations, Australia voted against a United Nations resolution moved by Mexico. The resolution called for a conference specifically focused on nuclear dangers that would include non-nuclear non-proliferation treaty states. Also in 2006, Australia abstained from voting in support of a UN motion to reactivate the issue of nuclear disarmament and specifically ‘accelerating the implementation of nuclear disarmament commitments’.
Australia has also voted against a UN motion calling for nuclear disarmament within a specified time frame, legally binding negative security assurances and an international conference on nuclear disarmament. Under the Howard government, Australia has also voted against a convention on the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons, including calls for the Conference on Disarmament to commence negotiations on an international convention prohibiting the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. Australia consistently abstains on the UN resolution that calls for multilateral negotiations leading to an early conclusion of a nuclear weapons convention. In short, this is a mountain of evidence that the Howard government is not prepared to encourage strong, internationally agreed safeguards. Our concern is exacerbated by their extremely poor record in the area of nuclear nonproliferation.
I think that the second issue raised in Senator Allison’s motion, which is the extent to which nuclear energy provides a solution to the problems associated with climate change, is a useful issue to raise because there is going to be an increasingly vigorous debate in this country about whether Australia should pursue a nuclear energy industry.
The Howard government, for want of a climate change policy and for want of anything to offer with regard to tackling climate change, has seized upon nuclear energy as some sort of quick fix for the problem that climate change represents to Australia. In looking to pursue nuclear energy as its response, Labor believe the government is going down the wrong path. We do not support the development of a nuclear energy industry in Australia. We know that for some countries nuclear energy is seen as a viable energy option, but they do not enjoy the energy choices that Australians take for granted.
Labor is adamant that Australia does not need nuclear power or enrichment and that we should not become the world’s nuclear waste dump. Australia has established domestic power industries with strong skills bases, massive capital assets and considerable public support. The strength of these industries and the scale of their resource bases mean that nuclear power would struggle to compete economically.
The Prime Minister’s own nuclear review, led by Dr Ziggy Switkowski, found strong economic arguments against nuclear power in Australia. It noted that our access to low-cost coal and gas meant that nuclear energy would be up to 50 per cent more expensive than electricity from fossil fuels. Dr Switkowski’s report also noted that high up-front costs of regulatory approvals and construction are drivers of that unfavourable comparison.
The review also found that nuclear energy may only become economically viable in Australia if a carbon tax or emissions trading value of up to $40 per tonne is levied on CO2 emissions. Even then, the review acknowledged that significant government support—taxpayer support—would be required to offset the cost of establishing a regulatory framework and developing the skills needed to build nuclear facilities in Australia.
On top of the up-front capital cost, and the unknown cost of government subsidies to get the industry started, the cost of decommissioning and waste disposal is also uncertain. In March 2007, the UK’s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority estimated that the total cost of decommissioning Britain’s 20 nuclear sites was £70 billion—up from an estimate of £56 billion the year before.
The decision to develop a domestic nuclear power industry would also mean Australia accepting the safety risks inherent in nuclear energy generation and taking on the problem of radioactive waste storage. Critically, any domestic nuclear power program would also face considerable challenges in gaining the necessary levels of public support. All senators would be aware of the difficulty faced over the last 15 years in establishing a disposal site for our existing radioactive waste. The difficulty in gaining public support for a nuclear power industry should not be underestimated.
The task for Australia in developing energy options to respond to climate change is not to develop a new nuclear industry but to put our vital fossil fuel industries on an environmentally sustainable footing and to build our renewable energy capacity. Australia’s coal and gas industries are vital not only for domestic power generation but also for our economy. Coal represents more than 10 per cent of our exports by value and provides around 30,000 jobs. Rather than developing a nuclear power industry, we need policy that focuses on developing clean coal technologies, which will clean up our fossil fuels and protect our economic interests. That is why Labor’s clean coal initiative is a key element of our response, and it has to go hand in hand with considerable efforts to boost our renewable energy capacity.
The Howard government has chosen a different course and seems committed to implementing the Prime Minister’s nuclear vision—although I think we are seeing some nervousness on the part of many on his backbench. The Prime Minister has already indicated that he believes that nuclear power is the cleanest and greenest form of electricity. In April, he announced a number of measures that his government was going to take to progress his vision of a nuclear powered future. Those included repealing Commonwealth legislation prohibiting nuclear activities, including provisions of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.
The government has already committed Australian taxpayers’ money to fund research for the Generation IV advanced nuclear reactor research program. We know that a director of Nuclear Fuel Australia, an Australian company proposing a domestic nuclear enrichment plant, has been in talks with the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources regarding the enrichment project. He has made it clear that he thinks his prospects of developing his proposals depend on the coalition winning the next election. He is certainly right about that.
John Howard has also recently got the backing of the Liberal Party Federal Council, which unanimously called for the establishment of nuclear reactors and high-level waste dumps in Australia. In addition, the Prime Minister has charged ministers and departments with preparing work plans which are expected to be presented to cabinet next month for implementation in 2008, should the government be returned. We know from Senate estimates hearings that these plans will include options to override state bans on nuclear power, which would eliminate the final protections Australians have against the imposition of a nuclear power plant in their region.
Clearly, at the coming federal election, Australians will have very real choices to make about Australia’s energy future. Labor’s future energy mix of clean coal and gas, geothermal, solar, wind and other renewable energies is in stark contrast to John Howard’s plan for 25 nuclear reactors dotted around our coastline.
The government’s indication that it is seeking advice on overriding state bans on nuclear power brings me to the final point raised in Senator Allison’s matter of urgency—the overriding of state controls on uranium mining within their borders. Industry minister Macfarlane has been campaigning for some time for state governments in Queensland and Western Australia to end their opposition to uranium mining. He was recently reported as saying that he was investigating suggestions that Commonwealth powers could be used to determine uranium mining policy in those states. Given the extraordinary extension of Commonwealth powers into other areas of state responsibilities in recent days, this should come as no surprise. The government is clearly looking to extend its powers in a whole range of areas, and it seems that uranium mining and nuclear energy may just be another of these.
The decision on whether or not to allow uranium mining within their borders is rightly a decision for state governments. That is Labor’s view. In modifying our position on uranium mining and export this year, federal Labor asserted the rights of the states to make decisions regarding land use and mining within their borders. Both the WA and Queensland governments were elected at their respective last state elections on the basis of a policy platform which included a continued commitment to refuse applications to mine uranium. For Premiers Beattie or Carpenter to submit to Minister Macfarlane’s pressure and allow uranium mining would be a reversal of commitments those premiers made to their electorates. For the federal government to override those restrictions would be a direct contravention of the policies Western Australians and Queenslanders voted for at the last election.
I have publicly expressed my personal view a number of times that the state restrictions will be removed. But their removal, in time, is a state matter. It is a state political issue and it should remain so. I respect the Labor premiers’ decision to stand by the policy platforms upon which they were elected.
In closing, I think this motion has raised a number of important issues about Australian and global security, about our energy future and the state of our federation. I thank Senator Allison for putting these issues on the Senate’s agenda. I think the Howard government’s pursuit of uranium sales to India fundamentally undermines the integrity of the NPT, and as such is contrary to Australia’s security interests.
Australia should focus on rebuilding the NPT, not undermining it further. We have real choices in Australia about our future energy mix. We reject the Howard government’s focus on going down a nuclear path. We have much better options. I think Australia should pursue the options of cleaner fossil fuels and renewable energies rather than endorse the government’s plans to turn Australia into a nuclear energy country.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Nuclear Nonproliferation</title>,Matters of Urgency,22,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2007-08-08,"—I rise today to support this urgency motion and to say emphatically that the Australian Greens are totally opposed to the sale of uranium to India because it is outside the non-proliferation treaty and for reasons which I will expand on in a moment, given that I have got only five minutes in which to speak. It is extraordinary to hear members of a government that constantly trade in fear suggest that the escalation of the nuclear fuel cycle can be managed in an extraordinarily safe way. The United Nations Security Council resolution 1172, passed on 6 June 1998, unanimously calls upon India and Pakistan to:
... immediately stop their nuclear weapon development programmes, to refrain from weaponisation or from the deployment of nuclear weapons, to cease development of ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons and any further production of fissile material for nuclear weapons.
The federal government decided to acquiesce to the Bush administration’s desire to ramp up India’s nuclear capacity. The Australian government went along with it. Up until then, Foreign Minister Downer had been one of the strongest advocates for saying that we should uphold the non-proliferation treaty. Once President Bush made his views clear to the Prime Minister, the Australian government shifted position.
Contrary to what Senator Payne put to the parliament, it is not true to say that the International Atomic Energy Agency will have coverage and oversight of all of India’s facilities. Many of the reactors, two of which are dedicated to making plutonium for nuclear weapons, and nine power reactors, including a plutonium breeder reactor that is currently under construction, will be outside international safeguards. Just to ramp up the tension in the region even more, Pakistan’s President Musharaff has declared that, ‘In view of the fact that the US-India agreement would enable India to produce a significant quantity of fissile material and nuclear weapons from unsafeguarded nuclear reactors, the NCA expressed firm resolve that our credible minimum deterrence requirements will be met.’ So, by agreeing to this, by sending Australian uranium to India, you are ratcheting up the degree of tension between India and Pakistan and significantly shifting the balance that is already there. It is disgraceful. It is based purely on an agenda to facilitate the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership set up by President Bush and to which Prime Minister Howard kowtows.
I am interested to hear Labor say today that it upholds this, because just a few moments ago in the Senate Labor voted with the government against a motion which called on the government to reject any sale of Australian uranium to non non-proliferation treaty states, to encourage India to join the NPT, and to use its position in the Nuclear Suppliers Group to block the submission to give India an exemption from the Nuclear Suppliers Group rules, preventing the supply of uranium to non-NPT states. So it appears that Labor in government would be prepared to express their disapproval in the Nuclear Suppliers Group, to register their dissent, but they would not block. That is the key difference.
That is where I would like clarification from the Labor Party. If they are going into government, people have a right to know exactly what they would do. We have the shadow minister, Mr McMullan, saying that they would not block. In the Senate, Senator Evans is saying that they would oppose. ‘Oppose’ is different from ‘block’ with consensus decision making, and the Australian people need to know very clearly whether Australia would have the courage of its convictions in the Nuclear Suppliers Group—which interestingly was set up because of India exploding its nuclear test and so on. That is why they set up the group. Now they are going to tear it apart again and change the rules to facilitate India to ratchet up tension in that part of the world. Given India’s record—which is not good, contrary to the Prime Minister’s assertion—in managing nuclear technology and knowledge, there is no guarantee that terrorists could not access this material from India just as easily as they can from other states which have a poor record in this regard. What we see here is a very serious issue. (Time expired)

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2007-08-08,"—Following Senator Milne reminds me why the Australian people will continue to reject the Greens. The Greens have a habit of extreme language, of opposing most developments in a modern economy. I was intrigued that Senator Milne accuses the government of fear tactics. The Greens trade on fear. Basically that is one of the leitmotivs of the Green movement—to trade on fear and to avoid wherever possible rational debate.
In the brief period that I have to debate this issue, let me go through matters which have been raised in relation to India. Senator Milne, why not put on the table exactly what Mr Downer said? Why try to invent comments from the government? Why try to make extreme comments? This is what Mr Downer, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has said in relation to a press question about any prospects of selling uranium to India:
If we were to sell uranium at all, we would only do that under strict conditions we would negotiate with India as we have with France, Britain, America, China and so on ...
Nothing like that, of course, emerged from Senator Milne’s statement. Mr Downer went on:
... a nuclear safeguards agreement so we could trace that uranium and that uranium would only be used in several nuclear power stations, not used for any military purpose.
He went on to say:
But we haven’t made any decision to do this yet, even to negotiate such an agreement, because first we would want the nuclear reactors that we would sell the uranium for, to come under the strict controls of the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency and they would be able to send inspectors and inspect how the reactors operate and the like.
Let us get those facts on the table. In her remarks, Senator Payne added considerable details. In fact, there are various hoops that this proposal would still have to go through before any such matter could even be considered. For example, India and the IAEA must enter into new safeguard agreements, the Nuclear Suppliers Group must agree, by consensus, to make an exemption to the guidelines to enable international civil nuclear supply to India, and the so-called 123 Agreement that the US government has negotiated would have to be approved by the US congress. So there are many hoops to go through before such a matter could even be considered.
I was intrigued that the Labor Party sent Senator Evans in to debate this issue. It is a sensitive issue for the Labor Party and the Labor Party is hopelessly divided on this matter. Senator Evans, I think, as part of the leadership group, could be guaranteed to carefully tread the minefield as he went through it. Senator Webber is shaking her head. Of course, under the famous three mines policy of the Labor Party, which Senator Webber strongly supported, there was massive expansion of uranium mining in Australia, supported by a number of state premiers. Now, of course, the notorious, the useless, the pathetic three mines policy has been rejected by the Labor Party. But, in order to avoid upsetting some of their supporters, who are, as I said, hopelessly divided on uranium mining, they have said that, in relation to Western Australia and Queensland, it is a matter for the premiers. In the meantime, Labor Premier Rann is massively trying to expand uranium mining in that state. In listening carefully to the very moderate delivery of Senator Evans, I detected that the Hansard will show that. He said that the states do have a constitutional responsibility in the area, which is true, but he said he thought it would be better if the states of Queensland and Western Australia removed these restrictions and came on board. It was said very carefully and in a way to not highlight this issue. But what does this mean? In effect, it means Senator Evans was saying that Australia and the Labor Party wanted to expand the nuclear mining industry—that is the effect of what Senator Evans said.

Senator Webber interjecting—

—Now Senator Webber is looking upset because she is very opposed to this. Oh, hello, Senator Webber is in favour of the expansion! This is very important, that Senator Webber is now in favour of the expansion of uranium mining in Australia which is very interesting for the record. Now, let me deal with the second part of the motion.

Senator Wong interjecting—

—Don’t get sensitive, Senator Wong, or I might start to speak about some of your issues. In relation to the second part of the motion, it is interesting to note that it is poorly worded and it was not precisely clear what the motion is. If we banned nuclear power plants around the world, emissions of carbon dioxide would be some 2.5 billion tonnes higher per year. The person who is drawing our attention to the important debate of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions wants to ban nuclear power. If you ban that, according to the figures I have, you would increase carbon dioxide emissions by some 2.5 billion tons per year. A remarkable policy and again it shows the unreality of much of this debate and the unreality of the Greens, and, I regret to say, the Democrats, on this. The Labor Party, of course, because of its hopeless divisions in this area which will paralyse it, finds it hard to debate this policy in any sensible and rational way.
Then, of course, the final part of the motion is the alleged prospect of the federal government taking control of uranium reserves from anti-mining states. I explained how carefully Senator Evans walked around this particular minefield for the Labor Party. We did come to the conclusion, when we listened carefully to Senator Evans, that the Labor Party was in favour of an expansion of this industry. It has expanded and we should not apologise. While Hawke and Keating were in office, uranium mining expanded greatly in Australia and we should not hide from that fact. My advice is that the Commonwealth government has no plans to override state bans on uranium mining, and I understand that the legal advice provided suggested that this would probably not be a viable option anyway. Of course, the most effective way for Australians to benefit from surging international demand for uranium mining is—(Time expired)

"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2007-08-08,"—Unlike Senator Kemp, I will do my best not to misrepresent others in this debate. Senator Kemp is somewhat sadly mistaken, I think: Labor is not divided when it comes to the issue of selling uranium to India; we are at one. We had an interesting debate within our party about the future of uranium mining and we now have an agreed platform. We have an open and public process. We have a lively debate and we form a view, unlike those opposite who just do what their Prime Minister tells them to.
Senator Payne made an interesting contribution earlier, talking about the importance of Australia’s relationship with India. Indeed, it is of growing importance and a relationship that all of us in this place should probably spend more time contemplating. However, even more important are our responsibilities as a nation when it comes to being an exporter of uranium. Therefore I, like Senator Evans, have absolutely no problem with supporting, in particular, part (a) of Senator Allison’s motion and, indeed, the sentiments expressed in the rest of the motion.
If anyone is confused about the conditions under which uranium and nuclear power can be used, it is those opposite. You only have to look at the way they choose to treat two different nations: India and Iran. There is deep and significant confusion and division there.
Not only the shadow minister for foreign affairs, Mr McClelland, but also all of the media have pointed out the problems the federal government has with its contemplation of selling uranium to India. Mr McClelland has been on the record as saying that the federal government is pretty much into unrestrained promotion of nuclear power and that this is a cause of great concern, especially when it comes to the government’s poor record in the area of nuclear nonproliferation.
I notice that there are a whole lot of new strict conditions—not a strict condition that says you have to sign up to the NPT but a whole lot of other strict conditions that we may or may not be aware of. Instead of trying to work out a way of coming up with strict conditions under which to sell uranium to India, which the foreign minister has been trying to do, he should be joining us on this side in campaigning for wide-ranging reform and strengthening of the nonproliferation treaty. And then he should encourage India to join it.
It is important that we place on record here that the NPT allows the development of the nuclear energy industry, provided that countries do not build nuclear weapons. India, of course, has tested nuclear weapons, to our knowledge, in 1974 and 1998. India joins Pakistan, North Korea and Israel as the only four countries that have not signed the NPT.
So the government is going to contemplate selling uranium to India, and we are going to look at some nefarious ‘strict conditions’ that do not include signing up to the NPT. This is the same government that wanted to use the NPT to quite justifiably deal with the challenges that we were confronting with Iran. Well, you cannot opt in and opt out of an NPT. You cannot say that it is really important that Iran has to be a signatory and they have to obey it but that it is okay for us to sell uranium to India, which refused to sign it and which is on record as testing nuclear weapons. You cannot have it both ways—you either believe in the NPT and you want it enforced universally or you do not. You cannot play sneaky games with the United States about who is good and who is bad and opt in and opt out of the NPT. You cannot do that and be a responsible exporter of uranium.
What you also cannot do is go and seek legal advice—which the government did confirm at estimates hearings it was getting; I know because I was there with Senator Evans—about overriding the states when it comes to nuclear power and enforce nuclear power and uranium mining on them, yet, at the same time, override state governments and say they cannot have wind farms. Well, who cares about the environmental future of this nation and the energy sustainability of this nation? You cannot do that. You cannot have it both ways. Just as you cannot opt in and opt out of the NPT, you cannot pick and choose when you are going to override people— (Time expired)

"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2007-08-08,"—I am very pleased to be able to participate in this debate this afternoon and, just by way of introduction, say that I share Senator Evans’s mystification as to the real intent of this motion. It seems to me that this is probably the only matter upon which he and I agree in relation to this debate. It is poorly drafted and it is not entirely clear as to its intent. But, insofar as one can divine that, it seems to be a good example of the Democrats hyperventilating on an issue of public importance but completely overstating the possible implications of the matter and, in that context, devaluing the sentiment contained within the motion. But, of course, the Senate is a very democratic place.
I confess that I had some concerns about the India-US nuclear deal when it was first announced. In fact, I think I am on the public record as expressing some reservations about it. The reason for those reservations was that it was not clear, when the agreement was announced, how restrictive it might be. It was not clear, when the agreement was announced, as to the extent to which there might be protections for the nonproliferation regime or to the extent to which there might be safeguards in relation to the materials and the technology that were to be transferred under the agreement. But we now know the answer to these questions.
The agreement was concluded on 20 July this year and is now available for public scrutiny, and I suspect that it would be a productive thing if all of those who had participated in the debates, but particularly those on the other side of the chamber, were to go to the agreement and look specifically at the provisions, because they are very illuminating. Let me take you to article 10 of the agreement. It reads very straightforwardly:
1. Safeguards will be maintained with respect to all nuclear materials and equipment transferred pursuant to this Agreement, and with respect to all ... fissionable material used in or produced through the use of such ... materials and equipment ...
It goes on to say, at point 2 of article 10, that that nuclear material:
... shall be subject to safeguards in perpetuity in accordance with the India-specific Safeguards Agreement between India and the IAEA ...
And, importantly, it draws in the additional protocol, which of course adds a significant and important enhancement to the safeguards regime.
It is not just article 10 of the agreement that should be of interest to those who are concerned about this. Article 5, section 6, says:
... an India-specific safeguards agreement will be negotiated between India and the IAEA providing for safeguards ... India will place its civilian nuclear facilities under India-specific safeguards in perpetuity and negotiate an appropriate safeguards agreement to this end with the IAEA.
Yet again, article 6 of the 123 agreement says:
India will establish a new national reprocessing facility dedicated to reprocessing safeguarded nuclear material under IAEA safeguards ... The Parties agree on the application of IAEA safeguards to all facilities concerned with the above activities ... Any special fissionable material that may be separated may only be utilized in national facilities under IAEA safeguards.
So at every turn this agreement, which is now available on the public record, asserts the importance, from the United States perspective, of having India participate in the non-proliferation regime. It continues to assert the importance of the regime as a means of protecting the global community, the international community, from further proliferation.
As my colleagues on this side of the chamber have said, there is a long way to go before this agreement might actually be implemented. The Nuclear Suppliers Group must of course agree to change; the 123 agreement itself must be approved by the Congress, and that may not be an easy thing to do—there is some reservation in the Congress already about the particular matter; and, of course, India itself, as the 123 agreement says, must negotiate an appropriate agreement with the IAEA. So we have a very long way to go before this particular agreement is put in place.
None of this makes certain that Australia itself will then go on to conclude an agreement to sell uranium to India. Let us assume the possibility that this course actually occurs; let us assume that Australia did take this possibility. I think we can say with some confidence that, at the very least, there would be comparable safeguards in place, as are contained in the 123 agreement concluded between the United States and India. That would reinforce Australia’s longstanding tradition of supporting the non-proliferation treaty regime.
Let me remind the Senate of the extent to which that is actually the case: the considerable work we have done in relation to nonproliferation over a long period of time—the failed negotiations in New York in 2005, for example; the continuous support we have had in trying to bring into force the nuclear test ban treaty; the work we have done in relation to negotiating the additional protocol which, as I said a moment ago, substantially enhances the overall safeguards regime—and let us not forget the work that Australia has done in relation to supporting the global initiative for combating nuclear terrorism. Australia has consistently, over a long period of time, since the mid-1970s when it began to sell uranium overseas, strongly supported the non-proliferation regime. There is no reason on earth to assume that that will not continue to be the Australian government’s policy should there be a decision, sometime in the future, to sell uranium to India.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2007-08-08,"—The speech read as follows—

In tabling the Committee’s Alert Digest No. 8 of 2007 I would like to draw the Senate’s attention to three bills that include provisions which would abrogate the privilege against self-incrimination.
At common law, people can decline to answer questions on the grounds that their replies might tend to incriminate them.  Legislation that interferes with this common law privilege trespasses on personal rights and liberties.
The Committee does not see this privilege as absolute, however, recognising that the public benefit in obtaining information may outweigh the harm to civil rights.  One of the factors the Committee considers is the subsequent use that may be made of any incriminating disclosures.
Where a provision limits the circumstances in which information so provided is admissible in evidence in proceedings against the affected person, the Committee may accept that it strikes a reasonable balance between the competing interests of obtaining information and protecting individuals’ rights.
In Alert Digest No.8, the Committee has commented on provisions in the following bills that may be considered to abrogate the privilege against self incrimination.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2007-08-08,"—The speech read as follows—

In tabling the Committee’s Alert Digest No. 8 of 2007 I would like to draw the Senate’s attention to three bills that include provisions which would abrogate the privilege against self-incrimination.
At common law, people can decline to answer questions on the grounds that their replies might tend to incriminate them.  Legislation that interferes with this common law privilege trespasses on personal rights and liberties.
The Committee does not see this privilege as absolute, however, recognising that the public benefit in obtaining information may outweigh the harm to civil rights.  One of the factors the Committee considers is the subsequent use that may be made of any incriminating disclosures.
Where a provision limits the circumstances in which information so provided is admissible in evidence in proceedings against the affected person, the Committee may accept that it strikes a reasonable balance between the competing interests of obtaining information and protecting individuals’ rights.
In Alert Digest No.8, the Committee has commented on provisions in the following bills that may be considered to abrogate the privilege against self incrimination.
The Migration Amendment (Sponsorship Obligations) Bill 2007, would insert proposed new subsection 140ZJ(8) of the Migration Act 1958, which would abrogate the privilege against self-incrimination for a person required to answer a question or produce a document under new subsections 140ZJ(2) and (4) of the Act.  The Bill, however, includes a provision that limits the use of any information provided, or derived from the information provided, in criminal proceedings against the individual.  As such, the Committee was prepared to accept that these provisions strike a reasonable balance between the competing interests of obtaining information and protecting individuals’ rights.
The Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Discretionary Mutual Funds and Direct Offshore Foreign Insurers) Bill 2007 and the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Simplifying Regulation and Review) Bill 2007 both include provisions that would abrogate the privilege against self incrimination.  In each bill the respective provisions go on to limit the circumstances in which the information provided is admissible in evidence in proceedings against the affected person.  However, that limitation applies only to the information directly supplied by the person and not to information gained indirectly as a result of the statement or document so provided.
The explanatory memoranda accompanying the bills provide no explanation as to why the provisions only permit a ‘use immunity’ and not a ‘derivative use immunity’ in respect to the information and/or documentation provided.  The Committee has sought advice from the Treasurer in respect of each of these provisions.  Pending the receipt of this advice, I draw Senators’ attention to these bills.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-08,"—I move:
That Determination 2007/04: Principal Executive Office (PEO) Classification Structure and Terms and Conditions, made pursuant to subsections 5(2A), 7(3D) and 7(4) of the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973, be disallowed.
This is, of course, the Greens’ motion to disallow the regulation to increase the pay of members of parliament. The two regulations before the Senate would increase the income of members of parliament by 6.7 per cent. That comes on top of a seven per cent increase this time last year. It will mean that this year the average pay of members of parliament on the back bench will rise by $8,000 to $127,000 per year—that is, if you do not take into account electoral allowances and all the other provisions for members of parliament. This 6.7 per cent would increase the Leader of the Opposition’s income by $15,000 to $235,000 per year and it would increase the Prime Minister’s salary by $21,000 to $336,000 per year.
Let’s do a comparison. The Prime Minister’s salary will go up by $21,000 per year, but the 1.2 million pensioners who made this country what it is are on a total of $13,652 per year. We are seeing an increase in the Prime Minister’s income that is almost double the total-year income for the 1.2 million pensioners of this country. That is unfair, that is unjustified, that is not right and it is no way to honour the people who have contributed so much to this country. We are proposing not simply a stopper on an unjustifiable pay rise to members of parliament but that the money go to giving a very necessary and justified lift in income to 1.2 million pensioners in this country—the Prime Minister’s 1.2 million forgotten Australians. They deserve the pay increase, not us.
When you look for justification for this 6.7 per cent increase on top of the seven per cent last year—a 14 per cent increase—there is none. The Remuneration Tribunal, which is said to be independent but is nothing of the sort in my book, gives no justification. It calls none of us before it. There is no increase in workload, greater demand on our services or productivity output improvement to justify this increase, which for all of us is $8,000 per year and for the Prime Minister is $21,000 per year. Certainly let us have an increase which keeps up with the cost of living in Australia. That is what the pensioners get. But no, that is not the case for members of parliament who represent those pensioners and, indeed, average Australians in their millions. While pensioners have had no real increase in their income during the 11 years of Prime Minister Howard’s government compared to the increase in the cost of living, the income of members of parliament has gone up by 85 per cent—pensioners, zero; members of parliament, 85 per cent. Who opposite, or indeed in the Labor ranks, is going to justify those figures? There will not be justification because there is no justification.
When we look at the measly pension—the $260 that pensioners get to make ends meet in this country—it is very easy to overlook the fact that the cost of living index does not reflect increasing costs for them in particular. As we all know, cheap imported goods—which we on higher incomes buy in great amounts—are largely beyond the reach of the people on the lowest incomes in the country, including pensioners. What is not beyond their reach—because they have to pay these costs—are the much more rapidly increasing costs of rent, food, transport and services. So in fact, when you take that factor into consideration, we see that pensioners have not only not kept up with parity but also are very probably losing ground. The pensioners I speak to, including a wonderful group of Greek Australians in Marrickville on the weekend, are finding it very tough indeed to make ends meet in this wealthy Australia of 2007. They do not like the fact that we parliamentarians get such things as gold cards when we retire for free travel. They note it but they cannot do anything about it. They feel cheated because they have worked for decades to put this country on the basis that it is on, and none of us can deny them that. Our wealth has come out of their labours. But they are not being rewarded for it; they are being overlooked and forgotten.
What we Greens are saying is, ‘Well, let’s put the parliamentarians’ pay increase towards giving the pensioners a pay increase instead. We are up 85 per cent. Let’s lift them from zero per cent and give them a break.’ If the current tax breaks for the mega-rich in this year’s Costello budget can put $3.5 billion into the pockets of people taking home more than $75,000 a year—and every member of this parliament is included in that bracket—then we have more than ample funds to give the 1.2 million pensioners, and indeed the 600,000 part-pensioners, a reasonable increase. What will it be? Will it be the $160 increase that we backbenchers are getting at the moment or the hundreds more for the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister? No, it will be $30 a week for pensioners—that is, one-tenth. Surely we can forgo this one pay rise and this one tax cut to give the pensioners of this country one-tenth of the amount that will land in our pay packets if we do not do this. One-tenth is $30 a week. Is it too hard in this age of wealth in this country to give the pensioners of this country $30 a week? We Greens say, ‘No, it is not.’ It is not only not too hard; it is warranted, it is right and we should be doing it. We cannot in good conscience put our hands into the taxpayers’ pockets to line our own and turn our back on the pensioners of this country, as the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition want to.
I realise how the numbers fall, but I make an appeal here—and maybe this will be heard by the Prime Minister or the Prime Minister in waiting. It is high time that we were debating the pensioners, who have been forgotten, rather than ourselves—who get thought about too often. It is a tough job being in here. We are open to all sorts of pressures that maybe quieter citizens do not have. But that is our privilege and that is our option. They have none. They are dependent on us. The budget this year left them out altogether save for one thing. There were big tax breaks right across the board which privileged the rich much more than the poor and the middle-income earners in this country. On top of that was $3.6 billion for those earning over $75,000—which we Greens oppose. Hidden in the budget was a one-liner saying, ‘Pensioners will get a once-off $500 in the run-up to the election.’ How tawdry is that? If that is not a ‘sit quiet, take the money and vote for us’ inducement for votes from this clever Prime Minister’s backroom thinkers then what is it? I was in Burnie the other day when an aged pensioner came up to me and said, ‘Well I’ve got $500 and I want to put it into your campaign because I think it would do better if Mr Costello knew it was coming in your direction.’ That was one person’s view of how she wanted to see the country go. It is my job to see that she is not out of pocket over that, but the thought was there.
We have many elderly or incapacitated Australians on the pension. They are not highly organised. They do not have an open door to the politicians’ offices like the big corporations and the big end of town to get the mega tax breaks. It is so easy here to take them for granted, and that is what is happening here. Australia’s pensioners are being taken for granted—and, I think, taken down. We can do better. We must do better. We Greens are taking a stand here today. This is not just about blocking an unwarranted, unjustified pay rise for members of parliament in 2007; it is also about remembering those who are struggling to make ends meet in 2007. Wouldn’t it be better if some of those mega tax breaks had gone into the public health system? What about a dental care system for this country? Prime Minister Howard cut out the concession card holders’ dental care system in his first year of office. Now we have pensioners waiting two years to get a tooth looked at in mega-rich Australia 2007. Is that the legacy of the Howard government when it comes to social justice in this country? We can and we must do better than that. This motion today is a very strong statement for the Greens saying to the big parties who hold office or are in opposition in this country; ‘Think again on this pay grab. Think again about the plight of those people who cannot make ends meet in 2007. They deserve some of the wealth of this country which they are being denied.’",SENATE,<title>PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICE CLASSIFICATION STRUCTURE AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,29,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2007-08-08,"—I rise on behalf of the Labor Party to indicate we will not be supporting the disallowance motion moved by Senator Brown. As I understand it, the disallowance motion seeks to disallow the determination by the Remuneration Tribunal which led to a 4.2 per cent increase in salaries for those people affected by the decision—essentially, the principal executive officer remuneration range upon which the parliamentary salaries are linked. It also, as I understand it, affects about 95 senior public servants. The allowance to senators and members is pegged at the reference salary of band A in the lowest of the PEO ranges. So, by moving this motion, Senator Brown seeks to deny the pay increase to politicians, but of course also denies it to a range of public servants. I understand the reason he has done it. I am sure it is not his intention to affect them in that way. I think he expects to lose it, but, in doing so, I suspect he might have lost 95 potential votes among those public servants. I am not sure how many of them vote Green, but they will not be voting Green next time, Senator Brown.
My problem with this, as I have said previously, is that Senator Brown proposes that we set our own salaries. Senator Brown says he knows better and this Senate knows better how to establish the rate of pay for senators and members. By moving this motion, he seeks to put an alternative proposition to that one determined by the independent body, the Remuneration Tribunal, which is authorised to set the salaries of members of parliament. On this occasion, Senator Brown seeks to say, ‘No, we won’t use an independent umpire’—the sort of independent umpire that Senator Brown has supported in terms of IR legislation for other workers in this country and has had a good position on over the years; allowing the right for independent determination of such things. On this occasion, he says, ‘I, Senator Bob Brown, will tell you what the salary of politicians ought to be.’ Now there may be others who want to argue a much lesser position than the total remuneration package Senator Brown proposes. But, effectively, Senator Brown says: ‘I know better. On this occasion, I will determine what the rate will be by disallowing this regulation. I will take it out of the hands of the independent umpire and I will make this parliament decide.’
Fundamentally, I have always opposed the proposition that people should set their own salary and conditions. We are no better at doing it than anybody else. We are totally conflicted and any ability to try and explain such decisions in a wider audience would be undermined by claims of self-interest. Whatever we do, we cannot win. But, quite frankly, we are not the appropriate body to set the salary and conditions. I think it would be totally inappropriate for the Senate to seek to establish the rates of pay and conditions for politicians. It is just not appropriate. Because of that recognition, in 1999 the government made a regulation under the Remuneration and Allowances Act to link the parliamentary base salary with reference to the tribunal’s principal executive officer structure. It basically allowed the tribunal to manage the salary structure since that time.
The difficulty for us, of course, is that every time there is a movement it comes before us by way of the determination and it gives an opportunity for someone to seek to have a debate about it. I am fine with a public debate on the issue. I am fine with a public debate about politicians’ salary and conditions, but I am not relaxed about us determining them. I am happy to have a debate, but I am not happy about making the decision because no-one will see us as independent on that subject. I just think it is totally inappropriate and wrongheaded for us to set our own salary and conditions. That has been a principle broadly accepted by parliamentarians and broadly accepted by the public. No-one, apart from Senator Brown, argues that the Senate ought to set the salary.
Senator Brown is saying he has made an independent judgement as to what the appropriate salary ought to be for a senator and member, and he is going to give effect to that by his motion today. So Senator Brown is now putting himself as the independent umpire of his and our conditions by what he seeks to do today. He says, ‘On this occasion,’ but, quite frankly, this process has been followed before. I cannot remember when—I did not bother looking up on which previous occasions Senator Brown or others have done this—but it has been quite common in other parliaments for, generally, minor party senators to use the opportunity to play some cheap politics. I think the Greens did it in Western Australia at one stage in the state parliament. It is useful in terms of publicity. I assume you get a lot of coverage from it. That is your prerogative. But the reality is that good public policy requires, in my view, that the parliament not seek to set the terms of the salary and conditions of parliamentarians. We do not have a great record on it. We are totally conflicted in doing so and there would be no public confidence in any decision-making processes that we took in that regard.
I think we are better off having all our salary and conditions set by an independent Remuneration Tribunal, as I have never been comfortable with us seeking to set some of our other conditions. I remind senators of the government’s decisions in relation to MPs’ print entitlements, where the government determined those levels and brought them before the parliament. I just do not think we are the right people to be making those decisions. The government got it wrong. It appeared highly politically motivated to increase MPs’ printing entitlements in the lead-up to a federal election. It favoured the government party because they had more members. The whole thing looked like a political stunt and the whole thing brought politicians into disrepute. As far as I am concerned, an independent Remuneration Tribunal should set all of those conditions. I am not sure that is our official party policy; I will check that. But, as far as I am concerned, hands off! We are not the right people to determine those things. There ought to be independent assessment of those things.
Senator Brown talks about public disquiet. Everywhere I go people tell me they do not think politicians are paid enough—particularly the Prime Minister and senior ministers. Maybe that is because I am moving in the resources sector these days and they are all earning a packet and anything under 500 grand looks paltry. But, to be honest, even when I had the shadow portfolio which covered FaCSIA and I was moving among the community sector, they tended to express the view that they thought, because of the hours and the responsibilities, not all politicians were paid enough.
I do not share that view. In my personal judgement, the salary is about right. I do not think paying politicians will attract better people to politics, but I guess I would say that, wouldn’t I? I do not adopt that argument. People go into public life for reasons other than salary. It ought to be of a sufficient level that people are not making a massive sacrifice, but, equally, I do not know of anyone in public life who would be motivated by a minor adjustment in pay rates. As we know, we have a fair share of millionaires in the parliament these days. They are not doing it for money—it is costing a few of them—but that is a sign that we can attract all sorts of people to the parliament and that they come in for reasons other than the salary.
But the fundamental principle that this parliament has endorsed and the community broadly accepts is that we should not set our own pay and conditions. Senator Brown’s motion has the effect of seeking to get the parliament to set them again by virtue of the disallowance opportunity of the regulation. It is a bit opportunistic of Senator Brown to seek to do this. I understand why, but I have seen these stunts before about rejecting this pay rise or that pay rise. Every time it comes up it is an opportunity, but I think we ought to be more systematic in the way we approach it. We ought to say: ‘What are the principles? How should these be determined? What is the process?’ Establish that and leave it alone; do not seek to interfere when one thinks there is political advantage in running one case or the other. That is a principle this Senate ought to endorse.
The issue that Senator Brown was right to raise, and which is an important issue, is the level of the age pension. He expresses concern, rightly, about the level of the aged-care pension. I, frankly, do not understand how people live on that income. I never have. It is interesting: I was chatting to my father the other day, who is an independent retiree as a result of his employment, and he was expressing the view of how well off he was in comparison to pensioners and how he was appreciative that he had joined a super scheme late. He was espousing his support for superannuation, that it had made his retirement far more comfortable than it would have been if he had been on the pension. He mentioned that a couple of his drinking mates down at the Wembley Hotel were surviving on pensions and that they were finding it very hard to afford the occasional beer. Senator Brown makes a good point about that; it is an issue we ought to focus much more on.
His point about the CPI increases is also right. I have had no end of representations from pensioners about the basket of goods which is used to calculate the changes in pensions—that things like cheap imported electrical goods are in the basket and that the price of plasma TVs coming down subdues the total value of the CPI index. They quite rightly say to me, ‘I’m flat out paying for my groceries, without buying plasma TVs, and I’m still operating on the old black-and-white we’ve had since 1963.’ Those are legitimate arguments, and the parliament ought to have more debate about them and focus on the conditions that so many tens of thousands of pensioners live in in this country. It is right to focus on that. I know that inside the Labor Party we have focused on those issues and on how we can afford to improve the lot of pensioners. So that part of the debate is right, but linking the issues to try to say, ‘If we stop the pollies getting a pay rise, somehow this is going to favour pensioners,’—it is easy politics. It gets you a headline and you get a run in the paper, but you do not do anything to improve public policy in this country. In the end you do not do anything to assist the pensioners. It is unhelpful and, quite frankly, it does not do the reputation of politicians and the political process any good.
As I said, it is easier to do the stunt, but there are serious issues at stake. I know it is harder for Senator Brown and the Greens to get noticed in the current climate. The focus on the prime ministerial race between Mr Rudd and Mr Howard is consuming a lot of oxygen in the political debate. The reality of the Senate becoming less relevant since the balance of power changed and our inability to get any focus on the role of the Senate and the accountability mechanisms must make it much harder for minor parties. That might be difficult, but I do not think pulling stunts like this is the answer to those pressures. I am sure the Greens and the Democrats and Family First are finding this. The parliament ought to reiterate its support for salary and conditions being set by an independent Remuneration Tribunal. We ought to, as much as possible, move down that path in relation to most politicians’ and parliamentarians’ conditions. The government’s move on the postage and printing allowances was a classic sign of why we should not be put in charge of our own conditions. Proper decision-making process was corrupted by the political panic of the government to try to ensure their incumbents had the best opportunity to be re-elected. That is not the proper basis on which you decide postage or printing allowances for parliamentarians.
Labor will be opposing Senator Brown’s disallowance motion. The decision of the Remuneration Tribunal, whether one agrees with the quantum or not, has been determined by the appropriate body, not by parliamentarians seeking to set their own wages, and we ought to accept that that process serves our democracy much better than this attempt to pick and choose on which occasions and under which conditions we accept or reject it. It is not a sustainable process, and I do not think it is in the interests of confidence in the political system more generally.",SENATE,<title>PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICE CLASSIFICATION STRUCTURE AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,29,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2007-08-08,"—In most years, Senator Bob Brown seeks to run this sort of argument after a Remuneration Tribunal review. We have come to expect this rhetoric and shallow grandstanding from Senator Brown. As the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate indicated, it is about Senator Brown getting publicity and attempting to stay at the forefront of people’s minds. It is a bit shallow, really. Since 1999, the base parliamentary salary for all senators and members has been linked by regulation to a salary determined by the Remuneration Tribunal, an independent statutory body that determines remuneration and related matters for key Australian government officers, not just parliamentarians. As a result of this legislative link, the base salary is adjusted automatically in line with the relevant Remuneration Tribunal decision, usually on 1 July each year.
The salary for members of parliament has been set at the A level, which happens to be the lowest level of the principal executive officer salary band. Obviously, being a parliamentarian is not about the money. To the best of my knowledge and understanding, nobody aspires to parliament because ‘the money is so good’; they do it for other reasons. As I said, level A is the lowest level of the principal executive officer salary band—and this is the salary band for senior public servants. The new base salary will be $127,060. The pay rise comprises two elements: firstly, an increase of 2.5 per cent as a result of the restructure of the principal executive officer salary band outlined in determination 2007/04; and a further increase of 4.2 per cent as a result of the annual remuneration adjustment outlined in determination 2007/08. The first component is a catch-up clause which reflects a disparity between the benchmark and actual wage movements in the senior ranks of the Public Service. The second component is the annual review of salary.
In undertaking its annual review and deciding on appropriate adjustments, the Remuneration Tribunal takes into account a range of factors—none of which are the views of parliamentarians! More seriously, I am advised that, if this disallowance motion were to be passed today, it would have a flow-on effect to all public servants at the principal executive officer salary band. This would deny a wage increase to the following people: the General Manager of Aboriginal Hostels Ltd; the General Manager of the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency; the Managing Director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; the General Manager of the Australia Council for the Arts; the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Film Commission; the Director of the Australian Film, Television and Radio School; the Principal of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies; the Director of the Australian Institute of Marine Science; the Chief Executive Officer of Cancer Australia; the Chief Executive of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation; the Director of the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency; the Chair of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority; the General Manager of Indigenous Business Australia; the General Manager of the Indigenous Land Corporation; the Director-General of the National Library of Australia; the Director of National Parks Australia; the Renewable Energy Regulator; the Managing Director of the Special Broadcasting Service; and the General Manager of the Torres Strait Regional Authority—to name but a few. Obviously, the government will oppose this motion.",SENATE,<title>PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICE CLASSIFICATION STRUCTURE AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,29,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2007-08-08,"—I rise to speak on Senator Bob Brown’s disallowance motion because I want to put my personal views on record. This motion, if successful, would disallow the 4.2 per cent increase that applied to members’ and senators’ salaries from 1 July this year. I note that this motion no longer disallows determination 2007/04, which allows for the 2.5 per cent increase—and, of course, these two determinations are usually considered together as annual adjustments to wages. I understand Senator Brown’s position and the intent of his motion. Like Senator Evans, I too feel very strongly and passionately about the issues to which Senator Brown referred, particularly in relation to pensioners and the inadequacy of pensions in this country. But I want to place on record that I am unhappy about the precedent set by this disallowance motion.
By pursuing this motion, Senator Brown, as he would appreciate, places his parliamentary colleagues in a unique but awkward position. He is essentially demanding that we take responsibility for determining our own salaries when, at the same time, we are directly responsible to the Australian people. Avoiding this situation is the very reason why we have our salaries set by the independent Remuneration Tribunal. The Remuneration Tribunal is empowered under the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 to inquire into the salary of public officials, and it is standard practice for it to do so every year. In doing so, the tribunal considers a range of economic indicators, including the wage cost index; salary outcomes in the public sector and, to a lesser degree, the private sector; and the principles of wage determination and decisions of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Senator Brown implied in his remarks that it is a bad thing that politicians are not consulted in that process, while Senator Johnston implied in his remarks that it is a good thing that politicians are not referred to in that process. Obviously, we all have different views on what matters should be considered and what should be taken into account, but, again, it should be done in an independent way.
As Senator Johnston and Senator Evans have both pointed out, if successful this motion would have an impact on salaries other than ours. It would alter the salaries of some state and territory politicians and a large number of Commonwealth public positions, some of which were referred to by Senator Johnston, including the director of the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the CEO of the Australian Film Commission, the CEO of Cancer Australia, the chair of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the General Manager of the National Blood Authority, to name a few. More than 90 non-elected official positions are also covered by this determination, and I am not comfortable with the fact that this motion affects their pay; therefore, I am not comfortable with voting for this motion. I also understand that there is an argument for some salary adjustment for some of those post 2004 politicians, but it is not my role to determine that.
I believe and I am happy to put on record that this determination, especially when combined with determination 2007/04, rounds out, Senator Brown, to an annual increase of 6.8 per cent. I know that we keep doing the math and it is 6.7 per cent, but I have been told that when you round it up it is about 6.8 per cent. I believe it is excessive; I believe it is too much, especially when you look at inflation at 2.1 per cent for 2006-07, so I am in a quandary. But I want to point out to the chamber that my decision today is not to support this motion. I do not think it is my role; I do not think it is our role. I think we should be kept from decisions about the raising or lowering of our own salaries. I have made a personal choice: I am happy to pledge, and have done so, the above CPI increase in my salary to charity. I am comfortable with that, but it is my personal choice. I am not going to make a choice on behalf of the rest of my colleagues in this place or, more importantly, some of those public officials whose salaries are affected by the motion today.
Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I hope Senator Brown understands my position. It may be an increase that some consider warranted. I have made a personal decision, but I am not going to get into a debate today as to whether or not I as a politician should be responsible for determining other politicians’ salaries.",SENATE,<title>PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICE CLASSIFICATION STRUCTURE AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,29,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-08-08,"—I will also not be voting for this disallowance motion for the reasons that have already been well expressed today, but there are a couple of other points that I want to add. It would be easy to vote for this motion of disallowance because it is not going to get up—so we know there would be no harm done—but I agree that it is the tribunal which makes these determinations. Perhaps we should have made a submission to the tribunal saying, ‘Please do not bring down an increase which is higher than community standards and which is higher than CPI,’ because, for some reason, that is why they did it. I understand that the combined superannuation and salary increase has come to represent a grossly enlarged increase on CPI.
This leads me to another point that needs to be made today: we are dealing with an increase which is about the unequal treatment of senators and members in this place. It stems from the decision made a couple of years ago to change the superannuation entitlements for people who were coming into this place. That is, we were making decisions—and a lot of us objected very strongly and voted against the changes for this reason—for those who came after us, and so we have a mix at the present time of people who are entitled to generous superannuation pensions and entitlements and those who are in an accumulation scheme with far less generous entitlements. I can only assume that part of the reason for the Remuneration Tribunal’s decision is to make up for that disparity.
Of course, it does not make up for the disparity; it just increases the entitlements of those who were here prior to the decision being made. It is salutary that this should not occur again. In other words, if a decision is made about entitlements like superannuation in this place, it ought to apply to everyone, not just to the chosen few who happen to be here to make the decision. I see this as a probable reason for the difference between the increase and what the community can rightly expect. Like others, I think we have to leave these decision to the Remuneration Tribunal. I am reminded that perhaps next time round we need to make a submission to the tribunal and say, ‘Please do not increase our salary beyond what is reasonable in terms of community expectations.’",SENATE,<title>PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICE CLASSIFICATION STRUCTURE AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,29,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-08,"—I thank those who have contributed to this debate and I beg to disagree. The motion as I have put it from the Greens would see that MPs got a 2.5 per cent increase, not the 6.7 per cent. The Fair Pay Commission just a few weeks ago determined that Australian workers get a two per cent increase. The Greens are saying: let that be an indication that MPs should get the same. We have put this to the Senate, and it appears that all parties are rejecting it. We do not. What is more, the Remuneration Tribunal does not give reasons and it has not given reasons. We cannot debate reasons that are not given. There is no justification for this pay rise. I submit and put here again that the Remuneration Tribunal, which is appointed by the government, is a politically charged organisation which is not able to make a dispassionate assessment, and we would not be in this position were it able to.
If it is good enough for workers in this country to have their pay increases determined by the Fair Pay Commission set up by Mr Howard, the Prime Minister, and the government, then it is good enough for members of parliament to have our pay increase set by the Fair Pay Commission as well. It should be two per cent; it should not be seven per cent. We should not be sailing 85 per cent above the consumer price index while pensioners languish with no increase at all. I thank members for their point of view. I reject it; it is not logical; it does not stand up to scrutiny. We are doing the right thing here and we stand by this disallowance motion, which would make our pay increases the same as those for the rest of the Australian community.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-08,"—by leave—I, and also on behalf of Senator Siewert, move:
That the provisions of the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Welfare Payment Reform) Bill 2007 be referred to the Community Affairs Committee for inquiry and report by 10 September 2007, with particular reference to:
(a)   the likely effects of the new income management regime on the health and well-being of children in affected communities;
(b)   the demonstrable need to restrict the appeal rights of those on the new income management regime in affected communities;
(c)   the interaction of the bill with the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 and the extent to which the provisions can be characterised as ‘special measures’; and
(d)   the effects of these measures on community governance and the development of remote communities.
That the provisions of the Northern Territory National Emergency Response Bill 2007 and the Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Northern Territory National Emergency Response and Other Measures) Bill 2007 be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for inquiry and report by 10 September 2007, with particular reference to:
(a)   the relevance of the acquisition of Aboriginal land and changes to the permit system to address the problems of child protection, health and development;
(b)   the possible impacts of the prohibition of alcohol on child safety;
(c)   the interaction of the bills with the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 and the extent to which the provisions can be characterised as ‘special measures’; and
(d)   the effects of these measures on community governance and the development of remote communities.
These motions seek to refer the package of legislation regarding the Northern Territory situation, and some other measures relating to welfare payment quarantining but not to the Northern Territory situation, to Senate committees for proper examination. For the sake of resolving the question this evening, which I think would at least create total certainty for the relevant Senate committee or committees and the public, I recognise that it is desirable to have this debate finalised and voted on by 10 minutes to seven. That is only half an hour away, so I will keep my remarks brief.
To some extent, this issue was canvassed in other debates earlier today, but I believe it is important to make the point, to have the debate and to get the issue on the record here. The motions moved by Senator Siewert and me seek to refer the legislation to two separate committees. We seek to deal some of the legislation across to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs—particularly areas to do with the permit system, land acquisition, alcohol measures, pornography controls, changes to community stores and issues to do with governance. The separate legislation dealing with welfare quarantining, which is an amendment to matters relating to social security payments, we wish to send to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, where such matters are usually dealt with.
The key issue for me and the Democrats is not so much which committee these bills go to or whether they go to two separate committees; the key issue is the need for sufficient time for the Senate to inform itself of the views of the people who are directly affected and those who have immense expertise in these areas—much more expertise than just about any of us in this chamber or on the government benches anyway. The proposal is for the bills to be sent to committees, to report back on the first sitting week in September. While that is still a fairly brief period, it would nonetheless allow a few weeks for senators to hear from a range of people, particularly from the Territory. That would be the week starting 10 September, which is just a month away.
I repeat what I have already said a number of times here today and elsewhere: if there is a single measure in any of these pieces of legislation that the government can point to and justify as being needed now to protect or save children at risk from harm that would not be able to be carried out if this legislation were not debated until next month, then I would appreciate it if they would single that out. We still have not had anybody from the government do that at any stage in this debate in either the Senate or the House of Representatives. That, to me, is a simple matter. It is an important matter. It is an urgent matter. Because it is important and urgent, we need to do it well. You do not rush into any emergency or disastrous or serious situation without first having a proper look at what you are going to do before you charge in. That is what the Senate is at risk of doing. This is an important thing for the sake of getting the legislation right.
I would also say that it is important for the sake of strengthening the confidence and trust of the people of the Northern Territory—particularly Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory and more widely—that there be at least some genuine attempt to listen, to do all we can to get it right, to do whatever is possible within the constraints of the situation and to minimise the mistakes and maximise the effectiveness of what we are trying to do here. Frankly, that is the Senate’s job. To suggest that we can do that job properly by doing what is proposed by the government—having a one-day hearing on Friday, about 40 hours from now, with a witness list still to be provided of a group of people who probably still do not know that they are going to be giving evidence—and to expect us to then produce any sort of coherent committee report to bring back to this chamber on Monday to continue the debate is ludicrous.
It is understandable, in one sense, that the government may wish to rush this through and get it all locked in before there is an opportunity for people with expertise to comment on and draw attention to problem areas. A natural response of government in any circumstance, particularly when they know they are making major changes that are likely to contain flaws, is to push it all through before people have a chance to draw attention to those flaws and before pressure builds to fix them. They can always say, ‘We’ll fix it up down the track if we need to.’ That is a common political tactic. As I have said already today, this issue is too important for politics. We have a particular responsibility to do all we can to get this issue right, rather than just playing with political positioning and dealing with the political situation.
The Labor Party would know, because they have experienced it with other major pieces of legislation, how ludicrous it is to have these one-day Friday hearings. I think this was done with the Telstra legislation—a major piece of legislation. It was presented as a matter of: ‘Are you for or against privatisation? If you are, you’ll vote for and if you aren’t, you’ll vote against.’ But there was a whole range of detail in it which went far beyond that proposition. That legislation was slammed into this chamber with a day’s notice. Before people had even had a chance to read it and absorb it, they had to give evidence to a Senate committee which then had to try to absorb all of that, comprehend it and report back to the Senate the following Monday, and we were all pushed to accept it all. As we have seen since, we have ended up with a debacle.
It is not a political statement to say that you will end up with mistakes in legislation if you do that; it is inevitable. Nobody is so omniscient; no group of parliamentary drafters, departmental officials, ministers or anybody is so all-knowing, so clever, so brilliant, so perfect in every respect that, when they follow a process like that, they can think they are going to get it right. They will get it wrong, and the Senate will get it wrong. These motions are about minimising the chances of the Senate getting it wrong.
It must be emphasised that one piece of legislation, the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Welfare Payment Reform) Bill 2007, which seeks to amend the Social Security Act, deals with Aboriginal people and communities in the Northern Territory. But significant parts of it deal not with the Northern Territory or with Aboriginal people at all but with the entire Australian community. According to the government briefing I have received, it deals with matters that will not come into operation until, at the very earliest, next year, and probably not until the year after that. So they are very significant changes. I am not even expressing a view about whether they would be good or bad. I can see merit in both sides of the argument, frankly. I think they are being pushed through without awareness by the public that they are likely to be affected. They will be put in place and become law. As we all know, it is much harder to change a law once it is in place than to get it right in the first place.
That is a reason why there is no particular urgency in this regard. I do not believe anybody from the government would credibly argue that waiting for a month before quarantining welfare payments for Aboriginal communities in the Territory is going to cause child assaults that otherwise would not have happened. Even if the government wants to make that point, the clear reality is that large parts of the legislation have nothing to do with the Northern Territory at all, with Indigenous communities or—in part at least—with child abuse. Part of the legislation does and part does not. The provisions are not going to come into force for a long period of time.
We, as a Senate and as a parliament, should not be passing major pieces of legislation which comprise dramatic shifts in public policy and in legislative operation—major intervention by a government in the daily lives of all Australians, potentially, in a very detailed, very interventionist way—without, firstly, at least making sure people are aware of the matter and we can get some feedback from them and, secondly, examining it properly ourselves. That is our job. It is not good enough to just refuse to do our job on the basis of putting up this general label and saying, ‘It’s an emergency,’ and running around with a banner over our heads saying, ‘Emergency, emergency!’ so that we do not need to actually do anything properly.
I would argue that, if it is an emergency, that is double the reason to do it properly and double the reason to scrutinise things properly. That does not mean there would be an excessive delay, as has often been alleged by the government. It means doing a bit of listening and a bit of thinking, rather than just a lot of talking. As some government speakers quite loudly proclaimed today, the time for talking is over. In part, I would agree with that, but the time for listening is certainly not over, and the time for thinking is never over. Frankly, there is not enough thinking, and certainly not enough listening, going on at the moment. You cannot make informed decisions in these sorts of circumstances.
I will make a final point. A whole range of people have made comments in reports over many years, leading up to and including the Little Children are sacred report, which was used as the catalyst for the Northern Territory intervention. I am referring to not just reports about what needs to happen but reports and reviews which have examined what has been done. The head of the Productivity Commission, who is not usually slagged off by government people as being a bleeding heart leftie, made quite clear what has worked and what has not worked. In the very valuable benchmarking work that the Productivity Commission has done, the key common factor in what works in trying to improve the situation for Indigenous people is working with people at a community level, building trust, confidence and capacity, and working with respect.
Whatever else you would say about the pros and cons of the government’s policy decisions in this area, they have certainly not done that in the last five or six weeks. They could have done it, and they should have done it; and they should start doing it now. They should do it not just because it is a feelgood thing or because it makes people feel nice to talk about working together but because the evidence shows that it works. The evidence also shows that when you don’t do it, you fail. So if we are about trying to maximise the chances of success then that is what we should do.
This very process that the Senate is engaging in at the moment of bulldozing legislation through, of failing to listen to people, of actually denying people the opportunity to be heard, of refusing to allow any credible consideration of the very significant issues that are contained in these bills, actually helps to reduce trust. That is a consequence, and you cannot dispute that. It may not be the intent but it is the consequence—that you increase suspicion, you increase resentment, you reduce trust and you also reduce empowerment. You do not strengthen the capacity of the community, who are already struggling with disempowerment, to deal with these issues by disempowering them further through these sorts of processes. And that is what is happening.
This very process that the government is trying to insist upon undermines the capacity to be effective. So even by refusing to agree to these motions in order to allow some degree of respect, of engagement, of listening, we are actually making the job harder. Regardless of what ends up being in the laws that are passed, we are making the implementation and therefore the chances of success much more difficult. There is a real opportunity here that the minister has presented through his commitment in this area, and I do acknowledge and praise him for that commitment. But opportunities can be lost, can be wasted and can go very sour. It takes more than just passion, lots of urgings and lots of emotion. We need to ensure that proper consideration occurs as well, and that is what these motions are about.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Referral to Committee</title>,Bills,30,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-08-08,"—I will keep my comments short because Senator Bartlett has covered a wide range of very important issues. The two motions to refer the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Welfare Payment Reform) Bill 2007 to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs and the Northern Territory National Emergency Response Bill 2007 and other related bills to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs were made because we believe that these issues should be considered by both of those committees. The package of legislation is supposed to be about addressing child abuse, and those are issues that should be dealt with by the Community Affairs Committee. The welfare reform is very extensive. As Senator Bartlett outlined, it goes far beyond just the emergency response measures in the Northern Territory, and it needs to be carefully considered.
We are dealing with extremely complex issues that have no simple answers and require complex and complicated multifaceted responses. The Little children are sacred report had 97 recommendations. I believe that if we were truly doing our job properly, we should, for example, be auditing the government’s plan and legislation against those 97 recommendations. Not only that, we should also be auditing it against, for example, the Combined Aboriginal Organisations of the Northern Territory plan for addressing child abuse, and reviewing the many other reports that have been done over the years around how to tackle these issues. But, most importantly, we need to be hearing from the communities and groups that are affected by this legislation.
The government has now finally agreed to refer the package of bills to the legal and constitutional committee for a limited one-day hearing. It is simply farcical to think that we could adequately deal with issues in one day, let alone report back on the next day of business, which is Monday, and make a halfway decent and comprehensive analysis of this legislation—let alone that we are putting witnesses who are appearing and those who are writing submissions in the position of barely having received this legislation and having to do a comprehensive analysis of the legislation and get a submission in by Friday. Quite clearly, this will be an ineffective approach to looking at this legislation. We will not be able to do it justice.
As I said this morning, I believe that no senator in this place will be able to say that they have a comprehensive understanding of the full ramifications of this legislation. That is why I believe that this legislation should be referred with a reporting date of 10 September. At least that would allow what I think is the minimum amount of time needed to review the legislation, to hear from witnesses and also to allow enough hearing days for all of the organisations—the community organisations, government departments, academics and Aboriginal organisations as well as welfare organisations—to be able to comment on this legislation.
I would also like to quickly comment on the fact that a fuller inquiry would have allowed us to assess the mechanisms that the government is proposing to ensure that they are in fact special measures under the Racial Discrimination Act, that they do qualify as special measures and that they are truly advancing and for the benefit of Aboriginal people. We could have properly assessed the measures against the criteria that are established internationally for the determination of what special measures are. I doubt, in the limited time that we have available, that we will be able to do that.
There are certainly a whole range of people who I believe should be appearing on Friday but whom we will not have time to see. And it is a tragedy that we will not be able to adequately review this legislation and hear from all the people whom we should be hearing from about whether this legislation meets the requirements of what is needed to address child abuse. I am pleased that the government has agreed to a committee hearing, but I am extremely disappointed that it is limited to a day and has to report so quickly, and that we will miss an opportunity to properly review this legislation.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Referral to Committee</title>,Bills,30,1
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2007-08-08,"—I move the following amendment:
Omit all words after ‘That’ in each of the motions, substitute ‘the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Welfare Payment Reform) Bill 2007 and four related bills be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, at whatever stage the bills have reached at 12.45 pm on 9 August 2007, for inquiry and report by 13 August 2007.’
In speaking to the amendment, I wish to advise the Senate that the government has initiated a committee referral for the bills that have been discussed and debated this afternoon, the Northern Territory National Emergency Response Bill 2007 and related bills. I have been advised, and Senator Siewert indicated in her closing comments, that that referral was resolved in the Selection of Bills Committee meeting earlier this afternoon.
I understand the sentiments of Senators Siewert and Bartlett, and the reasons they have stood to support the motions. They have spoken fervently in favour of the motions and their objectives. The amendment would obviously ensure a reporting date of 13 August—early next week—noting that there will be a hearing on Friday of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, which I chair. There will be an opportunity to obtain submissions and advice from various witnesses to that particular committee.
It is deemed a priority for the reasons that have been outlined very fervently and passionately by the government and specifically by the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Mal Brough. He has a real personal, dedicated and professional interest here to, on behalf of the government, ensure that the health and safety of our children, particularly in the Northern Territory, is a priority. He has made it a priority. It is a national emergency.
Things are already happening. There has already been a good deal of discussion and debate in the public arena with respect to the proposed legislation before us. Of course, there has been a great deal of debate over many months, not just in the last few months but over the last year even, of these matters. We have heard about the Little children are sacred report and we are obviously distressed to read the contents of it. That just added renewed vigour to the government’s will to ensure that something happens and it happens fast. Australia’s children, in the Northern Territory in particular, are at risk and we want to care for them. We want the interests of those children to be a top priority of this government, and that is why the government is proceeding with this inquiry and a reporting date of Monday next week.
Half-a-dozen or more of the speeches in the second reading debate have already been concluded this afternoon. No doubt there will be further debate and discussion of these bills. To further delay the reporting date to 10 September, as indicated by Senators Siewert and Bartlett, would be prejudicial to the priority of the government to ensure that the health and safety of our children is best protected. There was concern that it was just a one-day inquiry. This is a very important task and it is a top priority. One-day inquiries are not without precedent in this place. In fact, I can recall the Telstra inquiry and the National Water Commission inquiry. The copyright legislation that went to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee a couple of years ago had a one-day inquiry. We do Senate inquiries based on the papers from time to time where we do not have witnesses and there are no public hearings as such. So we have to be flexible in this place; we have to accept the priorities of the government, and the government sees it as a top priority to protect the health and safety of Australia’s children, particularly in the Northern Territory.
So I understand the sentiments of Senators Siewert and Bartlett, and I know where they are coming from. In a perfect world, obviously, things could be different; but it is an imperfect world. We want to act. On this side of the Senate chamber we want to act fast in the best interests of the children at risk.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE PAYMENT REFORM) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Referral to Committee</title>,Bills,30,1
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2007-08-08,"—I indicate that the opposition will be supporting the amendment that has been moved by Senator Barnett. As the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Evans, indicated in his speech in the second reading debate, we accept that the legislation is emergency legislation, that there is an issue of concern about looking after children in some of these areas, and that that needs to be addressed, and addressed with some urgency. In that respect, the Opposition have indicated that we will facilitate the passage of the legislation through the parliament, despite the fact that we may have some reservations and concerns about certain aspects of the legislation.
I indicate that, whilst we have agreed to this amendment with respect to these bills, it should not be taken that our protests, which have been put on the record on a number of occasions, about the way the Senate committee processes have been truncated on a range of inquiries and hearings since the government got a majority in this place on 1 July 2005, have somehow melted away; they have not. Certainly, we recognise that this issue is important and that there is a degree of urgency about it. So we are prepared to facilitate the passage of the bills through the Senate.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-08-08,"—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for inquiry and report by 15 October 2007:
All aspects of the detention and release of Dr Mohamed Haneef, including:
(a) the source and veracity of information upon which decisions were made;
(b) the actions of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (Mr Andrews), including his overriding of the Brisbane Magistrate’s Court decision to grant bail to Dr Haneef;
(c) the role of other ministers, including the Attorney-General (Mr Ruddock) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard);
(d) the investigation by the Australian Federal Police and other agencies;
(e) the decisions taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions;
(f) the international impact on Australia of the Government’s handling of the case; and
(g) any future decisions to be made in relation to Dr Haneef.
This is a Greens motion to set up an inquiry into the detention and subsequent release of Dr Mohamed Haneef. Over the last few weeks we have all been watching the case of Dr Haneef unfold. Many of us will remember the way in which this started with the horrendous events that occurred at Glasgow airport and in London. At the time everyone was focused on what had happened in London and, following on from that, we heard that part of the investigations included somebody in another country. That turned out to be Dr Haneef, the Gold Coast doctor. As people who were following this story in the media saw, there was a big splash in the way in which it started. I remember that in my home town of Sydney, the front page of the Daily Telegraph had a photograph of an Indian doctor who works at Gold Coast Hospital. It was not Dr Haneef but, I think, a Dr Asha, who had also been questioned. The headline over the photograph of this doctor said, ‘Evil’. That is how the case of Dr Haneef, which we have all been watching, really began—a big splash in the media following the events that occurred in London and Glasgow.
Many people have also been following with concern the comments made by various government ministers and officials throughout this entire process. I want to touch on a couple of those comments. Those comments fitted into the pattern of what we have seen from this government. The government has sought to use particular cases relating to terrorism for its own political advantage and has sought to use those cases to instil a sense of fear and uncertainty in the community. Many of us, particularly people who live or work in Western Sydney, have seen the impact that that government’s response has had in migrant communities and in particular in Muslim communities.
The comments that were made by government ministers and other officials focused very much on issues relating to terrorism. I did not hear—maybe someone could point them out to me—any comment by a government minister or official about the importance of civil liberties. I would be grateful if someone could point that out to me because I do not recall, in all of the commentary that has been made by government ministers and officials in the course of the Dr Haneef case, any comments about the importance of our civil liberties or the rule of law and the way in which it operates. But I do recall the comments that have been made about terrorism and the links to terrorism that this case brought forward.
At the outset of this case we saw the first occasion where the new powers that have been given to the Federal Police to hold people without charge were used. Dr Haneef was arrested at Brisbane airport on 12 July and 12 days later he was charged. In 2004, when the parliament debated the matter of allowing the Federal Police to hold people without charge, there was quite considerable debate. It was a matter of whether or not such extraordinary powers, such a reversal of the way in which our criminal justice system has operated in the past, were to occur. There was concern from members of parliament—from myself and others—and from members of the legal profession about how they would be used. We had a Senate inquiry into the matter and there was an opportunity in the chamber to ask questions. In that process there were suggestions that the law, as it is written, allows for somebody to be detained indefinitely without being charged. The law requires the court to approve each extension of time but there is no limit on how long somebody can be held before they are charged. Part of the public debate that occurred at the time was about what would be reasonable. What would a court consider to be a reasonable period of time to grant extensions under which people could be held?
 In response to those questions, the then Assistant Secretary of the Criminal Law Branch of the Attorney-General’s Department, Mr Geoff McDonald, indicated to the Senate inquiry looking into this matter that the sort of timeframe that he thought a court would consider to be reasonable would be in the order of 16 hours. There was a case in the Victorian courts where the court had determined that that was a reasonable period of time to hold somebody. Professor George Williams was one of the people commenting on this issue and he said that somebody could be held for up to 24 hours. Mr McDonald said that it would be an extraordinary circumstance in which somebody might be held for 24 hours. But what happened in the first instance of this legislation being used?

In that process there were suggestions that the law, as it is written, allows for somebody to be detained indefinitely without being charged. The law requires the court to approve each extension of time but there is no limit on how long somebody can be held before they are charged. Part of the public debate that occurred at the time was about what would be reasonable. What would a court consider to be a reasonable period of time to grant extensions under which people could be held?
 In response to those questions, the then Assistant Secretary of the Criminal Law Branch of the Attorney-General’s Department, Mr Geoff McDonald, indicated to the Senate inquiry looking into this matter that the sort of timeframe that he thought a court would consider to be reasonable would be in the order of 16 hours. There was a case in the Victorian courts where the court had determined that that was a reasonable period of time to hold somebody. Professor George Williams was one of the people commenting on this issue and he said that somebody could be held for up to 24 hours. Mr McDonald said that it would be an extraordinary circumstance in which somebody might be held for 24 hours. But what happened in the first instance of this legislation being used?
