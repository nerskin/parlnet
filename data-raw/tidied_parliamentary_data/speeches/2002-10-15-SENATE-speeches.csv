This is the 39th report in a series of reports recommending that a right of reply be accorded to persons who claim to be adversely affected by being referred to, either by name or in such a way as to be readily identifiable, in the Senate. On 30 August 2002, the President of the Senate received a submission from Mr John Hyde Page concerning a matter raised by Senator Hutchins in the Senate on 22 August 2002. The President referred the submission to the Committee of Privileges under resolution 5. The committee considered the submission at its meeting on 26 September and recommended that a response in the terms included in the report I have just tabled be incorporated in Hansard. The committee always reminds the Senate that, in matters of this nature, it does not judge the truth or otherwise of the statements made by honourable senators or persons seeking redress.

APPENDIX ONE 
RESPONSE BY MR JOHN HYDE PAGE AGREED TO BY MR HYDE PAGE AND THE COMMITTEE OF PRIVILEGES PURSUANT TO RESOLUTION 5(7)(B) OF THE SENATE OF 25 FEBRUARY 1988
My attention has been drawn to a speech made in the Senate on 22 August, 2002 at about 9.35am by Senator Hutchins during which adverse references were made to me.
In accordance with resolution five of the Senate I submit a response to those remarks and I request publication of this letter.
In his contribution, Senator Hutchins read into the Senate an anonymous email he claimed to have received, including the transcript of a purported telephone conversation between two people. The inference of that email and transcript was that I had offered a bribe to a member of the Young Liberal Movement to attend a meeting of the Movement.
I categorically refute that suggestion. I would also note that when the anonymous email quoted by Senator Hutchins was first circulated within various political circles, the alleged beneficiary of the bribe wrote to the NSW State Director of the Liberal Party also denying any bribe had been offered to him.
To be referred to in this way has the potential to seriously damage my reputation and it is therefore appropriate that, in accordance with Senate procedures, this submission is included in the parliamentary record.

I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
This report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, Enterprising Australia—planning, preparing and profiting from trade and investment,is a short report on the proceedings of the inquiry. The Minister for Trade referred the inquiry to the joint committee on 2 November 2000. With the calling of the 2001 federal election, the inquiry automatically lapsed on the dissolution of the 39th Parliament on 8 October 2001.
The committee gave consideration to the re-referral of the enterprising Australiaterms of reference in this the 40th Parliament. However, we decided not to continue with this inquiry. Our decision was based on a number of factors: firstly, the poor response to the call for submissions; secondly, the quality of evidence; thirdly, a review of the Commonwealth's investment promotion and attraction efforts by a task force headed by Dr Ian Blackburne that embraced significant aspects of the enterprising Australiaterms of reference; and, fourthly, broad acceptance by the government of the recommendations made by Dr Blackburne in his August 2001 report Winning investment--strategy, people and partnerships.
Notwithstanding the lapse of the inquiry, we took the view that a short report should be tabled in the parliament outlining some of the issues and conclusions that came out of the evidence that we received. These reflect a similarity of view between our observations and the findings of Dr Blackburne's review team. I do wish to place on record our appreciation of the assistance that the former Irish Ambassador, His Excellency Mr Richard O'Brien, and the Singaporean High Commissioner, His Excellency Mr Ashok Kumar Mirpuri, gave to this inquiry. 
We see a number of challenges for Australia in planning, preparing and profiting from trade and investment. No specific development agency model, whether it is an Ireland or a Singapore model, fits the Australian context. What is paramount is a national strategic approach to trade and investment. Additional challenges are regional initiatives that can build a diverse base for regional economic wealth, the provision of the skills in Australian people that will underpin research and development initiatives, and Australia's global competitiveness and the comparative effectiveness of the incentives that we offer. A strategic national approach to planning, preparing and profiting from trade and investment promotes and increases Australia's international competitiveness. Evidence to the inquiry showed that there were a number of federal government agencies that played a role in promoting investment and exports and, as Dr Blackburne noted in his investment review, this is not efficient and does not allow for a single Australian brand.
In the climate of global competitiveness, where national leadership is paramount, the multiple player approach promotes the insular culture of the bureaucracy and the notion of `turf', with government processes cumbersome and sometimes unresponsive. It was evident to us that the degree of commitment to a national strategic approach is a key to advancing Australia's trade and investment competitiveness. The government has agreed to the development of a national strategic framework for investment promotion and attraction, with the Employment and Infrastructure Committee of Cabinet to oversee operations. We are hopeful that this will indeed provide the capacity and the capability to implement a whole of nation approach.
With the intention that this framework is to be developed in the context of Australia's overall economic growth and industry and regional development objectives, we regard the major national issues raised during Dr Blackburne's consultations as very important, and they need to be addressed. These major national issues are set out in appendix E of our report. We are concerned that these issues, which were to be included in the work program of the Blackburne review's proposed Prime Minister's investment council, will not be addressed under the new arrangements of the revamped Invest Australia. These major national issues should not be dismissed as not applicable and lost to examination within the changed operational arrangements of Invest Australia.
In our report we comment on the issues of tax, seen as an impediment to business; the adequacy of Australia's skills base, with investment in education critical to the future of Australia; and the commercialisation of R&D in Australia. On this last issue, for instance, we are of the view that in pursuing commercial outcomes the capability to reach commercialisation should not become the sole criterion for funding an R&D project. Not every project can lead directly to a commercial outcome. If the policy focus on commercialisation becomes the be-all and end-all for Australian R&D, then Australia as an innovative country, for which it is recognised world wide, will lose research capability. Balancing R&D is a fine line. Managing this fine line is critical to the future and needs to be understood in the current policy climate by R&D boards and public administrators.
In conclusion, irrespective of Australia's achievements in encouraging inward investment and promoting export sales, the challenge for Australia and its policy makers at all levels of government is to move forward and put us ahead of our competitors. We need to focus on becoming even more competitive than our competitors and not being both outmarketed and insufficiently aggressive in the pursuit of opportunities. I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee: Joint</title>",Committees,16,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2002-10-15,"—The report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade has been adequately described by my colleague opposite, Senator Ferguson. It ought to have commanded far more attention than it did. The purpose of the report is best set out in its title: Enterprising Australia— planning, preparing and profiting from trade and investment. As anyone who looks at the balance of payments or Australia's trade situation knows, an imperative to greater wealth creation in this country is that more Australian companies export. If more Australian companies are to succeed as exporters, they need to be globally competitive. Characteristic of a globally competitive company is a focus primarily on the world, not on the domestic market. They have a high incidence of innovation in their company structure and a high investment in research and development. They recruit skilled labour that has been well educated, they are able to be flexible and adaptable to new market situations that they confront in the world and they penetrate markets successfully. 
This is not some sort of dry academic exercise. This goes to the engines that drive economic growth, improve living standards and create jobs for ordinary Australians. From that point of view, this is an extremely worthwhile report. I congratulate Mr Prosser of the committee at that time on promoting the investigation. Having said that, Senator Ferguson has also referred to the reasons why the committee did not take this report further; certainly the election was a big factor and a new committee was another factor. The real reasons—the poor response to this inquiry, the quality of the submissions garnered by the inquiry and, indeed, the advent of the Blackburne report—are all adequately set out in this document. However, we could have focused more on the findings of the Blackburne report and the implementation of them. But that is not a reason to criticise the effort that has been undertaken here.
I want to say a few words about some of the issues covered in this report. In 1994, when the Australian Manufacturing Council existed and created a forum for all the players in the Australian manufacturing industry to examine the issues in their sector and to seek remedies from government to improve that industry sector, which is vital for jobs in Australia and vital for our innovative edge in the world, a study was undertaken headed `Leaders and laggers'. It examined the characteristics of what makes success for Australian companies and looked at successful exporters and manufacturing enterprises. It also looked at the characteristics that are true of companies that do not succeed, and these were the laggers.
Overwhelmingly, the emphases of the leaders were, as I have said, a global view of the market, investment in research and development, capacity for innovation and a general outward drive to capture new market prospects. The characteristics of the laggers—those that did not succeed—were a preoccupation with the level of taxation they might pay, difficulties with their industrial relations system as they managed it in-house and a series of navel gazing issues of that nature which meant they were not focused on global opportunity; they were focused on what was going wrong with their company and, therefore, did not think about how to turn the company into something that was going properly and correctly.
That was an important study because it looked at real life experience of successful Australian companies, and it finds some echoes in the document that we have today. It is not surprising that there is a continuity of theme of those key issues. One of the weaknesses in this report is that it does not address issues that have occurred since the advent of the Howard government. For example, it does not adequately deal with the reduction in the research and development tax concession, which went down in 1997 from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. R&D is a driver of export growth and international competitiveness. The fact that there has been less incentive and less take-up of research and development means that we are now becoming a lagging nation under that demographic.
The report did not deal with the impact of the capping of the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. We offered a scheme to encourage Australian companies that are mostly small to medium sized enterprises to go overseas and examine the market. That scheme has been capped, so not all those companies that want to go and examine the market can get access to the scheme or, if they do, it is at a lesser level. Under the previous government it was open-ended, so all players that wanted to be exporters could be and not just those that were ahead of everyone else in the queue and lucky enough to get a grant. It did not examine the abolition of the International Trade Enhancement Scheme, which encouraged Australian companies to get into the international market. Nor did it look at the abolition of the Development Import Finance Facility, which ensured that Australian aid spent abroad also created opportunities for Australian business. 
The report did not look at the abolition of support for the business angels program, where experienced entrepreneurs were being matched with small high-tech start-up businesses, nor at the abolition of the Australian Manufacturing Council, a body that I think has played a magnificent role in resolving problems that confronted the growth of the Australian manufacturing sector and is indeed one of the reasons why we now have a vibrant export sector whose total value outranks that of the agricultural sector in export earnings. Nor did it look at the cessation of a $20 million operating subsidy to the Commonwealth Development Bank for small business financing, an area in which the bank, as an expert lender in this field, is ideally placed to make assessments about the competitiveness of potential enterprises. That $20 million operating subsidy was an essential way of levering those small enterprises into something better. 
The outsourcing of government IT, at a cost to taxpayers of several hundred million dollars—which is something that this government has done—has meant as well that we have not kept in-house the possibility of structuring a major IT provider in this country and rather have brought in from overseas foreign IT providers to meet our needs. The freezing of the R&D Start program in early 2002, with the government cancelling new applications from 115 businesses, was the wrong signal to send. We are trying to encourage people to be more innovative, to use R&D. To cancel the R&D Start program early this year was the wrong signal for industry to receive. The abolition of the Printing Industries Competitiveness Scheme occurred ahead of schedule and, more importantly, the government's own resources were cut back, meaning its ability to pick trends in this sector was diminished and its ability to find solutions and to provide the necessary support programs was diminished. 
This report looks at Singapore and Ireland as two tigers—one a Celtic tiger and one an Asian tiger—that have very active industry policy agencies at government level. The cutback of 30 per cent in the department of industry's funding over four years—the largest fall in any spending of any department— and a cutting back of 10 per cent in staff mean that, while this report looks at other countries to find out how you lift yourself to excellence, Australia is cutting back the infrastructure on which you build the necessary programs to encourage that same development in Australia. 
I conclude by saying that, just last week, quite importantly, Dr Craig Emerson, Labor's shadow minister for innovation, industry, trade and tourism, tabled a policy discussion paper—Thriving industries in an innovative Australia—which does provide a very good blueprint for how to get Australia back to work and properly started again. This country has been the best in the world for creating part-time work and not full-time jobs. The jobs we have created over the last several years have been part-time jobs in the main, not full-time jobs that offer full-time career prospects for Australian workers.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-10-15,"—I would like to say a few words with regard to this report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade— Enterprising Australia—planning, preparing and profiting from trade and investment— and particularly focus on my own state. I find it interesting that the report says that there was a lack of interest from agencies in terms of incentives and impediments. I would like to highlight some of what I believe are the impediments that occur—at least in my state—with regard to opportunities for overseas exports, particularly to the Asian region. I want to give some examples, in particular from the timber industry. 
It is interesting that in Tasmania today we have an industry that has so many opportunities and yet many of them are not being realised. One of the reasons that that is the case is that the government agency responsible for the management of the public resource seems to be acting against the interests of the private sector, which could process a lot of the timber that is being harvested from Tasmania's forests and gain very significant export opportunities in countries like China. How is that happening? It is happening in this way: the state government agency is actually exporting whole logs from Tasmania to China and other Asian destinations in competition with sawn timber products— or what could be sawn timber products—produced by Australian, indeed Tasmanian processors. That is something that we have to have a serious look at.  
Looking at this issue in respect of creating jobs and opportunities in your own state or your own country, why you would have a state authority or a government agency proceeding to export whole logs, in terms of raw material, rather than allowing private businesses to actually create employment through processing that timber in the state of Tasmania or somewhere else in Australia, does take some understanding. Indeed, you have to wonder why they would be doing it at all, in terms of economic development in the state of Tasmania. It is not just in that area. We have a very simplistic view, it seems, in terms of the opportunities for export development in Tasmania, because we seem to be content with the approach of just taking the lowest common denominator and shipping it offshore, rather than taking an approach whereby we can expand the opportunities for sawn timber products. 
Not only that, if we look at the trade imbalance in Australia in respect of forest products, it is huge. I think it now stands in excess of $2 million per annum in pulp, paper and forest products. So there is all the more reason why states such as Tasmania should take the initiative to create and drive export opportunities in processed wood products, and yet we fail to do that. This report makes it very interesting in terms of the opportunities that should exist yet do not. It is very important to highlight that, because that is something that the Commonwealth ought to take an interest in, in that we are allowing state agencies to do the sorts of things that seem to be to the detriment of the development of export opportunities within this country.
I cannot understand any state government—let alone from a Commonwealth point of view—allowing that to happen; it makes no sense whatsoever. We are looking at the management of what is a very valuable resource in terms of hardwood timbers in Tasmania's eucalypt forests. From Tasmania's perspective, it is important for the long-term sustainable management of those forests that we do go into the processing of those timbers, rather than just send them off in whole log form. I know that the Special Minister of State, Senator Abetz, would be fully aware of the stockpiles of logs that exist at Burnie and at Bell Bay in Tasmania. It is becoming increasingly unacceptable to people in Tasmania to see those logs going offshore when they know full well that they could be processed within the state. We are even exporting logs to Victoria, which is in turn processing those logs and then exporting them. As a Tasmanian senator, it makes little sense to me that the state allows that to happen. Sure, it might create a few jobs for Victorians, but I do not see it as being of much use to the jobs that we should have in Tasmania. Very few opportunities remain for Tasmania in the natural resource area, but timber is one of them. It is about time something is done to ensure that opportunities in the natural resource area of timber are taken up and that something is done about them.
I am contacted by sawmillers on a regular basis now. Unfortunately, they do not want to say anything publicly because of a fear of retribution from the Tasmanian authority, Forestry Tasmania—in a circumstance where they produce residues for which they know that essentially they now have but one market, one purchaser, in Tasmania. They feel that they are between a rock and a hard place—that if they make public comment about this problem they will be crucified for doing so and things will only get tougher for them. I would hope that the Commonwealth might take an interest in this and consider what it can do to ensure that more processing jobs and more export opportunities are created for the Tasmanian timber industry. I know that they can be created and that those opportunities exist—particularly when China spent in excess of $US30 billion in 2000-01 importing timber products. If we do not comprehend the potential of that sort of market, we will never maximise the export opportunities that exist for this country. We have to take some steps to bring about necessary changes; we cannot just function on the basis of `Dig it up, chop it down and ship it out'. It is unacceptable that we continue to allow that to happen in this day and age. 
I have spent a few weeks in China this year, looking at their own forest products industry. I have found that there are vast opportunities; yet, as I said, there is little incentive on the part of the Tasmanian state government and there is little assistance on the part of the state authorities. A prime example is that exactly the opposite is happening: they are trying to chop down the trees and ship the logs out for what is essentially the lowest price. That will then make the sawn timber products uncompetitive, because the Chinese will ask, `Why are the logs so cheap and your sawn board so dear?' It is a valid question. Essentially, the only group selling large volumes of whole logs into China and/or Korea are state authorities—the manager of the public resource in Tasmania. It just is not good enough. As I said, I hope the Special Minister of State and the Commonwealth will take some interest in this matter and see whether they can do something about it in future. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Our decision was based on a number of factors: firstly, the poor response to the call for submissions; secondly, the quality of evidence; thirdly, a review of the Commonwealth's investment promotion and attraction efforts by a task force headed by Dr Ian Blackburne that embraced significant aspects of the enterprising Australiaterms of reference; and, fourthly, broad acceptance by the government of the recommendations made by Dr Blackburne in his August 2001 report Winning investment--strategy, people and partnerships.
Notwithstanding the lapse of the inquiry, we took the view that a short report should be tabled in the parliament outlining some of the issues and conclusions that came out of the evidence that we received. These reflect a similarity of view between our observations and the findings of Dr Blackburne's review team. I do wish to place on record our appreciation of the assistance that the former Irish Ambassador, His Excellency Mr Richard O'Brien, and the Singaporean High Commissioner, His Excellency Mr Ashok Kumar Mirpuri, gave to this inquiry. 
We see a number of challenges for Australia in planning, preparing and profiting from trade and investment. No specific development agency model, whether it is an Ireland or a Singapore model, fits the Australian context. What is paramount is a national strategic approach to trade and investment. Additional challenges are regional initiatives that can build a diverse base for regional economic wealth, the provision of the skills in Australian people that will underpin research and development initiatives, and Australia's global competitiveness and the comparative effectiveness of the incentives that we offer. A strategic national approach to planning, preparing and profiting from trade and investment promotes and increases Australia's international competitiveness. Evidence to the inquiry showed that there were a number of federal government agencies that played a role in promoting investment and exports and, as Dr Blackburne noted in his investment review, this is not efficient and does not allow for a single Australian brand.
In the climate of global competitiveness, where national leadership is paramount, the multiple player approach promotes the insular culture of the bureaucracy and the notion of `turf', with government processes cumbersome and sometimes unresponsive. It was evident to us that the degree of commitment to a national strategic approach is a key to advancing Australia's trade and investment competitiveness. The government has agreed to the development of a national strategic framework for investment promotion and attraction, with the Employment and Infrastructure Committee of Cabinet to oversee operations. We are hopeful that this will indeed provide the capacity and the capability to implement a whole of nation approach.
With the intention that this framework is to be developed in the context of Australia's overall economic growth and industry and regional development objectives, we regard the major national issues raised during Dr Blackburne's consultations as very important, and they need to be addressed. These major national issues are set out in appendix E of our report. We are concerned that these issues, which were to be included in the work program of the Blackburne review's proposed Prime Minister's investment council, will not be addressed under the new arrangements of the revamped Invest Australia. These major national issues should not be dismissed as not applicable and lost to examination within the changed operational arrangements of Invest Australia.
In our report we comment on the issues of tax, seen as an impediment to business; the adequacy of Australia's skills base, with investment in education critical to the future of Australia; and the commercialisation of R&D in Australia. On this last issue, for instance, we are of the view that in pursuing commercial outcomes the capability to reach commercialisation should not become the sole criterion for funding an R&D project. Not every project can lead directly to a commercial outcome. If the policy focus on commercialisation becomes the be-all and end-all for Australian R&D, then Australia as an innovative country, for which it is recognised world wide, will lose research capability. Balancing R&D is a fine line. Managing this fine line is critical to the future and needs to be understood in the current policy climate by R&D boards and public administrators.
In conclusion, irrespective of Australia's achievements in encouraging inward investment and promoting export sales, the challenge for Australia and its policy makers at all levels of government is to move forward and put us ahead of our competitors. We need to focus on becoming even more competitive than our competitors and not being both outmarketed and insufficiently aggressive in the pursuit of opportunities. I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,16,2
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2002-10-15,"—The report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade has been adequately described by my colleague opposite, Senator Ferguson. It ought to have commanded far more attention than it did. The purpose of the report is best set out in its title: Enterprising Australia— planning, preparing and profiting from trade and investment. As anyone who looks at the balance of payments or Australia's trade situation knows, an imperative to greater wealth creation in this country is that more Australian companies export. If more Australian companies are to succeed as exporters, they need to be globally competitive. Characteristic of a globally competitive company is a focus primarily on the world, not on the domestic market. They have a high incidence of innovation in their company structure and a high investment in research and development. They recruit skilled labour that has been well educated, they are able to be flexible and adaptable to new market situations that they confront in the world and they penetrate markets successfully. 
This is not some sort of dry academic exercise. This goes to the engines that drive economic growth, improve living standards and create jobs for ordinary Australians. From that point of view, this is an extremely worthwhile report. I congratulate Mr Prosser of the committee at that time on promoting the investigation. Having said that, Senator Ferguson has also referred to the reasons why the committee did not take this report further; certainly the election was a big factor and a new committee was another factor. The real reasons—the poor response to this inquiry, the quality of the submissions garnered by the inquiry and, indeed, the advent of the Blackburne report—are all adequately set out in this document. However, we could have focused more on the findings of the Blackburne report and the implementation of them. But that is not a reason to criticise the effort that has been undertaken here.
I want to say a few words about some of the issues covered in this report. In 1994, when the Australian Manufacturing Council existed and created a forum for all the players in the Australian manufacturing industry to examine the issues in their sector and to seek remedies from government to improve that industry sector, which is vital for jobs in Australia and vital for our innovative edge in the world, a study was undertaken headed `Leaders and laggers'. It examined the characteristics of what makes success for Australian companies and looked at successful exporters and manufacturing enterprises. It also looked at the characteristics that are true of companies that do not succeed, and these were the laggers.
Overwhelmingly, the emphases of the leaders were, as I have said, a global view of the market, investment in research and development, capacity for innovation and a general outward drive to capture new market prospects. The characteristics of the laggers—those that did not succeed—were a preoccupation with the level of taxation they might pay, difficulties with their industrial relations system as they managed it in-house and a series of navel gazing issues of that nature which meant they were not focused on global opportunity; they were focused on what was going wrong with their company and, therefore, did not think about how to turn the company into something that was going properly and correctly.
That was an important study because it looked at real life experience of successful Australian companies, and it finds some echoes in the document that we have today. It is not surprising that there is a continuity of theme of those key issues. One of the weaknesses in this report is that it does not address issues that have occurred since the advent of the Howard government. For example, it does not adequately deal with the reduction in the research and development tax concession, which went down in 1997 from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. R&D is a driver of export growth and international competitiveness. The fact that there has been less incentive and less take-up of research and development means that we are now becoming a lagging nation under that demographic.
The report did not deal with the impact of the capping of the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. We offered a scheme to encourage Australian companies that are mostly small to medium sized enterprises to go overseas and examine the market. That scheme has been capped, so not all those companies that want to go and examine the market can get access to the scheme or, if they do, it is at a lesser level. Under the previous government it was open-ended, so all players that wanted to be exporters could be and not just those that were ahead of everyone else in the queue and lucky enough to get a grant. It did not examine the abolition of the International Trade Enhancement Scheme, which encouraged Australian companies to get into the international market. Nor did it look at the abolition of the Development Import Finance Facility, which ensured that Australian aid spent abroad also created opportunities for Australian business. 
The report did not look at the abolition of support for the business angels program, where experienced entrepreneurs were being matched with small high-tech start-up businesses, nor at the abolition of the Australian Manufacturing Council, a body that I think has played a magnificent role in resolving problems that confronted the growth of the Australian manufacturing sector and is indeed one of the reasons why we now have a vibrant export sector whose total value outranks that of the agricultural sector in export earnings. Nor did it look at the cessation of a $20 million operating subsidy to the Commonwealth Development Bank for small business financing, an area in which the bank, as an expert lender in this field, is ideally placed to make assessments about the competitiveness of potential enterprises. That $20 million operating subsidy was an essential way of levering those small enterprises into something better. 
The outsourcing of government IT, at a cost to taxpayers of several hundred million dollars—which is something that this government has done—has meant as well that we have not kept in-house the possibility of structuring a major IT provider in this country and rather have brought in from overseas foreign IT providers to meet our needs. The freezing of the R&D Start program in early 2002, with the government cancelling new applications from 115 businesses, was the wrong signal to send. We are trying to encourage people to be more innovative, to use R&D. To cancel the R&D Start program early this year was the wrong signal for industry to receive. The abolition of the Printing Industries Competitiveness Scheme occurred ahead of schedule and, more importantly, the government's own resources were cut back, meaning its ability to pick trends in this sector was diminished and its ability to find solutions and to provide the necessary support programs was diminished. 
This report looks at Singapore and Ireland as two tigers—one a Celtic tiger and one an Asian tiger—that have very active industry policy agencies at government level. The cutback of 30 per cent in the department of industry's funding over four years—the largest fall in any spending of any department— and a cutting back of 10 per cent in staff mean that, while this report looks at other countries to find out how you lift yourself to excellence, Australia is cutting back the infrastructure on which you build the necessary programs to encourage that same development in Australia. 
I conclude by saying that, just last week, quite importantly, Dr Craig Emerson, Labor's shadow minister for innovation, industry, trade and tourism, tabled a policy discussion paper—Thriving industries in an innovative Australia—which does provide a very good blueprint for how to get Australia back to work and properly started again. This country has been the best in the world for creating part-time work and not full-time jobs. The jobs we have created over the last several years have been part-time jobs in the main, not full-time jobs that offer full-time career prospects for Australian workers.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-10-15,"—I would like to say a few words with regard to this report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade— Enterprising Australia—planning, preparing and profiting from trade and investment— and particularly focus on my own state. I find it interesting that the report says that there was a lack of interest from agencies in terms of incentives and impediments. I would like to highlight some of what I believe are the impediments that occur—at least in my state—with regard to opportunities for overseas exports, particularly to the Asian region. I want to give some examples, in particular from the timber industry. 
It is interesting that in Tasmania today we have an industry that has so many opportunities and yet many of them are not being realised. One of the reasons that that is the case is that the government agency responsible for the management of the public resource seems to be acting against the interests of the private sector, which could process a lot of the timber that is being harvested from Tasmania's forests and gain very significant export opportunities in countries like China. How is that happening? It is happening in this way: the state government agency is actually exporting whole logs from Tasmania to China and other Asian destinations in competition with sawn timber products— or what could be sawn timber products—produced by Australian, indeed Tasmanian processors. That is something that we have to have a serious look at.  
Looking at this issue in respect of creating jobs and opportunities in your own state or your own country, why you would have a state authority or a government agency proceeding to export whole logs, in terms of raw material, rather than allowing private businesses to actually create employment through processing that timber in the state of Tasmania or somewhere else in Australia, does take some understanding. Indeed, you have to wonder why they would be doing it at all, in terms of economic development in the state of Tasmania. It is not just in that area. We have a very simplistic view, it seems, in terms of the opportunities for export development in Tasmania, because we seem to be content with the approach of just taking the lowest common denominator and shipping it offshore, rather than taking an approach whereby we can expand the opportunities for sawn timber products. 
Not only that, if we look at the trade imbalance in Australia in respect of forest products, it is huge. I think it now stands in excess of $2 million per annum in pulp, paper and forest products. So there is all the more reason why states such as Tasmania should take the initiative to create and drive export opportunities in processed wood products, and yet we fail to do that. This report makes it very interesting in terms of the opportunities that should exist yet do not. It is very important to highlight that, because that is something that the Commonwealth ought to take an interest in, in that we are allowing state agencies to do the sorts of things that seem to be to the detriment of the development of export opportunities within this country.
I cannot understand any state government—let alone from a Commonwealth point of view—allowing that to happen; it makes no sense whatsoever. We are looking at the management of what is a very valuable resource in terms of hardwood timbers in Tasmania's eucalypt forests. From Tasmania's perspective, it is important for the long-term sustainable management of those forests that we do go into the processing of those timbers, rather than just send them off in whole log form. I know that the Special Minister of State, Senator Abetz, would be fully aware of the stockpiles of logs that exist at Burnie and at Bell Bay in Tasmania. It is becoming increasingly unacceptable to people in Tasmania to see those logs going offshore when they know full well that they could be processed within the state. We are even exporting logs to Victoria, which is in turn processing those logs and then exporting them. As a Tasmanian senator, it makes little sense to me that the state allows that to happen. Sure, it might create a few jobs for Victorians, but I do not see it as being of much use to the jobs that we should have in Tasmania. Very few opportunities remain for Tasmania in the natural resource area, but timber is one of them. It is about time something is done to ensure that opportunities in the natural resource area of timber are taken up and that something is done about them.
I am contacted by sawmillers on a regular basis now. Unfortunately, they do not want to say anything publicly because of a fear of retribution from the Tasmanian authority, Forestry Tasmania—in a circumstance where they produce residues for which they know that essentially they now have but one market, one purchaser, in Tasmania. They feel that they are between a rock and a hard place—that if they make public comment about this problem they will be crucified for doing so and things will only get tougher for them. I would hope that the Commonwealth might take an interest in this and consider what it can do to ensure that more processing jobs and more export opportunities are created for the Tasmanian timber industry. I know that they can be created and that those opportunities exist—particularly when China spent in excess of $US30 billion in 2000-01 importing timber products. If we do not comprehend the potential of that sort of market, we will never maximise the export opportunities that exist for this country. We have to take some steps to bring about necessary changes; we cannot just function on the basis of `Dig it up, chop it down and ship it out'. It is unacceptable that we continue to allow that to happen in this day and age. 
I have spent a few weeks in China this year, looking at their own forest products industry. I have found that there are vast opportunities; yet, as I said, there is little incentive on the part of the Tasmanian state government and there is little assistance on the part of the state authorities. A prime example is that exactly the opposite is happening: they are trying to chop down the trees and ship the logs out for what is essentially the lowest price. That will then make the sawn timber products uncompetitive, because the Chinese will ask, `Why are the logs so cheap and your sawn board so dear?' It is a valid question. Essentially, the only group selling large volumes of whole logs into China and/or Korea are state authorities—the manager of the public resource in Tasmania. It just is not good enough. As I said, I hope the Special Minister of State and the Commonwealth will take some interest in this matter and see whether they can do something about it in future. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-10-15,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I wish to make a brief comment on the response to the resolution of the Senate of 23 September 2002 by the Charge d'Affaires of the Embassy of Indonesia which was tabled earlier. The motion stated:
That the Senate calls on the Government of Indonesia to ensure that Ms Lesley McCulloch is given full and immediate consular access and that she and her colleagues are treated fairly and in accordance with international human rights standards and released from custody as early as possible. 
I remind the Senate that Ms McCulloch and her friends were arrested in Aceh some weeks ago and are being held with a view to being charged and brought before the Indonesian courts. When I first contacted the Australian Attorney-General's office about this matter, I was reassured that the usual process here would be followed, that this Australian, Ms McCulloch—she has been given a long stay in Australia, although she is a British citizen—and her friends would normally be held for a few days, released and exported. That has not happened. They are now being charged and there is the real concern of serious charges being laid against her and her friends with potentially many years in prison.
I comment on this in two ways. I hope the Attorney-General is taking much more vigorous note of the plight of Ms McCulloch, whom I met earlier this year. She has been working at the University of Tasmania and is now caught up in these circumstances. I also hope that the Australian Embassy in Jakarta—the UK and the US embassies there have already been given consular access— has sought and is given consular access to see Ms McCulloch to ensure that she has all the legal and other aid that may be required at this time. I note that the Charge d'Affaires has said, amongst other things, in his letter:
Ms. McCulloch and her colleague have and will continue to enjoy consular services from UK and US Embassies in Jakarta. I must however admit that Indonesia's prison facilities are not as excellent as those found in Woomera Detention Centre where the illegal migrants have been recently detained. Ms. McCulloch and her US fellow-traveller may hence find it distressful, demanding therefore that they be freed as early as possible. 
I recognise that there are some language difficulties potentially involved here, but I am not impressed with the intonation of that particular part of the message to the Senate. I ask the government to ensure that the Attorney-General is acquainted with the whole of the letter of course but in particular that remark. The Charge d'Affaires for Indonesia goes on to say some other things and then says:
Notwithstanding, we will see to it that Ms. McCulloch and her companion get a fair trial for their breaching of Indonesia's laws and regulations.  
This is not the first time that embassy officials have asserted that Ms McCulloch and her companions have broken the law. There has been no such finding by any court in Indonesia or anywhere else, nor has evidence been forthcoming that allows that statement to be made. It alarms me greatly that there is a presumption of guilt here by embassy and government officials before these women have even been brought to trial. It is a very serious matter, and I hope that the Australian government is now taking it far more seriously than it was some weeks ago and is putting all due impress on the Indonesian government that this matter is taken seriously by Australia and that it wants to see Ms McCulloch given not just her Indonesian rights but her international rights in the law and released safely to return as soon as practicable and reasonable. 
Question agreed to. ",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Response to Resolution of the Senate</title>,Documents,17,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2002-10-15,"— The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 is the matter before the chamber at the moment. This bill allocates Commonwealth capital funds to government and non-government schools for the years 2005 to 2007. These funds are crucial to government schools in particular and they constitute around one-third of the capital funding for the government schools sector. In the case of non-government schools, this Commonwealth funding is almost the only government assistance available for capital works, although some states provide some forms of indirect assistance for capital expenditure to a small extent.
The Commonwealth program providing capital support for schools was first introduced by the Whitlam government in 1974. Unfortunately, the funding provided under this program has not been increased in real terms since this government came to office. Inevitably, this has had an impact on schools, especially on government schools in working-class districts. The communities of these schools simply do not have the resources to raise funds independently of the government as communities in wealthier suburbs do. This has led to a situation where schools in poorer suburbs and in rural areas are fast becoming run down. The impact of that is a growing gap in the levels of social inequality in this country. We have seen this growing gap in the way in which the Commonwealth funds schooling, particularly those in the privileged elite schools, and in the money that is provided to students in less affluent areas. This has a direct effect through the years on the students and it has an effect on the outcomes.
It is well known that in Australia today the sorts of life chances that you have bear a strong correlation to the postcode that you enjoy. They have an impact on what sort of school you go to and they often have an impact on the sort of university you go to, the sorts of educational opportunities that are presented to you. Let me give an example of that. Despite the equity programs of the Commonwealth over nearly 30 years now since the Whitlam government, there are some universities in this country that have been able to resist the pressure for social change to the point where the levels of income distribution amongst the parents of the students and in the backgrounds of students in those institutions has not changed dramatically in 30 years.
That is not to say that there have not been dramatic changes in other institutions. Let me give this example. Figures tabled by the Commonwealth at the MCEETYA meeting of state ministers last week—and I quote here from table B2 of that report—revealed to the state ministers that seven per cent of the students at the University of Melbourne come from low socioeconomic backgrounds. That is about the same as when I went there, I can tell you—I was one of the few, and I recall that the figure was around seven per cent. If you compare that figure to that for the Victoria University of Technology down the road, according to the Commonwealth 23.1 per cent of its students come from low socioeconomic backgrounds. So it is quite clear that there are dramatic inequalities in education in Australia, and it is quite clear that the actions of government can have an impact on that, despite the capacity of particular institutions to resist those policies. 
We are seeing a growing divide between government and non-government schools in this country. We have seen that the wealthiest private schools—the ones that, in the debate on the state grants bill two years ago, the Labor Party sought to exclude from the new funding arrangements that the government introduced with its controversial SES funding scheme—are doing extremely well. These are the sorts of schools that are well endowed with luxurious accommodation and facilities. They are the ones that have horse riding centres and yachting facilities—for instance, Geelong Grammar. They are the ones that have indoor rifle ranges, such as King's School at Parramatta in Sydney. These sorts of schools have facilities that people in public educational facilities would only dream about, and they outclass the average public school in terms of their capital support and their moneys for facilities.
We have a situation now where many non-government schools can boast better capital facilities—that is, buildings, libraries and computer facilities—than many public schools can. There is an inequality in educational opportunity that is being experienced in this country. My view is that it is the Commonwealth's responsibility to assist the states in providing a boost to capital funding to try and even up the imbalances that occur. This view is not just held by me. In fact, it is not a particularly radical idea. It is an idea that stems essentially from the tradition of the Karmel settlement of the 1970s. I am sure that those interested in education will recall the Karmel report, Schools in Australia. It is a report that, as a member of the Labor Party, I am very proud of. It was a watershed in that it allowed for the formation of what was known as the Karmel settlement.
The Karmel settlement was one of the greatest achievements of the Whitlam government. It said that the Commonwealth had a responsibility to overcome the sectarian divisions in our society in order to make sure that there was genuine equality of opportunity in our schooling system. Those who remember the divisive state aid debate of the sixties and seventies would appreciate how refreshing that Karmel settlement was. It provided a rational, measured approach for the Commonwealth to provide financial assistance to non-government schools but at the same time provide assistance to the public sector. Many needy schools, particularly those in the Catholic systemic system, were able to improve their facilities quite dramatically, whereas those that enjoyed the lion's share of privilege and a real power in our society—such as Geelong Grammar and King's School—received only a small proportion of the public support given to the poorer schools. I thought that was a very fair approach.
With this government, we have a complete abandonment of that principle. The states grants bill that introduced the SES system fundamentally shifted the balance. The opposition successfully pointed out just how excessive the government's largesse was when it came to former category 1 schools— those elite, very wealthy schools. In that debate I was able to point out to the Senate a number of calculations about the extent of the assistance that would be lent to those very wealthy schools. I confess today that I was wrong. It is a hard thing to say, but I was wrong. I said, for instance, that Wesley College in Melbourne would gain $3 million extra per annum from the Commonwealth under those new funding arrangements. I also said that the King's School in Sydney would get over $1 million per annum. Those were windfall gains by which the very wealthiest schools would benefit the most. 
As it turns out, I underestimated the increases that the Commonwealth was providing to those schools. Under the new figures the department has given me through the Senate estimates process, and based on the 2001 enrolments, we find that Melbourne's Wesley College will actually get additional funding of $7.5 million, not the $3 million that I referred to; King's School will get $3 million, not $1 million; St Peter's College in Adelaide will get $3 million; and St Leonard's College will get an additional $3½ million. These figures are per annum. What we are seeing is Commonwealth funding in a form and with a generosity that I think very few persons in this country could possibly have imagined at any point in our educational history and in the debates about the way in which the public system should be supporting the private system. Even if we allow for the enrolment growth that has occurred within the two sectors, there has been a massive expansion in support for the non-government sector.
The government's policy now is essentially that the sky is the limit for some particular schools in this country. It does not hold that view with regard to all schools. What we have is essentially a profligate government when it comes to the question of funding for elite schools in this country. It places no limitations on the funding of particular programs in education—a policy which contrasts sharply with its policy in other areas of government activity. We do not see the same sort of attitude being taken within health, for instance. Government policy now seeks to automatically fund schools on the basis of the indexation arrangements that have been entered into, whether or not their enrolments actually grow, to the point where some of the richest schools will get increases way over and above even what was announced by the government at the time of the introduction of the new SES formula.
Because of the extraordinarily generous indexation arrangements for those particular schools—and remember that what we are talking about here is, I think, a $24 billion program, two-thirds of which go to one-third of the students in this country—we have a situation where the Commonwealth funds are now going to rise at 5.7 per cent per annum, with no debate, no public disclosure and no discussion. Comparing that to indexation arrangements for universities—the figure there is 2.2 per cent—there is a huge gap in the indexation arrangements between the sectors in this country. That means that, by 2004-05, Commonwealth funding for the private schools in this country will be in excess of $4.2 billion. In the same year, university funding by the Commonwealth will be $4.1 billion. So, by 2004-05, the Commonwealth will be spending more money on non-government schools than it is in total on all the universities in this country. Looking specifically at the Catholic education system, by 2007 the Commonwealth will be spending more money on Catholic education than it is on the entire university sector.
I raise that—and all these figures are based on the figures contained in the portfolio budget statements—in the context of the bill we have here before us. With this bill, we are discussing funding for capital works projects which has to be seen in the broader context of educational funding. We all understand that there are non-government schools that are struggling to do a good job. We know that they are servicing some of the neediest communities in this country and catering in some places for the most underprivileged groups in this country. They deserve Commonwealth support. I do not want anyone to suggest that I do not acknowledge that point. Labor do not oppose public funding for those particular schools. What we are concerned about is the new system, whose implications we are now seeing halfway through that four-year program. We are now seeing the implications of this coalition government's approach which substantially advantages the already privileged in our country.
We have noticed that there is often a lot of argument within the states about whether or not the Commonwealth should be acknowledged for its contribution to capital projects. I know that when we were in government there was often a concern, particularly about conservative governments failing to acknowledge the role of the Commonwealth in the provision of facilities, so we often had the unseemly situation where Commonwealth education ministers, or their representatives, were not invited to the opening ceremonies of various capital facilities. That is still going on. 
We had a situation, though, where the previous Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, the Commonwealth minister, went to the extraordinary extent of actually withdrawing funding from schools where he felt he had not been given appropriate acknowledgment in the naming rights for new facilities. It is one thing to have an argument with the states to make sure that the Commonwealth is acknowledged for its role. It is very important that the Commonwealth is able to communicate with the public, and I certainly want to communicate with as many people as possible and explain what this Commonwealth government is doing in education. It is important for school communities to know that they can look to the Commonwealth for assistance. It is another thing entirely for a Commonwealth minister to refuse to attend an opening and withdraw $1 million from a school in New South Wales.
This was the case last year, when it was quite clear that the Minister for Education in New South Wales had a dispute with the then Commonwealth Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp. The New South Wales minister was not able to attend an opening ceremony under those requirements and in fact he nominated the state shadow minister to act as his representative—so another Lib! Dr Kemp was not satisfied with that. He said that if he could not go then they were not going to get the money, and that is exactly what occurred. If a Labor government had behaved in the way that the Commonwealth behaved on that occasion there would have been an outcry, and so there ought to be. But when this government acts in this way, like so much of its public positioning, there is not a huge amount of public attention drawn to it.
Commonwealth funding for schools should be aimed at targeting genuine need. That is why the funds that have been allocated by this bill should be increased—so they can assist government schools, particularly those schools that serve the poorest and the least privileged in our community. The funding under this program should be increased so that the government can at least fulfil its obligations to the extent it did it when it came to office in 1996. Further, the guidelines for this program specify that the funds should go to where they are most needed and they should be honoured in more than just words. The Commonwealth does not act to ascertain that the government or non-government school systems around the country actually allocate the funds on the basis of need. So I think there are serious questions about the accountability arrangements under this program. Further, the opposition believes there should be a proper prioritisation subject to periodic review. As a consequence, I have outlined some of my concerns in a second reading amendment. I trust that this amendment will enjoy the support of the chamber, and I look forward to other contributions to this debate. I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
		“But the Senate
	(a)	condemns the Government for:
	(i)	failing to provide real increases in Commonwealth capital funding for schools since 1996;
	(ii)	failing to address adequately the capital needs of schools in disadvantaged and isolated areas;

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2002-10-15,"—I rise to speak on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 and to take the opportunity to once again address the importance of public education and highlight, as others have, the amount of Commonwealth funding that is currently being directed towards the private school sector. I would specifically like to talk about accountability measures with regard to what the Australian Greens believe is a lack of accountability for public funds that are directed to the private school sector.
The states grants act currently specifies the weakest form of financial accountability for private schools—that is, an accountant's certification that the amount of money granted was spent for the purpose for which the grant was made is the only requirement currently with regard to capital grants of public money to private schools. Yet, each year, the federal government hands over $4 billion to private schools without, we believe, an adequate sense of whether the money was well spent or not. I think the public can justifiably ask whether this amount is being spent in the public interest and if there is any intention of producing an equitable outcome.
The Greens acknowledge that the process by which these grants are given to private schools is through the block grant authority. We also note that these authorities are representative of private school interests and certainly not of the public interest. We are concerned that this process is not the fairest way to allocate this public money on the basis of public interest. Rather, we would like to see openness and accountability so that all Australians can see where this money is going and can be assured that the public interest is being protected in the allocation of these funds. We acknowledge that capital grants, unlike the much larger recurrent grants, favour the public education system. However, the capital funding of private schools must be seen in the broader context of the overall schools funding mix, which so outrageously and damagingly bestows massive benefit on private schools while starving public schools of growth funding.
It is little wonder that there is disquiet in the community about this issue when schools such as King's School and Trinity Grammar in my home state are spending massive amounts of public money refurbishing their campuses whilst public schools across the country are struggling to continue to provide excellent education in completely substandard conditions. It is little wonder that there is disquiet, given the massive handouts to the category 1 schools, the very wealthiest of the private schools. Those wealthy schools have received an increase in Commonwealth funding of 148.5 per cent as a result of the Howard government's states grants act, whilst the poorest, category 12, schools received only a 29.6 per cent increase. This indicates the impact that the Greens anticipated in the election campaign before the last election, when we were campaigning for funding to the categories 1, 2 and 3 private schools to end—not all private schools, but categories 1, 2 and 3, the most elite and wealthiest of the private schools.
By 2004, Sydney's Trinity Grammar will be receiving $5.3 million in SES funding, an increase of 258.8 per cent over its ERI funding in 2000. Whilst these figures refer to the SES per capita funding and not to capital funding, they do make clear the inequities in the funding formulas being applied by the Howard government. The community at large is crying out for fairer funding that recognises the needs of public education, that recognises the inequity of funding King's School, Scotch College and Frensham School and that also recognises the need for full public accountability with regard to public money being given to these private schools. 
Capital funding is important because the public appearances of schools strongly influence many choices that parents make with regard to future education opportunities for their children. It is perhaps naive to believe that the funds given to private schools are always spent on exactly the purpose for which they were granted. But it is impossible to tell exactly how these funds are spent without complete openness of a school's accounts, something that this government refuses to mandate. Public education is therefore forced further into the marketplace and into competition with private schools that draw on not only the wealth of parents but also the generosity of state and Commonwealth governments. Inequities in these funding measures and regimes threaten the future of public education. They render that competition unfair and risk leaving public education stripped of its most important asset: the comprehensive range of students. 
Over the past 100 years public education has created a fairer and more prosperous society. It has given us a society in which all children, regardless of their cultural background, their gender, their religion or their ability to pay, can access high-quality public education. In article 26 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights there is a recognition that being able to provide high-quality public education is a key indicator of the health of a society, and yet in this country we have continued to see, particularly over the last decade or more, a crisis being created within the education sector because of government mismanagement, funding cuts and the inability of various governments to commit to spending the sort of funds that we need to ensure the longevity of our public education system. The Australian Greens believe these stakes are certainly too high. When you look at it, what is at stake? As I said, it is in article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is about our society's health. It is about ensuring opportunities for employment for future generations through the educational opportunities they are able to receive.
We see this bill as the first shot in the lead-up to the next round of states grants acts that this parliament will be debating in the lead-up to 2005. The Australian Greens believe that the Senate needs to send a strong message to Mr Nelson and Mr Howard that says that we do not want to see a repeat of the shameful episode of October 2000, when the last states grants act was passed. It was good to hear the comments made earlier about the inherent inequities of that system, whereby people's socioeconomic advantage or disadvantage is determined purely by their postcode. It was positive to hear those comments. I almost had to think twice to remember how it was that that piece of legislation managed to pass through the Senate with the support of the two major parties.
The Australian Greens believe that we need to send a simple message from the Senate and that message needs to look at accountability of public money being sent to private schools. It needs to call for an end to the funding of the very wealthiest of those private schools and, in doing so, recognise the inherent worth of our public education system and put the provision of public education right at the front of the government's agenda. It clearly needs to be the responsibility of the government to ensure that all students, regardless of their background, have access to high-quality public education. That cannot be the case if we continue to take up these funding models which skew public funding into the pockets of private schools, which take away that core responsibility from the government and seek to hand it to various parts of the private sector. In this vein I would like to foreshadow that I will be moving a second reading amendment on behalf of the Australian Greens. I will move:
At the end of the motion, add:
		“but that the Senate:
	(a)	condemns the Government for its failure to provide adequate, open accountability for the expenditure of public funds on private education and its failure to ensure that public money is spent for the public benefit and to produce equitable outcomes; 
	(b)	condemns the Government's unwillingness to invest appropriately in the capital funding of public schools;
	(c)	regrets that the Government's approach results in an increasing strain placed on the public education system which is being starved of Commonwealth funding and forced to compete with an increasingly well resourced private education system”.
At the appropriate time I will commend to the Senate this Australia Greens amendment to the second reading.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2002-10-15,"—I also rise to make my contribution on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002. As most honourable senators would be aware, this bill provides capital funding for government and non-government schools for the years 2005-07. This bill follows on in the long history of Commonwealth funding for capital works in schools since the 1970s. It is important to note the purpose of these capital funding type bills. The intent of the bill is to allow advance approval for capital grants for projects to enable authorities to plan for school building projects. This process provides a key support to the capital improvements of our secondary and primary schools. This support over last 30 or so years has totalled some $10 billion in current terms to support capital works. This process enables a significant improvement in the quality of education for many Australians. Indeed, the current bill provides an amount of some $220 million in capital grants for government schools for the period 2005-07. The bill also provides some $77 million annually in capital grants for non-government schools. It is interesting to note that the Commonwealth is virtually the sole source of public moneys for capital grants in non-government schools.
One of the key issues that have emerged over time is the mix of funding for the government sector and the non-government sector. A rough analysis suggests that under this bill the government sector will receive approximately three times the amount that the non-government sector will receive. By most measures, this approach will seem reasonable to most Australians, I am sure. In fact, the Commonwealth's guidelines for this program include objectives to provide and improve school capital infrastructure, particularly for the most educationally disadvantaged students. They also set out objectives for the refurbishment and upgrading of capital infrastructure for existing students while making provision for changes in demography and enrolment trends.
As many of us are aware, one of the key times in the establishment of any successful school is the start-up. Given that the establishment of government schools is normally funded by state and territory administrations, it would appear that the non-government sector, at a cursory glance, is somewhat disadvantaged during this crucial time. We can, of course, point to the low-interest loans that are offered by many state and territory governments to the non-government schools during establishment. Of course, in the interests of fairness and equity, the Commonwealth cannot be seen to be providing an inequitable share of the funding available under this bill. Such a bill would be attacked in this place by most, if not all, of the non-government senators.
So how does the government provide that little extra boost to the non-government sector? If you take a closer look, it is through another program, of course. Each non-government school can receive establishment grants. This equals a per capita entitlement for each full-time equivalent student of $500 for the first year and $250 for the second year. During the period 2001-04, that came to a total of $11.9 million. We have a very interesting picture developing. The government has gone to no end of trouble to make sure that the public view of this bill is that it is equitable and that the non-government sector is seen to be receiving only its fair share relative to the government schools. However, it will then slip them an extra, say, $12 million a year and call it an establishment grant. Do government schools receive an establishment grant? Of course they do not. Only non-government schools are entitled to this piece of largesse. However, superficially this legislation can appear to be all equitable and fair. Everyone receives their fair share of capital funding, because the extra provided to the non-government schools is not capital funding; it is an establishment grant. 
This reflects several things in education funding. One of these is the government's ideological commitment to private education. Private education is, I am sure, the government's view of the ultimate expression of user-pays. All those worthy Australian mums and dads who pay for their children's education are lauded by this government. We should all become more responsible and, of course, individualism teaches us that we should pay for this ourselves. We will overlook the fact that not only are people paying the school fees but also the Commonwealth chips in along the way. In fact, from 1996 to 2000, the government school sector share of estimated Commonwealth spending as a proportion of GDP remained static at 0.26 per cent. The non-government sector share grew by 21.6 per cent, from 0.37 per cent to 0.45 per cent. In fact, we have seen that the proportion spent on non-government schools as a percentage of total expenditure has risen, as was mentioned earlier by Senator Carr, from 57.8 per cent in 1995-96 to an estimated 67.6 per cent in 2005-06. But along the way we are told that the Commonwealth is just supporting the growth in enrolments in the non-government school sector. I for one do not accept that this increase in enrolments justifies a proportionate increase in such a short space of time. This ideological commitment overlooks the fact that the majority of Australians, past and present, are products of the government school system. This reflects the aspirations of everyday Australians to improve their situation or, in this case, that of their children.
Australians are told that non-government schools provide better education, more discipline, better values et cetera. Of course, these lines are readily accepted by those Australians who see their children's private education as a step up and a step forward to a better future. What that overlooks is that under the current government the freeze on expenditure in government schools directly affects the quality of the education provided. This ideological commitment to private education overlooks the fact that for many Australians there is no way they can afford the fees required for an education at a non-government school.
So, not unlike its commitment to cutting funding for higher education, this government is now engaged in reducing funding for government schools. There is no doubt that the public purse is now being used to supplement the activities of the non-government school sector to a greater extent than at any time in the past. There is also absolutely no doubt that this government is fulfilling its ideological urges but doing so at the expense of ordinary Australians. It is one thing to provide reasonable funding to the non-government school system but quite another to increase it at the expense, in real terms, of the government system.
Of course, the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 will be supported, because education generally requires the moneys involved. But this does not mean, and must never mean, that we should allow this government's approach to looking after the non-government sector to go unchallenged. There is no doubt that the quality of the educational infrastructure in schools is directly linked to the quality of the educational outcomes. When you have excellent facilities—and, as outlined earlier by Senator Carr, some of them are exceptional facilities—you are more likely to attract and retain quality teaching staff, and all of this means that our children will end up with a better education. But one should stop and think: the reverse is also true. Where the quality of the facilities is poor and when they are allowed to degrade even further, then the outcomes are likely to be poor.
The Commonwealth should be ensuring that all schools have excellent infrastructure, especially in those areas most directly related to the knowledge economy. Australia will never benefit from all the possibilities of the new economy, which is much lauded and talked about by this government, whilst our schools are equipped for the old economy. There must be a greater emphasis on the provision of information technology at all levels of our school system. Attention should be paid especially to those areas of Australia with low per capita ownership of computers. It is one thing for a child not to have access to a computer at home—and that is usually for financial reasons—but it is quite another for a child not to have access to computers at school. 
There is much talk about Australian education, especially in the key areas of science, mathematics and technology. We all talk about that being the key to the future for not only our children's education but the development of our economy. In fact the enrolment benchmark adjustment liability funds are now used by the states as grants to foster development in those key areas. It seems to me that if one of the futures that we want to build in this country—and I hope it is a future that we want to build in this country—is for a highly skilled, high wage economy then we have to invest in education at all levels and in all ways.
That highlights the big disappointment with this bill. This bill contains no increase in real terms since this government came to office in 1996. In fact, I understand that there has been a reduction of almost $10 million in funding. On the one hand, we know that high educational outcomes are directly related to the quality of education; on the other hand, we have a government that wants to reduce, in real terms, the expenditure that is directly related to achieving those outcomes. Mark my words: there will be a reckoning from this. That reckoning will not be in the short term, although we will start to see it soon; the real reckoning will be much further down the track, when the capital infrastructure of our schools continues to decline and so too the quality of our outcomes.
In finishing my brief contribution to this debate I would like to pretend to be learned and quote from Shakespeare. Even in my situation—and I am a product entirely of a government school education—I can remember learning some Shakespeare. I quote:
Ignorance is the curse of God,
Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2002-10-15,"—I am not sure whether I am supposed to talk about mercy and being strained at this point, but I think I will move straight on to represent my colleague Senator Lyn Allison, who is, of course, the school spokesperson for the Democrats. She is overseas and so is the higher education spokesperson for the Democrats. I will address the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 on behalf of the Democrats.
This bill, as honourable senators should know, amends schedules 3 and 5 of the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000 to provide capital grants funding for government and non-government schools for the calendar years 2005 to 2007. The bill provides a total of $897,783 million over the program years 2005 to 2007. Government schools will be allocated $666,963 million—that is $222,321 million per annum. Non-government schools will be allocated $230,820 million—that is $76,940 million per annum. Funding levels will be maintained for the government school sector at the same rate as in 2001, but for the non-government sector funding levels will fall from $87,401 million in 2003 to $76,940 million in 2004.
Certainly this is a lot of money in dollar terms, but, as the previous speaker and other contributors have noted, these are still worrying trends and worrying amounts of money, given the role that education at all levels plays in our community. One of the objectives of the government's capital grants program is:
... to provide and improve school capital infrastructure, particularly for the most educationally disadvantaged students ...
The Australian Democrats strongly support using capital grant funding to improve the education of disadvantaged students and, of course, we want to see it used to reduce the level of disadvantage in the school system. The problem, however, is that there is no way for us to assess whether this objective has been met. Our deep suspicion is that it has not been met and that it possibly will not be met. 
There is no apparent strategic planning to guide the provision of funds. The criteria for distributing funds for education and block grant authorities in the public and private sectors do not address this issue. We are also very concerned about the reporting requirements being quite weak. In fact, this echoes a debate we have had in the last couple of weeks. I do not seek to reflect on a vote of the Senate, but the most recent higher education debate that we had in this place, about amendments to the Higher Education Funding Act, also seemed to reek of concerns about a lack of accountability, reporting arrangements and, indeed, the issue of transparency. So, when we are dealing with the states grants changes before us, this lack of accountability is also a serious problem. It is a particularly serious problem when you have a government that is unable to tell us with any confidence whether or not its program's objectives have been realised.
The Democrats say this is a basic requirement of good governance. In our opinion, the objectives of the capital grants program should be changed. Instead of just aiming to improve school capital infrastructure—from what we know, in most cases it is of quite a low standard—we should be aiming to guarantee that all students are schooled in an environment which enhances the learning experience and in which they feel safe and valued. We should specify what this exactly means. We should specifically target disadvantaged schools in disadvantaged areas and schools which are in most need of capital works.
To achieve this, the government, in conjunction with the states and territories, needs to assess what it would take to bring our schools up to scratch. We need to have a better overall understanding of the current state of the school infrastructure and, of course, we need to quantify the level of unmet need. We need to set targets. We need to have standards and benchmarks worked out with the Commonwealth and the states. We should have a target of, say, replacing all portables that have been in schools for over 10 years with permanent buildings. This is something that Senator Allison and indeed many Democrat spokespeople before her have talked about previously.
That kind of target may seem unrealistic now, but at what point did we determine that it would be acceptable for so-called portables to become permanent structures? When did we decide that it was okay for Australian children to be educated in substandard conditions? A benchmark could be that a school should have an indoor assembly hall or gymnasium for a given number of students. There are still schools without this basic facility. When we have set such targets, we should then look at what the budgetary implications are and try to allocate the funding accordingly. Unfortunately, this is not what the government is doing and there is no joy to be found in this particular bill. Indeed, this bill is full of more of the same, and we know it is not nearly enough.
Some of the issues that I have raised today, such as the need for a national assessment of school infrastructure, have actually been raised before not only by my colleague Senator Allison but in a 1999 report entitled Capital matters: an evaluation of the Commonwealth's capital grants programme for schools. I would be very interested if the minister could advise the Senate what has happened as a result of this review and what recommendations have been adopted. Perhaps that is something to be taken on notice now for the committee stage of this bill: what has happened to the recommendations in that 1999 report, Capital matters?
It is a regular occurrence for Democrat senators to visit schools in all states and territories; mind you, in some states and territories, we need to get very specific and exact permission to actually attend schools, which is always very interesting. We have visited schools of all types in order to assess everything from staff morale to teaching conditions and, obviously, to answer the questions of students and teachers who have an interest in our political system. But we are conscious of the fact that many of the schools that we have visited require money for serious capital work. Only schools with shrinking enrolments do not rely on demountables or portables, and in most schools we have noticed that they are a permanent fixture. In many schools there is no money to properly maintain the grounds or the buildings, which in many cases are in various states of need of repair. I contrast this with some of the wealthier private schools, which have received massive funding increases from this government, with their excellent facilities and sometimes quite impressive grounds. 
The following extract, which I would like to place on record in the Senate, comes from a staff member from one country primary school in New South Wales. It was submitted as part of a New South Wales public education inquiry. That staff member wrote:
Our school was established in the 1870s. It has an enrolment of approximately 600 students who are housed in 22 classrooms, 10 of which are metal demountables and the remaining 12 are wooden. It is difficult to promote principles of social justice when teachers and students are forced to spend day after day in substandard buildings. At least 11 classrooms leak and have done so for some time. In two classrooms at least, water runs down inside the back wall possibly behind the electrical conduit and power point. In another room, leaks in the ceiling resulted in water collecting in the fluorescent light. Leaking rooms have also resulted in many resource books being ruined and children's books being damaged. At least eight classrooms have inadequate carpet. The carpet either smells due to the leaks or is old, dusty and stained. In one room the carpet is fraying across the room where one rust coloured piece is joined to another maroon coloured piece. At least six classrooms have basic structural problems, such as piers with no footings, piers that are cracked, buckled noticeboards on the back walls, gaps in walls that you can see daylight through. At least eight classrooms have problems with excessive temperatures (37-40 degrees) during the warmer months. There are two toilets for 30 staff.
To check the veracity of those claims, those conducting the inquiry went to this school and they found that they were generally correct. I think anyone in this chamber or more generally would be foolish to think that these examples are isolated incidents. An Australian Primary Principals Association report released last year found that 26 per cent of principals think that `their school facilities are badly in need of an upgrade'. It is clear to me that more funding is needed for capital works so as to improve the entire educational experience of our children. No-one can underestimate the importance of a good physical learning environment. That issue was well summed up in the report of the New South Wales inquiry, which stated:
The ways in which buildings impact upon human life range from their purely functional consequences, to their affect on the aesthetic sensibilities and aspirations of individuals and groups. These qualities are as important, if not more so, to a satisfying and productive life within schools as they are in other human institutions. First ... the primary tasks of public education—teaching and learning—can be enhanced or retarded by the presence or absence of appropriate physical conditions (like a comfortable classroom temperature, a physically safe and clean environment, areas suitable for study and play, room designs that support productive pedagogy, basic educational facilities like `wet areas,' and so forth). Then again, the school community's spirits can be uplifted or depressed by the presence or absence of well designed buildings that are maintained and presented with a view to satisfying the aesthetic needs of those who work and study within them. While it is difficult to isolate the effects of the many interacting factors that contribute to a school's academic outcomes, there is research evidence that good building quality and maintenance are associated with improved academic results. On the available evidence, when allowance has been made for other relevant factors, the physical state of a school is one effective predictor of student achievement. Research suggests that the quality of physical space affects self-esteem, peer and student teacher interactions, parental involvement, discipline, attention, motivation and interpersonal relations.
While I and the Democrats realise that there are deserving private schools—and I think that has been acknowledged in this debate— it is the government schools that appear to be in a far greater state of need overall. The government's funding policies, however, are reducing the amount that should be made available to needy schools in both the public and the private sectors, since the funding is spread across all schools, even the already wealthy. Imagine what could be done if the massive funding increases to the former `wealthy' category 1, 2 and 3 schools from the states grants bill in 2000 went instead to the very needy public schools to improve the conditions there. Imagine if, instead of providing money to all those new schools the government now funds in order to provide so-called educational choice to a limited section of Australian families, the government funded only those new private schools that are needed in a particular area. 
The crux of the matter is that this government's funding decisions will lead to an increasing amount being spent on the maintenance of the non-government school sector. We very strongly think, and have passionately advocated, that that money would be better spent on the public system. It is for that reason that we—my colleague Senator Lyn Allison and the Australian Democrats— will be moving an amendment to this legislation in the committee stage of this bill to request an increase in the capital grant funding program for government schools by a total of $50 million over the program years 2003-07. We do not believe that this is a particularly onerous amount, given the level of need, but it will nonetheless be of assistance. We urge both the government and the Australian Labor Party to support it.
I think the importance of education to a democratic and enlightened society can never be underestimated. I do not think we can afford to ignore the important links among all education sectors, whether we are talking vocational education, primary and secondary education, education in those even earlier years, or higher education. While I might speak in a somewhat different capacity today as a higher education spokesperson and a former schools spokesperson for the Democrats, nonetheless I think it is evident to all honourable senators that there is an incredible link among those sectors, and one that we should respect. Hopefully one day we will recognise that money for education in our community is an investment and not a cost. Unfortunately, this bill seems to reflect the outdated ideology that somehow it is a cost and not a benefit in every sense to the community at all levels. We look forward to support for that amendment, and I indicate, to speed debate, that the Democrats will be supporting the second reading amendments that have been proposed. I am aware of one from Senator Nettle on behalf of the Greens and I believe Senator Carr may have foreshadowed that he was moving a second reading amendment.
—He has moved it. I have seen it and I believe it was the same one that was moved in the lower house, in which case we will be supporting it.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2002-10-15,"—The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 amends the State Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000 to provide capital grant funding amounts for government and non-government schools for the years 2005-07. Specifically, the bill amends schedule 3 and schedule 5 to the act to insert maximum capital grant funding amounts for government and non-government schools for the calendar years 2005, 2006 and 2007. Schedules 3 and 5 of the act set out funding amounts for the capital grants program for government and non-government schools respectively for the period 2001-04. The schedules in the act setting out capital funding allocations include a specific note stating that funding allocations for latter years will be added by an amending act.
The act and previous acts make specific provision for capital funding allocations beyond the normal four years of the quadrennium, due to the size and complexity of school capital projects, which often require long lead times for planning, assessment and construction. School capital projects are regularly funded across several years. As there are substantial development costs associated with capital projects, a guarantee of funding is often sought well in advance of actual construction. By longstanding arrangement, the state education departments and non-government block grant authorities which administer the program are able to recommend funding allocations for projects up to three years in advance of the current calendar year. This enables funding for major projects which require long lead times to be secured at an early stage and payments for large projects to be staged over a number of years. For example, $18 million worth of projects was approved for funding in 2004 as part of the non-government school funding round conducted in 2001. 
This bill is not about shifting funding between the sectors; it is about giving certainty in Commonwealth funding to all schools as they undertake planning and construction of major projects designed to provide essential educational opportunities to schoolchildren. There have been various misleading claims made inferring that the coalition is shifting funding away from the government sector to the non-government sector. Indeed, the Commonwealth is increasing its funding to government schools at a faster rate than the states, which have constitutional responsibility for government schools. In the last federal budget, government school funding was increased by 5.6 per cent compared to an average increase on the part of the states of 2.7 per cent. The opposition is confusing the issue of need in this debate. The government reformed the general recurrent grants program by addressing the anomalies of the former ERI arrangements and moving to an SES funding model which funds schools based on the relative needs of the school communities they serve. Capital grants are also provided on the basis of relative need. 
In response to the amendment to the bill proposed by Labor I indicate that the government does not support the amendment and I make the following points. Capital funding for government schools has been maintained in real terms and increased in actual dollars at a time when government school enrolments are falling. The principal responsibility for maintaining the fabric of Australia's schools system rests with state and territory governments. While the Commonwealth has maintained its expenditure in this area, the same, regrettably, cannot be said for many of the state governments. The opposition also fails to take stock of the fact that, as a result of the introduction of a new tax system, the states and territories have access to a significant new source of funding through GST revenues. These revenues are expected to rise from $24.4 billion in 2000-01 to $32.6 billion in 2004-05, an increase of 33.6 per cent.
I agree that it is imperative that the capital needs of schools in disadvantaged and isolated areas, including Indigenous schools, receive priority attention. The Commonwealth program is targeted specifically to these schools. The Commonwealth expects states to honour their agreements with the Commonwealth and allocate the substantial funding the Commonwealth provides to these areas of need. I acknowledge that the accountability and evaluation processes established for the program by the Labor Party were inadequate. The government has tightened accountability requirements and will continue to do so while the states, such as South Australia, contravene their agreements with the Commonwealth and their school communities.
Non-government capital works projects are normally approved in October. Schools often undertake building works during the long recess over Christmas to avoid danger and disruption to students. If passage of this bill is delayed beyond October, any urgent projects with 2005 funding that are prepared to let tenders, sign contracts and commence construction during the end of the year school recess will be unnecessarily delayed and some projects may need to be rescheduled.
In summary, there is a compelling argument that the bill should be agreed by the parliament without amendment to allow capital projects recommended by states and non-government block grant authorities, which include a 2005 allocation of Commonwealth funding, to proceed. If the opposition wants to demonstrate that it supports schools and the quality of their educational provision, it should support this bill straightaway. I call on the chamber to support this important bill so that it can provide certainty for the schools that are waiting anxiously for this bill to proceed.
Question agreed to.
Senator NETTLE (New South Wales) (5.05 p.m.)—I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
		“and the Senate:
	(a)	condemns the Government for its failure to provide adequate, open accountability for the expenditure of public funds on private education and its failure to ensure that public money is spent for the public benefit and to produce equitable outcomes; 
	(b)	condemns the Government's unwillingness to invest appropriately in the capital funding of public schools;
	(c)	regrets that the Government's approach results in an increasing strain placed on the public education system which is being starved of Commonwealth funding and forced to compete with an increasingly well resourced private education system”.
Question agreed to.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-10-15,"—I rise to speak this afternoon on the Torres Strait Fisheries Amendment Bill 2002, because it amends the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984 to provide for the Chairperson of the Torres Strait Regional Authority to be appointed as a member of the Protected Zone Joint Authority. The bill provides overdue recognition of the important relationship between the people of the Torres Strait and their traditional waters. The opposition strongly support the formal inclusion of the Torres Strait Islander people in the Protected Zone Joint Authority's decision making process. However, we recognise that there is currently some discussion about representation matters in the Torres Strait, particularly relating to the representation of the Kaurareg people, the traditional owners of the Prince of Wales group of islands. This matter will not be resolved in the course of this debate, but Labor do call on the government to improve its consultative processes in this region. 
Representatives of the Kaurareg people have advised Labor that they are concerned about the deficiencies in the government's consultation on the bill. We are advised that representatives of the Kaurareg people have sought no more than individual consultation on the bill but have been refused this consultation. This government has a less than outstanding record on Indigenous affairs, and I fear that this is just one more example of its lack of good faith in dealing with Indigenous communities. Nonetheless, Labor are pleased to support the amendment bill, because it does give proper regard to the right of Indigenous people to participate in the Protected Zone Joint Authority as full participants, not as observers or ad hoc members. 
The Torres Strait Regional Authority is a Commonwealth statutory authority established eight years ago under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989. It seeks to strengthen the economic, social and cultural development of the Torres Strait to enhance the lives of Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginal people living in the region. Under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act, the Torres Strait Regional Authority is responsible for the recognition and maintenance of the special and unique variety of island cultures of Torres Strait Islanders living in the Torres Strait region, the formulation and implementation of programs for Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginal people living in the Torres Strait region, the monitoring of the effectiveness of programs for Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginal people, and advising the minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs on matters relating to Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal affairs in the Torres Strait. 
The Torres Strait protected zone was established under the Torres Strait Treaty entered into between Australia and Papua New Guinea in 1985. The Torres Strait Fisheries Act gives effect to the fisheries provisions contained in that treaty. Section 8 of the act requires that the Protected Zone Joint Authority have regard for the traditional way of life and livelihood of traditional inhabitants. The Protected Zone Joint Authority meets biannually in the Torres Strait and is formed by the Commonwealth and Queensland ministers with responsibility for fisheries. The addition of the Chairperson of the Torres Strait Regional Authority to the Protected Zone Joint Authority as a full member is an important measure.
This is an appropriate moment to congratulate Senator Ian Macdonald for exercising his responsibility for the first time, last July, as Chairperson of the Protected Zone Joint Authority. I am sure he enjoyed his journey to Thursday Island and have no doubt he recognises his important responsibilities with respect to the Protected Zone Joint Authority and the fisheries resources of the Torres Strait. I am also pleased to acknowledge the superb contribution of the Queensland Minister for Primary Industries, Henry Palaszczuk, to the work of the Protected Zone Joint Authority. 
—I wouldn't go overboard if I were you!
—Senator, you have done fairly well so far. I would keep my head down if I were you. Things might change. The Torres Strait comprises more than 100 islands and stretches over 150 kilometres between Australia and Papua New Guinea. The population of about 8,000 people is dispersed over 19 small island communities. The culture of the people of the Torres Strait is deeply influenced by the sea, and the maritime tradition remains very strong. 
I understand that islander input into regional fisheries policy has recently been improved through a new consultative mechanism. The new structure provides for representation of Torres Strait leaders and fishers on the industry advisory groups and the executive council that will advise the Protected Zone Joint Authority on regional management issues. These arrangements, together with the permanent appointment to the Protected Zone Joint Authority, will strengthen the involvement of Torres Strait Islanders in the decisions that have an impact on the economic, cultural and social life of the region. In conclusion, I note again concerns about the adequacy of consultation with the Kaurareg people and call on the government to improve its commitment to consultation with Indigenous communities in the Torres Strait as well as on the mainland. I commend the bill to the Senate. ",SENATE,<title>TORRES STRAIT FISHERIES AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2002-10-15,"—In speaking to the Torres Strait Fisheries Amendment Bill 2002 I want to canvass two specific issues: firstly, the consultation process that was undertaken by the government in the lead-up to the bringing of this bill to the parliament and, secondly, the management issues related to the Torres Strait prawn fishery.
The Senate needs to be aware, as does the government, that both Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders traditionally have lived, and now do live, in the Torres Strait. It was only last year that the Kaurareg people's native title claim over islands in the southern part of the Torres Strait, including Prince of Wales Island and Horn Island, was recognised. The Kaurareg are Aboriginal people who, like the Torres Strait Islanders, have strong associations with the sea. Like Torres Strait Islanders, the Kaurareg wish to pursue their native title claim over the sea. 
Over some years the Kaurareg have lobbied to change their representative body for native title matters from the Torres Strait Regional Authority to the Cape York Land Council. There are good arguments on both sides of this discussion and, clearly, more work needs to be done to ensure that all parties can be satisfied that their native title interests are being well represented. This is especially so given that currently the Torres Strait Regional Authority is pursuing a sea claim on behalf of traditional owners in the region. However, I recognise that this native title representative issue is not related to this bill, but it is indicative of the need for both Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders living in the Torres Strait to be consulted in the process of developing legislation such as this bill. My advice is that this has not occurred in this case, and that is disappointing.
However, the fundamental purpose of the bill is to give representation to Indigenous interests on the Torres Strait Protected Zone Joint Authority, and that principle should and will be supported. I take this opportunity to urge the government to review their consultation mechanisms in the Torres Strait to ensure inclusion of both Torres Strait Islanders and the Kaurareg not only for fisheries matters but for all issues.
I move now to management issues in the Torres Strait prawn fishery. In July this year on Thursday Island, Ministers Macdonald and Palaszczuk, as the constituted joint authority of the Torres Strait Protected Zone Joint Authority, requested that an options paper be developed to address management issues in the fishery. There are two issues that need to be canvassed in this options paper: firstly, the issue of sustainability and, secondly, the need by government to allocate fishing days to both Torres Strait Islanders and Papua New Guineans. 
In the original allocation of days in 1993 and 1994, there was no allocation made to these licence holders. There were 13,570 days allocated at that time and that was when those days were capped. The fishers in the area have no question that the issue of sustainability needs to be addressed and needs to be addressed through good modelling of the fishery with good scientific information, and they are pursuing that work with the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. I encourage the Australian Fisheries Management Authority to undertake sound scientific work in consultation and cooperatively with the fishers so that a resolution to the issue of sustainability can be found. I can advise the Senate that the Torres Strait Prawn Entitlement Holders Association happily acknowledge that the issue of sustainability has to be addressed, and addressed soon.
The second issue, although it is somewhat related, goes to the reallocation of days to include Torres Strait fishers and Papua New Guineans in the fishery. It is the view of the Torres Strait Prawn Entitlement Holders Association that those issues are somewhat separate but that the issue of sustainability has to be identified first and then the reallocation can occur. I understand that an independent panel has been established to review this process, and I wish that group well in its deliberations. But it comes down to the number of days that should be allocated to the fishery. In the view of the Torres Strait Prawn Entitlement Holders Association, if further days are going to be allocated to licence holders—and they do not have a problem with that—it has to be within the sustainability model and there has to be recognition that, in fact, that is a reallocation of days from existing licence holders to new licence holders. That is an important point that AFMA and the independent panel have to consider when they are reallocating those days. 
I understand that the Torres Strait Prawn Entitlement Holders Association has requested representation on the Protected Zone Joint Authority. That request has not been taken seriously. I will be interested in your comments, Minister, as to why that has not been progressed. I understand also that the fishers are now attending the joint authority's meetings on Thursday Island and, in the view of some of the fishers, the value is more to the authority than the other way. It certainly would be useful if there were a more cooperative relationship between, essentially, the managers of this fishery and those who work it. In support of their view that they need to be represented on the joint authority they suggest that it is an issue of equity and the contribution that they can make to good management practice of the fishery. To conclude, I support the inclusion of the Chairperson of the Torres Strait Regional Authority on the Torres Strait Protected Zone Joint Authority. I encourage open and better consultation with the Indigenous peoples of Torres Strait and the fishers who work in the fishery.",SENATE,<title>TORRES STRAIT FISHERIES AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2002-10-15,"—The Australian Democrats are disappointed that the government and the ALP are persisting with the passage of the Torres Strait Fisheries Amendment Bill 2002 at this time. They are both fully aware of the reasons why, on numerous occasions, the Democrats have requested that the bill be deferred to ensure that two particular issues are resolved. One is the question of Indigenous representation in the Torres Strait and the other is to ensure that the native title rights and interests of the Kaurareg people are recognised and respected. It goes without saying that what has to be achieved is what the bill seeks to achieve as an outcome: to ensure that all Indigenous people in the Torres Strait who are likely to be affected by this bill are adequately consulted about the bill and how it will impact upon them. I want to talk about some of those issues and ask some questions of the minister.
In general, the Democrats support in principle the objective of including an Indigenous representative on the Protected Zone Joint Authority. Indeed we welcome the intention of the bill to bring about that outcome. However, we take issue with the government on the question of ensuring appropriate Indigenous representation. By that we mean representation that enjoys the full support of Indigenous people in the Torres Strait and reflects the spectrum of Indigenous interests in that region. We do not have any confidence that the situation at the moment has been resolved. I will outline our concerns in that regard.
Our concerns centre on the issue of the recognition of the Kaurareg people of the Torres Strait. The Kaurareg people are the traditional owners of the Prince of Wales group of islands off the tip of Cape York. This group includes well-known islands: Thursday Island, Horn Island, the Prince of Wales and the Hammond Islands. They are, therefore, the holders of rights and interests over a significant part of the Torres Strait. The Federal Court recognised the Kaurareg people as the traditional owners of sea country included in the Torres Strait protected zone in May 2001.
However, the Kaurareg native title determinations were not over the full extent of the Kaurareg's traditional land; for example, they did not include Thursday and Hammond Islands, nor did they include any of their sea country which extends north into the Torres Strait protected zone. The determinations of native title that were made by the Federal Court in 2001 recognise both Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginal people as Kaurareg people. It is important to state here that the native title rights and interests of the Kaurareg people extend into the Torres Strait protected zone and the Australian area of the Torres Strait waters for which the Protected Zone Joint Authority is responsible under the Torres Strait Fisheries Act.
Based on advice that I have been given by the Kaurareg people and the Cape York Land Council, who are providing them with legal advice, the Kaurareg people's native title rights and interests are therefore very significant in terms of the Torres Strait Treaty and the application of the Torres Strait Fisheries Act. I would therefore like to take issue with the view that has been put to me by the minister, Senator Ian Macdonald, in a letter dated 14 October, that the seven islands over which the Kaurareg people were granted native title `lie outside the Torres Strait protected zone'. Their native title rights and interests are not peripheral to the application of the Torres Strait Treaty—they are central and should be recognised as such by the Commonwealth in terms of resolving this issue. 
I would also like to respond to the minister's criticism that he is not aware of the `exact nature of the concerns' of the Kaurareg people in relation to this bill. I think the reason for this is obvious—the Kaurareg people have made it clear to me that they have not been consulted about the bill. Beyond what my office has conveyed to them, they have no knowledge of the content and purpose of this bill or how it might impact on their native title rights and interests.
In a letter sent to me this afternoon by Mr Jeffrey Bosen, the Chairman of the Kaiwalagal Aboriginal Corporation, the prescribed body corporate dealing with the rights of the Kaurareg native title holders, he explained:
While the Kaurareg people come under the Torres Strait Regional Authority, we believe that we are not adequately represented as the Aboriginal owners of this area. Because we are a minority in the Torres Strait Regional Authority Area our interests are often secondary to those of the Torres Strait Islanders.
We have continued to struggle to be identified as Aboriginal (rather than Torres Strait Islanders) and this is increasingly difficult when the Torres Strait Regional Authority is making decisions on our behalf without adequate consultation with us. Governments and Agencies assume that the Torres Strait Regional Authority has our mandate but on many matters it is simply not appropriate to have Torres Strait Islanders make decisions that affect us, Aboriginal people.
The Kaurareg people seek recognition and respect as the traditional owners of this sea country.
Although the Kaurareg have a representative on the Torres Strait Regional Authority, I am also aware that there is considerable difficulty for this representative in communicating effectively with the broader Kaurareg nation, whose members are scattered over much of Northern Australia. It has therefore not been possible, in a practical sense, to speak to all of the Kaurareg people to get their informed consent to the passage of this bill. They have advised me that, if they were properly consulted and advised about the bill, it may well be the case that they would have no objection to its passage, but until this occurs they think they should have every right to withhold their support for this bill. Mr Bosen, in his letter to me today, went on to explain:
As the Chairperson of the Kaiwalagal Aboriginal Corporation, I was not informed of the summit that was held in April 2001 or of the decisions that were made in relation to the membership on the Protected Zone Joint Authority. While we support the involvement of indigenous representatives in the Protected Zone Joint Authority we seek to have our own Aboriginal representative as well as the Chairman of the TSRA.
The fact that the minister's office has made it clear to me that the Commonwealth has no intention of seeking the informed consent of the Kaurareg people in relation to this bill raises serious concerns about how recognised native title holders will be treated across Australia, given that their rights have already been recognised by the Federal Court. 
In this particular instance, the Democrats believe that the Australian government has a clear obligation under the Torres Strait Treaty with Papua New Guinea to protect the traditional way of life and livelihood of the traditional inhabitants, including their free movement, performance of traditional activities and the exercise of traditional customary rights. It is clear from the definition of `traditional inhabitants' under the treaty and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act that this would include the Kaurareg people. The principal purpose of the establishment of the protected zone under the treaty is to `acknowledge and protect the traditional way of life and livelihood of the traditional inhabitants including their traditional fishing and free movement'. This purpose is also echoed in the Torres Strait Fisheries Act. The advisory council that was set up under the treaty has a responsibility to ensure that traditional inhabitants are properly consulted and are given a full and timely opportunity to comment on the matters of concern to them. Similarly, under the Torres Strait Fisheries Act, the minister is required to consult with traditional inhabitants on any matter that affects their interests. 
The Australian Democrats are concerned that the Kaurareg people have not been given a full and timely opportunity to comment on the Torres Strait Fisheries Amendment Bill. We believe that the government could easily rectify this situation if it chose to and that, in doing so, it would give effect to the relevant terms of the Torres Strait Treaty and the provisions of the Torres Strait Fisheries Act. It seems to me that no good argument has been put forward to support rushing this bill through, because it is not a life and death issue; we are talking about changing some of the structural arrangements about representation.
As the minister is aware, the Chairperson of the Torres Strait Regional Authority has been attending recent meetings of the Protected Zone Joint Authority in an advisory capacity for some time. So it is not a question of saying that they do not have representation there; they do. It is a question of looking at formalising that but doing it in the proper way.
As I mentioned earlier, the objective of including an Indigenous representative on the joint authority is one that the Democrats support in principle. However, that representation must reflect the interests of all traditional inhabitants, not just a sector of these interests. The Democrats have called on the government to delay the passage of this bill until the broader issue of Indigenous representation in the Torres Strait is comprehensively resolved. I want again to make that request and to remind the minister that a meeting of the Indigenous representatives, which would include ATSIC, the Cape York Land Council, the Kaurareg people and the Torres Strait Regional Authority, is to take place in November to do just that. It seems to me that no evidence can be put forward to explain why we ought to rush this bill through. It is not a life and death issue. Commonsense requests have been made, and I think that we ought to comply with those requests.",SENATE,<title>TORRES STRAIT FISHERIES AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2002-10-15,"—I rise this afternoon to speak on the Torres Strait Fisheries Amendment Bill 2002. During my time in the seafood industry, I can recall holding one principle beyond all others. As a fisherman, I often talked to fisheries managers who were convinced that the business of managing fisheries was all about managing fish. It took me quite a few years to really understand how far wrong we had gone with that whole process. Managing fisheries is actually all about managing people. To manage people, you have to have the same process you have with any management issue with people: you have to ensure that all of the people involved in the process have a lot of ownership of and an understanding about the process itself.
It is very interesting that this amendment would usually be perceived as a fairly simple administrative change to the Torres Strait Fisheries Act, with the simple addition of another person to the Torres Strait Protected Zone Joint Authority. But, as Senator Ridgeway has pointed out, when associated with people these issues are not as simple as they may first appear. The Chairperson of the Torres Strait Regional Authority already actually sits on the authority but is not a full member. We have had years and years of Indigenous people telling us—certainly they have spoken to me over the years—of their frustration in not being further involved in mainstream fisheries management. Under this new amendment, the authority will enable the third member to join both the federal and state fisheries ministers in a more formalised arrangement.
Before coming to this place, I was very proud to have been involved with the establishment of similar management structures across the Northern Territory for a range of areas and language groups, like the Warnindilyakwa, the Numberini, the Tiwi Islands, Port Keats, the Beagle Gulf and the Manbuynga ga Rulyapa. They all refer to fisheries management groups and areas which were empowered to manage the fisheries and the resources within the areas relating to the language group for which they spoke. 
The greatest difficulties that we had every single time that we started off these consultative committees and these management committees were, as Senator Ridgeway said, associated with issues of representation. One of the greatest pieces of evolution within these committees is that when we started off there were some difficulties, and so we started where we could and we evolved the process of ensuring that the Indigenous communities were empowered to resolve some of those issues about representation themselves. I certainly hope that this step is the very first of a series of steps to ensure better understanding and the empowerment of all the people from the Torres Strait in this process.
The whole issue of fisheries management is about looking after the resource. I think it is very important that we move with some timeliness towards a resolution of these matters. Some previous speakers spoke about some of the issues associated with the complex allocation processes that are about to take place. They are not only allocation processes; they are resource management processes that not only involve allocations between certain sectors and reductions between certain sectors but ensure that certain sectors are brought up to capacity. It is a very complex issue involving a lot of people and a whole range of different rights and interests.
I think it is very important, though, that the bottom line is that there is no real point in going out and managing something unless you have the goal of managing it so that our children will have a better opportunity to access that resource than we did. If we allow too much time to pass, at the end of the day the fisheries industry will suffer. We know that from history, so there is a reasonable imperative to continue to take reasonable steps in this direction. It is very important to recognise that this appointment is not so much a token advisory appointment but a position that will eventually represent all the traditional interests within the Torres Strait. The issues associated with the Queensland fisheries minister have traditionally reflected the interests of the commercial fishers, the recreational fishers in Queensland and the management processes that go with them. The Commonwealth minister clearly has been there to represent Australia's interest, the treaty obligations and those interests and issues associated with the Commonwealth fisheries.
I believe the very complex issues that the Torres Strait Protected Zone Joint Authority are about to take on will be very much assisted by the appointment of Terry Waia. I understand that the PNG interests and the licence held by the traditional owners are going to have a fishing effort assigned to them, and I think that process will be very much assisted by someone who has such a history in fishing at a local level. The fact that the Torres Strait Protected Zone Joint Authority will also have to oversee a restructure that accommodates all of these interests, as well as ensuring that the existing operators can continue to fish in an economic and sustainable manner, is one of the first challenges that will be laid down.
Let us look at the current Chairman of the TSRA, Terry Waia. I can think of few other people who could step into that environment and work towards bringing these interests together. He is an individual who, as chair of the Saibai Island Council, has looked across at the western provinces of New Guinea; he has dealt with many of the quarantine and immigration issues and has associated himself with many of the resolutions in those matters. In his address to Corroboree 2000, which was convened by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, Mr Waia said:
As a person who has lived my whole life within two kilometres of the western province of New Guinea, I have always known reconciliation and compromise—two people, Torres Strait Islanders and Papuans, living as neighbours.
The principal words are, `I have always known reconciliation and compromise.' If you had to think of values that you wished to instil in someone who was going to be involved in the very complex matter of fisheries management, they would be the sorts of values that you would ask for. I think that this particular individual will very much appreciate the position, the aspirations and the desires of the numbers of stakeholders and will be very much an addition to the whole process of rationalising and further managing the resources of the Torres Strait Islanders in the future.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2002-10-15,"—First of all, I thank all of those who have contributed to this debate for what have been very thoughtful contributions. Particularly I acknowledge the contribution which Senator Scullion just made. Senator Scullion is a person, as he indicated, who has had a long history with the seafood industry and matters maritime throughout Australia. It is indeed a delight that the parliament is able to draw upon his experience over the years in these issues. Having said that, I also appreciate the contribution from the other senators, particularly Senator O'Brien's praise of the current board of the PZJA. I do concede, Senator O'Brien, that Mr Palaszczuk does make a very worthwhile contribution and we do get along very well, and my predecessor and Mr Palaszczuk also operated very harmoniously in this role.
It seems to me that there are three issues that people have raised. I am not sure that it is the intention of the Senate to go into the Committee of the Whole to clarify some of these issues. In case it is not, I will try to address them in my second reading speech, but it may be that some senators will want to look into it in greater detail in the Committee of the Whole. There was a lot of valuable contribution, but there were three issues which I might be able to assist the Senate with by responding. There was the reason for getting this bill through now. Senator Ridgeway was suggesting that there is no need to rush it through, that it could be delayed. Senator McLucas spoke about the Torres Strait Prawn Entitlement Holders Association requiring a position on the PZJA. There was another issue: the position generally raised by some people about representation on the PZJA.
I will start with the reason for this bill being dealt with now. The Torres Strait Fisheries Amendment Bill 2002 has had a long gestation and was, I understand, initiated some years ago. It has been around for a long time. It was an election promise that the coalition made prior to the last election and it was a commitment that was very much supported by the Torres Strait Regional Authority. I am not persuaded that what we have is not the right formulation but, Senator Ridgeway, if there are other people who should be represented—and I am not suggesting for a moment that I think there are— there are always opportunities to amend the bill in the future, as we are amending it today.
The current bill has been in place for almost 20 years and it is able to be amended. We are amending it today and if there is merit in what you say and you are able to convince others of that then there is nothing to stop the bill being amended at some future time. Certainly at the last meeting of the PZJA we did invite Mr Terry Waia, the Chairman of the Torres Strait Regional Authority, to sit with us at the table and to participate as a full member. We did that because I think at the time the legislation had been drawn, the commitments had been made previously and we understood it to be a formality for him to do that. We had him sit with us, and I think it is appropriate for the people of the Torres Strait that their representative is made a formal member as soon as possible. So that is why we want to proceed with this at the present time.
Senator McLucas raised the issue of the Torres Strait Prawn Entitlement Holders Association. Again, those people, and anyone who really has an interest in the Protected Zone Joint Authority and the fisheries, are invited to the meetings. There is nothing exclusive about it. Mr Palaszczuk and I currently have the formal legal power to make decisions but we do invite everyone into the room. We certainly give everybody an opportunity to participate, to have their say and to make sure their views are known.
The authority is a decision making fisheries management authority. It is not a representative body whereby you have everybody represented. Having said that, it seemed sensible, when this proposal we are debating today was first put, that you had the Commonwealth minister, as Senator Scullion said, broadly representing the Commonwealth and the national interest and the Queensland minister representing the Queensland interest—and, of course, the Torres Strait and its waters are part of the state of Queensland. So the original idea was that those two ministers would manage the authority. 
The Torres Strait Regional Authority— and I am no expert on this, so I will give you an amateurish layman's understanding—was to consist of the elected representatives of the people of the Torres Strait. It seemed that that `level of government' should be the other party to the Protected Zone Joint Authority board. It was thought that there should be a representative of the Commonwealth government, a representative of the Queensland government and a representative of the `government' of the people of the Torres Strait. The Torres Strait Regional Authority is elected by the people of the Torres Strait and, until I am convinced otherwise, I understand it to fairly and democratically represent the interests of the people of that part of Australia. That is why those three people are there. I never say never but I would need a hell of a lot of convincing for the Prawn Entitlement Holders Association to be made a formal member of the authority. Certainly, for as long as this government is here—and I am sure for as long as the opposition is in government, whenever that will be—there will be an opportunity for them to be involved in a very full and appropriate way.
There are difficulties in the fisheries up there, as I think a lot of the speakers have mentioned, but they are the sorts of difficulties you have in any fishery management arrangement. There is a limited stock and it has to be managed sustainably. There are always more people than can be accommodated wanting to catch the stock. Everybody agrees that it has to be managed sustainably but always everyone wants their share and it is someone else who should bear the pain of any cutback to ensure ongoing sustainability. This does not just apply in the Torres Strait; it applies everywhere. It is an element of fisheries management anywhere in the world. In Australia we try to allocate the resource fairly and we ensure that it is done in a sustainable way. We usually find that the best way to address these issues is not for politicians to get involved in the detail of the decision making but for the people who are directly involved in the issues to get around the table with the scientists and the professional managers and work through the issues as they come along.
I acknowledge that the Torres Strait prawn entitlement holders do have some real concerns. Solutions to these issues are difficult, but, really, we are trying to work with the people of the Torres Strait and in fact to get them to work with the scientists and the managers to come through with what, in the circumstances, is hopefully the right decision. It will not be a decision that will make everyone happy; very rarely is this possible in fisheries management matters. But we hope that the parties themselves will come up with a conclusion which they understand is fair. Of course, that is what we are looking for with a lot of the difficult decisions that have to be made in the fisheries in the Torres Strait area.
There was the issue of the representative nature of the Kaurareg people. For the record, I might just indicate the sorts of things that I indicated to Senator Ridgeway when he raised the matter with me. It is fairly obvious that the TSRA does support the passage of this bill. The proposal contained in the bill for the TSRA chair to become a member of the Torres Strait Protected Zone Joint Authority was actually generated by the traditional inhabitants of the Torres Strait and pursued by the TSRA as their representative body. There have been several opportunities for groups concerned about the proposal to raise their concerns through the TSRA, through the PZJA or directly with the Queensland or Commonwealth governments.
Senators would be aware that the proposal for the TSRA chair to become a member of the PZJA was made shortly after the Cultural Maritime Summit held on Thursday Island between 22 and 25 March 2001. The summit was attended by chiefs, elders and young people from the 22 inhabited islands of the Torres Strait. Representatives of the various land councils and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission also attended. The Kaurareg people had a strong involvement in the summit, with Kaurareg elders delivering the welcome and a Kaurareg representative chairing one of the sessions. The summit dealt with many issues relating to the economic development of sea-based resources for traditional inhabitants of the Torres Strait, community empowerment as it relates to fisheries, and traditional fisheries management concerns. 
In response to concerns raised at the summit, my predecessor, Wilson Tuckey, and the Queensland minister, Mr Palaszczuk, travelled to Badu to meet Torres Strait community representatives on 12 April 2001. At this meeting the ministers agreed to pursue the appointment of the chair of the TSRA to the PZJA to ensure formal Torres Strait Islander participation in the management of the Torres Strait fisheries. I understand that the Kaurareg people were represented at this meeting, along with many of the diverse islander communities with an interest in Torres Strait fisheries issues. At the next meeting of the PZJA, on 3 October 2001, the PZJA welcomed the full participation of Mr Terry Waia, then and now the chair of the TSRA.
At the earlier TSRA meeting, between 24 and 27 June 2002, the TSRA endorsed the proposal that the TSRA chair become a full member of the PZJA. As Senator Ridgeway mentioned in a letter he wrote to me, from 1997 to 2000 a Kaurareg person had represented the Kaurareg people's interests on the TSRA board. The current Kaurareg representative on the TSRA board is from Horn Island, where the traditional Kaurareg people reside. I am informed by the TSRA that this member meets with elders regularly and brings their issues to the board's attention. As you mentioned, Senator Ridgeway—and I think Senator McLucas mentioned it too— the Kaurareg people were granted native title rights to seven inner islands and were officially recognised as traditional owners of the area. All of these islands and their surrounding waters lie outside the Torres Strait protected zone. However, they are included as part of the `outside but near' waters set out in the Torres Strait Treaty.
Senator Ridgeway informed me that the Kaurareg people had concerns about the passage of the bill. I indicated in my letter of response to him that the exact nature of those concerns had not been conveyed to me, although Senator Ridgeway has again touched on this in his speech. I am aware that there are issues surrounding the Kaurareg people's representation on broader matters in the Torres Strait but I suggest, with respect, that the passage of this bill does not compromise the settlement of these issues with the Torres Strait Islander representative organisation. Of course, this bill in no way affects the native title rights of the Kaurareg people.
I hope this is a satisfactory explanation of the major issues that were raised in the second reading debate. I conclude by emphasising that the amendment does mark an important recognition of Torres Strait Islanders' ancient cultural connections to the marine resources which are abundant in the Torres Strait protected zone. The appointment of the chair of the TSRA to the PZJA, sitting alongside both the Commonwealth and Queensland ministers, is a significant recognition of the importance of Torres Strait Islander input into the management of both traditional and commercial fishing in the Torres Strait protected zone. The appointment, as I mentioned, is the result of extensive consultation with all islander communities by both the Commonwealth and Queensland governments, through the TSRA, and it spanned some 18 months. It is an appointment that the Torres Strait Islanders want. As I say, this was confirmed by their official endorsement of the amendment in June of this year. The appointment will play a significant role in the self-determination and economic development of the Torres Strait Islander people.
The amendment is also consistent with both the Torres Strait Treaty, entered into by Papua New Guinea and Australia in 1985, and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984, which specifically states:
In the administration of this Act, regard shall be had to ... the traditional way of life and livelihood of traditional inhabitants ...
I am personally proud to be associated with a change such as this. I give credit to my predecessor, Mr Tuckey, and to Mr Palaszczuk on this change. It is an improvement to a management model which I do say has worked well so far and which, I am sure, will work even better in the future. I conclude by again thanking senators for their contributions and by commending the bill to the Senate.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-10-15,"—The Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act is the primary legislation for the administration of Australia's offshore petroleum resources. The amendments before the Senate in the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill 2002 are driven by two imperatives: first, to reduce the complexity of the act and associated compliance costs and, second, to rid the act of any anticompetitive provisions in keeping with the competition principles enshrined in the 1995 COAG agreement. The opposition supports these amendments. The act, now 35 years old, is due for review and amendment and is unacceptably complex. It contains within it unacceptable compliance costs which are a burden to Australian energy companies. Likewise, the opposition agrees that it is unacceptable that the current provisions in the act allow precious and major sources of energy to be locked up for such extensive periods of time—according to the Bills Digest, for up to 26 years.
Not long before the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Bill was enacted, Australia imported 100 per cent of its petroleum, and natural gas was virtually unknown here. Today petroleum and gas represent Australia's most valuable commodities and we are a net exporter of energy. Of course, none of the energy sources which underpin the Australian economy are renewable, and while further discoveries will be made Australia's energy reserves will not last forever, at least not as we know them. The government has an important role to play in ensuring that these resources are exploited in a way which maximises the benefit to the Australian people, the people who own them. This bill will assist in that process but I must say that it will not be sufficient to deal with all of the issues involved and much more needs to be done.
What we need is a comprehensive energy policy and that is a failing which one would ascribe to the policy framework that this government has. I know that this government is wont to accuse the opposition of lacking in policy in this area. Clearly, there is no doubt that the Howard government, having been in government since 1996, and its ministers in this area over the last six years have been derelict in arriving at a comprehensive energy policy for this nation for the future. If that had occurred and we had such a policy framework in this country at this time, we would not be having the debate now about whether gas from the Sunrise field in the Timor Sea should be exported from a floating facility or brought to an onshore facility and also used for domestic gas purposes. 
Some would argue, I am sure, that government intervention in the market would cause a flight of capital and leave some of our important reserves unexploited. That is not the opposition's view. These resources are finite. They are, as we understand it, not renewable resources and not renewable reserves of these resources within the constraints of the boundaries of this nation and its territorial waters in particular. Whether they are exploited this year, the year after or in a decade's time is, in many cases at least, irrelevant and certainly not the key point in determining Australia's position and our national interests in this debate. We can rush in, and that seems to be an approach that this government takes, or we can plan in a way which maximises the benefits of our natural resources for all Australians and for the future of this nation. This is a nation which is young now but which we would expect to have a great future.

"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2002-10-15,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the documents.
I would like to briefly comment on the government's response to the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation's final report to the parliament. Overall, the Australian Democrats are very disappointed with what is a minimalist response to a 10-year process. Considering that the council's final report contained only six recommendations and that only part of one of those recommendations has been responded to, we question the adequacy of the government's response to what we regard as one of the most significant social issues confronting Australia, particularly in the last decade. By aiming at the lowest common denominator position on reconciliation, I think that the government has failed to take up the challenges or commit to the implementation of the Roadmap for Reconciliation, developed by the council after 10 years.
We are concerned on two fronts. One is that reconciliation appears to be no longer treated by the Commonwealth as an issue of national importance. Secondly, as a result of its relegation to the too-hard basket by the government, we question whether we can still say with confidence that reconciliation does enjoy full cross-party support in this parliament, as it did 10 years ago when the enabling legislation for the council was passed. As the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Dr Bill Jonas, said, the Howard government's commitment to practical reconciliation means practically nothing to Indigenous Australians. To use his words:
Practical reconciliation amounts to `business as usual'. It involves little innovation or change to service delivery arrangements to address Indigenous marginalisation in a holistic manner. It simply manages the inequality that Indigenous peoples experience, rather than providing a detailed, comprehensive plan for overcoming this disadvantage. It is a cruel illusion of equality that perpetuates Indigenous people's position at the bottom rungs of our society.
In the light of the government's response, it is obvious that it is not prepared to take up the leadership challenges that the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation identified it must if we are to achieve true and lasting reconciliation in this country. I think we have to ask whether the government is prepared to look at enshrining in legislation the principles that are contained in the declaration towards reconciliation and the road map, as recommended by the council. The Commonwealth has publicly distanced itself from the documents of reconciliation and rejected key elements of them. As it has in so many other areas of Indigenous affairs, the government clearly considers it appropriate to cherry pick from the recommendations of the council and to pursue only those that it considers the most benign, inoffensive or risk free. The clear message that can be taken from that is that, for the thousands of Australians who have contributed to the development of these documents over the last decade, their views and aspirations do not count for much. We ought to be asking the question, after all of this time: where are the performance benchmarks and measurable time lines that COAG and MCATSIA were to develop so that we can ensure that real progress is being made towards eliminating Indigenous disadvantage in all its forms? 
You have to ask the question: where is the government's commitment to a time line for a referendum to remove section 25 of the Constitution because of its overtly racist intent? Where is the government's commitment to replacing this provision with a section that will enshrine the principle of nondiscrimination on racial grounds in our national Constitution? And where is the government's preparedness to consider legislation that will facilitate some discussion on bringing about some settlement or treaty to resolve the many matters that stand in the way of reconciliation? 
On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I tabled a private member's bill last year to do precisely this, but neither the government nor the ALP have seen fit to support its passage into legislation. Even where the government has shown some preparedness to step outside the strict confines of practical reconciliation, it is mostly in relation to its recognition of Indigenous protocols—and, even here, recognition is tightly constrained to the incorporation of protocols on certain occasions and for certain ceremonies. At the same time the Commonwealth is not prepared to incorporate Indigenous protocols into the opening ceremony for this parliament, I cannot understand why this parliament—the people's house—is not regarded as an appropriate ceremony at which to acknowledge the important place and status of Indigenous people in the life of the nation, just as the government's own House of Representatives committee had drawn the same conclusion and made that recommendation. It seems to me that we have to take greater steps than we currently have if we are to bring about reconciliation.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2002-10-15,"—I rise to also speak on the Commonwealth government response and the executive summary to the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation final report. In representing the Northern Territory, of which almost 30 per cent of the population is Indigenous people, I find this response extremely disappointing. I am sure that that will be the case for not only the Indigenous people that I represent in the Northern Territory but a great many Australians in this country. I truly cannot believe—after 10 years of work, during which the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation produced some outstanding milestones for this country and attempted to put reconciliation front and centre on the social calendar of this country and to make reconciliation the key plank of the government's platform at the time—the inadequate response of this government to the final report from this council. 
I was one of a number of members of this parliament who attended the final ceremony, for want of a better word—handover and closure—of this council at the end of 2000. This magnificent document that was presented to us, entitled Reconciliation: Australia's challenge, was quite timely, being produced in December 2000. If people remember, it has a magnificent image on the cover of this document of an elderly Indigenous person holding hands with a young Australian, the result of which we saw at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. That emotion and sentiment was captured by the whole of this country during the opening of the Olympic Games, sentiment that has been captured by many citizens around this country in their reconciliation walks—and I participated in the walk over the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and that has been duplicated in many cities around this country. 
People in this land are concerned about reconciliation and it has become a people's movement. No doubt, as a result of this response, it will continue to be a people's movement, because there is a severe lack of leadership from this federal government on reconciliation. This is not a document that provides any sort of leadership, guidance or future hope that this country will truly come to terms with reconciliation and what it means. There were only six recommendations in the final report of this council after 10 years of hard work. As Senator Ridgeway has said, this government has seen to support, and in kind, only one of those recommendations but probably the recommendation that will be the least significant in improving reconciliation and its agenda in this country. To actually agree that section 25 of the Constitution should be dealt with and that it is now irrelevant is something that we all know. Anyone reading the Constitution would see that it would be a matter of course for any government in this day and age to pick that up, take it on board and do something about it. 
This is simply 23 pages of a photocopied document at best, with a very flimsy cardboard cover. It does not go to the heart of the substantial report handed down by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation; it merely restates, as most of the budget documents of this government have, what this government is doing. It is not a genuine attempt to actually come to terms with the findings of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation or an attempt to lay out any sort of map or path to develop this as a social issue in this country. As Fred Chaney said in the press some weeks ago—
 (Senator Bolkus)—Order! Will senators on my right please remain silent. That includes you, Senator McGauran.
—That just shows the kind of feeling this government has towards a significant document such as this. Fred Chaney, the Chairman of Reconciliation Australia, has labelled this report as disappointing. It is disappointing. Once again it is a sad indictment of this government's copybook that the issue of reconciliation is not high on its agenda. (Time expired)

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2002-10-15,"—I rise tonight to briefly place on record a couple of issues. Firstly, I would like to express my most profound sympathy, and that of my staff, to those who have lost loved ones and friends in the Bali massacre. I also wish to express my deepest and heartfelt thoughts for those who are injured, either physically or psychologically, and those who love and care for them. It is, I believe, beyond one's true comprehension as to exactly what those people have experienced and what they have yet to experience. It is a responsibility for all of us not forget them as the days, weeks and months pass and as their pain, their heartache and their sorrow, needless to say, continues.
I wish to make special mention of the Western Australians who have been affected and those families who are still worried about the whereabouts of their loved ones. Everyone hopes and prays for good news no matter how long it takes. To see the grief on the faces of the players from the Kingsley Football Club from the northern suburbs of Perth as they have decided to return home not knowing the fate of some of their fellow players is nothing short of heartbreaking. I wish them well. 
The work of so many is to be commended, I believe. Those with any form of medical or first aid training who have worked tirelessly in Bali—many of them simply as volunteers, though they were up there holidaying and having a great time—have ended up playing a vital part in the treatment of those affected in this tragedy. I commend the members of the Australian Defence Force who have acted swiftly, professionally and compassionately; the medical and nursing staff of Australian hospitals; the ambulance workers; the counsellors; the Australian Red Cross; and the generous spirit of our fellow Australians. The list could go on forever. 
I also want to make special mention of the doctors, nurses and allied health professionals of Perth hospitals, who have left no stone unturned in their diligence to treat the injured. The people who are working around the clock know no time and seek no special recognition. Australians who have queued to give blood, in the hope that it may help, reinforce the true Aussie spirit. There are many unsung heroes who emerge out of such tragedies. There are many people who have simply volunteered their services and many of those people have been at the coalface, dare I say, in Bali, trying to help in any way they can. I think that we owe them a special debt of gratitude because, without them, things for those who have been affected, whether physically in Bali or at home, would have been so much harder.
My contribution tonight is not long but I also wish to make a special comment on and commend the work of Father Brian Morrison in Perth, who, in his typical way, has taken immediate steps to get humanitarian aid dispatched to Bali. He has also met the planes arriving in Perth carrying the injured and met the families of those affected. Father Brian's Crisis Care is legendary in Perth. In fact, Father Brian has been to some horrific war zones throughout the world. When I talked with him this morning it was really quite devastating to hear his account of what he saw when he went out to Perth airport to meet those planes. He has said how devastating a sight it was to see the injured and that there is much that needs to be done, now and in the future, to be of real assistance. 
I would like to place on record our thanks to Father Brian for all that he does for those in need—not just in Perth but around the world—because the cargo that he is sending to Bali is not just for Australians. It is also for those Balinese who, as we know, are in desperate need. So thanks to Father Brian. Channel 9 will probably kill me but, if someone wants to see something special about Father Brian on Channel 9 this Thursday night, just have a look at This Is Your Life and it will tell you how special this guy is. 
I conclude where I started. To all those affected in one form or another in this dreadful tragedy, from a Western Australian and Australian point of view—of course, Western Australia has a particular affiliation with Bali because of our location, and many people fly there for their holidays not just once a year but numerous times a year; many of my friends fly there regularly throughout the year—I say that we are with you in every way possible. If there is anything that any of us can ever do—I know that I speak for my colleagues, and I see Senator Webber from Western Australia in the chamber here tonight—in a most bipartisan way we would be only too happy to be of assistance.
