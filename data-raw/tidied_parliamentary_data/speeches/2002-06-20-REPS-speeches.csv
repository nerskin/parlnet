"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2002-06-20,"—If this House ever needed any evidence of the coalition's betrayal of regional and rural Australia, it got it today in question time. Let me go back just a couple of months. The ink was barely dry on the budget papers before the Howard government ratted again on rural and regional Australia. This matter of public importance contains a simple but very harsh word that aptly describes the way in which regional communities, and in particular their local governments, have been treated yet again by the Howard government. That particular word is `betrayal'. It is not just my word; it is a word that has been used by many communities to describe their anger and dismay at yet again having promises made to them by the Howard government and then being comprehensively dumped after an election.
It took the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and the cabinet only six months after the last election to dud rural and regional Australia yet again. You dudded them, they know it and they will not forget it. Councillor Noel Playford of the Queensland Local Government Association said after your betrayal on the Roads to Recovery Program:
The Howard government now makes three types of commitments: `core, non-core and never to be believed under any circumstances'.
These are not my words but the words of a local councillor. This is not the first time that the Howard government has betrayed rural and regional Australia in a budget. This government has historical form: a serial pattern of betrayal that goes back to the days when it was elected. From the moment it was elected, the Howard government has broken promise after promise to regional communities.
As much as coalition members do not like to be reminded of the fact, let me refresh your memories. You are always wanting to take a trip down memory lane as far as the Labor Party's record in this parliament is concerned. Let me take you down memory lane on your own record.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Corio should be keen to have `you' and `your' expunged from the record here. I would like him to accommodate it.
—The Howard government's first betrayal came after the 1996 election. That was when they abolished the office of regional development and the regional development program after promising rural and regional Australia that they would be retained. The second big betrayal came over Telstra—that famous non-core promise of the Prime Minister that they would not privatise any portion of that great Australian company.
The third betrayal of the Howard government came over the GST. That was the `never, ever' promise. If you made a non-core `never, ever' promise to your kids—and I am talking to the former leader of the New South Wales farmers, Mr Cobb—you would have been in real trouble. Here you have a Prime Minister making non-core `never, ever' promises over the GST.
The fourth betrayal stemmed from that one—the GST's impact on fuel prices. Members of the coalition went throughout rural and regional Australia and they told farmers, workers and households that the price of fuel would come down and so would the price of the goods and services that they consume. Neither of those happened. The government knew that at the time. They deliberately deceived people in rural and regional Australia. They made promises and those promises have been broken. The disturbing feature of the 2002 betrayal is that not only is it the serial nature of the political offence; it is the unbridled display of arrogance by the coalition in believing they can continue to treat rural and regional Australia with utter contempt and without any political ramifications. 
The new betrayal began with this budget. It began with the increase in interest rates and the deficit that the Prime Minister said he would never have in his budget, and it began with the Roads to Recovery program. It has continued with the betrayal on jobs. We had an example of it here in question time today when the Deputy Prime Minister could not even let the minister responsible for the beef quota decision stand up and defend his own decision. What a weak-kneed effort that was. Here was the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, champing at the bit to try to answer the question, and the Deputy Prime Minister got up to try to defend the government's record on jobs in this regard.
The Senate inquiry took evidence on this particular quota matter and said that 5,000 to 7,000 regional jobs will be destroyed as a result of this minister's decision. The honourable member for Parkes was head of the New South Wales Farmers Association when the last decision was made on quotas with EU beef. He was part of the criticism the industry made of this minister over that particular decision, because of the impact it would have on jobs in rural and regional Australia. Now we have an even graver decision with an even greater impact. Nothing is more important to a rural and regional community than the creation of jobs. It is important to the social health of communities and to the economic health of businesses and commerce in those areas. Nothing is more devastating than the destruction of jobs as a direct result of the actions of an incompetent and heartless government. The US beef quota issue is an example of this.
The second betrayal I want to refer to today is the betrayal in the budget. People in rural and regional Australia are going to be affected by Liberal and National Party interest rate increases. People in rural and regional Australia have mortgages and credit cards. They have been hit by Costello's rise in interest rates.
Government members interjecting—
—The honourable members cackle away—that great exercise in political irrelevancy: the National Party. Let me tell you now your constituents are going to suffer because of Liberal interest rate rises. I know you do not want to hear this, but let me remind you what the National Party leader said about the impact of Liberal interest rate rises on farm costs. The Deputy Prime Minister said that every 0.5 per cent increase in interest rates costs farmers $45 million—let alone households or others in rural and regional communities. We had a half a per cent rise before the budget, we have had a half a per cent rise since the budget and we now have a rise of one per cent in the pipeline. That adds up to an increase of $180 million, courtesy of Liberal Party interest rate rises, by the end of the year.
—What about the Labor Party's interest rates?
—You do not like it, do you? You do not like me talking about Liberal interest rate rises. I do not like quoting the Prime Minister because he has such a record of dishonesty, but on this particular matter he was correct. When he was asked on 25 October at the Australian Council of Social Service conference whether he would let the budget go into deficit, he said:
I have made that commitment—
listen to this; this is a good one—
I will repeat it to you this morning, I do not believe that we should go into deficit, and we won't go into deficit if we are re-elected ... Once you start with deficits they get bigger and bigger and you end up with high interest rates ...
What did he do in his first budget? We had a big fat Liberal deficit followed by a Liberal induced interest rate rise. That is what you cannot come to terms with. It has added some $90 million to farm costs and it will impact on households. This government is the biggest taxing government on rural and regional Australians in the history of the Commonwealth. Since the GST, every man, woman and child in rural and regional Australia is being taxed $800 extra. This budget was one of fiddles and pork barrels, but let me tell you this: there are more pork barrels for the National Party in this budget than there are porkers in your local piggery.
The honourable member for McMillan will be taking this up in the debate on this matter of public importance, but let me go to the Roads to Recovery program. As the National Party and coalition members know, roads are indeed the lifeblood of rural communities, as is telecommunications infrastructure. Nowhere is the Howard government's betrayal more comprehensive than in the treatment of the Roads to Recovery program. It is now a matter of history that in the 2002-03 budget the government `rephased' $100 million of the $300 million due to rural and regional councils under the program. Another term that was used was `reprofiling'. It is a bit the same as `non-core' and `never, ever', isn't it? You have rephased $100 million and it has impacted on rural and regional communities. Many councils have been forced to cover the shortfall and they can only do that with the rate rises. They will not be able to meet their contractual obligations and they may be liable for penalties. 
For that great seat and pocket of irrelevancy in the coalition and this House, the National Party, let me read what the local government associations think of you. The Australian Local Government Association expressed its shock and disbelief. They said, `This decision simply beggars belief.' They went on to say:
The Commonwealth has literally pulled the rug from under hundreds of shires and councils across the country.
That is code. They would not say it, but I will: you betrayed them yet again. And they had this to say: `Communities from every federal electorate in the country have been grossly misled.' They were misled by the Prime Minister and the Howard government. The Local Government Association of Queensland said: 
We simply don't accept that we are going to get the money back in two years' time.
Of course, they won't. It is another of your non-core, reprofiling, rephasing promises.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—I remind the member for Corio. He cannot apparently get `you' out of his vocabulary.
—This decision alone has cost us $63 million. We just do not believe the government, given its track record of deceit and broken promises. The Local Government Association of Queensland had this to say:
So much for the Roads to Recovery program. It might be better called `the long winding and never ending Road to Recovery'.
That is what they called the program. That was in your state, honourable member. The Local Government Association of Queensland also said:
This decision illustrates once again why citizens express such contempt for politicians.
In this case, we know whom they are referring to: they are referring to coalition MPs.
The Local Government Association of South Australia said:
On any measure SA Councils get the worst deal in the nation on Federal road funding ... and to have this new allocation cut is rubbing salt into the wounds.
The Local Government Association of New South Wales called it `highway robbery', and said:
Despite this, all program monies must be returned and we are sick of the Government ratting on their election promises.
You have ratted on your promises—
—Member for Corio!
—The Howard government have ratted on their promises to rural and regional Australia. You have comprehensively betrayed your constituents, yet you come in here trying to defend the indefensible. No wonder the National Party now is down to 13 seats. No wonder it is down from its 1987 vote from 11.5 to 5.6. You have betrayed your constituents.

"Cobb, John, MP",NP,2002-06-20,"—Isn't politics a wonderful thing? I thought I had seen everything, but I never expected to see the opposition use as an MPI a question that would have been better fitted as a dorothy dixer for us to show what they did not do and what we have done. I was a bit stunned to see it. I do appreciate the fact that the member for Corio pointed out that I was a past president of the New South Wales Farmers Association. He is right about one thing: they were vitally interested in the GST. But what he needs to remember, and what he should have taken the trouble to find out—if he ever travels away from Geelong in outer Melbourne—is that they were 100 per cent behind the GST. What they did not want was an opposition which ensured that the GST did not apply across everything, therefore making it a damned sight harder to implement and not as efficient as it otherwise would have been. Anybody who wants to question that should go to New Zealand to see how much more efficient a GST can be when it is across everything. This one is working. It could be even better but, thanks to the opposition, it is not. I cannot believe that you want to go through this, but if you do want to go through this exercise—
—The member for Parkes will not use the word `you'.
—My apologies to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, if the opposition are keen to go through this, then so be it. But I think if they learnt what happens in country Australia, the first thing they would realise and understand is that country Australia depends utterly and almost solely, but not quite, on small business. There are a couple of things that small businesses need. The member for Corio mentioned interest rates. What he did not mention was that some farmers went broke. I had neighbours who went out, and I will tell you when they went out. Some of them went out in the late eighties. Do you know why? Because interest rates went well over 20 per cent. Why did they go over 20 per cent? Because the government of the day, the Labor government, pushed Australia's borrowings up to $96 billion. It is very hard for an ordinary small businessman to compete with the federal government in the borrowing market. That is what you do not understand. When you borrow $96 million—
—The word `you' is coming through again.
—I have to concede, I am in error again. Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, can the opposition ever get the basic premise through their heads that small businesspeople cannot compete with $96 billion borrowings? What has been cut down so far by this government, and by paying back $60-odd billion by the end of this session, means that the government does not have to pay over $4 billion in interest. It takes us out of the borrowing market. The best thing this government ever did was get interest rates and inflation down, making it possible for small business to once again get involved in development. When will the opposition ever learn that? Nowhere is that more relevant than in country Australia. If the opposition wants to ask these questions, they have to wear them.
Why don't we just go through a few of them? Look at what has happened in trade in the last six years. Agricultural trade has gone from around $22 billion to $31 billion in six years. Let us talk about production figures. The value of production figures has almost doubled in terms of trade. Let us look at health. If you live in a big town or a small town, the biggest issue in country Australia is health. I am amazed that you want to go through this. No more than 25 per cent of Australians live in country Australia, but 40 per cent of the money put aside for health and aged care in the last budget went to country Australia. In the last six years, $1.2 billion has been spent by this government on country health. What has been promised for the next session will take that to $1.8 billion. The figure for the last 13 years is so reprehensible that I am amazed that the member for Corio wants to draw this to everyone's attention. Can I just talk about a few of those things? Let us talk about doctors. It is very hard for country people to get along without doctors. Let me tell you something: in the 13 years you were in government, the number of doctors that were lost was incredible. 
—The member for Parkes is slipping back into the `you'.
—The number of doctors that the opposition lost was something to behold. In the years from 1997-98 to 2000-01, about 63 more doctors have been located in country Australia. Let me tell you that we have actually got a strategy, something which never occurred when the opposition were in government—13 years, and they did nothing except lose doctors! We have got a strategy that the opposition have never put their minds to to get nurses back into country Australia by way of scholarships and training. There are heaps of nurses out there who need retraining. A lot of money has been put into that—something like $100 million into the training, the scholarships and the retraining. That is the quickest way to get nurses out there.
Let us talk about doctors again. Do you realise that when we took government, after the opposition had been in government for 13 years, the number of rural students in medical schools around Australia was barely eight per cent? Today, that is up to 25 per cent, and there is no permanent solution to that problem other than to get country kids into medical schools. To accuse us of not looking after country Australia when we have tripled the number of country students into medical schools in six years—be it on their heads.
Let us talk about the treatment of people. Did the opposition ever dream of spending $72.5 million on six cancer treatment centres to be located in country Australia? I do not know whether members of the opposition have ever got out there—I am sure that the member for Corio and the member for Batman are not too sure where most of these places are. But I know of people in Hillston who have to travel all the way to Melbourne every week to take their kids for cancer treatment, and being able to travel to Dubbo or elsewhere rather than to the capital city will be the greatest thing that we could ever have done for them.
We have already located specialists in Broken Hill and in Dubbo in my electorate. Neurologists, skin cancer specialists—you name it, they are going out there. When I think of what could have happened in those 13 years, I get very angry, because this did not happen. We have not done it all, but we are facing the problem and we have got a strategy to deal with it. For 13 years, they did not do one thing. The member for Corio might have travelled a little bit of Australia, but he certainly has not seen what is happening or he would not have had the hide to get up and say what he said today.
Let us talk about communications. While health might be the biggest issue out there, communications and the strategy that this government has and will have in the future is what will make it possible for us to go forward. I wonder if the opposition have heard of a thing called CDMA. If they have, they just might stop and think about another mobile system called analog. If they are talking about looking after country regional Australia, it may have escaped their minds that they not only wiped the thing called analog but they sold the broadband—I forget how much for; I think it was half a million dollars. They threw out a very good system. The former Leader of the National Party, Tim Fischer, did a deal with Telstra to get CDMA. 
I will talk to you about my electorate. What has changed? I will tell you how badly we have looked after them. There is mobile phone coverage in the order of 10 or a dozen places where nobody ever dreamt it would exist. Recently, I drove from Ivanhoe—which I am sure the members for Batman and Corio would have a little trouble finding—which is about three hours from Broken Hill and about 10 hours from Sydney. I think you would call it isolated. Do you know that, while driving from Ivanhoe—about 150 kilometres from Hillston, about another 100 kilometres to a place called Lake Cargelligo and another 100 kilometres to my home, which is 100 kilometres to the nearest town—only for a very short time in that whole trip was I out of mobile coverage? That is something that I do not think we ever saw the previous government look at doing.
—So how come Stewie lost his seat? That is an example of the success of your government!
—Could I stay with communications for a while?
—Member for Batman! You'll be thrown out!
—I think it is worth exploring communications a bit further. The member for Batman and the member for Corio are getting a little excited. The trouble is that they started this, and now they do not like what they are hearing. But the truth is that those people in the outer extended zone of Australia—if the member for Batman and the member for Corio ever knew they existed, they have certainly forgotten them—have now got two-way radio coverage for their phones, which was put on for them absolutely free. Under Networking the Nation, with the mobile phones they have got, with the two-way satellites they have got—on broadband, I might add—they have communications equal to the best that people in Sydney and Melbourne have got, and I think they are the only two places that the previous government knew existed.
If they want to go on about this and bring up dorothy dixers which only make them look as totally ignorant of rural or country Australia as they are, then on their heads be it—but these are the facts. Let's talk about roads. The member for Corio was on about Networking the Nation. It is not that strange that people have reacted so strongly and so warmly to Networking the Nation, because it is the first time in 20-odd years that a federal government stood up and said, `It's time we put some funding into roads—for country roads and for local roads—and if the state governments, who are responsible for these issues won't do it, we'll do it.' Yes, we did have to put $100 million off for two years, but it has not left them. The reason the opposition, and especially the member for Corio, are so anxious and excited about Roads to Recovery is that they wish they had had the courage to do it themselves, to stand up against the members from Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney and put that funding where it should go—and where it is going. 
Can I also talk about the government financial assistance grants? I will just pull out one example, the shire of Bland in the south of my electorate. Its funding from 1996 to 2001 went up by 30 per cent, which is pretty much the average figure right across my electorate. We are putting money into roads—we are not talking about the absolute lack of caring for country Australia—we are doing it. I would like to talk about Regional Solutions for a moment. There were some incredible statements about rorting Regional Solutions. Let me tell you that I will be in there for everything I can get for my electorate. I will tell you something else that I am sure will be of interest to the opposition. The member for Charlton said, `It's a rip-off; it's a rort—I haven't got any of it.' The member for Charlton got 100 per cent of everything she applied for in her region.
—I did not.
—She did not apply for one cent—
—I did not.
—The member for Charlton is not in her place and is grossly disorderly when she interjects.
—Never!
—You are not allowed to interject.
—That member got everything she applied for; she did not apply for one cent.
—Ask about the pipeline.
—The member for Ballarat!
—She does not give a damn about her electorate. We applied nous and we got the money. Can I talk about Black Spot Programs? 
—There is a big hole where the member for Parkes sits.
—They apply to roads and mobile phones. I can tell you six towns in my electorate are going to get at least three or four TV stations.
—The member for Batman, if you continue to ignore the chair you will be dealt with.
—I would really love to tell you about their cohorts in state government who are making life for country people totally impossible and totally uneconomical. If you bring these questions up, you have got to wear the answers.

"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,2002-06-20,"—You only have to look at the level of representation of the National Party in this place to realise that this is not a political party that can ever hope to represent the aspirations of rural and regional Australia. In my electorate there used to be a time when the Country Party represented the people of McMillan. They have now been reduced to being 2.5 per cent of the vote in the electorate of McMillan. The reason that they get 2.5 per cent of the vote is because of the level of representation that we see in parliament here today. They are a gaggle of dullards over there. They used to always say that the most important thing in farm families was making sure that you had the best person to manage the farm as the farm went from succession to succession. Obviously, in farm families they are pretty keen to make sure that the smartest person stays on and manages the farm—and that is why we end up with the dumbest people from those farm families entering the parliament as National Party MPs. They are an embarrassment to their communities and they are an embarrassment to this parliament.
It was not that long ago that we had the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, standing up in this place saying that there was no clear constitutional role for the involvement of the Commonwealth government in regional development policy. He believes that the Commonwealth should get out of regional development. Despite the money that they might announce, that is still what he believes. He sees that there might be some way in which the Commonwealth government might provide money to regional communities, but only on the basis that they might be able to get a vote out of it. They are not interested in the people; they are interested in the politics of it—the grubby politics of preserving non-performing National Party MPs. In the course of the last three or four years, they announced a couple of specific grants to certain areas in Australia. They have not done this based on need and they have not done this based on merit. They have employed the basic old Country Party thinking which is all about the pork barrel. Cut off a bit of pork—
—The porkers are out of the barrel.
—The member for Braddon, you have already been warned.
—throw it to a community in need and try to distract them from the main game. They try to distract communities from focusing on those essential services which they need by trying to put a little bit of grubby money around, to try to make sure that communities are not able to make the decisions that they need to make in relation to communities based on the delivery of government programs—not based on the pork barrel, the money which they wheel out just before an election.  
Over the last three or four years, we have seen repeated examples of this. My community, the people of the Latrobe Valley in the electorate of McMillan, have been identified repeatedly as being amongst the most needy in the Australian nation. What have we got from the federal government? Nothing; we have not received a dollar from these people. And in that period of time, when they have denied any support to the people of the Latrobe Valley, one of the most needy communities in Australia, they have seen fit to give $10 million to Newcastle and they have given $3.5 million to the people of Eden when their cannery closed. However, the people of the Latrobe Valley—the community which was identified in the Productivity Commission inquiry into the impact of NCP on rural and regional areas as the most disadvantaged of all of the 42 regions that were modelled—have received not a dollar for our community. When our community needed help over that time, we did not receive a dollar. However, the electorate of Wide Bay—or as I should say, `wide pay' or `bribe bay', as it has come to be called—is represented in this place by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. That community does have some needs which need to be addressed, but it should not get support while people in need in the Latrobe Valley do not get a dollar. 
On this side of the House we have an approach to rural and regional development policy which focuses the most government resources on those areas most in need, not on those areas which just happen to be in a coalition-held seat or happen to be represented by a National Party minister. Those of us on this side of the House who represent rural districts are interested in people and communities, not grubby internal politics which is all about trying to prop up poor-performing National Party MPs. We are interested in people and communities and trying to make sure that those people in need get the support that they want.
I put the government on notice: we will chase them down every last burrow after every bit of pork every time they allocate funding inappropriately. It is unacceptable. We know that there exist out there substantial parts of rural and regional Australia which are suffering massive disadvantage. These areas have been identified by government report after government report. The government is aware of these areas which have been identified and continues to obfuscate and not take direct action to support these communities, which are desperately in need.
Jesuit Social Services have done important work in identifying those communities which are particularly disadvantaged, through their works Unequal in life and Unequal in health. There has been no formal response from the federal government to either of those important inquiries by that well-respected centre. If the government were serious about doing something for these struggling regional parts of Australia they would not just put in place small programs like their so-called Stronger Regions program, which is a mere $100 million over three years. They would sit down with those communities immediately and do something directly to assist those communities. They would not just establish another committee and put in place a process which runs for months and years. They would say, `We know you've got a problem right now. We're coming there, we're going to meet with the community and industry, and we're going to make something happen now—not in 12 months or two or three years; we're going to do it now because you are in need now.'
That is the difference between us and them. We see a problem and we want to fix it; over on that side they see a problem, sit on it, and try and find some political opportunity—some way to try and prop up poor-performing National Party MPs. That is all rural and regional Australia is to them: a way of propping up their vote and trying to sustain poor-performing National Party MPs instead of tackling those problems and doing something directly to turn around the disadvantage which exists in rural and regional communities—and it exists particularly acutely in some of those communities.
The government have announced eight different areas which will receive $4 million over three years under the Sustainable Regions program. Nearly all of those areas are Liberal and National Party areas. The eight regional TradeStart offices which were announced by the government all went—except for one in the electorate of the member for Corio—to Liberal and National Party electorates. So, where they have an opportunity to try to put some public policy measures in place to help rural and regional Australia, instead of focusing the most resources on those areas most in need they focus the resources on wherever it is that they need to reward a political mate. They put the resources wherever it is that they need to try and prop up a poor-performing coalition MP. 
On this side of the House we think that is an appalling approach to take to rural and regional Australia. We think that is a contemptible approach to take. On this side of the House we do not think that you should have one policy for people in the city and one policy for those people who live outside the metropolitan area. We think that you should have policies specifically designed for those communities as they exist in the city and as they exist in the country. We think that the approach which the government has taken is contemptible; it is all about trying to play one regional community off against another rather than putting the most resources where the most need is. On this side of the House we believe that the greatest amount of government resources should go to those areas most in need; on that side of the House they think that the resources should go where there is a political need.
We stand opposed to that point of view and we put them on notice today: where we see pork-barrelling and this contemptible approach to rural and regional Australia we will hold these people to account. We will make sure that people in rural and regional Australia get the support that they need and do not have to put up with the grubby political pork-barrelling that we have seen from the gaggle of dullards now representing the National Party in this place. People in rural and regional Australia deserve better than that. The level of representation which they receive from the National Party is abysmal and that is why they got 2½ per cent of the vote in the election.

"Hawker, David, MP",LP,2002-06-20,"—I almost felt sorry for the previous speaker. The poor member for McMillan had obviously run out of material; the frivolous repetition that went on and on towards the end of that speech was a sad reflection on his preparation. When you look at what he had to say, it basically boiled down to personal insults and hollow rhetoric. My other observation is that if, as he claims—and who am I to doubt him, because he knows his area better than anyone—he has got nothing for the Latrobe Valley then, sadly, that is a reflection on the quality of the member, because obviously he is not trying. Maybe he ought to do a reality check on who holds the seats in the country and why there might be a majority of seats held by the coalition, with the result that they are getting a lot of this funding.
When I looked at this MPI I had to pinch myself. I thought: are they serious in putting up something like this? Then I thought that maybe the member for Corio had been put in here to try and divert attention from the problems of the Labor Party. He was obviously prepared to come in here and do this knowing that he was going to get not one but two black eyes by putting up this sort of motion. Then, of course, it was obvious. I picked up the Australian today and there it was, the headline `Labor has lost its way.' And who said this? The byline reads:
Barry Jones says party is doomed without reforms.
That is obviously why the member for Corio was sent in here to try and arrange this diversion. Clearly, the brains trust of the Labor Party could see that today was yet another bad day and that they might as well try and divert attention, no matter how frivolous the MPI. 
Question time only reinforced that when we listened to the type of questions that were being put up. Every time they got an answer it was clear that the Labor Party had some major problems. That I guess is why the member for Corio came in here. But I just want to take up five of the points that the member for Corio based his MPI on because each one of them can be knocked over very simply. He seemed so desperate to get up and say anything that he never bothered at any stage to get his facts right. Let us look at them one by one.
He talked about the GST and the electors not knowing about it. Let me remind the member for Corio that in the lead-up to the 1998 election we went to great lengths to make sure that voters knew before the election that if they voted for the coalition there would be tax reform. In fact, we went to such lengths that the Labor Party were whingeing that we were spending too much money putting out material explaining what tax reform was all about. To say that the electors were not told before the election what would happen if the coalition was re-elected really was completely out of court.
The second point he talked about was fuel and fuel taxes. Let me remind the member for Corio about fuel taxes. It was this government that got rid of Labor's indexation of fuel excise. Labor put in fuel excise and ramped up the tax over its time in government. We have frozen that. But we have gone further than that. With the tax reform not only have we got rid of the indexation but we have also reduced the cost of diesel for heavy transport, directly benefiting people in the country. So we now have the situation that, while there is a 38c-a-litre fuel excise, heavy transport only pays about 18½c a litre. In other words, we have taken all that tax off—all that tax that Labor was putting as a direct cost on people in the country, because every time you have to move goods to or from the country you have to use transport.
If we look at the third point, he has made some comment about roads. Who brought in Roads to Recovery? The coalition. And the coalition will continue Roads to Recovery. It is a four-year program. We have made the commitment and it will continue. But it was a new program. It was nothing to do with Labor. He was trying to criticise it as though it was something to do with the Labor Party. The Labor Party did nothing; absolutely nothing. It was the coalition that brought that in.
The fourth point—and I must admit I could not believe it when the member for Corio brought this up—was him mentioning something about jobs. Can I remind the member for Corio that since this government has come in the unemployment rate has been falling? It has been falling in my region for well over 12 months. In every month now the statistics come out and show that it is falling. That is happening in many parts of regional Australia and it is certainly happening right across Australia. The unemployment rate is falling and if you look at the small area labour market figures you will see the number of people in work is actually rising in the regions too. Again, he has not bothered to look at his facts.
On the fifth point—and again it is very hard to believe how the member for Corio could come in here and have a straight face when he makes these statements—he mentioned something about interest rates. Some of us do remember interest rates under the Labor Party. We remember when they got up to 20 per cent. We remember all the small businesses and farmers who got burnt by the Labor interest rates. The interest rates today are the lowest they have been in 30 years. He could not even get the recent two small rises in interest rates right. I really think that the member for Corio should have done his homework a lot more before he came in. It seems most unfortunate that he did not bother to get his facts right.
I would like to bring up a few more points now because I think that the coalition government has a very proud record when it comes to looking after rural and regional Australia. I think the reforms that have been brought in right across the board have directly benefited the country. They have directly countered some of the disadvantage that occurred under Labor. There is no doubt that the benefits have been substantial and that they are ongoing. I mentioned tax reform in the case of fuel tax but it goes much further than that. If we look at what tax reform was all about with the new tax system, it was directly to benefit exporters. Exporters have seen billions of dollars taken off their taxes and with that new system people in the country—who are a very large part of the export effort of Australia—have been direct beneficiaries. So when you look at that point the reforms have had a very big effect. 
We can go to the next area, which is the waterfront and industrial relations reform. It was this government, the coalition government, that cleaned up the waterfront. Remember all the difficulties we had with the Labor Party when they could not get away from the union bosses telling them what to do? Nowadays we see those reforms really working. Who benefits again? People in the country. I think the member for Corio ought to have done a bit of homework before he ever bothered to bring in this motion because by any measure he has made himself look pretty ignorant.
I have mentioned the value of economic management. As the Treasurer pointed out earlier today in question time, we have the lowest interest rates in 30 years. Inflation is down. We can remember inflation under Labor and we remember the damage that did. We remember the damage under Labor. Look at all the work that is happening, as I mentioned, in infrastructure with the improvement in roads.
I am watching the time. I am having trouble getting through all the things that the government has done for country Australia. Let us have a look at the environment. Labor used to try and kid themselves about their environmental credentials. This government has actually done it with the Natural Heritage Trust funding and with the work that we are doing on salinity. We have doubled the amount of dollars going into environmental work particularly in the regions but right across Australia. We are a government that is actually getting out there and doing it. With this national action plan, the work we are doing on salinity, we are tackling one of the great environmental problems of this nation. It has taken a coalition government, a Liberal-National government, to recognise what is really needed in the country. Maybe that might be why, the member for Corio and the member for McMillan ought to realise, the coalition holds nearly every seat in the country. It is because we understand it.
We look at what the Regional Solutions Program has done—some fantastic things. Then we look at the Rural Transaction Centres, which address some of the problems which Labor could never address. We look at things like Medicare Easyclaim reporting. Labor would not have anything to do with these sorts of things. Look at what increased border protection is going to do to in trying to maintain our clean, green status for all our exports. By any measure, whatever way you look at it, this is a government that is doing something for the country. I do not understand why the member for Corio was ever allowed to put up that MPI, because by any measure he has made himself look a complete fool. It is the coalition that is looking after the country and it was Labor that betrayed the country.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Howard Government: Rural and Regional Australia</title>,Matters of Public Importance,13,1
"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2002-06-20,"—I think it is important that these sorts of issues are raised in the parliament. It is a great shame that country issues do not get more prominence amongst the issues that are raised here. It is a great shame that there are very few country representatives in the parliament to actually listen to the debate. Before making my contribution, I will mention that I was delighted to see the former member for New England as an adviser in the chamber again today. It is only the second time I have seen him since three days before the election outcome, and the first time was yesterday. It is good to see that he is still alive.
Looking at the general debate that has taken place here, it is no wonder that country people are looking for alternative representation. I was very disappointed in what the member for Parkes had to say—it was just a programmed event that has been fed into him and it is being regurgitated. In equal terms, the Labor Party as well has degenerated into debating who did what, who scored the highest interest rates, who scored this and who scored that. That type of debate surrounds all country issues that are debated in here. Country people are a bit more interested in the future than in who did what 10 or 15 years ago or what happened in 1992.
I think country people are searching for different representation, particularly at a time when the two major parties are the Liberal Party and the Labor Party; obviously, country Labor and the National Party are just appendages to those two major groups and they do not really have any influence in the outcomes. We have reached a stage over the last decade where both major parties have agreed on a common economic agenda, and that is unique in our political history. That is why the debates that take place in here surround the marginal adjustments—who created what and when was unemployment going up and down.
The underlying economic framework that was established in the early 1990s through the Labor Party and that has been fed through the system through various arrangements—COAG, ARMCANZ and the other institutional arrangements that have been put in place over the last decade—actually presents to country people in particular an identical twin in terms of the policy arrangements. That is one of the great problems that country people face—they look at the two major groups and they see the same outcomes. Whether it be at a state level or at federal level, if you actually take the time to look behind the veneer, they are very similar policies. The people who have paid for that have been country people, in the main.
There has been massive population decline. The Deputy Prime Minister, for instance, keeps telling his electorate that he has his hands on the levers, that he is in charge of the show and that nobody else can have any influence, but his electorate has had the greatest population decline of any region in Australia other than Tasmania. I guess that says something about the Tasmanian representatives in here. 
—They are all Labor!
—That is possibly right, too. But it says something about the influence that the National Party has had on the agenda. The agenda has been shrinkage of population, and that is something that has to be stopped. If the existing parties will not do it, they will find that alternative representation will come into this place.
You see it in a whole range of areas. Even yesterday it was raised in the Main Committee that we need greater flexibility in a lot of the policy arrangements—in aged care policy, for instance. If you do not start to ensure that people in smaller and medium sized communities have access to aged care, they will leave those communities in their early 40s and establish themselves and their families in other areas where aged care may be available. There is a lack of flexibility in terms of those particular policies, but it flows across a whole range of things. In regional airline policy we can see what is happening Australia wide at the moment. There is a range of indicators out there, all expressing the same thing—they are deriving their death from the same thing.
The economic policy that the Liberal and Labor parties have agreed on and that lack of flexibility are geared around what I would call—particularly after today's question time—the feedlot mentality. We have adopted a mentality that does not fit Australia's geography, in my view, and it should not fit its geography. It is a mentality which says that, to deliver the highest number of resources to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible cost, you must concentrate those people into feedlots. Where possible—I mentioned this the other day, as well—you use gravity to help get rid of some of the refuse. That is a cost-effective community. That is an appalling society to be imposing upon a nation of this size and magnitude, but that is the common policy that both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party have.
Tragically, in my view, the National Party have allowed that policy to operate. They are allowing it to happen now. They have the balance of power in this parliament and they are doing absolutely nothing about it. The member for Parkes virtually betrayed the farmers of New South Wales—and this issue is about betrayal—during his custodianship of the New South Wales Farmers Association. I used to be in that association and I was a proud member of it, but it was absolutely destroyed by the politicisation that that particular character delivered to it. To have him as the major speaker representing the National Party in this place is, I think, an absolute disgrace and an indicator of where they have actually come to.
There are a few other issues that I would like to raise. On Telstra, the key word in this matter of public importance, I think, is betrayal. I will not go that far. But I think that if the government sell Telstra they have betrayed country people. One of the great problems, and probably the reason that I am in this parliament at the moment, is that my predecessor and others in regional Australia have not bothered to listen. If anybody in regional Australia, be it Ron Boswell, John Anderson or whoever, believes that country people want Telstra sold—and I appeal to the people in the Senate—they have got real mental adjustments to make. Any reasonable poll that was done would indicate that over 85 per cent of country people, other than the political playmakers, do not want Telstra sold. So I would argue: do not let that happen. If that happens then that indicates they are being really taken for granted and really betrayed by this parliament.
The doctor issue is another issue that I think needs some discussion. In the recent budget, we had the appalling situation where the use of Medicare provider numbers and differential Medicare rebates was used to help drive doctors into Western Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane et cetera. What that is actually doing is driving doctors out of the country. The Deputy Prime Minister virtually condemned me here—I think on the first question I asked—when I raised the use of Medicare provider numbers and differential rebates to encourage doctors into country areas. They would not do it for the country people, but they are doing it for Western Sydney. We wonder where the $100 million went from Roads to Recovery. Well, $80 million of it went into Western Sydney and Western Melbourne. I understand the political imperatives of doing that, but do not have the hide to say to country people that you are in there fighting for them when you are siphoning that money off to create some winnable situations in Western Sydney. What that says is that you are taking those people for granted in terms of their electoral capacity. The presence of three country Independents in this parliament demonstrates that they will not be taken for granted, either by the Liberal Party or the Labor Party into the future. I think there are some key indicators there. 
In conclusion, I am very pleased that the member for Parkes did speak, because next week I intend to move to suspend the standing orders to bring on a motion and I hope that the Labor Party and the country members in this parliament will support it. I will read it, if I may. It says: 
That in light of the NSW Farmers Association City-Country Snapshot Report showing the growing divide between city and country and the new 10 year discriminatory US Farm Bill, this House discusses as a matter of urgency the adoption of the zonal taxation proposals as put forward by the National Farmers Federation, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Local Government Association as a way of overcoming the population drift, economic decline and inequity of services in country Australia. 
I ask that this parliament allow that motion to come forward. It has been on the Notice Paper for some weeks now and I would be delighted to have a real debate about it, where all country members could participate. I ask those who purport to represent country people to support that suspension of standing orders next week.
 (Mr Jenkins)—Order! The discussion is now concluded.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Howard Government: Rural and Regional Australia</title>,Matters of Public Importance,13,1
"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2002-06-20,"—Here we are, debating the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002, one of the prodigal children of a former bill that failed in the Senate—the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill, which went down the chute in 1999. What did the government do? Having put that bill forward, having rammed it through this House—as they ram through so many of their bills—it went to the Senate, the Senate committee looked at it, they made a determination in regard to it, there was a vote, it got knocked over. Instead of accepting that, the government chose to break this bill into a number of elements. Instead of seeing it as cognate or one job lot, they probably thought that if they could break it into a series of elements—eight, 10 or 12—they would be able to do two things, one of which was to beef up their legislative program, which is pretty narrow and pretty slim, because they would have eight, 10 or 12 bills to put through instead of one to get knocked over. It is a bit like the Internet. If you want to send stuff from one place to another, maybe it is better to use packet-switching, where you send little bits off at a time and hope they all arrive at the one point and get reassembled. My guess, though, is that when this bill gets shunted through this House shortly we will have a situation where the Senate will have another look at it and they will knock it over again. Why do I think that? Labor's attitude towards this bill is that there is no real difference between the More Jobs, Better Pay bill and aspects of that bill relating to secret ballots, and this bill. I think the Democrats and others in the Senate will probably take the same attitude.
In his second reading speech the minister said that a vast set of changes had been put forward in this bill, that the whole landscape had changed really and that they had even taken up a suggestion by the International Labour Organisation. You would not normally expect that to happen but, when the Treasurer, Mr Costello, is day after day quoting the Hon. P.J. Keating and his arguments from 1990, you know they are fairly desperate and you know that they have got to cast around to try to build their arguments up. In that case, he has chosen an authoritative source. But going to the ILO to seek to try to bolster their argument is very strange for this anti-union, anti-worker government. If you have a look at what is supposed to be so significant in terms of the changes to this bill, the Bills Digest, which I will refer to in a number of places, is very useful. Page 13 deals with the comparison of the bill, and the second point they make relates to the ILO. For an eligible poll, in the previous More Jobs, Better Pay bill you had to have 50 per cent of the work force in an enterprise voting in order for it to be a quorum. They had a talk to the ILO, and the ILO said that the normal quorum is about 40 per cent. So the government have made that change to this bill. Big deal. Is it really substantial? We do not think so. 
What is the second change they have made? This one is a bit weird. In order to not leave out people who are not unionised, to allow non-unionised employees to have a bit of a go at the secret ballot, they have introduced some kind of mechanism which really says: `There's no direct representative here. We can't actually go to a union. We have got a series of people who haven't got a single representative. They haven't got a designated agent. How do we find if they actually want to have a secret ballot? We will go and ballot them to find out.' So we have got a ballot in order to have a ballot. That is basically the only other provision, even though it is not fully spelt out within this bill.
So between what was there before and what is here now, the Labor Party have had a look at it and said, effectively: `Sorry, boys. There is no substantial change in regard to this, and our fundamental view, expressed in this House as that original bill was going through and expressed in the Labor Senate majority report, is that this bill, one of the bills sired by the original failed bill, should be given the flick as well.' The core reason is that what this bill seeks is already in the current Workplace Relations Act. There is only one difference in terms of what the government really requires, and that is to make it compulsory to have a ballot before you go to protected action, to make it more difficult to actually deal with solving industrial disputes.
I will start looking at some of the provisions in regard to this by quoting the second reading speech of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and his summation of what this is all about. The summation, the lead-up and the intro to it give you a good indication of just where this government is at and where this minister is at. We know the broader context: four months to actually reconvene a parliament and when we got here virtually no legislation organised—they had to scrabble for almost a month to get some material into the House—but, right at the start, it was flagged by the minister that a major part of the government's preparation for the next election would be an anti-union series of legislative measures. This is but one of them, and I have spoken on a number of others already. The minister said:
A secret ballot is a fair, effective and simple process for determining whether a group of employees at a workplace want to take industrial action. 
A simple enough statement. He continues:
It will ensure that the right to protected industrial action is not abused by union officials pushing agendas unrelated to the workers at the workplace concerned.
That is what this bill is about. It is about ensuring that union officials will not mislead people in the workplace and will not try to do things are not really related to workplace concerns. This sort of attitude has got a long history. It is at the very core of the approach of the coalition—not just the coalition now but the coalition in all of its phases and all of its modulations over time, and I will have a bit of a look at that in a moment.
When you go to the core of this in terms of a justification, this is about being anti-union and trying to stop people in the workplace from taking protected action without going through the full process and making sure you have a secret ballot before any protected action can take place. It is about putting inflexibility into the industrial relations system, not trying to make it easier to work or any better. If you turn this around, the government is pushing its agenda of being against unions and trying to typify unions as being those who push and try to lead the work force astray. What do we find when we look at the record of what has been happening? There has been a whole stack of applications for variations to workplace conditions; year after year, members of the work force have indicated that they want to undertake an activity.
A table entitled `Orders for secret ballots and applications to AIRC to initiate bargaining period' appears at page 7 of the Bills Digest and it outlines that, in 1996-97, there were 4,300 applications—which is a lot. But how many orders for secret ballots were there? Mr Deputy Speaker, you would expect that, out of 4,300 applications, a pretty big number would result in secret ballots, given that the Industrial Relations Commission can, at its whim, under section 135 of the act, determine that a secret ballot is necessary in order to determine the attitude of the workers in an enterprise to see whether or not they should go ahead with protected action. You would expect a pretty big number—maybe a quarter of that; maybe just over 1,000 would be a reasonable guess. If you were pretty conservative, you could say there might be only 500. When we look at the table, we find there were two. I hesitate to make a visual gesture in the House, but there were just two secret ballot orders.
—You are pointing in the right direction!
—I am pointing in the right direction; that is true. In the next year, there were 6,613 applications for a bargaining period. The number went up substantially; it tripled. There were actually six orders for secret ballots. When we go through the following years, we find that in 1998-99 there were 5,779 applications, in 1999-2000 there were 9,640 and in 2000-01 the number dropped to 6,625. And how many secret ballots were there? In 1998-99 there was one, in 1999-2000 there were two and in 2000-01 there was just one secret ballot ordered out of 6,625 applications for a bargaining period. What does that tell us? It tells us that the Labor Party's attitude towards this legislation is pretty much on the money. It tells us that the conciliation and arbitration system that has operated in this country since it was set up after the Harvester judgment has actually worked reasonably well, even with all the belting that this government has given it since 1996. It says that the commission has the ability, under section 135, to initiate a secret ballot if it thinks there is any doubt about what the work force think. Under section 136, an employer or a union or a group of employees can ask for a secret ballot to be initiated. 
But in the bill before us today, the government's amendment is to completely excise section 136. This is a government of excision. It wants to take lots of things out—not only islands; it also wants to take sections out of the existing legislation to take away the right of employees, unionists and employers to seek to have a secret ballot. Looking at the practice in the industrial relations system and at the comparison, it is startlingly obvious that a secret ballot does not need to be ordered for every one of those applications. What does this government intend instead? What does it say it has to drive at? I quote the minister:
Australia has previously had provisions allowing secret ballots at the federal level—
here is the really important bit—
but they have not been a compulsory precondition to industrial action.
That is the whole point of this bill. I will say it again:
but they have not been a compulsory precondition to industrial action.
This group of compulsive obsessives, or obsessive compulsives, are utterly attached to the notion that if you strangle the whole conciliation process and the whole negotiation process, you can strangle the life out of industrial action—there just will not be any, because their expectation is that workers will never go on strike and they will never take protected action if their real motives, beliefs and understandings can be divined. They think that unions, generally, are not just primarily concerned with the wages and conditions in an enterprise or across enterprises; they are really concerned about other things. What they have found in the secret ballots that have been undertaken is that workers pretty well understand what their terms of employment, wages and conditions are. They pretty well understand what is being put up by the employer. They pretty much understand, too, that in regard to this the Labor Party is standing in defence of all of those employees and unionists who want to have their say in a determination of what their wages and working conditions should be and want to have their say untrammelled by government intervention to make sure that the industrial relations system does not work—because if you cement in inflexibility, it will not work. If you took 9,640 applications for a bargaining period, and if every one of those led to protected action, there would be 9,640 ballots to find out whether you would go ahead. Would 85 per cent of the cost of that be put forward by the Commonwealth? The ACTU is not an organisation that the government are enamoured of. They might have got fairly close with the ILO recently and taken up one of their points, but they are not really close to the ACTU.
The ACTU's position on this is pretty balanced and reasonable. They make a significant point on one key issue: if you look along the government frontbench—of course, it is devoid of members now because question time is over and we have only got a minister at the table—and look right through their backbench, I am sorry to say that it is full of lawyers. You know what they are like and you know what they are up to: they tend to have a legalistic approach, particularly to the question of industrial relations matters. We know what the background of the current minister is; we know what the background of the former minister for workplace relations was; we know that the Prime Minister is a little suburban solicitor. That is his background, and it was the former minister's background, and that tends to narrow their thinking in relation to these issues. The ACTU states:
... this is part of a general thrust by the Government to create a legislative framework in which legal action is the only possible response by employers to unprotected industrial action, rather than encouraging the use of Commission processes to resolve the dispute which has given rise to the industrial action.
That is pretty accurate. The ACTU and its constituent unions are pretty experienced when it comes to industrial relations matters. They are actually supportive of the Industrial Relations Commission. They can work those systems to the benefit of their constituents, and can do so because there is still some room to move. There is still some flexibility and some negotiation and conciliation processes left there. This government does not really want an AIRC. They do not want any action at all. They have a simple belief that the problems will all go away if they just lock it up legally and ensure that action cannot take place. The minister has taken the British examples; he has tried to indicate that this is the best way to go. 
I go to the other key point the ACTU makes, which again is fairly balanced. They say that secret ballots really have very little to do with democratic functioning—although so much is made of that within the comments of the minister—and that they have:
... everything to do with restricting the right to strike. Further evidence is provided by the lack of any support for proposals such as compulsory secret postal shareholder votes on issues such as takeovers, or whether or not a company should lock-out its employees.
That is pretty accurate and it is a pretty good argument. Where is the action by this government, anywhere, to ensure shareholder democracy? This is a question in the industrial relations area of `workholder' democracy. The people who have the jobs, who hold them and who work have a right to express their view whether it is orally or in writing through a secret ballot process. But we cannot see the government campaigning hard to impose that on companies. They certainly did not impose it on FAI. They did not impose it on HIH—maybe if they had they might have got a better result in regard to the demise of the HIH insurance business, with all the ramifications since. This government will not lead the charge in terms of holding companies to account within the Australian workplace. They will not hold employers to account. They will not have an even and balanced approach to it; they will just have a partial and ideological one. 
This bill has a fair history: going back to 1928, to start with, section 56 of the then act transmuted over time in 1947 and 1956 to section 75 and a couple of other subsections over time. In all of those iterations, the ability of the Industrial Relations Commission to order a secret ballot was underlined by conservative governments. They tried to put more inflexibility into the system. But it takes a Howard conservative government to try to make sure that before any protected action takes place at all you have to have a secret ballot, that you have to have no room to move, that you have to have no flexibility whatsoever, that you have to live in a closeted world, closed in; one where you do not let employers and employees sit down across both sides of the table and allow the AIRC to conciliate the situation. They have no real fundamental understanding of the mechanics and the behaviours within the industrial relations system.
Taking a legalistic approach to this bill fails because it is not real. You would think that the conservative side after so many years might have finally got the message that this bill is ideological, impractical and unreasonable, and directed towards a political outcome rather than a practical outcome. For those reasons, and because it lacks balance, and because it is not sensible, and because it does not advance workplace democracy, we condemn it and we will vote against it.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (SECRET BALLOTS FOR PROTECTED ACTION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Hull, Kay, MP",NP,2002-06-20,"—I rise to support the minister on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002 and to put forth my views in support of it. In doing so I would like to thank Heidi for her great contribution to this debate. The bill proposes that, in order for industrial action to be protected action under the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1999, it must be preceded by a secret ballot process that approves the taking of the action. What makes it even better is that the process is very legitimate as it has been overseen by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The secret ballot process proposed by this bill removes the position of intimidation. Workers as individuals have a right to security. They do not want to be manipulated into taking or not taking industrial action by union officials with a hidden agenda. That agenda would most likely be entirely different to the objective of the workers and to the workplace concerned. It would likely be entirely different, and be misleading and not necessarily what the union members want.
Under the new provisions of this act, a union or an employee would be required to apply to the commission for an order that a protected action ballot be held. Included in the bill are proposed amendments and new provisions to ensure that, where employees wish to initiate a bargaining period or apply for a protected action ballot order, they may have their identity protected by doing so through an agent. I support the bill because it provides a true outcome. Because it would be a secret ballot, workers would not be afraid to vote how they want to on whether to take industrial action. They would be honest in their voting and would not be swayed or victimised by fellow workers, union officials or employers prior to or following the voting procedure. Currently, workers not only risk intimidation or alienation but they also fear losing their jobs or incurring a drop in pay if they decide to strike. They could even face having to work in tougher conditions.
Much has been made of employees' and unions' actions but little has been said about how a worker feels when an employer decides to put pressure on a worker to change their thought focus on industrial action. If this bill were in place, workers would vote according to their own heart's desire and not according to someone else's. They would have no fears and would be able to feel comfortable in their decision, knowing that it was anonymous to others. I agree with the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations that the secret ballot process will enhance freedom of choice for workers. Secret ballots will not impede access to lawful, protected action but will simply provide a mechanism to ensure that protected action is the genuine choice of the employers and employees involved.
The provisions of this bill are intended to ensure that protected industrial action is not used as a substitute for genuine discussions during a bargaining period and to ensure that the final decision to take industrial action is made by the employees directly concerned and no-one else. This bill assists in the prevention of unnecessary strikes, which in turn prevents the loss of jobs. The commission would not be able to order a ballot unless a bargaining period was in place and the applicant had been genuinely negotiating to reach an agreement—in other words, industrial disputes or strikes would not be as easily obtained, and agreements could be reached before it gets that far.
Under the bill's provisions, industrial action would be authorised by a ballot if at least 40 per cent of eligible voters participated in the ballot and if more than 50 per cent of the votes cast were in favour of the proposed industrial action. That is why this bill is so fair. A reduction in strike activity can be obtained through this bill. This can be seen by the UK's secret ballot provisions which came into existence in 1984.
The Blair government's Employment Relations Act 1999 retained the secret ballot system, which has helped to significantly reduce strike activity. Despite changes to this legislation requiring unions to meet the full cost of conducting ballots, the ballot process has become far more widespread in the UK than the law constitutes. It has been found that, on top of pre-industrial balloting, employers' last offers and union positions on proposed settlements are more often than not determined through the balloting process. There has been a substantial reduction in industrial disputes in the UK due to the introduction of mandatory pre-strike ballots in 1984. 
Over the last few weeks we have seen the impact that union activity has had on Australia's car industry due to a stalemate between BHP Steel and unions picketing its Westernport plant. The dispute threatened 12,000 workers from Australia's four biggest car makers. The companies stated that they may have to stand down workers due to a shortage of steel. Minister Abbott is fully aware of the impact of the dispute, and he accused the AMWU of sabotaging the car industry. In an article in the Herald Sun on Monday, 10 June, Mr Abbott said:
They claim to want job security. How can you protect job security by repeatedly closing the industry down? This picket, which is currently threatening to cripple the industry, is not a legal picket.
The two unions insisted the picket was legal and claimed that BHP was trying to use political and legal pressure to end the dispute. Around 280 workers at the BHP Hastings plant had been on strike since 21 May over job security and a pay rise. That forced BHP to use helicopters to break the picket line and to move goods in and out of the plant.
About 2,600 tonnes of steel had been airlifted compared with the usual 50,000 tonnes. This had huge implications. BHP took action in the Federal Court and in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission over the whole process. Ford, Toyota, Mitsubishi and Holden also sought permission to sue the unions for damages. Because of the strike, Toyota airlifted steel from Japan at a freight cost of $250,000 per load to keep its struggling Victorian factory open. Companies cannot afford that sort of cost to stay in production. The money has to come from somewhere. Whether it be from a cutback in staff or an increase in the cost of a motor vehicle, somebody pays for this type of action.
Every day of lost production costs the nation's biggest car maker, Holden, $20 million. The company said that industrial disputes had cost $320 million in lost production in the past six months. Holden also said that the industrial relations system for resolving disputes was not working properly. A Holden spokesperson, Tristan Everett, said:
What worries us at Holden is we're trying to get export orders up. People see this industrial relations climate being blown up.
I firmly believe this situation cannot continue. This bill has to be put in place to overcome drastic union disputes. Not only will the car manufacturers have to lay off workers; so too will BHP because car companies would have to resource their steel from somewhere else. Therefore BHP would lose the contract and could not sustain its work force. It is a continuous cycle that can bring about a dramatic loss of jobs as well as other consequences for the Australian economy.
A good example of how effective this type of legislation can be is in Western Australia. There has not been one application for a ballot since 1 January 1998 when compulsory pre-strike ballots were legislated. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill could provide job security in those companies seeking to expand. For a company to expand, there needs to be a harmonious and content work force.
As a successful businesswoman in Wagga Wagga since 1978, I am fully aware that there needs to be security within the workplace for any business or company to grow and become even more viable. My main focus as a member of parliament has included regional economic development and predominantly those issues that impact on small to medium enterprises, but including larger businesses. For a small business to expand it has to have a good work force and offer a great service. In those small businesses or in larger companies, expansions help create growth in the town or the city by having to employ more people. It is a continuous cycle. Other businesses in the town grow from them being consumers. For companies to expand they do not want to be the subject of continual contention in the media.
Back in my electorate of Riverina, earlier this year in Wagga Wagga we saw industrial dispute at Cargill meatworks. They were the subject of contention and it was plastered continually on the front page of regional newspapers and broadcast on television and radio news. We try so very hard to attract industries into our communities to provide additional employment, to provide greater economic growth. This type of action does nothing to benefit us and it does nothing to further our experience in attracting sensible and sustainable industries into regional communities. Another example in my electorate has been Ricegrowers Co-operative in Leeton with people frequently striking over the last six months and more.
Companies do not want to attract bad publicity, particularly in regional areas, in respect of industrial action by their workers when perhaps that is not what the workers want and their intention is not to detract from the industry within which they are employed. The objectives of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002 will overcome the problems, hopefully before they are made public, before they hit the tabloids, before they interact with the communities and before we are labelled and plastered in the media as being an unsatisfactory and unreliable work force. This cannot be allowed to impact on regional Australia in any way.
Then there is the problem of industrial disputes having an impact on other companies. In referring to the BHP Steel dispute and the implications that it caused for car companies, a Mitsubishi spokesman said the dispute had tarnished Australia's manufacturing reputation. This bill proposes to assist companies to be competitive, knowing that they are not going to be held to ransom by, at times, renegade union activity that the workers do not necessarily support.
Imagine that you are the owner of a large company that manufactures sheds. You quote on the biggest jobs that you can find in the region. You aim to have three, maybe four, jobs going at once. Everything is going well and you are coming out stronger than your competitor as you beat him in the tender process. Next thing—bang! You are hit with industrial action within your workplace through no fault of your own, no fault of your staff, but on a union whim. You talk to your employees with some of them saying it was not their choice. Now you are left with a big problem. You do not have security in your workplace to remain on top of the jobs that you have secured to remain competitive with your opposition. Your workers have just walked off the job. Who is going to build the sheds? You are left with a serious dilemma. The secret ballot process proposed by the bill, as Minister Abbott said in his second reading speech, `will create and protect jobs by preventing unnecessary strikes'. He also said: 
It will ensure that the right to protected industrial action is not abused by union officials pushing agendas unrelated to the workers at the workplace concerned.
As I said earlier, there needs to be security for the protection of workers and for the companies, and not only for the workers from the unions but for the workers from the employers as well. For the workers to be content in their jobs and not to be pushed into industrial activity by union officials, it is important that there is the security for the companies not to feel uneasy and threatened by disputes that they and their workers have absolutely no control over. Both parties can get on with what they do best under this bill, and that is `taking care of business'. Both parties have a choice. This bill offers a choice—a choice that can be acted upon.
Secret ballot arrangements have been operating most effectively in countries with significant histories in trade union problems. They exist in the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Germany and Ireland, and secret ballot provisions have not only reduced strike activity, as I have mentioned before, but given union members a choice of whether or not to take industrial action. This has assisted with gaining greater consultation and better relations between unions and their members. In the UK especially, the secret ballot system has the support of their trade union leaders, but not so in Australia.
—Why not?
—Yes, you might ask, `Why not?' The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry supports the bill in that it proposes the introduction of a qualification on the current bargaining period provisions to the effect that industrial action is not protected unless authorised by a secret ballot and an accompanying scheme to enable this qualification to be implemented in practice. The Australian Industry Group supports a legislative scheme with one important exemption, namely, that employees eligible to vote in a secret ballot should not be limited to union members. The group believes that in doing so it would create hostility and division within the enterprise.
As we all know, this is not the first time the government has brought this bill to light. There have been several recent legislative requirements and initiatives relating to this. It featured in the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999. At the same time the Commonwealth budget introduced funding for the partial costs of conducting these ballots. The more jobs, better pay bill failed to pass the Senate in November 1999 and the government decided to reintroduce schedules of the bill as separate bills. At the same time, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2000 was introduced to the House of Representatives on 26 June 2000 and the bill failed again to pass the Senate on 7 August 2000.
—What's wrong with them now?
—There is something desperately wrong. In 2002, when we are seeing more and more industrial disputes, picket lines and ever-increasing strike activity again, it is about time this bill was passed by the Senate. It is advantageous to the workers. It is advantageous to the companies. It is advantageous, as well, to the unions for their relationship with their members. But, the primary thing is that it is advantageous to the country, to the national account and that is what this government is very good at. I support this bill. I urge you to consider supporting this bill in the House.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (SECRET BALLOTS FOR PROTECTED ACTION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2002-06-20,"—in reply—In summing up this debate, let me first of all thank all members for their contributions. I particularly thank coalition members for their contributions. I probably should particularly note the contribution from my friend and colleague the member for Hume, who was able to draw upon his own extensive experience in years past as a member of the then Meatworkers Union, when he was a contract slaughterman. I thank him for the particularly poignant perspective that he was able to bring to this debate. 
I thank members opposite for their contributions, even though, obviously, most of them were pretty ferociously critical of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002 and, indeed, of me, the minister. I appreciate the passion that members opposite bring to these sorts of debates. In fact, I sometimes think it is the only thing that gets members opposite passionate—a debate about unions and union rights, as they see things. Nevertheless, I do accept that these are very sincere views, and I also accept that many members opposite do have enormous experience in the practice of workplace relations and that they are coming from a particular perspective which they sincerely hold.
I want to make it very clear that this government is not against unions at all. This government is all in favour of responsible unionism. We are not against unions; what we are against are mindless militants in the union movement. I noticed, in fact, that no less an authority than Dougie Cameron made a speech the other day, when he pointed to the risks—as the union movement diminishes in numbers—of mindless militants. What he called for was `mindful militants'. I think that a bill like this would encourage the unions to be more responsible. I think it would actually encourage good unions and good unionists to do a better job.
Let me say that strikes do cost jobs. That is the fundamental reality about a strike. Strikes cost jobs, they damage companies, they can damage the reputation of Australia overseas and, most of all, a prolonged strike can take hundreds and hundreds of dollars out of the pay packets, out of the pockets, of vulnerable workers—usually the workers who can least afford to lose that money. That is why strikes should never be entered into lightly. That is why the people who will be most affected by any strike action should be given the chance to have a fair, free and secret ballot before any strike action takes place.  
This bill is about freedom. It is about giving ordinary Australian workers real freedom over their futures and real freedom over the things that affect their lives. It is about dispelling forever the spectre of coercion, which has all too often haunted industrial relations and which has all too often haunted the decisions that are made at mass meetings to take industrial action. We all know how easy it is for the organisers, the officials, the heavies, those in the know, to intimidate groups of people in a situation like that, particularly when passions are aroused. I think that what we are asking for is thoroughly unobjectionable.
The point has been made by many speakers opposite, particularly the shadow minister, that unions are democracies. Well, they are in theory. Let me quote Luke Foley—who is the secretary of the Australian Services Union and, I am told, one of the rising stars of the New South Wales ALP—talking about the governance of the party and the union. He says:
The formal ALP-union link is marked by the dominance of entrenched hierarchies on both sides, where union officials and politicians negotiate with each other to the almost total exclusion of their respective memberships.
Both ALP branch affairs and the unions have a democratic deficit, at odds with the modern political demand for direct involvement and participation.
There we have, from the mouth of someone who knows and, indeed, from the mouth of someone who respects and loves the union movement, a very good argument why decent, responsible unionists should support this bill. It is not a particularly complex bill, although inevitably, with legislation, legalisms abound. It is essentially a simple proposition that there has to be a secret ballot before a strike under the auspices of the Industrial Relations Commission. If the member for Barton is as concerned as he said in his speech, why didn't he move a series of amendments? If he thinks that it can be done better than the way we are proposing, I am all ears. I appreciate and respect the member for Barton's expertise in this area and I would have been only too happy to consider what he thought was a better way of bringing about the objective of greater democracy in this important area.
The point was made that we are not requiring a secret ballot of shareholders before companies engage in industrial activity. At a superficial level, I suppose there is certain plausibility to that critique, but the simple truth is that, unlike unions, companies are not democracies. Companies are not run on democratic principles—they never have been, they never will be—whereas unions claim to be democracies. Let us hold them to that principle. The member for Barton said that if we had secret ballots it would lock people into striking. No, it wouldn't. But it would mean that, if strikes did take place, they would have great moral authority. Frankly, if a strike is backed by the workers concerned, with the authority of a secret ballot, it deserves to have moral authority. 
The member for Brisbane, the former shadow minister—again, a man whose expertise and passion I respect—said that we were delegating matters to third, fourth and fifth parties. It is quite simple: ballot agents are supposed to enable the unions themselves to conduct credible secret ballots. They are of the nature of probity advisers and it should not complicate things at all. Finally, let me say that the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany and Canada all have secret ballot provisions. They are countries whose traditions we respect; they are countries with a vigorous union movement; they are countries which have no lack of proper industrial activism. If they can do it, we should be able to do it. Let us give freedom a chance and let us support this bill.

"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,2002-06-20,"—Tonight I want to talk about the subject of breast cancer. In doing so, I draw the House's attention to one area of concern which arises as a result of the impact of breast cancer. I would also like to make reference to a number of groups, particularly Breast Cancer Network Australia, and the 83 groups which work under the umbrella of Breast Cancer Network Australia. I commend the wonderful work that those groups do in supporting women around the country when they face the trauma of a diagnosis and then ongoing treatment for breast cancer. 
In my own home town of Canberra, we have a wonderful group—and there are a number of such groups—called the Bosom Buddies group. We also have the Cancer Council ACT Breast Cancer Support Group, the Australian New Zealand Breast Cancer Trials Group's consumer advisory panel and Dragons Abreast, a wonderful dragon boat rowing team which, I think, is in other parts of the country as well. Amongst those support groups there is an ancillary group called Caring For You. A couple of months ago, the people from Caring For You came to see me wanting to talk about the situation when a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer and, sadly, that diagnosis leads to surgery which may involve a mastectomy. The follow-up to that is usually chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and a very long traumatic period of recovery—hopefully—for the woman involved. In the majority of those cases, the woman then requires a breast prosthesis which is fitted for her by specialists in the fitting area following that surgery. They came to see me because the cost of those prostheses can, in some instances, be quite prohibitive depending on where in the country the woman comes from.
There has been a point made in a couple of articles in the Canberra Times, on 3 June and 8 June, by women who have been involved in this area and who are also, in some cases, incredibly medically qualified. They have made the point that not only chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other forms of treatment but also the proficient and proper fitting of an effective breast prosthesis are important to a woman's recovery. The cost of these prostheses can be up to $400 or $500. The wearing life of a prosthesis can be effectively up to two years, although I know women who lead very active lives and sometimes need to replace those prostheses earlier than that.
There is very little, if any, financial assistance for the purchase of these items. The very sad and dramatic headline in the Canberra Times on 3 June read: `Dead women's breast prostheses resold.' These women were telling me that in some parts of the country that happens. In some parts of rural Australia we have women who cannot afford the money or cannot access proper fitting procedures and they make their own fittings out of cotton and seed, or whatever else they need, in an attempt to try and make a healthy recovery. We are not just talking about cosmetics here; we are also talking about the effect on a woman's body of a mastectomy and what that does to her stature, balance and carriage and how that translates to the very health of her body following that surgery.
The people involved who have been talking to me about this have suggested that maybe something could be done to help through the Medicare system or some other form of financial assistance. It is fair to say that some state and territory governments offer a small one-off payment. I know that in the ACT women are offered approximately $210 as a one-off payment. We are really saying that for a woman to go through such a trauma and then effect a proper recovery—psychologically, physically and emotion-ally—we need to do all we can for them. I would like to think that a bit of effort could be put into supporting, through all the networks around this country, the call for some form of ongoing financial support so that women can be supported as they need to use these prostheses and replace them.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Breast Cancer</title>,Adjournment,21,1
"Mr WILLIAMS,AM, QC, MP",LP,2002-06-20,"—On 6 June 2002 (Hansard page 2950) Mr McClelland asked the following question without notice:
Can the Attorney confirm that the Secretary of the Asia-Pacific Money Laundering Secretariat has claimed that Nauru's laws allow money laundering by organised criminals, people smugglers and terrorists, saying:
“Until Nauru has a full and comprehensive law in place and other anti-money laundering standards and measures.... it will be a vulnerable place for money laundering and it will be attractive to money launderers”.
Given that Australia provides substantial financial aid to Nauru, what action has the government taken since September 11 of last year to ensure that Nauru closes down these arrangements?
The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
I can confirm that in response to a question from an ABC journalist, who asked whether, in the absence of appropriate measures against money laundering in Nauru, does it mean that it is possible that money could be laundered through Nauru to terrorist organisations, the Head of the Asia-Pacific Money Laundering Secretariat did make the above statement on 6 June 2002.
The lack of adequate legislation and banking supervision in Nauru has been a matter of concern to the international community for some time.  The Financial Action Taskforce on Money Laundering (FATF), of which I previously said Australia is a very active member, had identified Nauru in 2000 as being a `non-cooperative country' in respect of the fight against money laundering.  In August 2001 the FATF set a deadline of 30 November 2001 for Nauru to enact suitable anti-money laundering legislative amendments or otherwise countermeasures would be applied.
Officers of my Department provided advice to Nauru, through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, on possible legislative amendments and offered further assistance, if required, prior to the FATF deadline.
The deadline was not met and members of the FATF subsequently applied counter measures.  In implementing the FATF countermeasures, Australia, through the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre(AUSTRAC) is reviewing all transactions reported which refer to Nauru, including all international funds transfer instructions to and from Nauru.  Instructions were issued to cash dealers in January 2002.
Despite the enactment of new legislation on 6 December 2001, in considering the status of Nauru in January 2002, the FATF determined that Nauru had not adequately addressed the deficiencies found in the process of licensing, regulation and supervision of its offshore banking sector.  The FATF, as does Australia, remains committed to working with Nauru to address the outstanding issues.
While Australia is prepared to assist Nauru with advice on the operation and regulation of its offshore banking sector, the decision to maintain financial arrangements such as `shell banks', is ultimately one for the Republic of Nauru. (For information, US correspondent accounts with foreign shell banks are now prohibited under the USA Patriot Act 2001.)
However, the Nauru delegation to the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering on 7 June 2002 stated that they hoped “to strengthen our legal and administrative framework in combating money laundering by developing plans with the technical assistance from Australia, the Commonwealth Secretariat and other international organizations”.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Foreign Affairs: Nauru</title>,Questions Without Notice,23,1
"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2002-06-20,"—Today I want to talk about an issue that is very important in my electorate: the closure of the Department of Earth Sciences at La Trobe University in Bundoora. This department has been a part of La Trobe University for 30 years, providing professional training primarily leading to careers in geology, granite petrology, geophysics and fluid flow. Eighty-five per cent of its graduates find work within three months of graduating. This of course speaks volumes for the quality of teaching, the expertise of the students and the high demand for their skills. Closing this department means that up to 170 students will be affected, from first-year students right through to PhD students. They will not be able to study part time, and they cannot fail a unit, because if they do it is unlikely they will be able to finish their degree at La Trobe.
Australia is the highest spender on minerals exploration. In the year 2000 almost $700 million was spent, making departments like the Department of Earth Sciences at La Trobe vital. It is the only undergraduate geology course in Victoria that offers extensive coverage of environmental subjects, particularly water geochemistry and hydrogeology. This closure also affects students in Mildura and Albury. Of course, the question is: where will these students go?
Last week I visited La Trobe to talk to the devastated earth sciences students and staff. Some students came to La Trobe specifically for the individual academics and their specialisation. I spoke to one new PhD student who has a supervisor in this department who is the only specialist in Australia, if not the world, teaching a particular area of hydrocarbon study. If this department closes, this student faces the question of where she will go. Will she follow her supervisor wherever he ends up? If he goes overseas, will she follow? Of course, this would contribute to something that I do not think that anyone in this parliament would want to see—that is, any further brain drain. These are very difficult questions and options facing these students.
Then there is the staff: one of the academic staff members thinks that he will be able to find another job and two of the administration staff will be redeployed within the university, which leaves at least 10 of the staff without jobs. Their options are not attractive. They could look for a job now, but that would mean abandoning their students. They could wait until the department has breathed its last and then face the insecurity of looking for work while unemployed. Most disappointingly, the corporate knowledge of these academics will be lost.

"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2002-06-20,"—I want to make some brief comments on this department's budget in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03. My views on changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme have been recorded in debate elsewhere. I am sorry the minister is not here but I intend to have a meeting with him on Monday to ask him a few of these questions. I want to concentrate mainly on aged care but endorse the comments that my colleague the member for New England made in his contribution here yesterday on allocated provider numbers and differential Medicare payments. Some initiatives in this budget, such as additional resources for carers of older Australians particularly in dementia care, greater commitment to cancer treatment and more money for palliative care, are worthy of very strong support.
In the area of aged care provision there are increases in money set aside for aged care nurses, which is welcome, residential aged care subsidies and community aged care packages. But there is a growing crisis in the provision of aged care generally within my area of the central west. We are told that the region is overserviced in respect of the existing ratio of 100 aged care places per 1,000 people over the age of 70. It has been suggested that aged care bonds may be a way of attracting investment into that sector. We have an ageing population in regional areas and—to put it crudely—we have a resource in our aged population. It is not going to disappear in any sort of a hurry and it strikes me that it could be a very attractive investment option if such bonds could be structured and government guaranteed as an investment vehicle for the very scarce resources available—or not available—for the aged care sector. We have heard of the phantom beds and the licences being granted to aged care providers right around Australia but many of them, particularly in places like Lithgow, are really struggling to raise the capital necessary for the bricks and mortar.
Aged care assessment teams tell me that there is a continuing overdemand for nursing home places—demand is in constant excess of the supply of such places, despite the fact that we are told that the central west is overserviced in terms of that 100 per 1,000 ratio. Exacerbating the problem is the continuing pressure on the state hospital system from aged patients who by any judgment should be in a nursing home. Last week the son of an 84-year-old woman who is in Orange Base Hospital and seriously ill—in the terminal stages of her life—was angered that she is to be shifted as a public hospital patient to Eugowra, 70-odd kilometres away, because there is no bed available in the Orange area. The bed in the hospital is obviously needed for more urgent medical patients.
This lady is in addition to the 30 people assessed as needing nursing home accommodation in Orange, yet the recent announcement of nursing home places for the central west put out by the minister in the last week or two has no provision for aged care providers to apply for any high or low care places. All that is on offer are home based care community care packages with a chance for people to apply for 40 unallocated low care nursing home places. I commend the minister for detailing these allocations before aged care providers go to the trouble of preparing detailed submissions in the vain hope of winning some licences, but it is no good funding home care packages without providing more medium and high care nursing home places, because inevitably home care aged will need intensive nursing care for the remainder of their lives unless they choose to die in their own home and their family can support that wish. We have a situation in country Australia where the population is ageing and the policy of ageing in place does not offer the family care option as much as it perhaps might in the city. The kids are not there; they have headed for greener pastures, sometimes overseas, to the cities or to the coast. I contend that there is a greater need for aged accommodation in major regional centres like Bathurst, Dubbo and Tamworth than there is in more populated areas on the coast.
I know that the statistics say that 90 per cent of older people choose to stay in their own homes as long as they can. (Extension of time granted) Perhaps there has been a disproportionate concentration on bricks and mortar aged care as opposed to home care because 90 per cent of people do choose to stay in their own home. The government must be applauded for extending the home and community care process but we must be careful that these packages are real care packages. We cannot afford to cut corners. I believe the care packages should include the bed and breakfast option—not in a food sense but the care should be provided at the beginning and the end of the day when the most need for that backup is required, and when the most comforting aspect of that service can be provided rather than a once-a-day visit. That is the lonely time and the period of the day when a person's wellbeing, comfort and loneliness in their own home is most obvious. I know that, having had my mother die in her own home, refusing to go anywhere else and causing great stress to the family, which was dispersed to all points of the compass, and feeling guilty that the pressure was on the neighbours to keep an eye on her. It was a very difficult situation.
I think the packages at this point are lacking in both their quantitative and qualitative component. The degree to which aged care providers take them up should not be the measure of their success. They are a much needed income stream for many nursing homes and some of them are converting—as is Wontama in Orange—some of their residential aged care beds into community care packages. They have good intent and they deliver a good service, as far as it goes, but I think that they need to be looked at in terms of greater quality of service delivery.
While there is a welcome allocation of an extra $211 million for subsidies for residential aged care, the figures I have detailed on the allocation of places in the central west highlight the fact that not enough licences are coming through to areas of real need—areas which the formula says are not in need. I know things have improved significantly over the past five years since the aged care reforms but I also know there is a tremendous administrative load on staff of aged care facilities with the new compliance regime. There are precious few resources to cope with this. The member for New England also mentioned this in his delivery yesterday.
The allocation of increased funding for aged care administration is targeted at compliance investigation, community care program management and assistance to Indigenous and rural aged care. That is very welcome but I suggest that more will be needed to take the administrative burden off nursing and management staff, who are struggling to meet their compliance requirements over and above their care duties to their clients.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2002-03</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,25,1
"McGauran, Peter, MP",NP,2002-06-20,"—I stand in place of the Minister for Ageing, who represents the Minister for Health and Aging in the House of Representatives. He has been called away on urgent ministerial business. Without knowing exactly who they were or the content of their contributions, I wish to thank members for their involvement in this debate. I am sure the contributions varied. I suspect, although I cannot be entirely certain, that the contributions of members on the government side far outweighed the significance, capacity and intellectual rigour of the opposition members' contributions.
I hope that members on the other side addressed the government's budgetary measures in regard to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I would be disappointed if they did not. I would not be surprised but I would be disappointed if they did not concede that the government's measures were balanced, reasonable and necessary. It has been an issue of much debate in the House of Representatives during question time, so I will not go over old ground. The argument of the government is simply that to make the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme viable and sustainable into the future for the benefit of many Australians, especially those in the low income area, it must be put on a more secure financial footing. The opposition are cowardly. You can call them reckless, negligent, craven or spineless—whatever word you like. Their obstruction is deliberate despite their knowing the integrity and urgency of the government's reforms. It is very disappointing and I think it will come back to haunt the opposition, particularly should they ever, at some time in the future—as far away as it might be imaginable—win government.
The other aspect of the portfolio's business and responsibility is aged care. Here the new minister is taking to the job with great enthusiasm and dedication and already we are seeing a flow of new beds into the aged care sector and new standards of care. Consequently, I believe that even though this is the most pressing financial and social imperative the minister is well on top of his work, as is Senator Kay Patterson. They are two outstanding ministers doing very fine jobs. I will bring my remarks to a close and urge opposition members to come to their senses and support the brave and, above all, enlightened measures of the government.

"McGauran, Peter, MP",NP,2002-06-20,"—If it suits the convenience of the chamber, I suggest that, after concluding consideration of the proposed expenditure for the Department of Health and Ageing, the order for the consideration of the proposed expenditures agreed to yesterday by the committee be varied by considering the proposed expenditure for the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations after the proposed expenditure for the Department of Education, Science and Training.
—Is the suggestion of the minister agreed to? There being no objection, that course will be followed. ",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2002-03</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,25,1
"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2002-06-20,"—One of my constituents, Mr Jack Macdonald from Sefton, got a fairly big no from a number of banks in my electorate in April. He rang my office to indicate his displeasure at the manner in which he had been treated and the manner in which he saw a lot of other people being treated by the local banks. It is a fairly ordinary story; unfortunately, it is also a fairly typical story of what is happening particularly to elderly people in our society.
Being from Sefton, he went to the Commonwealth Bank at Chester Hill. There had been a fire there and it had not reopened, so he went to three different banks to draw out money to pay his bills. At each of the banks, queues stretched out into the street. He waited for some time but never got to the counter and walked away in disgust. There were no chairs for the aged or the feeble, nor for young mothers carrying babies. He made the further comment that many people in the queues were complaining—just as he had problems, so did they have problems, because so many of them were aged and in discomfort because of the conditions.
This, unfortunately, is not unusual. I suppose the correction to that statement is that the unusual thing is he had three other banks to choose from around the place. If he had been in Greenacre, he would have had zero, because there are no banking institutions left in the shopping centre of Greenacre. One after the other, they have been pulled out. The argument from the Commonwealth Bank, Westpac and the other banks is that there is plenty of provision around the area of Bankstown and all people have to do is make their way down to Bankstown Square and they will be able to get service there. We know from the experience in both Greenacre and Yagoona that, when people have been forced to go to Bankstown Square, they join queues which are already long at each of the banks in Bankstown Square. People who are aged and dependent upon a social security pension have also got the problem that it costs them a lot of money, relative to their income, to go to the bank and take their money out to do the rest of what they need to do—shopping and so on.
Mr Macdonald was extremely upset. He went back to his club—he is active in both the Bass Hill and Bankstown RSL clubs—and he found that not only he but everyone to whom he spoke was fed up with the lack of customer service by all the banks. Everyone complained about bank closures and the difficulties they encountered when seeking over-the-counter withdrawals. Mr Macdonald stated that in protest the people he was talking to decided not to pay their bills until such time as the banks (a) stopped closures, (b) reopened closed branches and (c) improved their service. Mr Macdonald stated that, when the creditors came chasing their money, he would refer the creditors to me, their member of parliament.
I can only advise Mr Macdonald to pay his bills, because (a) I do not see that, in the short or medium term, there is a prospect of the banks stopping the closures—although that tide seems to have been stemmed a bit—(b) the banks have not moved to reopen closed branches and (c) given that the banks have taken away so many services, there has not been a great move to improve service provision. For Mr Macdonald and my other constituents this is a fact of life which is very difficult to accept.
The two shining lights are that the Punchbowl Credit Union has opened up in Greenacre and that the Bankstown City Credit Union exists—and has existed for decades—in Bankstown. Mr Macdonald would find, if he signed up with the Bankstown City Credit Union, that there are very few queues there, that the service is open and friendly and that the staff do all they can to assist their customers. So there is another way of addressing this problem; that is, through the credit union movement. To those of my constituents who are not familiar with the credit union movement, who are looking for real alternatives when banks are not providing the service that they should—when there are queues and when there is not enough concern about people who cannot access the Internet and cannot find all the quick and easy ways of doing things that the younger people of the population use—and who need direct help across the counter, I suggest the Bankstown City Credit Union or the Punchbowl Credit Union can fill the gap that has been left by the banks. The banks need to be rapped over the knuckles. They need to be made to reintroduce service and become customer driven organisations.
