The PRESIDENT,N/A,1999-02-18,"—I remind honourable senators that the address-in-reply will be presented to the Governor-General at Government House today at 6 p.m. For this purpose, the Senate will stand adjourned without debate at 5.40 p.m. Cars will be available at the Senate entrance at 5.40 p.m. for the purpose of taking senators to Government House.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-02-18,"—Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent him moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion no. 122.
The Regional Forest Agreement debate in Western Australia has galvanised public attention. Amongst the major parties, the National Party has recognised that the current regional forest process is not going to resolve the conflict, and it has made an earnest effort to look at how the conflict may be resolved. It is unusual for me as a Green to be moving to support that earnest effort from the Nationals. But let us give credit where it is due, and here it is due to the Nationals. I quote from the Nationals' press release of Thursday, 11 January, in which the state director, Jamie Kronborg says:
We believe that at least three major steps must be taken as a matter of urgency to help resolve the conflict over logging. These include the rapid phasing out of clear felling in old-growth forests.
The press release goes on to look at the way in which old-growth forest logging is no longer the major source of wood products in Western Australia, and how there is an alternative to the continuing destruction of the karri, jarrah and marri forests in Western Australia, which is better from an economic, employment and environmental point of view.
 The reason we must change the direction of the major parties, as the Nationals have done in Western Australia, is because the public demands it. There is so little of the grand forests of this nation left. There is an enormous groundswell of feeling that that little should be protected. The reason is that the public at large recognises that it is unnecessary to keep the destruction going, that the plantation and regrowth alternatives are there and are available now—not only for this industry to maintain its diversity of wood products for the Australian market but also for export and with downstream processing to increase the jobs provided in the logging industry. 
 Moreover, the real jobs in ancient forests these days are from the presentation of those forests to visitors in the recreation and tourism industries. Western Australia is no different from Tasmania where, these days, more jobs are actually created by keeping the trees intact with their wildlife than by felling the trees to the ground. I see some Labor members laughing about that, but they are the ones who always espouse jobs, jobs, jobs, while the big woodchip corporations mechanise, conglomerate and shed jobs—the jobs of their union members. It is not they who often sit outside the woodchip offices complaining about this, it is very often the Greens. But when the Nationals do their homework and come to the same conclusion, they should be congratulated and they should be supported.
 There is some prospect that Western Australia will be the state which, through public impulse, through the sheer pressure of public outrage about the destruction of forests, may turn around this head-in-the-sand attitude of the Howard government and several other state governments who say, `Whatever the woodchip corporations say, that is the line we will take.' This is an urgent matter. There is a positive resolution. When the Nationals in Western Australia come up with the road to that positive resolution, they deserve the support of this place.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-02-18,"—We have heard a debate on the motion but we have not heard a debate on why standing orders should be suspended, why this motion is urgent and why it could not be dealt with in the ordinary course of events. The fact is that this matter—notice of which was given yesterday—was dealt with last night at the whips meeting. At that time we indicated that we were unhappy with the matter proceeding and that we would deny formality.
However, we were prepared to entertain any approaches as to a rewording of the motion. No such approaches have been forthcoming. This motion is simplistic. It deals with an issue which has not just Western Australian but also national ramifications. If the matter is to be dealt with, it should be dealt with in a fulsome debate. It should be dealt with so 
 that all parties have an opportunity to move amendments that they consider appropriate, rather than simply deal with the motion by granting formality and voting for or against it. That would not necessarily reflect the views of the Labor Party, for example, on the range of issues which underlie this motion.
So we believe, firstly, that the matter is not urgent. Secondly, it is important that if this motion is to be debated it should be debated when there is an opportunity to give the matter the attention that it deserves and to deal with the full range of issues that lies behind it.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-02-18,"—The government will be opposing the motion for the suspension of standing orders. Senator Brown has not made out a case as to why the very limited time available to the Senate to debate matters should be used in this way. We had a debate on the RFA only yesterday afternoon. We will have a debate on RFA legislation in the next couple of sitting days, unless Senator Brown's tactics can delay that as well.
Senator Brown wants us to suspend standing orders so that the motion relating to the support for the WA National Party's stance on clear-felling in old-growth forests can be debated. I know that the Leader of the National Party and Western Australian Deputy Premier Hendy Cowan would be very pleased to have the support of Senator Bob Brown from Tasmania for the policy, but I am sure that the most successful deputy premier in many years of Western Australia's history can probably wait a few more days to have that support reaffirmed.
Senator Brown in his discussions talked about the overwhelming upsurge of support for stopping logging in old-growth forests that is occurring, mostly from extremely wealthy, well-heeled people living in the leafy western suburbs of Perth, who I guess would love to have the support of Senator Bob Brown in this and, I guess, many of his other economic policies. Most of them live in houses that have had their floors and their roofs chopped 
 out of old-growth forests. They are really saying to the rest of the home buyers in Western Australia: `We have our houses in Peppermint Grove and Dalkeith, but you can't have yours in the northern suburbs.'",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-02-18,"—In relation to this motion and the question before the chamber of its urgency and the need to suspend standing orders to be able to debate it and vote on it, from the Democrats' point of view it is clearly a motion that deserves the support of the chamber. Senator O'Brien said that it is a simplistic motion. It is not simplistic; it is simple. It is very simple, it is very straightforward, it is very clear and it is very positive. For that reason it is probably unfortunate that formality was denied on the issue.
The Democrats believe that the issue of forests is an important one, as was indicated in the debate yesterday, that needs to be brought to the attention of the Australian public. It is good to see WA leading the way in highlighting public awareness about the threat to our native forests. We are always keen to encourage and express support for state governments when they are doing the right thing, when they are highlighting threats to our environment in particular, and especially when it comes from parties such as the National Party. It is a bit of a surprise that National Party colleagues are not in here at the moment to assist in congratulating their colleague. I am sure they all do that privately but it would be a great opportunity for them to express it publicly.
So the Democrats, without wanting to take up an excessive amount of time in the chamber—because we do recognise that there are a lot of other important matters, which is why it is unfortunate that formality was denied—believe that it is an important matter on a number of levels. The overall issue of the protection of our forests in Western Australia and elsewhere is one that the Senate and the parliament should express support for as often as possible in the Democrats' view. For that reason we support the motion.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-02-18,"—This is urgent, as anyone in Western Australia would know. The issue is 
 urgent because at the moment the proposed RFA in Western Australia is still not presented and at the same time the Department of Conservation and Land Management are cutting down as much contentious old-growth forest as they can. There are very few people who know the situation in Western Australia who would not fully agree that the situation is urgent.
There are very few issues I have seen take up the entire coalition conference in Western Australia, the issue having generated such huge controversy. The coalition in Western Australia considered it so urgent that almost nothing else got a guernsey at their state conference. They certainly believe it is urgent. Perhaps Senator O'Brien was not aware of the fact that the Western Australian coalition considered this their most urgent topic. The media reported it as the most urgent topic that was considered at the recent coalition conference in Western Australia.
A very large percentage of people in Western Australia, again and again, when asked, have said that this is a very important issue. A growing number of people on all sides of politics in Western Australia believe that it is time for people to put aside politics and the old prejudices and do something for the future of Western Australian forests and for the future of conservation and the sustainability of jobs.
I believe the Western Australian Labor Party are thinking of putting together a committee to look at the issue. They are saying that industry and all stakeholders should be involved in assessing the situation. Unfortunately, they didn't qualify what industry they meant. Perhaps we need to remind the Labor Party that there are other industries apart from the timber industry, but let us not judge them too harshly before that comes around.
What we don't know yet in Western Australia is what the actions of the Labor Party will be. We do know what the National Party have said. We know what the Greens and the Democrats have said in Western Australia. We are not quite sure of the ALP, but we do know that enabling legislation has gone 
 through already in the House of Representatives and was voted on by the Labor Party.
You can understand why the ALP are not wanting to consider this urgent. They are squirming because they have a huge number of constituents in Western Australia who want them to take a responsible position. Yet their federal party cannot see fit to support their Western Australian party. I can understand why the urgency of this is concerning the ALP in Canberra. I can see why people from other parts of Australia, including Tasmania, might be concerned about the pressure that has been put on their own party, as we speak, in Western Australia; the pressure has been put on all parties to put down their prejudices and come to the table and work out what is the way of the future for this industry. If we continue to put it off, the destruction will continue. If we continue to put it off, it will be in the state election the biggest issue we have seen for some time.
From the Greens' point of view, that might be to our benefit. However, that is not the way we want things to go. We want a sensible approach, a sensible outcome, and it is urgent. It is urgent because as we speak a number of areas which have been considered as high conservation value are being cut down by a department which has an in-built conflict of interest. I have to congratulate the National Party on taking a stance in Western Australia on old growth forest, but there is also another area of congratulation in Western Australia. The Labor Party have asked that the Department of Conservation and Land Management be separated; that the conservation and forestry functions be separated. That is commonsense.
At the moment, we have the National Party in Western Australia calling for a separation. We also have the Greens and I think the Democrats in Western Australia calling for a separation. The one big gap in Western Australia on that issue is the Liberal Party. But we are getting daily more and more people coming from the Liberal Party, longstanding members of the Liberal Party in Western Australia, who are asking their own party to get real. (Time expired)

SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON RURAL AND REGIONAL AFFAIRS
LANDCARE POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
REPORT
Madam President, the review of Landcare policies and programs was originally referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee in December 1993. Senators may recall that Landcare is not a government program, but is more accurately described as a community based voluntary program supported, encouraged and influenced by a number of Commonwealth and State Government programs.
While Landcare enjoyed a high level of initial success, the committee identified the emergence of some problems and the existence of a degree of frustration among landholders and Landcare groups, principally as a result of:
.	 The inability of landholders to obtain funding for on-ground works under the then guidelines;
.	 The possible low value of further demonstration projects;
.	 Economic constraints attributable to the rural recession;
.	 Issues were beyond the capacity of individual groups; and
.	 Commonwealth State funding arrangements.
In the 37th parliament, the Committee made a detailed and thorough investigation of a wide range of issues relevant to the delivery of Landcare programs in Australia. In 1996, the Committee tabled an interim report, which highlighted anticipated changes to the delivery of Landcare programs. In 1997, the Committee held a detailed inquiry into that changed system of delivery.
However, for a number of reasons it is no longer appropriate for the Committee to produce a final report—intervening elections, the committee's intensive involvement in other inquiries referred to it by the Senate, which assumed a greater degree of urgency, and recent changes to the funding arrangements for Landcare programs, including the introduction of the National Heritage Trust, have all meant that the inquiry has lost some of its relevance and topicality.
The new arrangements put in place by the Government are a significant reason for not pursuing the inquiry at this time. The establishment of the National Heritage Trust, a capital funding base for a number of programs, including Landcare, may 
 address some of the problems initially identified in the committee's interim report.
An assessment of the operation of the National Heritage Trust and its funding of a range of programs, including Coastcare, Landcare and Waterwatch may be appropriate once the arrangements have been in place for a significant period of time. However, at this point, the Committee feels that an assessment would be premature and would prefer to give the Trust time to demonstrate its efficacy.
Given the committee's current inquiry schedule and particularly its major inquiry into access to services by rural and regional communities, the committee feels there is little to be gained by any further work on the Landcare inquiry at this time.
I believe that the most effective use of scarce committee resources requires the committee to discontinue the inquiry into Landcare and concentrate its efforts elsewhere. I would however like to place on record my thanks to the previous Chairman of the Committee, Senator David Brownhill and to previous committee members and staff, all of whom have put such a lot of time and effort into gathering evidence for the inquiry and to those people and organisations who gave evidence or made submissions to the inquiry.

—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the report be adopted.
I wanted to remind the Senate that the Landcare program was originally the brainchild, if you like, of the NFF's Rick Farley and the ACF's Phillip Toyne. I think the program has been a very significant social movement and has made an environmental contribution to this country. The program is certainly far from over. But one of the issues that the committee has to deal with is the significant change in policy that has occurred under this government. We will continue to monitor that program, but it is not possible to monitor it under the current terms of reference. So that is the reason for the report I am presenting today.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-02-18,"—Madam Chairman, I thought I would take this opportunity of informing you that I think that this debate has been conducted in a very cooperative way between our distinguished minister, Senator Ellison, who has just joined us in the chamber, and the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Faulkner, who has again conducted himself in his normal exemplary fashion during this debate.
We look forward to this debate on this most important bill proceeding in its committee stage. It is a very important debate for Australia because our electoral laws underpin our great democracy, one of the great democracies in the Western world. If we do not get these laws right, we will not continue to have this great democracy. I see that the distinguished opposition leader has joined us, as have other interested parties. I commend the debate and look forward to hearing and listening with interest as this debate moves along.
Senator FAULKNER (New South Wales—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) 
 (10.26 a.m.)—Yesterday I was addressing the three amendments that I had moved. I will not go over the points that I made earlier in this debate. Suffice to say, let me remind the committee that yesterday I indicated that the opposition moved these amendments because of our belief that it is essential that we tighten the definition of associated entity. These amendments will close the loophole in the event of a loan being forgiven and ultimately becoming a gift. They also prevent loans from being received from anyone other than a registered financial institution unless certain information such as terms and conditions of the loan are disclosed. The amendments now before the chair specifically go to the issue of the actual receipt of loans.
The primary problem that we have with the $4,650,000 Greenfields loan is that we have no evidence to suggest or prove that it is a loan given on commercial terms. In fact, to the contrary, we do know, from their annual return, that the Liberal Party made annual payments of $100,000 to the Greenfields Foundation. As a $100,000 per annum repayment on a $4.65 million loan, we can say that it is certainly at the very lucrative rate of 2½ per cent. There does not appear to be any indication that there would be any commercial rate of interest or that the loan was made on a commercial basis. The evidence just mounts for such a loan being forgiven. The loan would then constitute a gift.
During questioning at the Senate estimates, the AEC conceded that a 2½ per cent interest rate on a loan would give reasonable grounds to assume that the loan was not on a commercial basis and possibly even constituted a gift. Of course it is. It is $4.65 million that the Liberal Party will never have to repay in full. It has no intention of repaying it in full, and that is just the $4.65 million that has been disclosed so far up until the end of the last financial year. We do not know what money changed hands after that. That, of course, was in the lead-up to the federal election last year.
Our amendments would prohibit a loan from being received from anyone other than a registered financial institution unless certain information was disclosed. Basic information such as the terms and conditions of the loan 
 and details about the individual or organisation from whom the loan was received is the sort of information that we are talking about. I believe that this information would greatly assist the Australian Electoral Commission in their investigation and pursuit of possible or suspected associated entities. The amendments do not prohibit loans from being received; they just say that if you get a loan from an organisation other than a registered financial institution then you have to disclose enough about that loan to inform the AEC as to whether it is on a commercial basis or not—in other words, if it would actually constitute a gift.
During yesterday's debate, the minister and, I think, his office flagged some concerns with these amendments. Initially, these concerns were about certain credit cards such as Diners Club and American Express being caught up by not fitting our definition, as I understand it, of `registered financial institution'. The concern that was expressed was that credit card debts may need disclosure. That is not the intent of the amendments, so we offered to work with the government to find a suitable form of words to ensure that that was not a problem. The government was either unable or, I suspect, unwilling to help us, so we have revised our amendments to insert after `loan' the words `of $1,500 or more', which would eliminate minor credit card transactions. I commend that revision in the amendment to the committee.
We were also advised by the AEC that significant payments to credit card companies such as Diners Club and American Express are not featuring in the annual returns. So I have to say that either the government is looking for problems here where there are none or perhaps it is just that the Liberal Party is not disclosing its payments to American Express or Diners Club—I do not know. But I think the revision to the amendment very effectively deals with this issue.
The minister also indicated that the government had concerns about there being no definition of a loan in the Commonwealth Electoral Act, which might present problems for our amendments regarding loans. We heard what the minister said. I do not know 
 whether there was any basis for it, but you have to accept these things on face value. So we have also inserted in our revised amendments on sheet 1244 a definition of a loan which we have, frankly, pinched from the Income Tax Assessment Act, section 109D(3), that being, a loan is:
(a) an advance of money; and
(b) a provision of credit or any other form of financial accommodation; and
(c) a payment of an amount for, on account of, on behalf of or at the request of, an entity, if there is an express or implied obligation to repay the amount; and
(d) a transaction (whatever its terms or form) which in substance effects a loan of money.
As I say, that definition of a loan, which was the second area where the government and government staff were suggesting there might have been a weakness, has been effectively addressed by using that definition from the Income tax Assessment Act.
The minister and the Prime Minister and others in the government have been peddling what have been pretty pathetic lines from the National Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Crosby, who has really, I think, been making a bit of a fool of himself in the national press by trying to set his own definitions of a loan versus a debt. I think the Department of Finance and Administration understands what a loan is. Hopefully, this definition, as set out in the Income Tax Assessment Act, will help Mr Crosby and Mr Ron Walker understand—along with the minister at the table and the Prime Minister. I think it is really the role of the opposition to help them out when they are struggling in this regard, so that definition is included in our revised amendment.
As for the government and the Greenfields Foundation, if they are really fair dinkum and they want to prove that they are not rorting the electoral system by using forgivable loans as gifts then I think they should not have any fear of these amendments. If these amendments were to be adopted, I think it would be a very significant improvement in the Electoral Act, and I commend them to the committee.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-02-18,"—At 
 the outset, I will correct things for the record. Senator Faulkner said that the government has been unwilling to help. I think the officers from the Electoral Commission did meet with someone from Senator Faulkner's office yesterday. I dispute that we have been unwilling to try to resolve this matter. The government's genuine approach to this matter is evidenced by supporting the first three amendments proposed by the opposition.
The situation in relation to the remaining three amendments is, for a number of reasons, problematical. I appreciate that the opposition has revised its previous wording. But, at the outset, I would say that the government still has a problem with the wording as proposed by the opposition. The opposition amendment proposes to add a new section to division 4 of part 20 of the Electoral Act. This division of the act deals with disclosure of donations.
The government notes that the opposition has modelled this provision on the wording contained in present section 306, which deals with certain gifts not to be received by political parties and candidates. The government also notes that the terms of proposed section 306A are not exactly the same as those in current section 306. In particular, the government notes that the proposed provision does not limit the receipt of a loan to those circumstances listed in section 306 for the receipt of a gift. So what you have is not a complete replication, if you like, of a provision dealing with loans such as the one we currently have dealing with gifts.
Proposed section 306A would cover all loans received by a political party, state branch of a political party, a person acting on behalf of a political party, a candidate, a member of a group or person acting on behalf of a candidate or group and not just loans received for the benefit of the party, branch, candidate or group. The coverage is wide indeed.
Given that a difference in wording is employed, it would be reasonable to assume that the proposed provision was intended to be interpreted in a manner that was different from the general interpretation given to section 306. This is a reasonable conclusion because there is a departure between 306A 
 and the current 306. It would be open, for example, to interpret the provision to mean any loan of more than $1,500 received by a candidate at any time during the relevant disclosure period.
That raises the question of a situation where you have an unsuccessful candidate in a previous election. Where you have someone who has run unsuccessfully in an election and who then renominates at a subsequent election, the relevant disclosure period covers all the preceding time running from the second election to a period starting 30 days after the previous election. That could cover a period nearly as long as three years.
What is problematical here is that this coverage could include all personal loans made to the individual possibly for the benefit of some other person or entity. This could include loans taken out by a candidate for the benefit of a spouse, a sibling or an organisation for which the candidate was a guarantor—in other words, personal matters relating to that candidate. It could cover all manner of things—hire-purchase agreements, home loans, personal loans. Also, the proposed definition of `loan' in the opposition's provision is the first time that an attempt has been made to have the term `loan' defined in the Electoral Act.
The proposed definition is broad in that it covers any form of financial accommodation and any transaction, whatever its terms or form, which in substance affect a loan of money. The government has not had the opportunity to have this definition considered in detail by parliamentary counsel and is, therefore, unable to inform the Senate as to the possible implications of the provision. I note that the opposition say they have taken the term `loan' from taxation legislation. I understand that definition to have been in place for only a year, so it has not yet been fully tested.
It would be premature to include that definition in the Electoral Act, in that you are looking at a term which is being used for taxation purposes. What I am saying here is that, really, this definition is something which has been transposed by the opposition from one piece of legislation to another. That is not 
 normally a wise course of action, because the respective pieces of legislation could well require different definitions.
What is clear is that the proposed provision will treat credit card debts incurred by way of Mastercard or Visa cards quite differently from debts incurred by way of credit providers who are, in effect, financial associations, such as Diners Club or American Express. They are different in their make-up to Visa card and Mastercard. The position of credit providers like AGC, who have an association with a financial institution but are not necessarily themselves a financial institution, is unclear.
The opposition, I assume, would argue that this would not be a problem because the proposed provision only involves debts in excess of $1,500. It is, however, not clear in the proposed provision whether the $1,500 limit is a cumulative or aggregate figure. It is quite possible that the provision could be interpreted to mean a loan by way of credit advance by a credit company over the full disclosure period and not just each individual transaction. In these circumstances, it could be necessary for every candidate to detail every credit card transaction where that credit card was not held with a financial institution and the total credit provided exceeded $1,500. This, I would submit, is not an intended result.
In summary, the government does not object to the principle incorporated in the opposition's provision. What the government believes should happen is that this matter should be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for thorough investigation. The government believes that there is merit in what the opposition is proposing. But what it does say is that this has not stood the test of sufficient scrutiny and investigation. The government has supported the first three proposals put forward by the opposition. The remaining three, it says, require investigation, and the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters is the place where that should be done.
I reiterate that the government is not unwilling to look at this matter. It is not a question of the government disagreeing in principle 
 with what the opposition is proposing. It is not a question of the government being obstructive. It is a question of the government saying, `This is a very involved area where the technical detail has to be right.' We have a mechanism in place to give this sufficient scrutiny, and that is the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which already has, as its terms of reference, a review of the last election. This matter could be easily incorporated in that review. On that basis, the government cannot see its way clear to supporting these proposals by the opposition.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-02-18,"—Very briefly, I think that even the most generous person would have to describe that contribution by the minister on this important issue as particularly weaselly. Minister, one can come only to the conclusion that you do not want the definition of a loan placed by your own government in the Income Tax Assessment Act in this particular act because you simply have got something to hide.
Minister, you have indicated to us that this was the definition of a loan that came about as an amendment to legislation brought about while your own government was in office. You are saying there might be some weaknesses in the definition. If there are weaknesses in the definition, you should not have seen your way clear to enshrine it in the Income Tax Assessment Act. I think that is an extremely long bow for you to draw here in the committee, and the committee is entitled to be very cynical and sceptical about the nature of the carefully worded response that you have given, describing, in our own words, some of this as problematical. I do not think it is problematical legislatively, and I think you know that. It is problematical politically and it is problematical politically only to the Liberal Party. That is the problem we have got here.
The opposition wants to ensure this loophole or apparent loophole in the Electoral Act is closed so it cannot be exploited in the way it has been exploited thus far through the use of the Greenfields Foundation vehicle. That is our intention. Not one substantive argument 
 comes forward from you. I am not convinced on this occasion about some suggestion that a reference to the joint standing committee is the way to go. If we have a situation which does not deal with a massive exploitation of an apparent loophole in the act to the tune of a $4.65 million loan, then perhaps the issue can go off to the JSCEM. The problem there, as you know full well, Minister, is that there is a government majority on that committee.
This matter has been one of considerable public debate and notoriety now for in excess of a year since the activities of the Greenfields Foundation were first exposed. This committee has looked at this issue before. At that time it determined not to move in the direction that the opposition strongly argued for in relation to closing the loophole, but since that time more evidence has come forward. The AEC has served notice under the act and, frankly, Minister, you have not been able to put up any argument at all in relation to these amendments. It is merely that they do not suit the political party which you are a member of. I think you have to be a little broader than that. We have to look at the integrity of our electoral system and the integrity of the act. If any political party decides it is going to take a course of action which deliberately contravenes the spirit of the act and attempts to exploit an apparent loophole in the act, then I think the committee and this parliament have a responsibility to act.
It was a miserable defence, Minister, with respect. I think these are very strong amendments. The substantive issues that were raised by you, Minister, have clearly been addressed in the revised amendments in relation to credit cards and the definition of a loan. I am very doubtful on the issue of credit cards, but they may well have had some substance in relation to the definition of a loan. If it is an issue, it has been resolved in the revised amendment. I commend these amendments to the committee.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-02-18,"—I have been listening to the contributions made by both Senator Faulkner and Senator Ellison. Clearly, if this is to be effective at all, there must be a definition of 
 a loan. If I did not know the minister as being one of the most honourable and efficient members of this government, I would have thought he was having a lend of us by the response that he gave to us. The minister says that there has not really been time for the OPC to have a look at this. I think it is a very important issue, and the OPC frequently drops everything at the request of a government to have a look at a very important question. The definition of a loan is important for the integrity of this measure. The minister himself says the government agrees with propositions one, two and three. If the general thrust of the policy that appears to be accepted right throughout the chamber is going to be truly effective, then we do need to have a definition of a loan.
Failing anything else, I think the chamber ought to adopt the definition that is in the taxation legislation. Mind you, there are a number of things in the taxation legislation with which many of us disagree, including the rather cumbersome proposition in the taxation legislation which deals with the question of avoidance. It empowers the Taxation Commissioner to deem that an act that has been done in fact has not been done and that an act that has been done was done at another time than it was done. We came across it the other day. It is in the taxation legislation, but it is also in the legislation that is coming before us, the GST legislation. As I say, I think the OPC can at times use more felicitous words than it does to achieve the policy objectives.
Failing any other suggestions before the chamber, I feel inclined now to vote for the definition as contained in the taxation legislation. No doubt there will be time to amend the legislation if it proves to be insufficient for the purpose, unless there is some big rush on at the present moment to get everything in place for a double dissolution later this year. If that is not the case, why not put it in now and then we will have plenty of time to amend the legislation if the definition of `loan' in the taxation legislation is proven to be inadequate.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-02-18,"—Having listened to the debate and to Senator Harradine's contribution, the Demo 
 crats are of a like mind. It is important to emphasise again that this amendment and this issue we are dealing with are fundamental—or certainly fundamental from the perspective of the Democrats—to transparency in the Electoral Act and the public's ability to know who is providing support to political parties.
As I said yesterday in the debate on this legislation, it is important for all politicians and parliamentarians—people involved in politics—to work to increase public confidence in our political system, which is something that we all know is at a low ebb, to put it mildly. Any measure that seeks to address that and address concerns that the public may have about potential loopholes in the act in relation to disclosure of funding is something that the Democrats strongly support.
—The question is that opposition amendments Nos 5 and 6 on sheet 1231 and amendment No. R4 on sheet 1244 be agreed to.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
—On the running sheet, Minister, I believe there are now two items you now want to take together—that is, amendments Nos 2 and 4 on sheet VW203 and amendments Nos 3 and 1 on sheet VW203. I understand a revised sheet is being circulated in the chamber that removes amendment No. 3 and changes amendment No. 1. Is that correct?
—Yes, that is correct.
—So you are moving both of those two items on the running sheet together with the deletion of amendment No. 3 and the amendment to amendment No. 1?",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-02-18,"—by leave—That is correct, Mr Chairman. I move:
(1)	 Clause 2, page 2 (lines 4 and 5), omit subclause (3), substitute:
	 (3)	 Items 19, 20 and 24 commence on a date to be fixed by Proclamation.
(2)	 Schedule 1, page 8 (after line 13), after item 31, insert:

	 After ""shall send"", insert ""or arrange for the delivery of"".
These amendments deal with commencement dates and really are of a technical nature. One deals with the sending out of material to postal voters and provides that the same material be sent out to the postal voter as that provided to a voter who attends a polling booth.

—So amendment No. 3 is not being moved?
—No. That is why I took the time at the start of these two sections to make clear what I believed the minister was moving and what was the before the chair. The minister has clarified that. Amendment No. 3 is definitely not being moved, amendments Nos 2 and 4 are being moved and amendment No. 1 is being moved in an amended form whereby all the item numbers, with the exception of Nos 19, 20 and 24, are being removed.

 and 4, and amendment No. 1 is in a revised form, and those revisions, of course, are consequential to previous decisions of the committee. I think the opposition can see its way clear to support the government's amendments.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-02-18,"—I have opposition to the government amendments as outlined. Under the present act, people who need an assisted vote—for example, people who cannot see ballot papers, who do not have English as their first language or who are illiterate—can go into a polling booth with a friend of their choosing to fill in the ballot paper, but with these government amendments electoral officials and scrutineers would also watch them fill in the ballot paper. That is how the amendment put forward by the government reads to the community groups who have contacted my office about this. The amendment says:
. . . the presiding officer must mark, fold, and deposit the voter's ballot paper, in the presence of:
(c)	 such scrutineers as are present and such person (if any) as has been appointed by the voter—
On the face of it, that means the old situation of having only the friend of the voter see how the ballot paper is marked has changed to the situation where the friend of the voter plus the officials are present when the marking of the ballot paper takes place.
It is, of course, already difficult for people with the problems I have listed to have a secret vote. They must have somebody there of their choosing, but to add to that the need to have officials from the electorate office present is retrograde. I am moving to keep the situation as it is which is preferable for sight-impaired people, people whose first language is not English and people who are illiterate.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-02-18,"—The opposition has become more concerned about these particular items. I have listened carefully to what Senator 
 Brown has said and I have had a number of representations made to me, particularly from the Aboriginal community, on this issue. These items provide that the presiding officer at a polling place is the only person who can assist a voter to mark their ballot paper. The voter's friend may still be present; however, for the first time scrutineers are required to observe the process.
On the surface, this actually seems like quite a reasonable provision, I think it is fair to say. But if you consider a scenario where someone needs an assisted vote—they might have a disability, English language problems or be illiterate—as the act currently stands, this person would just take their voter friend to help them vote. Now we are going to have a situation where four people effectively will be in the booth—the voter, their friend, a presiding officer and a scrutineer.
My concern is growing, frankly, that this is going to be pretty intimidating for voters with a disability or literacy or English language difficulties. The spirit of the act and the spirit of our democratic process that a person's vote should be personal and confidential is always at issue with these sorts of items. It is never easy in these circumstances, and ensuring that we meet the spirit of the act is difficult. We have a situation here where the secret ballot is shared by at least three others.
I am worried that this is going to be particularly intimidating for Aboriginal voters in places like the Northern Territory, Western Australia and regional Queensland. I know that my colleague Senator Crossin wants to speak further about those matters, so I will leave it there. But I think the government will need to mount a strong case for these items.
As I have indicated, the opposition's concerns here have developed quite considerably. I know that the opposition and other senators have received some very strong representations about this in relation to its impact on voting for those classes of people who need an assisted vote. I must indicate that the opposition certainly believes, unless some case to the contrary can be made, that it is better in these circumstances to omit these items. ",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1999-02-18,"—I would like to take the committee through the current situation and what is proposed. If it is clearly set out, then people will understand that what is being proposed will be much more restrictive and will impinge very heavily on the person's right to maintain their ballot as secretly as possible. The proposals are being overly prescriptive—for what reasons I have not yet been able to ascertain.
 If I am severely handicapped, I do not have the physical ability to be able to write on the ballot paper. If I am illiterate or innumerate, then I clearly would know which party I wanted to vote for but I may not be able to write the numbers one to nine or the numbers one to 15 sequentially. I know that for most people that is probably a fairly hard prospect to comprehend. But in places like outback Western Australia—I had a discussion with my colleague Senator West yesterday about this—and particularly the Northern Territory, you have very elderly and senior traditional Aboriginal people who do not know how to write the numbers. That is one problem I know we have ascertained during the last few elections.
They do not always vote Labor. In fact, statistics will show you that is not the case. So this is not a party political discussion here; this is about pressing an argument to maintain people's right to be able to have a confidential vote. It means that a disabled or an illiterate person, who clearly knows whom they want to vote for, ask their voter's friend—Senator Faulkner referred to them as a voter's friend; it might be a relative or it might be somebody else in the community—to come into the polling booth with them. They probably say to them, `I want to vote for this party. Can you mark my ballot paper for me?' That is what that person does. At the moment that is all that happens. That vote stays confidential between the voter and the person who is marking their ballot paper. Then the ballot paper is put in the box.
 At the moment, if that person has no assistant, then the presiding officer marks the ballot paper and, of course, scrutineers can be present. The current situation is that we can 
 have two people in a ballot box, and sometimes three if the presiding officer is there. But what you are proposing is that the person can bring in their assistant to vote but the presiding officer must be the person who marks the ballot paper. So already the confidentiality is gone. But not only that, the suggestion is that the presiding officer must also be watched by scrutineers, if they are there, and the assistant's friend, if that person is there.
 In the situation where a person clearly knows who they want to vote for but just cannot mark the ballot paper, we have gone from having two people or maybe three people currently to having possibly five people watching that vote. Under the current situation, though, if you feel that a person is being intimidated by their friend or the presiding officer to vote in a way they do not want to, then the scrutineers from either party can step in if they feel that somebody is being coerced into a vote.
 What the changes are suggesting is that it automatically assumes that that vote must be supervised. I do not agree with the fact that people who are disabled, blind or illiterate need to have this overly prescriptive policing. We are talking about people who already have some inequity in society and who probably are not as strong in forcing their rights. I am wondering why there is a proposal to have scrutineers compelled to be present, if they are there, or to have the presiding officer being compelled to mark their ballot paper—when that is not necessarily the case. If you leave the wording in the act as it is now, it does not preclude the presiding officer from marking the ballot paper and it does not currently prevent scrutineers from intervening. But the changes require that those other people must be present. I think it severely restricts the right of people to vote as secretly as possible.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-02-18,"—I can understand the points that have been made by Senator Crossin, but I think you have to look at the question in this way: there needs to be some certainty, some guarantee, that how the person with a disability desires to vote has been recorded on that 
 ballot paper. You can have a situation where a friend, relative, et cetera, is being asked by the person with a disability to accompany them and to fill out the ballot paper, but there is no guarantee that that will be in the manner precisely that the person with the disability wants.
I come to the general question. I disagree with the government. I am not supporting the proposal that the presiding officer and the scrutineers be present with the voter and the voter's friend. That is five in the box, which is getting a bit cosy.
Some of the people who are concerned have put to me that this could take place in a very small town where the scrutineers of the Labor Party, the Liberal Party or the Democrats are known around the place—they might see the person in the pub on Friday or whatever—and they are going to know how that person with a disability voted. The question is: are they under the same penalty regime as an officer or as a worker of the Australian Electoral Commission?
So far as I understand, they are in respect of the disclosure but they are certainly not in respect of their continuing employment in the Electoral Commission, because they are not employed by the Electoral Commission. That is the added discouragement, if discouragement is needed, for the presiding officer, for example, to disclose how that person voted. That dissuasion is not there so far as the political party's scrutineers are concerned.
I can understand why the government has brought forward this measure—at present only the friend is required to be present. Unless Senator Brown can see his way clear to amending the legislation to require the presiding officer to be present, then we go back to the old act and the only person who is required by the voter to be present is the friend.
So all in all I suppose I have a halfway position. I haven't got an amendment to the amendment, but I am concerned about what the government is proposing here. Senator Brown has gone a very long way to remedy that, but I personally feel that the presiding officer needs to be present to guarantee the basic principle that what the voter wants recorded is recorded.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-02-18,"—Senator Harradine made some very good points. It is a complex matter. One thing that needs to be noted is that the very big majority of people who would be affected by the change in provisions here are indigenous people, or people who do not speak the English language—ethnic people who speak other languages. In that situation the presiding officers are really not going to be able to intervene in the relationship between the friend and the voter because the voter is going to be giving instructions in that language and the presiding officer is therefore not going to be party to whether those instructions are being carried out anyway. That is the major group that is affected in this situation.
Senator Harradine is quite right. With sight-impaired people the situation will be different. The presiding officer will give the assurance that the instructions are being carried out. However, the weight of the argument is very much in favour of just the friend being present. As Senator Crossin says, there is even some intimidation felt, rightly or wrongly, by people in small communities if a presiding officer is present and watching what they are doing. The law is there to make sure that that presiding officer does not say how you voted. Nevertheless, if you put yourself in the position of the voter, with the presiding officer present you would feel uncomfortable. That discomfort ought not be there in a system of secret voting, which is going to be valid as far as possible for all people. The best we can do is have the friend situation. In the absence of any strong argument brought forward, as Senator Faulkner said, the situation as it currently stands is far preferable to the one the government amendments would create.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-02-18,"—I understand what Senator Brown is saying. What he is proposing is better than what is here at present. I think it would be covered by an amendment to subsection 234(2)(c). Subclause 234(2) reads:
(2) If any voter satisfies the presiding officer that:
(a) the voter's sight is so impaired that the voter is unable to vote without assistance; or 

(b) the voter is so physically incapacitated or illiterate that the voter is unable to vote without assistance;
then the presiding officer must mark, fold, and deposit the voter's ballot paper, in the presence of:
(c) such scrutineers . . . 
I do not know whether we can do it on the run, but the person who is appointed by the voter ought to be the one who fills out the ballot paper. That is it in a nutshell. A polling official should be present at that time—not the scrutineers. But to do this on the run is a bit difficult.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-02-18,"—In view of the contribution made by Senator Harradine, for which I am obliged, perhaps the committee could report progress and we could have a look at this and get the drafting right. We could come to a drafting which might meet with the committee's approval, certainly one which might result in an improvement of things. But I think to do drafting on the run is always perilous. That would be my suggestion at this stage.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-02-18,"—I have no objection to the committee reporting progress while time is taken over this matter, but I would ask that Senator Harradine think about the important point of that rather pejorative term `illiterate'. I think it means `illiterate in English'. It catches most of the people who are going to be concerned about this issue. The presiding officers' presence in the booth with two people who are not speaking English and who are deciding how to mark a vote is not going to help ensure anything, other than that a voting paper is delivered to the ballot box, which is going to happen anyway. But it is going to bring a presiding officer unnecessarily into the booth to watch the vote being cast by people who do not speak English. There is no advantage in that happening, but there is a very clear disadvantage.
Many indigenous people, those that Senator Crossin was talking about, are unfairly going to have a presiding officer in the ballot box watching their vote being cast, without any advantage. I do not think that is too different from the presiding officer being in the ballot 
 box for the rest of us when we vote. I think you can argue that having the double-check for sight-impaired people may be a good thing or not. We really ought to leave it to the judgment of the person who is making the vote for their friend. I think that is the best that can be done. Therefore, rejecting the government amendments and keeping the status quo is by far the best option that we have.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-02-18,"—I would be very worried about Senator Harradine's proposal. It sounds to me like it is going to be an absolute nightmare, particularly in remote Aboriginal communities. I think it would mean many, many days extension of the time involved in the voting processes that are already in place, and I would be very concerned about it.
I do not think it is a good idea for the committee to report progress. We can see if we can work something through. I tend to think that the argument Senator Harradine mounted in our last debate would also apply in relation to this one. The choice before the committee at the moment is reasonably stark: it is to either go with these items in the bill or not go with them. To be frank with the committee, I have been changing my mind about this. I am a lot less comfortable with these items than I was previously.
The course of action preferred by the opposition is to vote to omit these items from the bill. This is an occasion, with respect to all members of the committee, where we can take some evidence in the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, have a look at the most sensible way of dealing with this, talk to those with experience who are directly involved and ensure that we do not make a massive mistake. I do not think this came through the joint standing committee.
Senator Ellison interjecting—
—Apparently, it did originally come through the joint standing committee. If it did, not enough thought has gone into it. I had a look at the report and I must say that I did not find it, Minister. I accept what you are saying. I accept that it is there and that it came through the joint 
 standing committee. I think the course of action, to my mind, is now becoming clear. A more sensible thing to do is for the committee to omit these items, to have a look at it, having sought evidence from people who are directly involved. If we are going to go down the track, let us not do it in a half-hearted way. Let us take some evidence and be absolutely clear that any change we make to the act is a good one and a sensible one that will work in the interests of the AEC and the electoral process and those voters who may have a physical incapacity or impairment, voters who might be illiterate or voters who might not have English as a first language and so on. That is the sensible way of proceeding. I would commend that to the committee.
I think it would be a mistake to report progress. We might be able to satisfy some concerns in the committee, but I am pretty sure in the time available we will not be able to satisfy the sorts of concerns that have been raised in representations to senators. I would commend that course of action to the committee. We should omit these items. Let us ask the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to have a serious look at this. We should engage some people who have direct involvement with and experience of how these processes work. If there is a need for a change to the act, let us come up with the right change on the basis of a thorough examination.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-02-18,"—I would like to speak in relation to the Democrats' position on this issue. I have refrained from speaking to date. I have listened to some of the various views that have been put forward. As has been said by one other contributor, drafting or amending on the run is a fairly risky process, particularly when you are dealing with a reasonably sizeable act like the Electoral Act. The issues that have been raised are very important ones. The Democrats have also had similar representations from community organisations.
I think the concerns that have been put forward by Senator Crossin and others and the representations that the Democrats have received are sufficiently strong that we would 
 not be of a mind to support the section of the legislation, as it stands, that seeks to amend the act.
I do take on board Senator Harradine's concern about the need—and this is obviously the intention of the amendment—for the presiding officer, as an impartial officer of the Electoral Commission, to witness the vote to ensure that the person's vote is being cast in the way that they intend. Although I must say that if there are two people in a polling booth talking in a traditional Aboriginal language and the presiding officer does not know the language, then I am not sure how they are going to be able to be sure about whether the voter's desires are being fulfilled anyway. I suspect that is something that would be very difficult to absolutely guarantee without requiring access to translators and so on, which would obviously become impractical. But it is an important issue.
A lot of different competing issues come in, such as the privacy aspect that was raised—the problem of having, particularly in smaller areas, smaller towns, two or three scrutineers watching over your shoulder and seeing how you vote and being able to wander off down the road and tell the rest of the town, or the prospect of that anyway. That is certainly a serious concern, and certainly a fundamental component of our electoral system stretching back many years is the right to a secret ballot. I think it is important to emphasise—in fact, from memory, from reading through a few of the submissions that have already come in to the current inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters—that that is an issue that has been raised by a member of the public in relation to the fact that visually impaired people actually do not have the right or the opportunity to be able to cast a secret ballot in many circumstances currently.
It is important to emphasise that because it is a fundamental principle of our act and of our electoral tradition. On the surface this may seem like a small matter but it actually deals with some fairly fundamental principles in respect of the operation of our Electoral Act—whether it is a secret ballot issue as against, obviously, another crucial issue of whether the person's vote is being cast in a 
 way that meets their wishes. It is also very important to maximise the opportunity to guarantee that.
Those are some of the competing issues that are involved in this part of the bill. Certainly, as it stands, to require only the presiding officer to be able to mark the ballot paper and also to enable any number of scrutineers to witness the whole operation is something that the Democrats believe is not an appropriate solution to what the government is trying to address, and we do not support this section of the bill as it stands.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech

that in relation to assisted voting, section 234(1) of the Electoral Act be repealed, and section 234(2) be amended to allow any polling official (rather than a ""presiding officer"") to assist a voter.
Quite clearly, this matter was canvassed. The government was of the view that should be the presiding officer rather than any polling official because of the seniority of the person concerned. So the question of assistance to the voter was covered in recommendation 20.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-02-18,"—With respect, that is completely different. This recommendation of the joint standing committee is completely different to these items.
—You said that the question of assisted voting was not covered.
—Minister, as you know, I asked how this got into the bill. It did not come out of the joint standing committee at all, did it? Recommendation 20 of the joint standing committee says:
that in relation to assisted voting— 

you read it out—
section 234(1) of the Electoral Act be repealed and section 234(2) be amended to allow any polling official (rather than a ""presiding officer"") to assist a voter.
This is not what is before us. This is the point I am making. I say again to the committee: the smart thing here is to omit these particular items that somehow—not via the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters but through some other processes that remain unknown to me and unknown to the committee, and perhaps unknown to the government and its advisers—have turned up in this bill that we are debating in the committee stage in this Senate. The truth is the specific proposals contained in these items ought to be examined. That is the substance of what I am saying, and I commend that approach to the committee.
Let us not go down this track of trying to work out some vaguely acceptable amendment to the current act when at the end of the day, if are to do that, we should do it with the benefit of advice and evidence from people who have a great deal more experience in these matters than most of the senators sitting in this chamber. I certainly accept that Senator Crossin, for example, knows a great deal more about it than I do and has had a lot more personal experience with it than I have. Most senators are in exactly the same boat as I am.
What is the sensible thing to do in this circumstance? I do not want be conned that this has come out of the joint standing committee. It has not. The recommendation of the joint standing committee has very little to do with the items that are before us. Let's do this properly in the time available. This is the point of Senator Harradine made just a moment ago in debating another amendment before the committee. We have got enough time to do this properly. This significant change to the act that might affect many people in the community who want to participate in the democratic process should not be dealt with in this way.
I strongly believe that it would be inappropriate for us to report progress because, if we do, we are not going to have the advan 
 tage of the sort of examination that I think is required in relation to this issue—if we are going to change the act and the way these provisions work. That is basically an unarguable case, and I will not be supporting a proposition that we report progress. I will certainly support Senator Brown's approach of omitting these items from the bill, and I will also be supportive of any endeavours on the part of the government or other senators who would want to see these issues investigated further in a sensible way, drawing on experiences of people who might be able to provide valuable insights and guidance for the benefit of the committee, as we seriously look at any way we might substantively change the Electoral Act.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-02-18,"—Well, that is Senator's Faulkner's decision, Mr Temporary Chairman, and he might have to wear it. The situation is that if you adopt this amendment, the current legislation will still be inadequate to guarantee authoritatively that what the voter wants goes on the ballot paper. If we carry this, that inadequacy will still exist.
As I understand it, the real concern of the people who have been making representations is that the party scrutineers are able to see what the individual is putting on the ballot paper—that is the problem. I do not think that is acceptable. I am trying to get them right out of it and have a friend do the marking of the ballot paper, witnessed by the  presiding officer or the polling official. I would have thought that was a much better interim situation than either allowing the bill to remain as it is or accepting the government's proposal. If you do not want that as an improvement then you will end up with nothing.
—I do not want the government's amendment.
—Well, you are going to get the government's amendment. I am going to a meeting of a committee which I am urgently required to attend. You can please yourself. That will be the outcome. You have got a choice: you can either go along with it to get a better situation than is currently in the legislation; or you can accept an opportunity to quickly rephrase it along the 
 lines that I was suggesting, that the friend of the voter marks the ballot paper and that is witnessed by the polling officer.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1999-02-18,"—Senator Harradine, you make some very valid points. One of the problems—which we always grapple with—is whether or not the voter's friend accurately records the intent of the voter. That is a problem, but now that I have listened to what the report recommends, I realise it goes much further than the current suggestion before us. If you picked up what the report suggested, which was to delete section 234(1), then you miss out entirely on the intent of what a definition of a voter's friend is and how they can be appointed. So that needs to stay there. But the current legislation, particularly section 234(2), says that where there is no voter's friend, only the presiding officer can mark the ballot paper. That is a problem too, because in a booth where you have a couple of hundred people who might need that assistance, the need for the presiding officer is clearly too restrictive and you might need other polling officials to mark the ballot paper.
In one sense, the current legislation does need amending to make it more flexible, but the set of amendments that you have put before us goes way beyond that. Requiring scrutineers to be present is too restrictive and their presence could be quite intimidating. Senator Harradine does make a valid point, but how does anybody guarantee that the voter's intention is recorded accurately unless somebody else witnesses it? It is up to the voter, of course, to get a presiding officer or a polling official to supervise what their voter's friend does, if they feel uncomfortable about it.
In one respect, I support what Senator Faulkner was saying. The person's right to be able to record their ballot secretly is too important for us to amend this on the run. But your current proposal is far too restrictive and impinges too much on a person's right to maintain their ballot as secretly as possible.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-02-18,"—I have been thoroughly convinced on one matter—that is, that the committee should not report progress—by the very cogent 
 argument put forward by Senator Faulkner. If this is going to be altered, if there is some other middle ground going to be reached and we do not have a recommendation from the relevant committee, then it ought to go back to those people who are affected. There ought to be time for that and there ought to be thorough consultation with the community—the very people who are affected by this, including the people that Senator Crossin refers to.
The second point is that I believe Senator Harradine has not heard the argument against a polling official being present when a voter and her or his friend is in the booth, whether they like it or not. That should be an option that is available to the voter. For us to dictate that a polling official should be there as a watch on the friend because the voter does not have English as their first language or they are sight impaired not only is a declaration that the voter's choice of friend cannot be trusted but also imposes the presence of a polling official where some people may absolutely not want that.
One does not have to have much of an imagination to know that in small communities polling officials and voters are going to be mixing and the voters put at a disadvantage. So Senator Harradine's argument does not hold up, except in the circumstance that we go out to the communities and say, `Is this what you want?' We should not be imposing on the voter polling officials—presiding officers or otherwise—who are very often the local official, the local school teacher or the publican appointed for this purpose. It is quite wrong for Senator Harradine, or for me or for anybody else to be dictating that that official be there, when the voter simply wants their friend. I disagree with Senator Harradine. We should not be dictating some form of middle ground, any more than we should be accepting the dictates of the government's amendments.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-02-18,"—Just briefly, I note that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters did recommend that section 234(1)(b) be repealed, and that is in our amendments today. It did suggest that 
 there be a polling official present. We varied that to make it only a presiding officer. This matter was subject to scrutiny in the previous report, the 1996 federal election report by the JSCEM, so the government says that this has been addressed previously. However, although the government thinks Senator Harradine's suggestion might have some merit and does merit further inquiry, because the time now is short—if progress was to be reported we would not get this back on today—the government is not going to pursue that line of action. The proposal before the committee should be put and voted on and we will get on with the rest of the bill.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-02-18,"—One of the other points that has been made that is worth re-emphasising is that, unless there is something strange happening in the mind of the government in terms of its electoral strategy, we do have plenty of time to look at this. We are not likely, one would hope, to be faced with an election immediately. We do have another joint standing committee inquiry happening which is going to report before the end of this year. I have already indicated that the Democrats are not supportive of what is in the legislation as it stands.
I do have a lot of interest in the proposal Senator Harradine was voicing, but we obviously do not have an amendment dealing with that before us at the moment. Nor, as Senator Brown pointed out, have we had the opportunity to more fully explore the community's and the affected people's desire about this, which is an important thing. So, given the fact that, one would hope, we have two or three years before the next election and a committee inquiry is going to report before the end of the year, then the Democrats believe it is something that we should not support in its current form. We have plenty of time to look at it and come up with an improved version in the next year or two.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-02-18,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998  is an omnibus bill of some 10 measures. It was introduced into the House of Representatives in early November last year and passed with the support of the opposition in late November last year. As is usual practice, this bill gives legislative backing to this government's standard practice of policy by press release. For instance, the changes to deductible expenditure for capital gains tax purposes was announced by the Treasurer in the May 1997 budget. It is February 1999 and only now has the Senate the opportunity to examine these changes. This is just another example of the government's general incompetence when it comes to administering its legislative program. A measure that was announced nearly two years ago has finally reached this chamber. This is simply not good enough.
To the bill itself, the measures in the main seek to make void tax avoidance schemes and, in the case of the CGT provisions relating to capital losses, the cessation of the artificial manipulation of these provisions which result in greater tax loses being claimed relative to the actual economic loss that has been incurred. For those senators who are interested, there is a good working example of this abuse on page 12 of the explanatory memorandum to the bill.
The changes to the capital loss provisions are stated as protecting $100 million in revenue. I note for the record that my col 
 league in the other chamber Mr Kelvin Thomson made mention of the fact that the Australian Taxation Office had commented on these changes in a Financial Review article on 20 November last. He sought from the minister a response about the effectiveness of the provisions now before us to counter the kinds of schemes that were referred to in the Financial Review. I would also seek a similar response from the minister here today as I do not remember seeing what Minister Hockey's reply to those provisions was, if he replied to them at all.
Skipping through the bill slightly but still in the area of changes to capital gains tax, schedule 7 will seek to ensure that, where an entity claims deductions for income tax purposes for capital assets, those deductions will now have to be deducted from the cost base of that capital asset for capital gains tax purposes. Building depreciation is a classic example of expenditure which will now have to be deducted from the adjusted capital cost base for a subsequently sold asset. This change will eliminate an effective double deduction for such expenditures in that, until the Treasurer's announcement, they reduced both the taxable income flow from an asset as it is earned and the amount of the capital gain which is eventually taxable when the asset is disposed of.
As stated earlier, not only is this measure nearly two years old but the Treasurer also has had to subsequently amend his original decision under pressure from the building industry and the Labor Party to provide transitional relief to taxpayers who were hit unexpectedly by the government's original announcement. Now expenditure incurred until 30 June 1999 on land or buildings owned as at the 1997 budget will not be affected. We in the opposition support this welcome change.
Schedule 10 of the bill relates to the depreciation of assets. This measure clarifies the Australian Taxation Office's interpretation of existing provisions applying to formally tax exempt entities which became the subject of taxation between 1 July 1988 and 2 July 1995. This measure will ensure consistent treatment of assets for depreciation purposes 
 for entities that came into the tax system between 1988 and 1995. Such entities include specific types of superannuation funds, some Commonwealth government business enterprises that have come into the income tax net—for example, Telstra and Australia Post—and state government business enterprises which have been privatised wholly or partially. It also includes some private entities that have lost their tax exempt status such as sporting clubs due to a change in the nature of their operations.
It is interesting to note that state governments and particularly the Kennett government in Victoria used as a selling point when flogging every state asset that he could the tax benefit from doing so of the depreciation charges available. In essence, the Kennett government was using the Commonwealth Treasury and therefore all Australian taxpayers as subsidy providers in order to prop up the sale of Victorian public assets. This measure will now put an end to such a practice.
The next measure I will discuss is schedule 9 of the bill which relates to the average calculated liabilities of life insurance companies. As the law currently stands, it requires that life companies use calculated liabilities at the end of the financial year to determine the amount of exempt income to be allocated to the immediate annuity policies. As a result, this has caused distortions where the proportion of liabilities at the end of the year do not reflect the experience through the year. Due to these distortions, the possibility exists for manipulation by life companies of these liabilities which then flow through to the amount of income tax that would be payable. Changing to an averaged calculated liabilities method will address this problem. It will protect revenue to the tune of about $100 million per annum.
While on the issue of insurance companies, schedule 8 relates to the tax treatment of the passive income of insurance companies. At present, the formula used for determining the passive income of controlled foreign companies of insurance companies is flawed. As the law is, passive income of insurance companies does not fall foul of the existing 
 rules and thereby escapes Australian tax. This allows life and general insurance companies to obtain a significant advantage in respect of offshore investment income.
This bill proposes a new formula to countenance that problem. It is estimated that it will raise some $10 million in revenue per annum. I have to say that we support this measure. We support it because it overcomes an unintended technical consequence of the existing legislation which frees some foreign income from tax when it should be subject to Australian tax.
Schedule 6 of the bill deals with the question of dividend imputation and retirement savings accounts. Under the government's proposals, dividend imputation credits or debits will be prevented from arising from the payment or refund of tax where those amounts are attributable to the RSA business of a life assurance company. This is not intended to punish RSAs relative to other superannuation funds; it simply ensures that life assurance companies do not get a windfall under the dividend imputation system. Labor supports this amendment.
Next we have schedule 4, which concerns the effect of bankruptcies on carrying forward tax offsets. These are technical amendments which simply propose that the tax rebate available for landcare type expenditures for farmers will not be available to be carried forward into future years for a taxpayer who becomes a bankrupt. We do not oppose that amendment.
Schedule 11 pertains to company tax instalments. The timing of when a company has to pay company tax depends on whether it is classified as small, medium or large—with large companies paying earlier than medium companies and small companies paying later still. The grouping measures that are part of that cover superannuation funds. The inclusion of superannuation funds is inappropriate as it can unfairly penalise a genuine medium size firm by including, for instance, a company super fund in the grouping provisions. Thus, the medium size company is treated as a large company for company tax instalment purposes when, obviously, it is not. Labor, therefore, supports this amendment.
The final measures in this bill deal with changes to the fringe benefits tax regime. The government proposes five changes to fringe benefits tax. Included amongst these is the exemption of all taxi travel to and from work from a fringe benefits tax. This extends the exemption granted by Labor in 1995 to out-of-hours travel—that is, travel after 7 p.m. or before 7 a.m. On balance, Labor has made a decision to support this amendment, as we have other proposals which involve exempting certain carparking fringe benefits provided by small business. 
The other measures alter the range of provisions which deal with situations where a third party provides a fringe benefit to an employee either on behalf of an employer or with their involvement. The new proposals purport to simplify what are very complex existing rules although they may make them worse in some circumstances. Nevertheless, we do need to have rules in this area to ensure that fringe benefits tax cannot simply be avoided by someone other than the employer providing the fringe benefits. The other changes go to the way in which employers will maintain fringe benefit tax records. These proposals came out of the Bell review of small business. They are not opposed by the Labor Party.
Finally, there are some changes in the payments of tax by small companies. These benefit small businesses only and on that basis we support them. The cost to revenue of this particular measure will be negligible.
I would now like to make some general comments. When this bill was debate in the House, my colleague Mr Kelvin Thomson moved a second reading amendment in respect of the bill. To save the time of the Senate, I do not propose to do that, but I will speak on the substance of the issue the amendment went to. That issue is the government's lack of commitment to stamping out the aggressive new tax avoidance culture that has developed under this government. It is my concern that this government is blinded by ministerial personal interest as opposed to what is in the public interest when it comes to the issue of tax avoidance. This is most notable in the area of trusts.
One cannot help but wonder, every time Treasury presents a proposal regarding the abuse of trusts, whether the government conducts a survey of its frontbench members to determine whether the proposal will offend any of the trust-owning members of the government. In the last parliament, the opposition identified, from memory, 19 trust-owning, tax avoiding members of the frontbench. Whether that number has increased or not, I do not know. What I do know is that this government has been loathe to move on the issue of the tax abuse of trusts.
I remember the paper that the government was going to release on the issue of trusts and tax avoidance. This paper was never released, on the basis that the issues it discussed were subsumed into the government's overall tax reform proposals. The real reason is that the government did not want the paper in itself to become the focus of attention to which individual ministers and their trust arrangements could then be held up to proper public scrutiny.
If the government has nothing to hide then it will release the paper. The reality, though, is that this government is a supporter of the tax avoidance industry. It has as its Prime Minister a man who presided over the worst abuses of our tax system ever seen—the bottom of the harbour period. What action did we then get from the then Treasurer, Mr Howard? He took no action over bottom of the harbour until the public outcry was so loud that he could no longer ignore it. The sad fact, though, is that he acted because he was forced to do so, not because he or the then Liberal government believed it was in the public interest to do so. It was a case of Johnny-come-lately by name and Johnny-come-lately by nature.
Sadly, we see a continuation of this ambivalence in the current government. A lot of rhetoric has been put out but not much substance has accompanied it. When we look at the previous antics of someone like Senator Parer and his myriad of tax schemes, is it any wonder that this government is soft on tax avoidance and tax avoiders when the Prime Minister himself condoned and justified the actions of the former minister for resources?
We now see the Prime Minister has had to lower his ministerial standards to meet the failures of his ministers, rather than ensuring that these failures never occurred in the first place. On a broader level, we have had the somewhat murky relationship between the Greenfields Foundation and the Liberal Party of Australia regarding the question of a $4.5 million loan, of which the full details have only now surfaced due to the persistent pressure of the Labor Party.
In conclusion, it is the Australian Labor Party that has had to enforce the Prime Minister's now defunct code of conduct. It is the Australian Labor Party that has had to drag this government, kicking and screaming, to the issue of tax avoidance. Sadly, this government puts ministerial or personal self-interest before the public interest. But this chamber can be assured that we in the opposition will continue to hold this government and its ministers accountable—as it is obvious that the Prime Minister will not do so.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-02-18,"—I am glad to have been preceded by my colleague Senator Cook, who has done a very capable wrap-up of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998. In his normal adequate and comprehensive manner, he has covered the issues raised by the legislation.
This bill covers the denial of certain capital losses, deductible expenditure and capital gains cost bases, depreciation, average calculated liabilities of life insurance companies, passive income of insurance companies, dividend imputation and retirement savings account changes, the effect of bankruptcy on carrying forward tax offsets, company tax instalments, payments of tax by small companies and, to the particular benefit of small business, fringe benefits tax changes. That is an awfully boring list when you read it out like that.
However, this kind of legislation is the bedrock of sound government administration. Most of these changes are very welcome and, in fact, improve both the integrity and the administration of the tax act and will contribute to the better management of tax affairs by businesses. So, overall, our compliments 
 go to the government on the bill. As you would have gathered from my remarks, we do support the bill. In particular, we are happy to see some of the onerous requirements of fringe benefits tax reporting being lifted from small business.
We also welcome the remarks of Senator Cook, although we probably would not express them in precisely the same manner. We certainly support his very strong urging of the government to pay attention to areas which are causing the tax office and the community at large—and, hopefully, the government itself—great concern. One of those areas is the erosion of our tax base and the integrity of our tax system through very aggressive tax planning which, to use a very commonly overworked term, is profoundly un-Australian, never mind anything else. I am sure that you are taking that to heart—at least I hope you are—and that both the tax office and the government will move to crack down on tax avoidance and unacceptable tax minimisation.
I would make the point that, contrary to recent comments of the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, the Australian Democrats are delighted to support fair and sensible removal of regulation from small business where that policy change is fair to all concerned—and we consider this to be one of those cases. We are also pleased to see the closing of the loophole in respect of artificially created capital losses.
As you know, the non-government parties and the government itself receive a lot of submissions from interested parties where such legislation is of interest to them. We have received very little correspondence in this area, and that indicates the full support in the community at large for this bill, despite it being lengthy and, no doubt, having a few little glitches and twitches here and there. But I think it points to the difference between this kind of legislation—legislation which the Senate can accept and will deal with quickly—and that of the ANTS tax reform package, which also is before us.
The other day, one of my fellow senators made a remark about the stupidity of those who need to take time to properly consider 
 legislation in this place. Just briefly, in response to that, we all know that the Senate is traditionally the chamber that reviews government legislation and subjects it to far greater scrutiny than ever occurs in the House of Representatives. Indeed, it is as a result of this scrutiny, in my opinion—and in the opinion of Australians, who vote differently in the Senate from the way they vote in the House of Representatives—that better legislation is delivered.
As we all know, this chamber has an extensive committee system, which allows for substantial public input and in-depth scrutiny of legislation; it is an invaluable process. But it is a process which, quite simply, takes time. It consumes a substantial amount of senators' time and a lot of resources. We are all in this chamber, across all the range of issues we deal with, generalists. There are very few specialists in this chamber. Therefore, we need to acquaint ourselves with the meaning of legislation and with its consequences.
The senator who made the remark about the stupidity of those who need to take time to properly consider legislation, I believe, might have been reflecting his own frustration at the fact that he probably had a lot more impact on legislation when he was in opposition than he now has in government.
Government senator interjecting—
—That may reflect an overheard remark and, therefore, I will not attribute it to the senator concerned. But it does indicate the difference between the frustrations of those in government, for whom every bill is urgent and unchangeable, and those of us who are non-government senators, whose job it is to do the difficult, and sometimes awkward, job of review.
The contrast between this bill and the 16 tax bills—which, I suspect, will increase to about 22—which govern the ANTS tax package is quite marked. Those bills represent over 600 pages of new legislation. Their effect will be to impose a new tax system. In contrast, we can, quite readily and easily, deal quite quickly with this bill. A new tax system strains the intelligence or the stupidity, depending upon your view of the rest of us in this chamber, much, much more.
As a party committed to review, we make no apologies for the process of review. But we make no apologies either for at times allowing a bill straight through with no amendments from us because, in our opinion, it is a good bill. This is one of those instances. We commend the government for bringing the bill before us. We indicate to you our support for it.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-02-18,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998  contains an array of provisions, including a crackdown on tax avoidance measures relating to the artificial creation of capital losses, changes to the calculation of capital gains tax, changes to an entity's tax status to cut down on depreciation advantages, reduction in compliance costs relating to fringe benefits tax and clarification of dividend imputation credits for life insurance companies. On the whole, the Greens (WA) are supportive of these measures. However, I would like to focus on two main issues raised by this bill. Firstly, I would like to discuss issues relating to tax avoidance and, secondly, I want to discuss the fringe benefits tax regime.
This bill attempts to tackle some areas that have been exploited for tax breaks. The Greens are certainly supportive of moves in this direction. However, we have major concerns about the government's general apathy in tackling some of the biggest issues in tax avoidance in Australia. The problem of tax avoidance in Australia is becoming more and more of a talking point. As Jennie George, President of the ACTU, has recently pointed out in committee hearings on the tax package, PAYE taxpayers are feeling that they are the only ones paying their fair share of tax in this country. They feel as if they do not have the ability to work the tax system and minimise their income tax as many high income earners are able to do. The average taxpayer does not have the money to be paying financial consultants, accountants and lawyers to devise elaborate schemes to evade the Australian Taxation Office. The average taxpayer cannot take advantage of the many tax effective products which are blatantly and aggressively marketed. Splashed unashamedly 
 in our weekend newspapers are advertisements that are selling expertise in tax minimisation techniques.
It may be argued that this is mere populist thinking that does not accord with reality. It may be argued that this is merely some kind of corporate bashing or cutting down the tall poppies. However, it seems that our very own Tax Commissioner shares elements of this populist thinking. It was reported earlier this month, on 1 February, on the news wire that internal memos issued by the Tax Commissioner, Michael Carmody, have warned that the tax system has been taken over by large companies and that they could not be trusted to pay their fair share of tax. Yes, our Tax Commissioner, who is absolutely in the thick of things, sees tax avoidance by large companies as a huge issue for Australia's revenue base.
Of course, the government's answer to our declining revenue base is to hit us with a GST. Certainly a broadening of consumption tax is one option that will help add to the revenue base, but at what cost? The cost is that it is the PAYE taxpayers, especially those on low incomes, who will be affected the most by the implementation of a GST. Even on the government's own figures, it is the high income earners who will gain the most from the tax package.
There is no real commitment to tackle the problems our Tax Commissioner has identified. Michael Carmody has also warned the government that the tax package will create fresh tax avoidance opportunities. Our Tax Commissioner is concerned that high income earners and businesses will take the opportunity to delay their income until July 2000 to take advantage of the tax cuts on offer. This will reduce revenue collection when the tax is finally paid. Michael Carmody estimates that it could deprive the budget of hundreds of millions—or even billions—of dollars. In addition, international experience suggests that the GST will create a whole new black market of its own.
Along with the tax package that is currently before the Senate, we have the review of business tax, the Ralph review, taking place. This review is not attempting to tackle any 
 issues such as how to maintain an adequate revenue base to meet our needs. The boundaries of the review are that it must be revenue neutral. It is also not attempting to tackle any issues of corporate tax avoidance. It would hardly be in many of the participants' interests to do so. The Greens have strongly argued that business tax should not be siphoned off into a separate debate. In fact, I moved a motion in the Senate last year to ensure the results of the review of business tax were known before the Senate debated the rest of the tax package. Unfortunately, this sensible motion was defeated so now we cannot look at the tax system as a whole and decide how we would like to structure it as a community. No, the business tax area has been shoved to one side so it cannot be touched in the more general debate about tax reform. So suggestions such as the minimum corporate tax that has been raised by many non-corporate players in the community barely rate a mention in the review of business tax. Many of these community and church groups do not have the time to engage in the RBT as they are struggling to try to inject some equity and fairness into the rest of the tax package.
Tax reform in this country needs to be holistic, transparent and fair. It is totally hypocritical of the government to undermine the Senate committee process by threatening to pull the whole tax package if the Senate makes any substantive changes. Yet, what is happening with business tax? Is the government trying to tell all those business folk making lengthy submissions that it is all in vain and that it will not be giving any concessions, making any adjustments? If the government does make concessions and alterations in the business tax arena, how can it then turn around and argue that any other changes that may benefit low income people, charities, community organisations or the environment are not possible? Could it be that there is one rule for the government's big business mates and one rule for the rest of the community?
While aspects of this bill are commendable, these measures to address avoidance do not go far enough and fail to address some of the most fundamental drains on our national 
 revenue. While the Greens (WA) would not expect one piece of legislation to be able to fix all aspects of tax avoidance, the government is closing its ears and eyes to the really big issue of tax avoidance in this country and, indeed, around the world. Obviously, the tax package put forward by the government could have realistically looked to the future and had the vision to see the realities of taxation in a global economy.
Tax officials have said that the growth of the Internet has made the use of tax havens easier than ever before. It is estimated that billions of dollars are escaping the tax net in this way. Is there any attempt to address this kind of issue? Not a mention.
One of the biggest challenges that faces Australia and the world is the ability of transnational companies, their contractors and their skilled employees to massively avoid tax. This is done by exploiting differences between national tax regimes and by using tax havens such as the Cayman Islands to hide their true financial position from the tax office. Electronic funds transfer is facilitating this massive leak from national tax revenues everywhere. We in this chamber have actually been creating a necessity for electronic transfers more and more because that is what banks want, that is what the big institutions want, and, therefore, it is easier for those institutions to avoid scrutiny.
A government with vision would be talking about the tough decisions that need to be taken to curb this kind of revenue leakage. What is really required is joint international action by governments to pursue transnational companies for tax avoidance. Others in the national arena are making these kinds of noises. It is about transfer pricing. It is about people who charge a lot for the goods they produce in the countries that charge the most tax. They make losses or only scrape even in those countries that charge the most tax, and they save their profits for those countries, or parts of their networks, which charge the least tax.
John Ralston Saul has been drawing attention to the statement recently issued by the Group of Seven in which they basically said they are going to bail out the bankrupt devel 
 oping countries. He points out that the third paragraph contains many statements of interest:
We commit to develop and implement international principles and codes of best practice on fiscal policy, financial and monetary policy, corporate governance and accounting. And to work to ensure private sector institutions comply with new standards of disclosure.
This is a good example of the moves toward joint international regulations—the way of the future that the government is failing to recognise. The Greens have been championing the kind of tax reform that goes to the heart of some of the biggest problems created by globalisation. Positive reforms such as the Tobin tax would assist in regulating the explosion of international financial speculation that acts like a giant vacuum cleaner sucking wealth from everyone around the world and concentrating it in the major financial centres located in the USA, Japan and Europe.
The government are trumpeting the fact that Australia is leading the world in bringing down tariff and non-tariff barriers. They have unilaterally reduced these rates, often to the detriment of many Australian industries and communities, and yet they shy away from being international leaders in progressive policy areas such as the Tobin tax, other international regulations of capital flows or strong stances on human rights on the basis that Australia is just a `middle power'. The Greens would like to see the government starting to talk about and engage in finding solutions to some of these issues.
The second issue I would like to briefly address is the changes to the fringe benefits tax regime. This bill relaxes the FBT regime in relation to small business and taxi travel. The Greens acknowledge that there is a difficult balance to be reached between fairly taxing all relevant income and creating enormous amounts of red tape that become a burden for small business. It is also important that strange anomalies be avoided or minimised in the quest to tax all Australians in a fair and equitable manner.
The position of the Greens (WA) on FBT and cars and parking is well known. In 
 principle, the Greens are not in favour of relaxing FBT for company cars and parking spaces as it encourages people to drive to work and generally use their cars more frequently. It is also an issue in terms of attempting to use economic measures and pricing mechanisms to encourage internalisation of the costs of the use of non-renewable resources.
The use of cars is perhaps one of the most wasteful uses of non-renewable energy in modern society. The environmental and associated health costs of using cars are well documented. There are huge health consequences from the rising levels of air pollution, but the community spends significant amounts of money rectifying or trying to rectify these health effects. Air pollution is a growing problem in our cities and the use of cars is a huge contributor to this increasing pollution. In addition, considering the growing problem of greenhouse gases, the overuse of motor vehicles is an issue that requires urgent attention. What would it mean in reality if we removed the fringe benefits tax on car parking spaces, especially where this is a substantial amount? My feeling is that it may in fact benefit those more wealthy employees for whom this is part of a tax avoidance package.
The Greens have acknowledged that compliance costs for small business is a significant issue. In our taxation platform for the previous election, one of the aims of the Greens (WA) was to reduce compliance costs where they are high, particularly where small and medium size businesses are affected. The issue of compliance costs will certainly be a big issue in the upcoming tax debate when every charity, community organisation and small business will become a mini tax agent for the government.
Indeed, Ray Reagan of the National Tax and Accountants Association has warned today that businesses face a $15 billion start-up cost to meet the introduction of the GST. In addition, he said University of New South Wales research showed the continuing annual cost to small business would run to thousands of dollars, not the $130 which the Howard government claimed. Are we really specifically aiming towards compliance costs for small 
 business? These figures show that it is unlikely that that is the aim of the government.
These issues of red tape versus using the taxation system for positive environmental outcomes are often difficult to reconcile. The Greens do acknowledge the comment of Professor Dixon that the FBT regime may not be the most effective vehicle to attempt to alter behaviour. In the absence of a user friendly transport system, many employees may drive to work any way. If this is so, the reality is that a car park is worth around $2,500 per year—more if it is in Sydney or Melbourne—and is likely to go to the more senior staff, who are likely to be high income earners. These are difficult issues to reconcile. I will be opposing changes to the fringe benefits tax on car parking, and I will discuss this issue in more detail in the committee stage of the bill.
Those companies who have located close to major transport routes, or those who have decentralised and located in areas where it is accessible and where there are not high levels of parking, may well be disadvantaged if we give a specific advantage to those companies who may be using a tax package to bolster the salaries and, therefore, competing unfairly with those companies who are trying hard to do the right thing. As I said, I will talk more about this issue in the committee stage of the bill.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-02-18,"—We have had a range of issues raised in the second reading debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998 . Some of the comments that were made by the speakers I applauded and agreed with, and some of them I did not. Some of them, particularly the end run of Senator Cook's speech when he was talking about the attitude of this government to tax avoidance, I totally rejected.
Having said that, the bill contains a number of measures—some are designed to protect revenue, some make technical changes, while others demonstrate the government's commitment to assist small business. For example, small business will benefit from changes to the fringe benefits tax and from the arrangements to allow small companies to pay their 
 tax later. The revenue will be protected by denying corporate groups the ability to multiply capital losses and by preventing taxpayers from claiming double deductions in certain circumstances.
This bill also ensures that tax exempt entities that become subject to tax have depreciation deductions and balancing adjustments based on notional written down values as if the entity had always been subject to tax. Also, this bill requires life companies to use average calculated liabilities rather than calculated liabilities at the end of the year of income. Finally, the bill corrects a deficiency in the formula used to calculate passive income of controlled foreign insurance companies.
I will give some brief comments on matters that were raised during the debate. First of all, Senator Cook brought to our attention a question that Mr Kelvin Thomson asked Mr Hockey during the debate in the House of Representatives on 26 November last year. That question was in fact responded to by Mr Hockey some days later on 1 December. I seek leave to incorporate that letter in the Hansard.
Leave granted.
The letter read as follows—
The Hon Joe Hockey MP
Minister for Financial Services and Regulation
Federal Member for North Sydney
1st December 1998
Mr Kelvin Thomson, MP
Member for Wills
Parliament House CANBERRA ACT 2600
Dear Mr Thomson
I am writing in response to the question you raised last Thursday, during the 2nd reading debate of Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No 2) 1998  (TLAB 2). You referred to an article in the Financial Review  of 20 November 1998 about creating capital losses by using structured finance products, and asked whether the measures to deny certain capital losses, contained in TLAB 2, will have an impact on such schemes.
The article stated that the general anti-avoidance provisions contained in Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936  will apply to deny the capital losses described in the Financial Review. 

I am advised that Part IVA can only apply to deny artificial capital losses in the financial year in which they are offset against capital gains, which can be significantly later than the year in which the losses are created. The measures contained in TLAB 2 include a proposed amendment to Part IVA so that artificial capital losses can be denied in the year in which they are created, if they are created by schemes entered into after this measure was announced (3 pm by legal time in the ACT, on 29 April 1997).
I am further advised that the income tax law, as it stands, can apply to deny capital losses created by the schemes mentioned in the Financial Review.  Whether Part IVA will apply to any particular scheme will depend on the facts of the case.
However the amendments contained in TLAB 2 allow the anti-avoidance provisions to apply more efficiently to artificially created capital losses which are used in a later financial year than that in which they were created.
Yours sincerely
(signed)
Joe Hockey, MP
Minister for Financial Services and Regulation
—Another matter raised by Senator Cook was the way this government deals with its business. My observation on that is that I think there is a difficult balance that I am not sure the Senate has fully addressed. If the Senate wishes to have very long, prolonged debates on bills, that is a matter for the Senate. On the other hand, those debates squeeze out other bills on the government's program, which inevitably leads to delays. I am not sure it helps when senators make bold claims about the mismanagement of the government's program when some very real issues are being addressed. I do not know at this stage how we successfully balance the legislative program with the right of the Senate to debate bills extensively.
In relation to Senator Cook's efforts on tax avoidance in the last part of his speech, Senator Cook and I have debated these issues on many occasions. The sorts of responses that I would bring to this debate are probably well known. This government moved very rapidly in the area of trust losses, which I do not think the Labor government did in all its years in office. We have moved to look at high wealth individuals. We have closed down a variety of schemes which came to be 
 exploited under the former government, such as R&D syndicates and so forth. So I put it on the record that this government has moved very strongly in this area to deal with what I think is a problem in relation to the aggressive tax planning that we see in Australia. We have moved to make sure we have a fair and equitable tax system.
Senator Margetts raised a very wide range of issues in relation to the tax package, and they are going to be debated very extensively in the coming months. It may well start today, if Senator Cook's committee can bring down its report. I do not propose to address those matters in any detail now. I thought Senator Murray's speech—and I agreed with 90 per cent of his speech, except for his very kind remarks about Senator Cook—covered the field pretty well. We welcome the support that the Democrats are giving to this bill. With those comments, I close my remarks.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1999-02-18,"—The stated purpose of 
 the Year 2000 Information Disclosure Bill 1999 is to encourage the voluntary disclosure and exchange of information about the year 2000 computer problems and remediation efforts by providing limited protection from civil liability for the year 2000 disclosure statements.
Its so-called Good Samaritan activity allows large organisations to provide smaller organisations with advice relating to Y2K, and this issue has been the source of some interest in the federal parliament over the last couple of years.
I would like to foreshadow an amendment that I will be moving in the Committee of the Whole that will require a process for parliamentary departments, Commonwealth departments and agencies to report back to the parliament for the purposes of improving public knowledge about progress to date with Y2K compliance.
The whole issue of the year 2000 bug relates to a programming flaw that was done many, many years ago that required the shortening up of dates contained in both embedded chips and computer applications. The manifestation of this problem extends now to when the date clicks over on the first  of the first in the year 2000. There is grave concern, both throughout the community and business, that business operations, community services—indeed, very serious and essential services—could be affected adversely by this change. Hence the program for testing, remediation and preparing contingency plans is of very serious public interest and is on the minds of government, business and community organisations everywhere.
This legislation goes some way to addressing the ability of the community generally to talk about the issue and share information. The amendment that we are foreshadowing provides for the reporting of the progress to date of those testing, remediation and contingency plans to the Commonwealth parliament for the purposes of keeping the public informed about progress to date with Y2K compliance.
This amendment has been agreed to by the government after extensive negotiations and comes on the back of a high level of frustra 
 tion about the quality of reporting to date by the Commonwealth government to the public. Indeed, the extent of public disclosure about progress on remediation and contingency planning to date comes in the form of just a three-page report that was released by cabinet about mid last year.
There is a need for extensive public awareness in relation to this problem. We heard just last night at an estimates committee that the government has finally, albeit belatedly, commissioned research in preparation for a public awareness campaign.
In order to help me keep my comments brief, I seek leave to table some documents provided to the opposition by the government in relation to their intentions with respect to Y2K reporting of Commonwealth agencies.
Leave granted.
—The other issue that needs to be traversed in the context of this debate is how the government can go about gaining the confidence as to their handling of Y2K of both the community and the corporate sector, at which this Good Samaritan style legislation is specifically aimed. I believe Labor's amendments will extend that confidence to a large degree to the community interests that will be addressed by allowing a far higher level of public scrutiny. The critical challenge that Y2K presents to the world over is something that must be addressed forthrightly and with leadership by governments.
There are several other reports that have significant impact on the way the Y2K problem is being addressed. One, in particular, in relation to Commonwealth progress to date was prepared by the Australia National Audit Office entitled `Getting over the line'. That report identified a series of recommendations aimed at assisting Commonwealth agencies to progress their reporting, testing and compliance in accordance with the guidelines provided for by the department.
The government has indicated that they will also be moving an amendment to extend the limited exemptions from civil liabilities to oral statements. I would like to indicate, at 
 this point in time, that it is the opposition's intent to also support that amendment.",SENATE,<title>YEAR 2000 INFORMATION DISCLOSURE BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-02-18,"—I am speaking on behalf of the Australia Democrats and committing our support for this bill. As the previous speaker in this debate outlined, the Year 2000 Information Disclosure Bill is intended to provide a system of voluntary disclosure in exchange for information about year 2000 problems, remediation effects and compliance.
This bill provides for limited liability for certain statements made between royal assent and 30 June 2001. The bill provides significant limitations on liability for statements made detailing the risks and compliance history of organisations. The rights of parties receiving year 2000 statements and the rights of third parties referred to in those statements are limited, except where statements are made fraudulently and recklessly.
The Democrats support strongly an open and fair approach to the resolution of the year 2000 issues. We will be supporting this bill and the various amendments being moved today. But we make it very clear that we reserve the right, as does any one in this chamber, to make any further amendments that are required or any amendments that are appropriate if, at a later stage, we find the government's processes or this particular regime wanting.
It is widely acknowledged that the year 2000 or millennium bug is one of the most significant challenges yet to face the information technology industry. The origins and the history of the bug provide a fascinating parallel to the information technology industry itself. Although many have blamed the cost, the limited capacity and the lack of availability of memory storage devices, it is more likely that this is just one of the many short cuts which programmers have taken over the years. Sadly, this short cut was entrenched in a number of different ways and with little foresight as to the consequences.
We should be aware that one of the impediments to addressing the millennium bug has been the opaque nature of so many of the 
 technologies which play a role in our lives. Significant developments are occurring in technology and in technology culture as a result of the recent dramatic spread of computer networking and the convergence among media communications and computing. The movement known as Open Source Software has become a major force in computer development. It promises a level of cooperation and peer review, which is likely to have a dramatic impact on business culture in the long term.
This may be the appropriate time to suggest that we rethink the role of ethics and professional responsibility. For the last 50 years technology has raced ahead of our society's understanding of the consequences. Many of us are focused on the consequences of the year 2000 right now, but it is probably worth a reminder that the issues exposed by the millennium bug are also part of a broader range of problems created by the elevation of business and technology interests over those of consumers and of society generally.
I am aware of at least three other significant dates and a number of triggers that could occur in other parts of the economy. The dates are 9 September 1999—it would be my birthday!—29 February 2000 and another `end of time' for many existing business computer systems around the year 2038. So there are at least three significant or `end of time' dates that may affect society.
Recently there has been concern that the passing of the 10,000 mark on the Dow Jones industrial average might cause a US stock market meltdown, with systems failing to move from four- to five-digit numbers. We are still waiting for the US stock market to hit that magic level. These and other dates and thresholds point to an ongoing concern that we should all have with the extent to which we oversee, understand and control the technology in our lives.
The problems relating to the millennium bug should not simply be seen as a single issue that needs to be cleanly and swiftly disposed of—while of course it must be—but also be an incentive to think about and discuss the ongoing role of government in regulating technology. This legislation is an 
 important attempt to urgently encourage a spirit of cooperation and openness regarding the risks and preparations for the new millennium. We are all still quite uncertain as to the actual impact of the arrival of the year 2000. The range of systems, in both the computer and organisational sense, which may be vulnerable is wide. But we are still distressingly uninformed about the complex relationship between different systems and the real effects of failure of individual components.
We certainly have many reasons to be cautious about the possible impact and that is why contingency plans and information are so important. There are risks that have been suggested in a number of areas ranging from health care to aircraft safety. On that note, I point out the encouraging words from the minister. I do not know if other members of the chamber are aware of this, but the information technology minister, Mr Alston, is so confident that the millennium bug will be zapped—this is according to AAP on 9 February—by the end of this year that he plans to take Prime Minister John Howard on a New Year's Eve plane trip. He is apparently going to be spending New Year's Eve in a cockpit of an aircraft. I am glad that the minister is so confident. It has actually been suggested in some countries that confidence in the resolution of safety issues should be demonstrated through such displays as airline executives and, of course, government officials taking flights that cross the threshold. Each to their own!
We should be proud of the way in the which the Australian community has responded to many of the challenges and uncertainties of the year 2000 but we should not become complacent. On the other hand we should not, at the other extreme, use simplistic scare tactics to bring about action. We should all take the opportunities provided by this particular bill to further prepare.
I do note with concern, on behalf of the Democrats, the government's lack of openness in the past about preparedness and the process of resolution. It seems that the threat of amendments requiring an obligation on the government to disclose has been instrumental, 
 so that threat seems to be one reason that the government has responded, and has resulted in what I believe is a more open attitude from the government on this issue. We continue to call on the government to be fair, open and accountable on this issue, especially in the way that it communicates with the Australian population about the impact of this issue and about preparations. I do not believe that has been the case so far, certainly not satisfactorily. The general `your government knows best, so don't worry' approach is not an appropriate way to address the legitimate concerns of our community.
There is no doubt that preparedness and contingency planning in Australia are proceeding well, but we must maintain our leading role in the international community and also play a part in world preparations. The Democrats, while currently supporting the framework before us and the framework of disclosure generally, still have some concerns in relation to the weakening of the Trade Practices Act, for example, and its particular protections. We believe that always sets a dangerous precedent, and we will be vigilant about the use and abuse of the disclosure rules contained in this bill. As I have mentioned, we reserve the right to amend this bill in the future if any abuse should be detected.
This bill is a good faith, good Samaritan offering to the Australian community, and any abuse of its provisions cannot be tolerated. The bill does provide an important defence in the case where parties feel they have been defamed through the making of a year 2000 statement that is the truth. We are all aware that the truth is fragile; the truth defence is provided in an atmosphere of trust to the Australian community.
In relation to the proposed amendments, we are mindful of the somewhat secretive nature of the government's year 2000 preparations. We are pleased that the government has added the commitments contained within these amendments. That is a good sign. We would also like to see extensive use of the provisions of this bill by government, departments and agencies, even where that has not been compelled. A system of voluntary disclosure could undoubtedly benefit from a strong lead 
 from all government departments and agencies.
As I have indicated, this bill is a timely reminder of the concerns we should all have with the failure of successive governments to tackle the difficult ethical questions arising from advances in technology. Internationally, we have often been in a leading position, but we must ensure that moves towards deregulation and self-regulation in critical areas of technology do not undo that success. Too often we are informed that regulation of or even public discussion about some of the matters relating to advances in technology is not appropriate. This, understandably, is part of the ongoing questioning of the role of government at a time when it seems to many that innovation is occurring faster than we can understand or appropriately regulate.
In a number of other areas, our ability to regulate is being limited by lack of discussion. Among these I include the regulation of encryption technologies and a range of other areas, like privacy. We must be continually vigilant where business interests, technology, community interests and human rights collide. I look forward to the ongoing debate on these matters and look forward also to a satisfactory outcome.",SENATE,<title>YEAR 2000 INFORMATION DISCLOSURE BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-02-18,"—I thank Senator Lundy and Senator Stott Despoja for their contributions to the debate here in the chamber and outside the chamber—to the very important debate on year 2K preparations in the community and the negotiations that we have held around this bill. They have been entirely constructive and will result in Australia moving further ahead in her preparations as a nation for the date change, which will occur in roundabout 316 days time.
Australia has, as has been referred to by both the other participants in this debate, led the world in many respects in Y2K preparations. There has been incredible cooperation between the levels of government and between government and industry. It makes one proud to be an Australian to see that we are 
 able to achieve this sort of world leading role in what is undoubtedly a very complex and challenging problem that requires so much effort at so many levels. However, contrary to what has been said in relation to the disclosure regime, Australia is recognised internationally by leading organisations as having one of the best government disclosure regimes on the globe.
The changes that took place to that regime as a result of a federal-state ministers meeting with industry on 17 December, to bring all of the states together to report on a common format, really did take Australia ahead of even the United States in terms of the quality of government reporting. Every state and the Commonwealth, as well as some utilities, I might say, will be reporting on a similar format as from the first couple of weeks of March—this coming disclosure period. That is something that has not been able to be achieved in any other nation. We are committed to continuing to increase the level of transparency and quality of information so that Australian citizens and businesses can make sensible decisions about Y2K preparedness.
There are two other things I wanted to mention. Senator Stott Despoja made a very important point about being flexible in our approach. I do not think that was the word she used, but she said we need to reserve the right to alter our approach to this problem and that, indeed, is why we want to keep an open mind about improving the government's own preparations and assisting industry. Also, we cannot be complacent, even though Australia is regarded as being amongst the best nations as far as our preparations go. There are many areas in which we have to improve our game and we cannot be complacent about it with 316 days to go.
Finally, I would like to say that Australia would not be in the position that she is in as a nation if it had not been for the efforts of a number of remarkable and quite outstanding individuals in the preparations—and there are probably hundreds of them. But I would like to take this opportunity to remark on the very good work of the Y2K unit in the Office for Government Online of the Department of 
 Communications, Information Technology and the Arts headed by Susan Page, who is here today; and also Maurice Newman, who has led the fight internationally. As chairman of the ASX and Deutsche Bank and head of our industry program, he has been one of the key people on the globe in terms of raising awareness and getting people to take action. Australians should be proud of Morris's work in this field and, of course, his chief executive officer, Graeme Inchley. There are many others who work with those people, but these individuals deserve mention here.
I genuinely thank the opposition and the Democrats and all other senators who have allowed this bill to be progressed so quickly. It shows what can be done with a truly non-partisan agenda in Australia. It is something we should be proud of. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-02-18,"—The opposition supports this legislation. The primary act gives effect to Australia's obligations under international law and is the basis for Australian conservation related efforts to control the export and import of wildlife and wildlife based products.
The primary act already makes it an offence, broadly speaking, to import, export or possess a product containing endangered species. However, at present forensic difficulties make it virtually impossible to prove beyond reasonable doubt that traditional medicines contain material from endangered species as claimed on their packaging. It is necessary to make some amendments to the 
 relevant evidentiary provisions in the existing act in order to more readily achieve prosecutions.
We feel that this legislation allows Australia to more fully implement its obligations under relevant treaties and, as a consequence, we support it.",SENATE,<title>WILDLIFE PROTECTION (REGULATION OF EXPORTS AND IMPORTS) AMENDMENT BILL 1998 [1999]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-02-18,"—These amendments to the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 will finally allow for successful prosecution for the illegal import of traditional Chinese medicine containing endangered species, such as tigers and rhinos.
Currently it is virtually impossible to prosecute for illegal import of traditional East Asian medicine, or TEAM, containing endangered species. The required forensic test to prove the medicines actually contain the endangered species are just not available. A TRAFFIC study in 1955 showed that during an 18-month period over 30,000 medicines were seized and labelled as containing endangered species. Not a single prosecution took place.
Traditional East Asian medicine practised for over 5,000 years uses more than 1,000 plant and animal species. TEAM is used throughout Asia and by Asian communities worldwide as well as increasingly by non-Asian consumers. However, some of the plant and animal species used by TEAM are now threatened with extinction, including the tiger, the rhinoceros and the musk deer. For these species, poaching for TEAM has been identified as the most immediate threat to the survival of the populations in the wild.
These amendments will allow for prosecution for illegally importing medicines claiming to contain endangered species without the requirement for forensic proof that the medicines actually do contain these species. This brings Australia in line with its obligations under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species on Wildlife, Flora and Fauna, or the CITES convention.
It is, however, very important that the government continues to work with the traditional East Asian medicine community in Australia on this issue to raise awareness and 
 understandings of the laws and regulations and streamline these, where necessary, to help compliance. We note the upcoming symposium in Melbourne on this issue and hope the government continues to give it full support.
It is worth nothing in this context that the tiger is endangered. There may have been as many as 100,000 tigers at the beginning of this century, but today only 5,000 to 7,500 are believed to be in the wild. Three subspecies of tiger have already become extinct. Demand for tiger parts for medicinal use is one of the most immediate threats to the survival of the tiger in the wild.
The trade in traditional Chinese medicines is but a small part of the global trade in live wild animals and their parts and derivatives. TRAFFIC Oceania has recently reported that the annual world trade in wildlife products and live specimens is estimated to be worth somewhere in the region of $US20 billion. TRAFFIC also estimates that up to one-third of this massive trade is illegal, concluding:
Illegal and unsustainable wildlife trade threaten more than individual species. Population collapses can threaten entire eco-systems and thus the quality of our own lives. Keeping wildlife trade under control will never be easy, because the trade in wildlife involves more than 350 million animals and plants each year.
The Greens (WA) support this legislation.",SENATE,<title>WILDLIFE PROTECTION (REGULATION OF EXPORTS AND IMPORTS) AMENDMENT BILL 1998 [1999]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-02-18,"—I would like to make a couple of points about the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1998 [1999] . First of all, anybody with poetry in the soul would want to preserve the wildlife of the world. I think later in the year we are going to have a full discussion about biodiversity and the need to preserve the world with the magic presently in it.
The second point I want to make is about traditional medicine, to which a reference appears in the second reading speech. I would like to make it clear, of course, that Chinese medicine—some call it traditional Chinese medicine—is an ancient art and a very honourable one. I would like to make clear that the exploitation of rare animals and beautiful animals is not at the heart of Chinese medi 
 cine. It can and does do a great service to humankind, without relying on those products.
Indeed, in Melbourne there is a move to regulate Chinese medicine—I think it might already be under regulation—by the Victorian government, and the government deserves credit for that. I put in this context the work done by Professor Chiang Lin (I know the minister, Senator Kemp, would have heard of him out Footscray way) working through the RMIT to see that regulation of medicine is properly instituted so that the good parts that come from Chinese medicine—as, indeed, with the good parts that come from any particular profession or any particular practice—are the parts that are preserved. That needs regulation. He fought hard for the regulation and, in spite of all, has got it through. May I say, just to balance up the matter, Senator Kemp, that Senator Crowley, when she was the minister, did a lot of good work in this area.
They are the two points I want to make. Firstly, this bill goes to protect, as I say, the poetry of the world and, secondly, Chinese medicine should not be seen as dependent upon illegitimate products or on the killing of beautiful animals, but does have a legitimacy which, I might say, is equal to the legitimacy of Western medicine; and by marrying the two, as Professor Lin wants to do, we get a much better outcome for all people.",SENATE,<title>WILDLIFE PROTECTION (REGULATION OF EXPORTS AND IMPORTS) AMENDMENT BILL 1998 [1999]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-02-18,"—I will be very brief, to enable the legislation to get passed in the four minutes we have remaining. Firstly, the Democrats support this legislation, the aim of which, of course, is to enable more successful prosecution of those who seek to use endangered species in various products. I note that the act creates a specific definition of convention listed species and, in a sense, only addresses convention listed species rather than other animals that are currently listed under the wildlife protection act. I understand the rationale for that, in terms of what this is aimed at, but I am not sure if it was necessary in the sense that it may have been helpful to actually have this sort of mechanism applied more widely to other wildlife.
I think it is important to emphasise, given that the bill itself is only four pages long, that the quite comprehensive explanatory memorandum lists various options that were considered and the costs and benefits of each and even lists the option of doing nothing, or taking no specific action. As it quite pithily says, there are no foreseeable benefits in maintaining a stance of no action. I think that is the important part of this legislation, that it does seek to take concrete and positive action to address what is a real problem. And the Democrats support that.
Briefly, we would also like to note, as is also mentioned in the explanatory memorandum, the government's commitment to undertake a broad review of the wildlife protection act. That is certainly something the Democrats will be paying close attention to. It refers to recommendations in a recent Senate committee report. The Democrats do have a strong concern about the potential for an expansion of trade in wildlife without very clear and strong protections to ensure that environmental benefits are protected for the long term. We will certainly be watching closely to ensure that economic measures do not gain too much precedence and that environmental matters and the very survival of species, as well as the broader environment, are not sacrificed for trade measures. With that, given the time, I will simply indicate again the Democrats support for this legislation.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1999-02-18,"—My question is to Senator Alston as Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. Minister, is it not a fact that the government's industrial relations policy at the last election assured workers that the no-disadvantage test would protect them from the erosion of their conditions of employment during agreement making? Didn't the government promise that no worker would be worse off? Has the 
 minister's attention been drawn to those aspects of Minister Reith's proposals that contemplate `a separate stream within the workplace relations system applicable to the employment of unemployed persons'? Does the minister believe that exempting some employers from unfair dismissal laws and discounting wages honours the government's commitment that no worker—not just existing workers—would be worse off?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Industrial Relations: Government Policy</title>,Questions Without Notice,19,1,question

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-02-18,"—Madam President, it is a very interesting question, isn't it? We are really being asked about how you can solve unemployment in this country. That is what the debate is all about. The debate is about flexing up the labour market and trying to resolve some of the social difficulties caused by you lot, who are not interested for one moment in anything like—
—Senator Alston, your remarks will be directed to the chair, not directly across the chamber.
—Thank you, Madam President. Of course the commitment that we gave at the last election, which is reflected in Mr Reith's letter, is that the government would ensure that no worker was any worse off than under the award safety net. Of course what the Labor Party would want to do is to lock in time a lot of outmoded practices that are clearly contributing to higher levels of unemployment than we need to have in this country.
—Like a living wage!
—Yes, there is a great living wage for those who are unemployed through no choice of their own, for those who could be in the work force if you were prepared to flex up the labour market. Come clean. Is Mark Latham wrong? Is Lindsay Tanner wrong? Or do you just not have any policy? Is Max Walsh right when he says Kim Beazley is purely a figurehead leader? Is that the position—you have no policies until 2001? So when Mark Latham says that Plan for the Nation was simply a way of allocating more money to more programs of the old kind, that the unemployed have responsibilities, that the old welfare system was failing—a whole lot of proposals; sensible policy 
 changes—you are not even prepared to debate that?
It is critically important to look at what freeing up the labour market would achieve. What Labor essentially wants to do is to go back to the old Working Nation, which cost squillions. It ended up, I think, averaging about a $140,000 per outcome. That is the sort of $2 billion program that Martin Ferguson and Simon Crean think makes a lot of sense. But we know those policies have failed. Mark Latham knows they have failed. Lindsay Tanner knows they have failed. Two-thirds of those on your labour market programs ended up back on the unemployment scrap heap. You have rejected our reforms for unfair dismissals, you were opposed to Work for the Dole, you were opposed to stimulating the economy through tax cuts—in other words, every sensible policy proposal is something you are not allowed to contemplate because your union bosses say, `It might jeopardise our power bases. We are not interested in the unemployed; we are interested in hanging on to those that we have got.' That is a tragic abdication of responsibility. What Mr Reith is saying is that we need to continue to update the policy approach that we take for endemic social problems like unemployment. We are the party prepared to have an open mind on these issues; you clearly have no interest of all.
We are not going to walk away from our election commitments but, by the same token, we are going to ensure that the best policy outcomes are put in place to actually benefit those people that you pretend to be concerned about. But, of course, when it comes to policy solutions you simply sit on your hands. All I can say is that Mr Reith is on the right track, so is Mark Latham, so is Lindsay Tanner, but you lot could not care less. It is a tragedy. You thought you would sneak in at the last election by having no policies. Clearly Mr Beazley has not learned from that experience.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-02-18,"—Senator Collins's proposition is that any change in the rules, any change in existing arrangements, constitutes two classes. You have got people on award systems and you have got people on enterprise bargaining agreements. Is that two classes of employees? Of course it is not. If you have got a system that you want to refine or improve, does that mean that as soon as you make a change and someone benefits from it you have two classes? You are locked into class warfare. You cannot get your minds above that. Of course it did not get you anywhere because the electorate treats that sort of attitude with contempt. You might as well go back to the 1950s and start bleating about communism. It just does not work any more. Wake up to yourselves. Find out how you can solve these problems. Come up with something positive and look around the world at what can be done to flex up the labour market. Go and talk to Tony Blair, who was good enough to write a foreword for Mr Beazley in that remaindered edition that is floating around the bookshops.

Response to the Report by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts (JCPA)
REPORT 355
ABORIGINAL COUNCILS AND TORRES STRAIT ISLAND COUNCILS: REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS
June 1998
FOREWORD
The Joint Committee of Public Accounts (JCPA)  "" Report 355:   Aboriginal Councils and Torres Strait Island Councils: Review of financial accountability requirements""  was tabled in Parliament on 27 November 1997.
In its report JCPA made 19 Recommendations of which Recommendations 2, 3, 4, 12, 14, 15, and 16 had policy implications. As ATSIC is the agency with prime carriage of these issues the response has been prepared by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs after convening an Interdepartmental Committee with representatives from:
Department of Finance and Administration
Department of Health and Family Services
Department of Transport and Regional Development—National Office of Local Government
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission—Queensland State Manager. The Torres Strait Regional Authority sent a position paper. 

Apologies were received from Prime Minister and Cabinet.
The Australian National Audit Office participated in the discussions although not as a Commonwealth Government Representative.
The representatives concurred with the response.
The report is hereby tabled.
Recommendation 2
The establishment of a Grant Providers Forum at Ministerial level comprising representatives of the Commonwealth and Queensland Government agencies funding the councils, together with representatives of the Aboriginal Coordinating Council and the Island Coordinating Council
Recommendation: Not supported
Commonwealth representatives of the IDC do not support the recommendation to establish a separate Grant Providers Forum at Ministerial level. There are a number of forums already in existence where these matters can be dealt with, for instance the Ministerial Council on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (MCATSIA) and Health Minister's Forums.
However, merit is seen in establishing some Regional Grant Providers Forums to ensure the program responsibilities are implemented appropriately (see comments under Recommendation 4).
Discussions held between ATSIC and the Queensland State government indicate that there was no interest in a separate
Ministerial forum.
Recommendation 3
The Grant Providers Forum should:
(a)	 develop standardised grant procedures and acquittal processes, which satisfy the requirements of the major stakeholders.
Recommendation: Agreed in principle
Commonwealth representatives of the IDC agree in principle with the report's findings in relation to the need for standardisation of procedures across agencies provided that various legislative requirements can be met. However, it was felt that advances may be achieved only in the longer term.
ATSIC has recently undertaken a major review of its grant procedures and modified them in line with the Australian National Audit Office—Administration of Grants Better Practice Guide and has put forward the view that the new 1998/99 Grant Procedures be adopted as the model procedures.
(b)	 establish an information source for Aboriginal Councils and Island Councils and other interested parties, which detail the grants that are available and information about 
 contact points within agencies. There should be Internet access to this information.
Recommendation: Not supported
Commonwealth representatives of the IDC do not support this part of the recommendation, which appears to be aimed at establishing a service point where clients can obtain information about grants from all agencies. In theory this sounds like a good idea however important issues to consider include possible reliability problems if the information is not constantly updated and the costs to provide the service.
(c)	 require agencies to report back to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and the Queensland Public Accounts Committee on a biannual basis regarding implementation.
Recommendation: Supported
Commonwealth representatives of the IDC support reporting biannually on the implementation of (a)  only.
It is also noted that the report only covers about 25% of indigenous people in Queensland—those in DOGITS.
Recommendation 4
At the regional level, Regional Grant Providers Forums should be created comprising representatives of all stakeholders. The role of these regional forums should mirror the role of the Grant Providers Forum, but address issues at the regional level.
Recommendation:  Supported
(See also comments for Recommendation 2).
Commonwealth representatives of the IDC do support the development of Regional Grant Providers Forums or their formalisation where they already exist, with the Queensland State Government sponsoring the establishment or formalisation of the regional forums.
ATSIC Queensland State Office has advised that a joint forum of ATSIC Project Officers and Community Service Officers was held in May 1997 and that a further joint forum is currently being arranged for approximately the same time this year.
More frequent Regional based forums will supplement this forum. A joint forum has already been initiated in Cairns with Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) as the main focus,  given that the largest amount of funds provided to Councils comes through this program.
ATSIC Queensland State Office has also advised they intend to enter a formal arrangement by way of a joint letter signed off by the State Manager ATSIC and the Director of Office of Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Affairs (OATSIA) to make the State forum a biannual event. 

Recommendation 12
The Grant Providers Forum should form a Training Working Group comprising representatives of all stakeholders. The tasks of the Training Working Group should include:
(a)	 the assessment of the training needs of Aboriginal Councils and Island Councils;
(b)	 the coordination of training provision to Aboriginal councils and Island Councils;
(c)	 seeking advice from the Commonwealth Department of Transport and Regional Development about the Remote Area Management Project with a view to assessing the usefulness of this initiative in providing a model for computer-based training to Aboriginal councils and Island Councils.
In performing its task the Training Working Group should take into account the training provided by Community Service Officers, internal auditors and others.
Recommendation:  Not supported
Whilst the Commonwealth representatives of the IDC do not support the establishment of the Grant Provider Forum at Ministerial level, they do see great merit in establishing a structured training program for the boards and management of Aboriginal Councils and Torres Strait Island Councils.
There was concern also that training itself will not resolve issues associated with management instability within the Councils. There are many instances where problems have occurred in the grant administration area not as the result of lack of commitment but simply through a lack of basic administrative skills and knowledge of roles and responsibilities.
A number of Commonwealth agencies already have programs in place to provide support and training and it was considered that the co-ordination of assistance from agencies could best be handled at the regional level.
ATSIC will examine the possibility of whether  Training Working Groups (TWG) be established as part of the proposed Regional Grant Providers Forums to formulate and coordinate training for the Councils at local level.
Recommendation 14
Grant controllers should liaise with the Training Working Group to assist with identifying the training needs of Aboriginal Councils or Island Councils.
Recommendation:  Support in principle
Commonwealth representatives at the IDC discussed the differing roles played by grant controllers and no common outcome was reached. 

ATSIC agrees that where a grant controller is appointed they should liaise with the Training Working Group to assist with identifying the training needs of Aboriginal Councils and Island Councils. The appointment of grant controllers is seen by both the Commission and the Queensland Government as an interim measure to enable community services to be maintained while further remedial action is implemented to restructure or strengthen community management.
Recommendation 15
When agencies that provide funds to Aboriginal Councils or Island Councils undertake risk assessments of indigenous organisations they should take account of the results of risk assessments by other agencies and provide the results of their own risk assessment to other agencies via the Grant Providers Forum.
Recommendation: Supported in principle
Commonwealth representatives of the IDC indicated general support for this recommendation. It was also agreed that better results would be achieved if the exchange of information was made via the proposed Regional Grant Providers Forums rather than the overarching forum. The IDC agreed that prior to implementing the recommendation the relative legal and legislative requirements would need to be considered and clear advice provided to all agencies about the type of information that could be exchanged.
Recommendation 16
The Grant Providers Forum address the issue of financial compliance, and maladministration of Council affairs, with a view to applying an interim step between full Council control of its affairs and the appointment of an administrator.
Recommendation: Supported in Principle
Commonwealth representatives of the IDC supported ATSIC's belief that this recommendation was aimed at encouraging the Queensland Government to work through ATSIC appointed grant controllers rather than appointing administrators in the first instance.
Aboriginal Councils and Torres Strait Islander Councils are incorporated under Queensland legislation, therefore Commonwealth does not have power to appoint administrators. The IDC also understand that the Queensland Government does not currently have any powers to appoint grant controllers.
When funded organisations fail to comply with Commonwealth agency grant conditions there are a number of options available:
1.	 Agree on and implement a strategy to rectify breaches and prevent recurrence, this would also usually involve some tightening in report 
 ing requirements (eg. Quarterly financial reports to monthly financial reports);
2.	 Appoint a Grant Controller; or
3.	 Implement defunding processes—this action is usually implemented when it becomes apparent that a funded body is incapable or unwilling to meet compliance standards.
Whilst the IDC did not support the recommendation to establish a Grant Providers Forum at Ministerial level there was agreement that the Regional Grant Providers Forum could liaise with the Queensland agencies to ascertain whether the use of Commonwealth grant controllers to assist with the administration of state funding is an alternative avenue.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Public Accounts Committee</title>,Committees,22,1,speech

More frequent Regional based forums will supplement this forum. A joint forum has already been initiated in Cairns with Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) as the main focus,  given that the largest amount of funds provided to Councils comes through this program.
ATSIC Queensland State Office has also advised they intend to enter a formal arrangement by way of a joint letter signed off by the State Manager ATSIC and the Director of Office of Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Affairs (OATSIA) to make the State forum a biannual event. 

Recommendation 12
The Grant Providers Forum should form a Training Working Group comprising representatives of all stakeholders. The tasks of the Training Working Group should include:
(a)	 the assessment of the training needs of Aboriginal Councils and Island Councils;
(b)	 the coordination of training provision to Aboriginal councils and Island Councils;
(c)	 seeking advice from the Commonwealth Department of Transport and Regional Development about the Remote Area Management Project with a view to assessing the usefulness of this initiative in providing a model for computer-based training to Aboriginal councils and Island Councils.
In performing its task the Training Working Group should take into account the training provided by Community Service Officers, internal auditors and others.
Recommendation:  Not supported
Whilst the Commonwealth representatives of the IDC do not support the establishment of the Grant Provider Forum at Ministerial level, they do see great merit in establishing a structured training program for the boards and management of Aboriginal Councils and Torres Strait Island Councils.
There was concern also that training itself will not resolve issues associated with management instability within the Councils. There are many instances where problems have occurred in the grant administration area not as the result of lack of commitment but simply through a lack of basic administrative skills and knowledge of roles and responsibilities.
A number of Commonwealth agencies already have programs in place to provide support and training and it was considered that the co-ordination of assistance from agencies could best be handled at the regional level.
ATSIC will examine the possibility of whether  Training Working Groups (TWG) be established as part of the proposed Regional Grant Providers Forums to formulate and coordinate training for the Councils at local level.
Recommendation 14
Grant controllers should liaise with the Training Working Group to assist with identifying the training needs of Aboriginal Councils or Island Councils.
Recommendation:  Support in principle
Commonwealth representatives at the IDC discussed the differing roles played by grant controllers and no common outcome was reached. 

ATSIC agrees that where a grant controller is appointed they should liaise with the Training Working Group to assist with identifying the training needs of Aboriginal Councils and Island Councils. The appointment of grant controllers is seen by both the Commission and the Queensland Government as an interim measure to enable community services to be maintained while further remedial action is implemented to restructure or strengthen community management.
Recommendation 15
When agencies that provide funds to Aboriginal Councils or Island Councils undertake risk assessments of indigenous organisations they should take account of the results of risk assessments by other agencies and provide the results of their own risk assessment to other agencies via the Grant Providers Forum.
Recommendation: Supported in principle
Commonwealth representatives of the IDC indicated general support for this recommendation. It was also agreed that better results would be achieved if the exchange of information was made via the proposed Regional Grant Providers Forums rather than the overarching forum. The IDC agreed that prior to implementing the recommendation the relative legal and legislative requirements would need to be considered and clear advice provided to all agencies about the type of information that could be exchanged.
Recommendation 16
The Grant Providers Forum address the issue of financial compliance, and maladministration of Council affairs, with a view to applying an interim step between full Council control of its affairs and the appointment of an administrator.
Recommendation: Supported in Principle
Commonwealth representatives of the IDC supported ATSIC's belief that this recommendation was aimed at encouraging the Queensland Government to work through ATSIC appointed grant controllers rather than appointing administrators in the first instance.
Aboriginal Councils and Torres Strait Islander Councils are incorporated under Queensland legislation, therefore Commonwealth does not have power to appoint administrators. The IDC also understand that the Queensland Government does not currently have any powers to appoint grant controllers.
When funded organisations fail to comply with Commonwealth agency grant conditions there are a number of options available:
1.	 Agree on and implement a strategy to rectify breaches and prevent recurrence, this would also usually involve some tightening in report 
 ing requirements (eg. Quarterly financial reports to monthly financial reports);
2.	 Appoint a Grant Controller; or
3.	 Implement defunding processes—this action is usually implemented when it becomes apparent that a funded body is incapable or unwilling to meet compliance standards.
Whilst the IDC did not support the recommendation to establish a Grant Providers Forum at Ministerial level there was agreement that the Regional Grant Providers Forum could liaise with the Queensland agencies to ascertain whether the use of Commonwealth grant controllers to assist with the administration of state funding is an alternative avenue.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,22,2,speech
