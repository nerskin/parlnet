Mr IAN MACFARLANE
 (Groom—Minister for Industry) (09:01):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency Repeal Bill 2014 provides for the repeal of the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency Act 2008 and the abolition of the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency. 


This bill is a critical part of the government's agenda for reforming governance arrangements for vocational education and training, as well as rationalising the number of portfolio bodies across government—and we certainly need to do that.


The Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency Act 2008 establishes the legislative framework for the Agency, which provides independent advice in relation to Australia's current, emerging and future skills and workforce development needs.


As part of the winding down of the agency's operations, it is the government's intention that the agency's staff and functions be transferred into the Department of Industry to strengthen resources and the capacity of the Department of Industry to provide targeted advice. 


The agency has made a valuable contribution to policy development and refinement in key areas of skills and workforce development. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all serving and prior board members for their involvement and engagement with the agency and its policy and research. 


I took the opportunity to speak to each of the board members and thank them for their contribution. Many people have done a great deal to improve the productivity and skills of young people in particular, and the contribution of the board members should be acknowledged.


I commend the bill to the House.


Debate adjourned.

Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (13:29):  There are some occurrences so bleak and sad that just to know them seems to deaden and freeze a part of you. To think that teenage girls in India, two cousins, needing to go to the toilet, went into a field at dusk in Uttar Pradesh, where they had grown up, and simply because they were girls and because they were born to a particular caste, were pack raped and hanged from a tree. It is a horrible thing to even know. Imagine what it was to be those girls. Imagine what it is to be their families. And imagine what girls in Uttar Pradesh think now when they go by themselves to a toilet in the field or see a shadow that might be something hanging from a tree.


Gender discrimination and violence happen every day, in every country, and we each have an obligation to make sure we continue to act and speak against it. In many countries, including India, the absence of clean water and toilets puts girls and women at greater risk of being attacked. This risk is compounded in poor areas where a lack of education, corrupt police and caste discrimination are prevalent.


These girls belonged to the Dalit or 'untouchable' caste, yet—as has been sadly observed of the caste system—untouchability for women is always a curse but never a protection. Let us remember that some 2.5 billion people around the world, 36 per cent of the global population, do not have adequate sanitation facilities. Let us remember that Australian aid makes a significant and lasting contribution to addressing that problem, and to reducing gender discrimination and violence in developing countries.

The SPEAKER
 (14:00):  I wish to make two statements prior to beginning question time. One is a ruling with regard to standing order 68. I hope the House might bear with me as it is a fairly lengthy one. However, copies will be made available so that people can see the statement itself.


At question time on Monday, 2 June, the Manager of Opposition Business raised a point of order about standing order 68.


The last paragraph of standing order 68 was an addition made at the commencement of this parliament. It provides:


If a Member has given a personal explanation to correct a misrepresentation and another Member subsequently repeats the matter complained of, the Speaker may intervene.


It is important to note that the standing order applies to all proceedings in the House and Federation Chamber, not just to question time.


This is the first occasion that an issue under the new standing order 68 has been raised and so there is no existing interpretation of the provision.


Interpreting standing order 68 presents considerable difficulties for the chair. Importantly, the wording in the standing order that the Speaker may intervene is a clear indication that the additional provision should not result in an automatic estoppel to a member speaking on a particular topic. Nor can it be allowed to be used to disrupt. Accordingly, any general use of the standing order is significantly limited by the following:


the chair would need to be aware that a personal explanation had been made about an issue for which there is a complaint and that it amounted to a correction;


the chair would need to be satisfied that the matter complained of is an exact repetition of the matter responded to by way of personal explanation; and


the chair would need to determine whether to intervene and if so what is the appropriate intervention.


On the one hand, the standing order potentially creates a role for the chair to intervene in the free flow of information, discussion and debate in the House even though there are other forms of the House available for recourse. On the other hand, it is recognised that members can take great offence at misrepresentations being repeated when they believe they have corrected a misrepresentation, at times on a number occasions.


Achieving a balance between these two objectives is a challenge, particularly as I have said on many occasions that I wish to actively promote free speech and robust debate.


The wording of standing order 68, tying the intervention to a correction, creates its own problems. The standing order states 'the Speaker may intervene where a personal explanation has been made ""to correct"" a misrepresentation'.


The Oxford Dictionary defines 'to correct' as meaning to set right, amend or substitute right for (wrong). The standing order could be seen to place the chair in the almost impossible position of having to determine whether a personal explanation has in fact amounted to a correction. This could involve the chair, potentially, in a detailed examination of what was said originally and whether it amounted to a misrepresentation or whether a personal explanation had corrected the alleged misrepresentation and whether the subsequent statement is a precise repetition of the said misrepresentation.


Notwithstanding these difficulties, I consider the standing order should be interpreted in a manageable way. Thus I propose to adopt the following approach:


if a member makes a personal explanation to correct a specific personal matter which the member claims is a misrepresentation and another member subsequently repeats the same words that have been the subject of the misrepresentation then: 


the member who made the personal explanation can make a complaint to the chair about the misrepresentation being repeated;


the chair in these circumstances may ask the offending member to refrain from repeating the misrepresentation;


in asking a member to refrain the chair will not be making any judgement on the truth or otherwise of the alleged misrepresentation or the correction;


should the chair intervene, the member making the complaint will not have the opportunity to subsequently make a personal explanation on the matter; and


should the member elect not to seek to invoke standing order 68 and have the chair intervene, a personal explanation would still be available.


The difficulties faced by the chair are illustrated by the case raised by the member for Watson in his point of order. The matter commenced on 29 May 2014, when the member for Jagajaga made a personal explanation in response to remarks during question time, which she said were made by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health. The remarks appear to be those concerning her involvement in the Hawke government introducing a Medicare co-payment and her position as Director of the National Health Strategy, which advised the then health minister Brian Howe. The member for Jagajaga stated she was opposed to a Medicare co-payment in 1991. In answering a question on 2 June, 2014, the Minister for Health stated:


Back in the Hawke years, Jenny Macklin, as the head of the policy department that advised Brian Howe at that point, said that a co-payment was necessary to make Medicare sustainable.


It was at this point that the member for Watson raised his point of order under standing order 68 and said:


The Minister for Health is now precisely providing information which the member for Jagajaga has previously explained to the House is false.


In this case the minister is quite entitled to make reference to earlier history which is on the record. The only occasion for the chair to intervene under standing order 68 is if there is a very specific reference to the matter where the member has corrected the misrepresentation.


I note that the minister referred to the member for Jagajaga's role as the head of a policy unit that provided advice to the then government. This is quite legitimate. However, the inclusion of the word 'said', that is, implying the member for Jagajaga stated her support for a co-payment, would seem to invoke the provisions of standing order 68. But if the words were, for instance, that the policy unit headed by Ms Macklin advocated a co-payment, it would seem not to invoke standing order 68.  


I trust that members will show a degree of tolerance towards whomever is in the chair as those who occupy the chair endeavour to apply the standing order in a way which is as fair as possible to all members and does not inhibit the free flow of information, discussion and debate. 


I propose to re-evaluate this approach after a period to assess whether there are any undesirable consequences, particularly on the free flow of debate.

The SPEAKER
 (15:13):  I have received a letter from the honourable member for Rankin proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: 


The Government's unfair and short-sighted attack on universities and students.


I call upon those honourable members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places.

"Chalmers, Jim, MP",ALP,2014-06-04,"



Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (15:14):  The cuts to higher education in this budget are breathtaking in their scope, in their spitefulness, in their short-sightedness and in their stupidity. What rubs salt into the wound for students right around the country is that the Minister for Education, who does not like students very much, went on the Insiders program on Sunday and said:


… students will always be the winners …


But what he forgot to mention was that, when he said students will be the winners, he did not mean students from low-SES backgrounds; he did not mean women; he did not mean students from regional areas; he did not mean students who do not have the limitless funds that are required now to pay for his university degrees; he did not mean the types of kids that we want in our university system, who now might baulk at the extraordinary cost that it takes—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! The member for Rankin will just resume his seat for a moment. Those members who are leaving the chamber will leave or return to their places in this chamber and give the member for Rankin the courtesy that he deserves in an MPI.




Dr CHALMERS:
  Thank you, Deputy Speaker.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Blair might not have heard that, but he might either leave or return to his place. The member for Rankin has the call.




Dr CHALMERS:
  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. On this side of the House, we reject their narrow and elitist view of higher education, just as we reject their narrow and elitist view of the country more generally. It says it all about the government that they want university study to be the preserve of the wealthiest people in our community, the preserve of the few, and not something that the broad range of Australians, whether they are from lower SES backgrounds or otherwise, can access. They want to take us back to the bad old days, where university was just for the kids from the fanciest suburbs, with the most well-to-do parents and from the most expensive schools, and we reject their approach.


The problem with this government is that, while the whole world is concentrating on how they combat inequality, how they invest in human capital, how they do the right thing by the broad mass of their people to get the right kind of economic growth—while the rest of the world is seeing that as a challenge—this government sees rising inequality as an objective. We know this because the cuts that it has made to the higher education system in this budget will hurt the poorest kids the most.


On this side of the House, we believe that access to higher education should be about the contents of your mind and the contents of your imagination and not the contents of your wallet. If we are serious about building the right kind of economy into the future, we should be investing in all of our young people and giving them the access to higher education that they deserve.


The reality about this budget is that the government have Australia hurtling in the wrong direction. It is worth reminding the House of the list of cuts that they have put into higher education in this budget. There is $5 billion in cuts to higher education in the budget. There is $3.2 billion in cuts to HECS. There is $1.9 billion in cuts to universities by reductions in government course subsidies. There is $202 million in cuts by indexing university grants to the CPI. There is $172 million in cuts to funding to promote and reward universities for enrolling low-SES students. There is $173 million in cuts to the training of Australia's research students, the scientists and academics of tomorrow. There is a $75 million cut to the Australian Research Council. There is a $31 million cut to the national regulator. They have abolished the $3.5 billion Education Investment Fund, and they have deregulated student fees from 1 January 2016, leading to higher fees and spiralling student debt.


Earlier on, in question time, the member for Hotham asked a very good question about how many of the current cabinet had had access to a free university education or affordable HECS. In his answer, the Minister for Education said that he has not done a study of that front bench. Well, we have. We have done a study of their front bench. What we discovered is that—depending on which biography you have a look at—something like 12 or 13 of the 19 people in the Abbott cabinet benefited from either a free education or affordable HECS. Twelve or 13 of the 19 had some aspect of their university education provided for free by the taxpayer. I will not take the House's time by running through them all, but, when the education minister got up here before and talked about the opportunities provided to kids, the reality is that, as the member for Hotham said, he is slamming the door on people who want the same sorts of opportunities that he had when it comes to affordable HECS.


I agree with the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Canberra, Stephen Parker, who said:


I … think it is unethical for a generation of leaders who by and large benefited from free higher education to burden the generations behind them in this way …


I think he makes a very good point. The education minister went on the Alan Jones show yesterday, and he said:


… they should be buying a bunch of flowers and a box of chocolates and visiting a home near them where they know someone hasn't been to university, knocking on the front door and saying thank you very much for paying for my education.


My advice to the Minister for Education is: he should go into some of the lower SES areas and knock on their door and explain to them why he wants to extinguish the dreams that they have for a higher education in this country. The reality is that those opposite are in denial and disarray when it comes to higher education in this country.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Rankin will resume his seat. I call the member for Higgins on a point of order.




Ms O'Dwyer:
  No, this is on a question, an intervention—whether the speaker will accept a question.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  No. The member for Higgins will resume her seat. That is not a point of order. An intervention is not allowed in the chamber.




Dr CHALMERS:
  They are in disarray when it comes to the higher education policy. I thought that, given the higher education theme of this speech, I would ask a multiple-choice question: which of the following statements have turned out to be true? Which of the following have turned out to be true: (a) the coalition's Real Solutions election document, which stated, 'We will ensure the continuation of the current arrangements of university funding'?



Opposition members interjecting—




Dr CHALMERS:
  What about this one: (b) the education minister's claim on Insiders on Sunday, 'Anybody who was enrolled before May 14, nothing will change in terms of their arrangements'?



Opposition members:  No!




Dr CHALMERS:
  No. Or (c) the Treasurer's statement that HECS loans 'shouldn't be different to any other loan'? Is it (a), (b), (c) or (d) none of the above? The answer, of course, is that none of the above turned out to be true.


The education minister has been running around today trying to pretend that these changes will cost an extra $3 a week for students, or $5 a week, something like the middy that the Treasurer talks about so regularly. I refer him to the Universities Australia modelling which was released today, which shows that an engineering graduate's HECS debt will go from $49,000 to $119,000 and take 26 years to pay off instead of 18 years. That is the magnitude of the changes we are talking about. That is why the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Adelaide said:


… it is starting to look as if the student debt burden for many under the proposed reforms might well be worse than in the US.


The House should be aware that the United States' student debt has tripled in the last eight years. That vice-chancellor is talking about Australia dwarfing that outcome.


We did some of our own calculations. Instead of $3 to $5 a week, based on the Universities Australia report a nurse might pay an extra $15 a week—that is a very conservative estimate—and an engineering graduate who takes some time off for work might pay an extra $82 a week, so I think we can dismiss the $3 to $5 figures pretty easily. The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sydney said:


It's the ordinary Australians that I think aren't getting enough of a guernsey in this conversation …


He is right. So many different vice-chancellors and people who know more about the education system than the Minister for Education have expressed their alarm about this.


The reality is that this goes to the core of what kind of country we want to be in the future. How we invest in higher education is one of the most important determinants of how we will go as a nation into the future. Instead of tackling those sorts of big issues we have an education minister who goes on Insiders on Sunday and talks about student politics, still fighting the Cold War on the uni campus. He says, 'My job is to fight the Left,' and he puffs his chest up about student politics. There are all kinds of quotes that reveal that this is about settling scores from when he was at university. This should be a far more important conversation than the Minister for Education implies in those sorts of comments. It goes to the type of country we want to be. It goes to whether we have a big vision for Australia or whether we have a narrow, elitist vision for Australia. In that sense it goes to the very core of our national identity.


If we are serious about building economic growth into the future, we want more people to have the types of tools of success that you get at university, not less. We do not want to narrow or diminish the pool of success stories that we can have into the future in our economy. We want to have a more expansive higher education system, not less. We want a more inclusive economy in this country. What the government shows with the cuts to higher education in this budget and what it shows about the difference between that side and this side is that on this side of the House we want fairness and access in higher education to be part of the country's future and on that side of the House they just want it to be part of their past.

"Frydenberg, Josh, MP",LP,2014-06-04,"



Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (15:24):  It is my great privilege to stand up and rebut this MPI. The member for Rankin should know better—the member for Rankin, who has a PhD, just like the member for Fraser. The member for Rankin and the member for Fraser should know that the future of the higher education sector in this country relies on deregulation. It relies on excellence. It relies on quality. It relies on choice. I am very proud to be a member of a government that has produced an important budget which will pay back Labor's debt—nearly $300 billion—over the next 10 years and will put in place measures which will encourage growth, encourage job creation and boost productivity. Central to that thesis is our higher education reforms, the greatest reforms in 30 years. We are the party of Menzies, and Menzies gave us the Murray committee and the Wills committee and an expansion in the university sector. This is the next stage in strengthening our higher education sector. You opposite have no ideas, no alternatives and no policies. The member for Maribyrnong gets up here in his budget reply speech full of cliches but no policies, no alternatives, no hope for the higher education sector.


The measures in this budget as they relate to higher education are a great leap forward for the sector. What do they do? For the first time they put significant government support in favour of students who are undertaking diplomas, students who are undertaking pre-bachelor degrees. For the first time they will receive significant support: up to 80,000 students will for the first time get their opportunity as a result of the federal government giving them support. We are saying to apprentices that they will be able to access government loans in the same way that tertiary students can, because taxpayers should not just support those people who go to university, they should also support those people who undertake apprenticeships.


What is more, in these reforms, $1 in $5 that is taken by the universities as a result of the deregulation in fees will go towards Commonwealth scholarships to help those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and from the regions—the very people that you are now turning your back on by denying us support for these higher education reforms. Those opposite are standing in the way of a commitment by this government to increase the funding for higher education: $900 million of additional Commonwealth funding that will go to higher education and research over the next four years. And how much for schools? An extra $3½ billion in additional funding will go to schools as a result of this budget.


This is an education budget. This is a budget for the future of Australia and Australians. We are investing in higher education, in research, to the tune of more than $900 million in additional money over the next four years and $3½ billion of additional money to schools—money that would never have flowed if you had been successful last year in the election. Not to mention the $20 billion investment in the Medical Research Future Fund: the biggest investment of its kind anywhere in the world. That is going to be our legacy. That is what those opposite are in denial about.


When you see those students rioting about these changes, you could be forgiven for thinking that they were paying for their university education up-front. No, they are not. Do you know why? Because you do not pay $1 back on your university funding until your income is above $50,000.


Let me repeat that. You do not pay $1 upfront for your tertiary degree until your income is above $50,000. And what is more—and the Minister for Education has pointed this out repeatedly in the House, in the press and at every opportunity—even when, as a student, you have paid back your higher education fees through HECS-HELP you have only contributed 40 per cent of the cost of your higher education. Sixty per cent of the cost of your higher education is picked up by the taxpayer. That is an important point: even when you have paid back your HECS-HELP fees, you have only paid back 40 per cent of the cost of your degree.


As has also been pointed out, people who undertake a university degree, on average, earn 75 per cent more over their working lifetime than those who do not get the benefit of a university degree. It accounts to about $1 million extra income earned by those who have a university degree, as opposed to those who do not.


These reforms are not just about boosting the quantity of students who are able to get a good education, boosting choice and helping those in the regions to get the best education; it is also about excellence. Because when we look at the world rankings of universities, we see that Australia has five in the top 100 and not one in the top 30. We as a country put great emphasis on excellence and everything we do and, in most endeavours, we will be in the top 30 of the world. But not in higher education.


These reforms are designed to give universities flexibility and to empower them to take extra money and reinvest it in the classroom, in the best-quality teachers, in the best possible infrastructure, in the best possible technology and to compete against other universities, particularly in our region, which are receiving more funding.


I do not want you to take my word for the fact that this is a good package of measures, I want to read some of the third-party endorsements. The Regional Universities Network said, following the budget:


The Regional Universities Network (RUN) welcomes the announcement in the Budget of an ambitious program of reform for higher education which recognises the importance of the sector to Australia. The Treasurer and the Minister are to be congratulated for highlighting the important role Universities play in Australia's future.


What about the statement from the University of Adelaide's vice-chancellor, who is probably well known to the member for Hindmarsh:


The Federal Budget has outlined massive and much needed reform to the higher education sector.


What about the statement from outgoing vice-chancellor, Professor Ed Byrne, of Monash University, a university I was proud to attend? He said:


The approach in the budget lays out a series of steps for an ambitious deregulation of the sector. The future of universities will be more in their own hands than ever before. 


Those are very powerful words. They are testimonies, as the member for Riverina has pointed out, of the significance of the budget reforms that we have put in place.


It would not be a speech in response to Labor's MPI unless we quoted the member for Fraser, the shadow Assistant Treasurer. I am quoting from Imagining Australia. I am not imagining Australia; I am quoting from Imagining Australia. I am not imagining this; this is from his book Imagining Australia. I bet he wishes he was imagining this! This is what the member for Fraser, the shadow Assistant Treasurer, said:


Australian universities (should) be free to set student fees according to the market value of their degrees. A deregulated or market-based HECS will make the student contribution system fairer, because the fees students pay will more closely approximate the value they receive through future earnings.


I could not have said it better myself. In fact, the member for Fraser should have been the first speaker on our side. This MPI is a load of rubbish, it is not even believed by those opposite. We have the better policies for higher education. (Time expired)

"Watts, Tim, MP",ALP,2014-06-04,"



Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (15:34):  While the list of those in the Australian community betrayed by the recent Abbott government's budget is a long one, there is no betrayal that is more bitter than the betrayal of the people in our community who are dreaming of building a better life for themselves through hard work and education. 


Before the last election, the coalition's Real Solutions policy pamphlet promised Australians who hoped to one day earn a university degree that the Liberal Party would:


… ensure the continuation of the current arrangements of university funding.


We now know that that was just another lie, a fib, a fabrication, a falsehood. Existing funding arrangements for our universities will not continue under the policies released in the federal budget. In fact, the budget indicates that Commonwealth government higher education expenditure for this year will actually decline in real terms.


At the same time, students will be slugged with massive increases in both their upfront uni fees and the costs of their university debts. In fact, Universities Australia today said:


With the reduction in the Government contribution, the student contribution to course fees will rise by an average of 23 per cent. For some courses the increase will be closer to 60 per cent. This could be much higher at institutions with strong market power and in the absence of an upfront cost to mute the price signal.


Professor Bruce Chapman, the man who designed the original HECS policy, has stated that as a result of these changes:


Fees will go up and they will go up quite significantly …


And further:


I expect most universities will increase tuition fees to international student fee levels, which are currently about three times higher. The Group of Eight universities will do that pretty quickly.


Professor Chapman also slapped down the desperate claims of those opposite that competition might prevent this from occurring, stating blankly:


The idea fees will go down anywhere is frankly fantasy land.


In the face of this betrayal, the Minister for Education had the hide to tell the ABC's Insiders program: 'Students will always be the winners,' as a result of the Abbott government's massive university fees hike.


If students will always be the winners, my question for the Minister for Education is: how will students be winners of what the vice-chancellor of the University of Adelaide has suggested could be a 'student debt burden that is worse than that in the United States'. Student debt burden in that country has tripled in the last eight years and is now larger than total US credit card debt. How will students be winners from decades of debt and a new interest obligation that will increase an unpaid student debt of $40,000 to almost $60,000 over a 10-year period? How will existing students be winners from having the debt burden of their already incurred university debts retrospectively jacked up to a rolling average of the government bond rate? It's an utter nonsense and those opposite know it. To bastardise Hot Chocolate: 'Everyone's a winner, baby—that's a lie!' 


The biggest losers from the government's plans to massively hike university fees will be families from disadvantaged backgrounds like some families in my electorate. There are few things that give people more pride than seeing the first member of their family attend university. I have seen families in my electorate speak about this. It is a great achievement and one that requires a lot of hard work and sacrifice, not only from the students themselves but from the family members around them. The government's plan to massively hike university fees will destroy this dream for many of these families. The Vice-Chancellor of Victoria University in my own electorate, Professor Peter Dawkins, has already said that the equity impacts of the government's proposals are 'the biggest question mark against these reforms'. In the inaugural Mitchell Institute policy lecture, Professor Dawkins noted: 


It is clear that the burden on students will rise significantly and with interest being charged from the time the student commences, significantly higher levels of debt will accumulate.


His conclusion was that this risked discouraging students from low socio-economic backgrounds from starting university. This view is shared by the man who designed the original HECS scheme, Bruce Chapman, who recently noted: 


Past changes to HECS didn't deter students from entering university, but now that there will be a real rate of interest on the debt we are in uncharted waters.


He noted that the 'real interest subsidy' in the original HECS scheme was an important and deliberate feature of the scheme designed to ensure the policy's equity. He further noted: 


The interest rate subsidy is there for protection. A lot of people, particularly women, will spend time out of the labour force, child-rearing, or people will have accidents and have bad luck and end up in poor jobs. When you think HECS you've got to think about insurance all the time. That's what it is—it insures you against bad luck … Once you put a real interest rate on that, that's gone.


Bruce Chapman is right. This government's plans to massively increase university fees take the equity out of our higher education system. If this legislation gets through the equity is gone. It will be a broken promise that betrays Australia's future. Labor has always fought for an accessible, high-quality education system. We would never introduce a system as unfair and inequitable as the one that those opposite are proposing and we will fight to make sure that the proposals never eventuate.

"Jones, Ewen, MP",LP,2014-06-04,"



Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (15:39):  I do not know whether the member for Gellibrand actually went to university but it is not 'bastardise', it is 'paraphrase', and I did not go to university. Anyone who goes around quoting Hot Chocolate really has to have a really hard look at themselves. Maybe you could quote some Bruce Springsteen or someone like that, 'down by the river' or something like that, so you have something really worth going to. I have sat through 15 minutes of this now and I have to ask what the actual question is here. What is actually being asked here? It seems to me that in this matter of public importance they are asking for free education. They seem to be saying that all fees are bad, there is nothing good in this. We have to go back and say, 'Where were you guys when HECS was brought in by your party?' That is okay. So some debt is okay but it is just Liberal debt that is not okay. 


When you go through this you really have to sit there and look at it. It is their ability to latch on to change. We would have thought that with the last parliament they would have been right up with change, that there will be no problems with change at all. 'There will be no carbon tax on the government I lead—hey, we are for a carbon tax. Away we go. We are not going to change private health—hey, we are up for a change of private health. We can accept change, we accept change all the time.' Oh no, when it is proposed by somebody else it is all out: we cannot change anything. 'Don't change anything, because we are glass half empty people.' 


I will tell you a couple of things about this. We are coming up to the World Cup. In the last World Cup we had the member for Grayndler saying we were a vuvuzela of negativity. I cannot wait to see the musical instrument that the Brazilians will be using, but can I tell you I might wax lyrical about the Brazilians! There is a complete and utter lack of any coherence in anything that they are doing at the moment other than saying it is bad. Whether they choose to believe anything that we put forward, no-one in this parliament can deny that over the last six years you guys clocked up over $190 billion worth of debt. The first thing you have to do is figure that out. So we have to look at ways of making sure that people have access. When things are broke, when there is no cash, who pays? The poorest pay. So we have to look at getting people who are the most exposed into higher education. That is what our policy does: it opens up another 80,000 places. For every $5 extra that is paid in HECS one dollar goes into the Commonwealth scholarship scheme, the greatest scholarship scheme this country will ever see. It is specifically targeting low SES people who would never otherwise get a chance. But 'No, we don't want that, we don't want that.' You blokes just talk a good game about people from disadvantaged backgrounds. 


I come from Townsville where we have James Cook University. It has three campuses, in Townsville, Cairns and Singapore. They are keen for competition. They say: 'Bring on the competition because we are up for it because we have a science degree that stands alone on absolutely everything. We have people coming from all over the world for our science degree and our marine science degrees and our coral reef studies. We have people coming from all over the place, from all over the world to get into that degree. In our science degree we have our Daintree outlook, we have our cattle station and we have Orpheus Island.' There is a degree that will stand alone against any form of competition for anything. James Cook University is rated number one in the world on coral reef studies and marine sciences. They say, 'Bring on the competition because we can handle the competition.' We just invested another $42 million in James Cook University for the Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine. There are 3.6 billion people of middle-class by 2035 to the north of Australia in the Asian century and we are ready for it because we embrace competition. We open it up and say, 'Bring it on.' Those opposite are looking at their bellybuttons saying, 'Nothing can change, just roll on past like a tumbleweed.' You are wasting everyone's time. Just get out of the road because you guys are in the Melbourne Cup and you have not gone past the post the first time. We are coming down the straight again and you are standing there dawdling in the road. Get the fag out of your mouth, move out of the road and get yourself a job.

Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (15:44):  They say you do not really get to know a government until they deliver their first budget. In the last three weeks, boy, have we learned a lot about this government! It is one that has pensioners, young people and working families right in the gun, but wealthy women, big polluters and ballet schools will always be the winners with these guys. Nowhere are there more half-truths, more out and out lies, more perversities and more contradictions than in the proposed changes to higher education.




Mr Ewen Jones:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order—




Ms O'NEIL:
  I listened to that dribble for five minutes! 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! Member for Herbert, I will ask the member for Hotham to not use the word 'lie', because by imputation it is a reflection on the chair.




Ms O'NEIL:
  I understand, Deputy Speaker. I went a little overboard there. I do apologise. But I will say that there are half-truths, there are perversities and there are contradictions and no more so than in the proposed changes to higher education. When we think about winners and losers, I can tell you that the losers from these changes will be the young people who are sitting out there watching this debate today from the gallery. These changes will see universities auctioning their degrees to the highest bidders. The introduction of commercial, compound interest rates will see those much higher loans growing every year. What experts are saying is that, with the new changes, universities will charge what they are currently charging overseas students today. Overseas students doing a law degree at Sydney university pay $140,000. For a nursing degree at Sydney university, they pay $88,500. The interest rate changes will mean that a student who finishes university with a $40,000 debt will pay $75,000. A woman who finishes her university degree and goes into a job that is not particularly high paid may never pay off her loan in her whole working life. 


Remember, these changes are being made by a cabinet, of whom 12, as we know, went to university completely for free. It is absolutely perverse. They use their free education to get power and position and now they are using that power and position to slam the door in the face of other young people in Australia who want to access those opportunities. We know from what other speakers have talked about that, very unfortunately but not surprisingly, the biggest impact of these changes is going to be on students from low-income families. I probably should not need to say this, but, without equal access to education, all of us are going to lose. The member for Rankin spoke quite eloquently about the need to try to not limit access to university education but get as many young people in this country to university as we can. 


The government has argued that young people from low-income families will not be deterred by these huge fees. This is hogwash. It absolutely defies expert opinion and just plain common sense. A detailed study by Deloitte Access Economics on changes to HECS has shown that, where reductions in university demand have happened in Australia, they have been almost all from students who have come from disadvantaged backgrounds. I have talked to quite a lot of local principals about the changes, and their frustration is absolutely palpable. I want to quote one of the local principals who said to me: 'The amounts that are being talked about will absolutely scare my students away. For these kids, a sum like $100,000 is a TattsLotto win. It's an unimaginable amount of money.' They point out to me the pressure that these young people are already facing within their families to go out and earn more quickly. They think that these increases in fees will be enough to shift the balance, not just subtly but a lot. But the biggest impost they point to with these changes is the impact they could have on the culture in their schools right down the line. These principals tell me that they work so hard to produce environments of excellence and a belief that these students can go on to do anything they want in life, but this culture is being completely undermined by a university system that will see many of them locked out of tertiary education. 


The government has argued that there are increases to Commonwealth scholarships and therefore this, of course, answers the access question. This is staggeringly unfair. Why should only a handful of the best and brightest young Australians from low-income families go to university when students from much wealthier homes will get much broader access to education? In Australia, that is just not how we do things. I can say that, as Labor, we will never tell Australians that the quality of their education depends on their capacity to pay. A country like ours should be a meritocracy and nothing aside from your intellect and drive should determine whether and where you go to university. But this is not how things are in Tony Abbott's Australia. If you are a white, privileged male, the government has got your back. But if you are poor, if you are a woman, if you drive a car, if you live in a region, if you are an older Australian, if you are a student, if you are a single mum, and especially if you are a young person, you had better watch out, because these guys are coming for you.

"Hawke, Alex, MP",LP,2014-06-04,"



Mr HAWKE
 (Mitchell) (15:49):  I want to thank the member for Hotham for her question in question time. It was a brilliant question—a brilliant question about who brought in HECS in Australia. I think it was fascinating to remind the House that it was the Keating administration who first came up with the notion that it was fair, very fair, for a student to contribute to the cost of their education. It is a fair principle. It is a principle that we should seek to reinforce in Australian education today, and this government is seeking to reinforce it. The only thing that could have made the member for Hotham's presentation a little better would have been a glass of chardonnay, because it was chardonnay socialism at its best. This is not about poor students. This is not about people on the breadline. This is about reinforcing the privileges of those upper middle-class kids at uni who are being paid for by poor students who do not go to universities. That is what this is about. People who go to universities are subsidised by the rest of our community. They are subsidised by people who never have a prospect of entering university and who, on average, have much lower incomes. We know that, when you get an education degree, it is an economic asset; it stays with you for the rest of your life. It is only fair that you make a contribution to that. 


The fact is that this government is expanding this scheme. We are not just expanding the cost incurred by a student; we are expanding access. The MPI that has come up today is really from the D team. There is no shadow minister. Nobody of really any note moved this motion. It is the D team. Maybe it is the F team.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr HAWKE:
  The interjections are from the F team. Those opposite say that this measure is unfair when the government is expanding access for the first time under the HECS to diploma, advanced diploma and associated degrees—a notion that any Labor government should have been proud of. It is a notion that the Hawke government would have been proud to put forward. It is a notion that the Keating government would have been happy to put forward. But we have this new chardonnay socialism from those over there. These members from the inner city suburbs of Melbourne really need to get out more. They need to leave the inner city of Melbourne and get out more and find a real student, a real struggling student. This is the same Labor Party that supported compulsory unionism for students. It supported high fees for students, making them pay out of their pockets, regardless of the equity issues, compulsory union fees. They were happy to take $1,000. When I went to Sydney university they were happy to take money from me for their compulsory student unionism even though I came from Western Sydney and did not have a high income.


But when we say people should make a contribution to their own education, they claim there is something wrong with that. Well, it was Paul Keating's notion. It was a worthy notion and one that this government is expanding because we need to ensure greater equality of access to universities. We need to make sure we have universities of the highest standard in the world. We do not have a university in the top 30; we need to get one. Deregulating the sector is nothing to be afraid of; it is a worthy concept and it is a worthy set of programs to put forward.


When you hear this lame set of arguments from the D team opposite, you really get the sense that this is a revolution without a cause. With the Minister for Education, I had the chance to be in Sydney to see the predictable Green Left Resistance, with their soulless eyes, addictively chanting. They do not even know what they are chanting. 'What are we chanting? Well, we are revolutionaries so let's have a revolution!'—a revolution of revolutionaries. They are like the Zapatistas in Mexico—revolution for revolution's sake. They do not even know what it is about. They do not understand that you do have to pay for things in life, that there is no such thing as a free education.


The member for Rankin is absolutely wrong to come in here and suggest education is free in this country and that somehow he is going to do something to alleviate the need to pay fees. People have to get a signal early in life that you have to make a contribution to your own education. It is only right and proper. A university degree is an economic asset that will stay with you all of your life. On average, people who have one will earn $1 million more than others. This is chardonnay socialism at its worst. This is not on behalf of poor people, this is not on behalf of socially disadvantaged people. It is on behalf of the inner suburbs of Melbourne, the chardonnay socialists in the Labor Party. They are disconnected from their trade union background, they are disconnected from the ordinary worker, they are disconnected from their base—and I say long may it remain so. Keep fighting for those inner city spivs in Melbourne and Sydney, stick up for them hard! It is only right and proper that people make a contribution to their education. It is a principle established by both Labor and Liberal governments. Really, this motion today is absolutely pathetic. (Time expired)

Mr CONROY
 (Charlton) (15:54):  I enjoy being lectured about career achievement by a man who has spent seven years in here not making a single mark! If we are the F Troop, he has got to be the Z Troop—and he is sitting amongst others there! This is a debate about a nasty government pursuing an ideological agenda. The inconsistency on their side is remarkable. We heard from the first speaker about paying down Labor's debt. And then we had the black is white story, that this is actually about equality of access, that liberating students from their money will give them greater chances in their attempt to get an education. The truth is that education is a great enabler. Like many on this side, I am proud that I am the first on my mum's side of the family to go to uni. I am not one of these chardonnay socialists. I am someone who went to university. I paid HECS in an affordable manner, indexed to the CPI, and had plenty of time to pay it back. What they are doing on that side is shutting the door on more kids from working-class backgrounds going to uni. They are shutting the door by introducing $5 billion of funding cuts. They are shutting the door by jacking up fees. They are shutting the door by applying commercial interest rates that will force working-class students to think twice about going to uni.


In my regional seat of Charlton 34 per cent of graduates are nurses, teachers or from allied health occupations. They are not lawyers, they are not doctors. They disprove the myth being peddled by the Minister for Education that all graduates will earn $1 million more than average workers. That is utter rubbish! I am proud that I have in my electorate the biggest hospital between Brisbane and Sydney. It has 120 nurse graduates entering this year. But it is going to struggle to get new nurses coming through because they are going to be turned off by this fee hike. According to research by Universities Australia a new nurse entering training now will see their fees go up—once you add the interest—from $23,000 to $98,000. How is that fair? How is it fair to ask a poor working-class kid, who wants to be a nurse to help out in our health system, to pay $98,000 instead of $23,000 over a reasonable amount of time with CPI indexation? They will be paying that money for 25 years. They will be 48 before they are able to pay off their debt—if they are lucky.


And teachers do not earn $1 million more than an average worker. I received an email from Jacqui, a year 11 student at Jesmond High in my region. She said: 'For a long time now, all I have wanted to do is study primary school teaching at Newcastle uni. I was disappointed and angry to discover that instead of my degree costing $19,000 over four years it will now cost around double that. I have worked out that, on a teacher's salary of $59,000 per year, it will take nearly 14 years to pay back my HECS debt. With interest, I would have paid a total of around $90,000. This figure will be higher if it takes me longer to get a job or I spend time out of the workforce for family reasons.'


That is the truth behind this inequitable policy. This is the truth when you look at students who go to the University of Newcastle, the best uni in Australia under 50 years of age, where 27 per cent of students come from a low-SES background. They are not the chardonnay socialists the member for Mitchell railed against; they are kids from low- and middle-income families who will be turned off by these huge fee hikes and by the deregulation of uni fees. This will place a real barrier against their entry to university. This is a great betrayal of the Australian people.


When I look at MPI debates, I like to see what those opposite said before the election. I go to that great document Our Plan: Real Solutions for All Australians, which the Prime Minister hid behind. It was his shield whenever a journalist had the temerity to ask him a question about anything before the election. 'Just look at my pamphlet. The pamphlet has got everything I stand by—and it is in writing, so you can trust what I'm saying'—it is in writing, so it must be true! If we go to page 41, we can read a firm commitment from the Prime Minister, a paragon of virtue and honesty: 'We will ensure the continuation of the current arrangements in university funding.' That is pretty direct; there are no ifs or buts. The truth is that this is an important debate because those on the other side stand for the betrayal of low- and middle-income families and their chances of getting a decent education, getting a degree in nursing or teaching, contributing to our society, advancing their family and maybe being the first in their family to go to university. That door is being shut by the heartless mob over there who are just pursuing a nasty ideological agenda. (Time expired)

Mr PITT
 (Hinkler) (15:59):  This is a matter of importance to people in my electorate, because regional students have been disadvantaged for a long time. Before I get to that, I must point out the great injustice done by the member for Gellibrand. Hot Chocolate fans all over the world are right now picking up the phone, getting on their computers, sending emails because it is not 'Everyone's a winner, baby, that's no lie'. The great line is: 'Everyone's a winner, baby, that's the truth.' Yes, that is the truth, which is exactly the opposite to what the member for Gellibrand said. As much as I would like to sing in this place, I am sure it would be inappropriate.


This is a serious matter. The people in my electorate are a lot like me. I was born in Bundaberg and had similar opportunities to them. I finished high school in 1986; I graduated with a score which was good enough to get me into university. I had an offer for university, but for me to attend university at that time meant moving to a capital city, and that was an expensive move. Students from regional areas have to travel, pay accommodation, feed themselves. They move away from home; they do not have mum there any more to help them out. They have difficult social challenges. If I had taken that opportunity at that time, the financial disadvantage for my family and my younger brothers would have been far too high, and it was not a price I was willing to pay. So I took a job as an apprentice electrician, and it was a wonderful time. Those four years were absolutely fantastic; I worked with some great people in an industrial workplace—a highly unionised workplace—and they were good, honest, hard-working people. They did their best every single day. I loved being an electrician—getting out and doing that work was absolutely great. 


However, one of those chardonnay drinking engineers who came from somewhere else suggested that I was not smart enough to attend university. So that was the reason I did not go—I was not smart enough. I accepted the challenge in 1992 and went to the Queensland University of Technology as an adult student. I used the money I had saved for four years to attend university. If I had gone in 1987, how much HECS would I have paid? Absolutely none! But in 1992 I had to pay HECS.



An honourable member:  How much?




Mr PITT:
  Quite a lot, but I tell you now, Mr Deputy Speaker, if I had the chance to talk to my skinnier, younger and less grey self, the advice that I would give is very straightforward: take the loan. At that time 10 per cent was the return on money deposited in banks. I should have put my money somewhere else and taken the cheap loan that was provided by taxpayers; the benefits would have been much greater. Instead, I used my own savings. I paid all those fees and got them out of the way. 


Going to university is an opportunity that is not afforded to many regional students, because they simply cannot afford to go. Our policy provides scholarship opportunities for regional students—students from low socio-economic backgrounds, students who would otherwise never get the opportunity to go to university. There are now some universities in my electorate—the University of Southern Queensland's Fraser Coast campus. For first semester 2014 there are 743 students in Hervey Bay. What is the gender split? Seventy-eight per cent are female; 22 per cent male. It is fantastic. There are 29 Indigenous students on campus and 23 external; there are only 11 international students. Of those 743, 367 are mature age and only 187 are school leavers. For a very long time the absolute best export from my electorate was our young talent: they travel to the city, do university and do not come back. 


These policies will give opportunities to people in regional areas, make our universities stronger and our regional universities more viable. And that will mean more students. I look forward to the day when our local universities triple in size—not 700, but 2,000 in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay—providing opportunities for our local kids so they can stay at home, attend university—opportunities that city kids have had for many years. I am not talking about opportunities provided by the taxpayer, but things they can do for themselves. In regional areas that is what regional kids are about: they do not want a handout, they just want opportunity and they will seize that opportunity with both hands. With that opportunity they will make this a better country and they will certainly be great for my electorate.

Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (16:04):  It is a pleasure to rise to speak on this matter of public importance. I thank the member for Rankin for his impassioned and fantastic speech. This is such an important issue because it affects not only the lives of individuals but the future of our country as a whole. It is something I am very passionate about. Like other people who have spoken today, I was the first person in my family to go to university. My parents left school at grade 10; I went to James Cook University and then on to the Queensland University of Technology for my bachelor's degree. I am very proud of that and, frankly, I would not have been able to do it, had it not been for Labor reforms to higher education. I am very proud of the Whitlam reforms and the Hawke reforms with the Higher Education Funding Amendment Act of 1989, which members opposite have spoken about.


The Higher Education Funding Amendment Act came into force because of a view that there was a limited private benefit to public education, but the public benefit was overwhelmingly greater than the private benefit of that higher education. We know that graduates earn substantially more over the course of a lifetime. What do they do with that higher income? We have a progressive income tax system and, as a consequence, graduates pay more in income tax. That is the way our taxation system works. Yes, we have a HECS system; we have a Higher Education Contribution Scheme. Why shouldn't we recognise that there is some private benefit, but that ought not mean $100,000 of debt over a lifetime for an engineering graduate. Students should not be saddled with debt for their whole life.


Deputy Speaker, I will read to you a few things that I have received in my office about this issue. One is from a constituent. I will read it out in full. She says:


Abbott—


the Prime Minister—


is out of touch with reality and his budget will lead to considerably higher university costs for mature age students who are being forced to change career so they can continue working until they're 70+. I'm a divorced 48 year old female who raised 2 children most of my life, hence I don't have enough superannuation to retire. For me, retirement is a pipe dream. My career to date has been in office admin - my salary is therefore capped. I'm changing career to become a lawyer so I can become self employed in my own legal practice and work until I'm 80 years old, my mental faculties permitting. Hence, I'm enrolled in a Bachelor of Law, but the Abbott government needs to keep the funding available to mature age people such as myself who are being forced into re-education and a change of career so they can work longer. Mr Abbott you can't have your cake and eat it too. Fair go.


That is what one of my constituents, who is a mature-age student, has said to me. It is not just young people who are being forced into debt. But when it comes to young people, when you think about that idea of having $100,000 of debt to be paid off over a lifetime—that is for an engineering student, and it is not my number; it is Universities Australia's number—that is 20 to 25 years worth of repayment.


Think about the fact that women will often take more time out of the workforce to raise children. What is the consequence? It takes them longer to pay off their debt. That is the consequence. And when you increase the interest rate to six per cent per annum that debt is going to grow and grow. So you are going to saddle them with more debt, it is going to take them longer to pay it off and their debt is going to be higher because they have taken time out of the workforce. That is the sort of legacy that the Liberal-Nationals are leaving this country. They should be ashamed of themselves.


As I said, these are not my numbers; these are the numbers of Universities Australia, that well-known, as the members opposite have described us, chardonnay socialist group—I don't think. In a press release that I received today and that most of those opposite would also have received today, Universities Australia said:


The peak body representing Australia’s universities has called for a rethink on the design of the proposed changes to the student loan program and the 20 per cent cut in the Government contribution to student fees.


The call comes as Universities Australia released new modelling—


You might want to go and have a look at it—


new modelling on the combined impact that the proposed changes to the Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) and the reduction in Commonwealth support would have on student debt and payback periods.


The modelling is there on their website for all to see.


Of course, when we are talking about the deregulation of university fees so that universities can charge higher fees, the higher interest rate and the lower repayment threshold, let us not forget the massive cuts to higher education in this government's 2014 budget—$5 billion in cuts to higher education and university research. They should be ashamed. (Time expired)

"Scott, Fiona, MP",LP,2014-06-04,"



Ms SCOTT
 (Lindsay) (16:09):  I have really enjoyed the scare campaign about universities put forward by the other side. You would think, for some crazy reason, that all universities are going to close down or that everyone is going to be charged a huge amount of money. The thing that those opposite fail to acknowledge is that it is their own side that originally came up with many of these deregulatory ideas.


Let us look at the contribution of the member for Rankin, who spoke about the accessibility of universities to low-socioeconomic demographics. To start with, we are actually extending what we are doing with trade and apprenticeships—$20,000 is what we are going to give to incentivise people to go in through the TAFE system. I went through the TAFE system and then went into the University of Western Sydney. This is where incentivising people through some of the other types of gateway courses is so crucial. If you look at the University of Western Sydney, which is in my electorate, you would think that, by the deregulation, universities are irresponsible institutions. The fact is that universities are not irresponsible institutions. They are thoughtful institutions. They are institutions that think about their students. They are institutions that think about the future, about how they going to create future leaders. Already because of the scare campaign of those opposite we have had eight universities come out and say, 'No, we're actually going to freeze our fees.' They include the University of Western Sydney, the university from my own electorate; Griffith University, I am sure the member for Griffith would like to know that; Deakin University; Victoria University; Flinders University; Murdoch University; and Edith Cowan University. By freezing university fees they are providing security to students so they know what their fees are going to be. The members opposite are running around trying to scare everyone by saying that university fees are going to go into some exorbitant place. What they are not actually saying is that universities are responsible institutions. What they are not talking about is how we are going to provide more gateway opportunities for people to get university. We are talking about 80,000 additional places. That is what we are doing here.


I will go back to the University of Western Sydney. It is a wonderful institution in my electorate. The University of Western Sydney is once again investing. It invests in health and research. It is looking at how it can grow the education sector in this country. It is also going overseas to places like China. It is seeing how it can be more internationally competitive.


We have a fabulous foreign affairs minister, and with the Colombo Plan and what they are doing with taking university students to China and from China back to Australia we are seeing our universities finally become internationally competitive. Under those opposite we saw our universities drop out of the top 100 universities in the world. This deregulation, together with the Colombo Plan and getting people into universities through gateway programs, will see our university sector once again be internationally competitive. If we want to have future leaders, if we want to have future thought leaders within our communities we need competitive universities. We need universities that are going to lead by example. We need universities that invest in research and funding. We will be investing in research so that our universities can go out there and find the research projects that will take us into the next millennium.


When we look at what this is all about we will see that this is about providing future leaders. This is about providing university to more people. We want to talk about people in low-socioeconomic demographic areas. Sometimes getting through year 12 is not necessarily the easiest thing in the world, so finding gateway programs that will take people into university is so crucial. If you actually want to help people in low-socioeconomic demographic areas—if you want to provide university opportunities to get the mechanic who has done his trade to become a mechanical engineer—you help him get his trade and then you help him get to university to be able to become a mechanical engineer. That is what I did. (Time expired)

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2014-06-04,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (16:15):  I move:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government's inaction on multinational tax avoidance that have resulted in broken promises in the budget leading to tax increases and cuts to essential services.""


In March 2010 the United States Congress enacted the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, also known as FATCA. The aim of the act was to improve compliance with US tax laws. FATCA imposed certain due diligence and reporting obligations on non-US financial institutions, including Australian institutions. Two years after the passing of FATCA, the member for Lilley, Wayne Swan, the then Treasurer, met with United States Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner in Washington and issued a statement on 7 November 2012 announcing that Australia had commenced formal discussions for an intergovernmental agreement with the United States to minimise the impact for Australians of FATCA. That statement noted that an intergovernmental agreement would also improve existing reciprocal tax information-sharing arrangements between the Australian Taxation Office and the United States Internal Revenue Service, which would help ensure Australian tax laws are effectively enforced so that Australian businesses and individuals who pay their fair share of tax are not disadvantaged by those who seek to evade their tax obligations.


Under the agreement which has been signed with the United States and was announced by the Treasurer on 28 April this year, we now have an intergovernmental agreement which sees Australian financial institutions complying with FATCA. Under this arrangement, a broad range of Australian financial institutions are affected: banks, building societies, credit unions, specified life insurance companies, investment funds, custodial institutions and some brokers. Those financial institutions are to be required to register with the US IRS. 


Under this bill, from 1 July 2014 the affected financial institutions will review customer accounts to determine whether they are reportable accounts, US citizens or US tax residents under the intergovernmental agreement and will report to the ATO in the 2015 calendar year the required account information for the 2014 calendar year, which will then be passed on from the ATO to the IRS. This bill puts in place those appropriate arrangements in order to see Australian institutions complying with FATCA. 


It is pleasing for those of us on this side of the House to see the end of these negotiations, begun under the member for Lilley and concluded under this government. The Labor Party welcomes sensible steps to assist tax authorities in ensuring compliance with tax regulations. What we are concerned about, however, is that while the government has managed to conclude this deal, it has dropped the ball on multinational profit shifting. More than $1 billion of loopholes have been opened up under this government, which will allow multinational firms to shift profits overseas. So while dual Australian-US citizens will be affected by FATCA, the multinationals will be able to continue to shift profits overseas. In a speech earlier today I listed the measures, five of them, on which the government has backtracked. The total amount is $1.1 billion.


Multinational profit shifting is a painfully detailed area and we were fortunate in government to have Assistant Treasurer David Bradbury focusing on these reforms for us. It might be helpful to the House if I outline in straightforward terms how multinational firms shift profits out of Australia and into low-tax jurisdictions. One simple example that members might think about is an arrangement in which the Bermuda arm of a company sells the Australian arm a paperclip at a cost of $1 million. The Australian company then claims that as a $1 million tax deduction and the money is effectively shifted offshore. That particular loophole has been closed, but a parallel trick can still be played with debt, in which the Bermuda subsidiary makes a multimillion dollar loan to the Australian arm and effectively $1 million a year is shifted out of Australia in the form of interest payments. Those interest payments are a tax deduction in Australia and the profit can be moved to Bermuda, where the company tax rate is considerably lower.


The concern that the Labor Party has on this is that multinational profit shifting will invariably become more tempting as industries internationalise. As more and more business is done over the internet, we are moving from a closed economy to a very, very open economy. And a government which is going soft on multinational profit shifting is a government which is increasingly going to miss out on revenue. Australia already has a higher than average share of revenue collected from company taxes, and so failing to close company tax loopholes is a significant issue for Australia. And because this government is unwilling to close corporate tax loopholes it has to do things like taking money away from children on the first day of school—getting rid of the schoolkids bonus payments, which is targeted towards low- and middle-income households, because it is going soft on multinational profit shifting. The Treasurer talks the big talk when he is at the G20, as the Prime Minister does when he is at Davos. But when it comes to actually walking into this House and passing bills which see multinationals pay their fair share of tax, this government is not up to the job. As a consequence, ordinary Australians will have to pay more tax or receive lower services. 


The total effect of the government's budget was to increase the deficit. Don't take my word for it: the member for Cook in question time yesterday said:


If I go back to the PEFO—as we know, the PEFO is where the officials tell the truth about what the budget really is from the previous government. From the previous Government, that's what it does, that's what it does.


A little repetitious, but you get the idea. PEFO is the true state of the books, so let's compare where we are at under the true state of the books, the Charter of Budget Honesty state of the books, with the current budget. 


The current budget's deficit is higher this year. It is higher next year and it is higher over the forward estimates. So what the government has done effectively in this budget is to redistribute resources—redistribute them from the most vulnerable to the most affluent. This is not only a failure of the fair-go test, because those who were most vulnerable have, after all, been doing it worse over the past generation, a generation in which incomes have risen faster for billionaires than for battlers, but now we have a budget that transfers resources from battlers to billionaires. A simple example of that: the budget raises the non-concessional superannuation cap pushing it from $150,000 to $180,000—a measure which will help some of the most affluent. 


But the vulnerable Australians do not just have low incomes; they also spend a larger share of their incomes. In fact if you look at those in the bottom income group, they tend to spend all of their incomes; and those in the top quintile tend to save about a quarter of their incomes. So, if you take $10 billion, you move it from the bottom quintile to the top quintile and then you take $2½ billion out of the economy. What would that do? You would expect it to have a hit on retail trade, and we are already seeing retail trade figures down. You would expect it to have a hit on consumer confidence, and we have the ANZ Roy Morgan Consumer Confidence measure now falling faster than at any time since the global financial crisis. We have the Westpac Melbourne Institute consumer confidence survey at nearly a three-year low. 


Part of what is going on at the Westpac Melbourne Institute consumer confidence survey is that confidence has fallen to a lousy 74.9 among Labor voters. I have news for those opposite: Labor voters may not have supported them in the last election but, if you are a retailer, a dollar coming out of the wallet of a Labor voter is just as good to you as a dollar coming out of the pocket of a coalition voter. This pessimism in the economy is hurting retail trade. 


Robert Menzies liked to say that about half the people didn't vote for him at each election and they could not all be wrong. It neatly sums up the value of bipartisanship but it is particularly important when we are thinking about economic policymaking. Governments must govern for all Australians. They must recognise that retailers are depending on the spending of coalition voters and Labor voters alike. But a government which is behaving as political scientist Judith Brett wrote recently like 'a bunch of winners taking it out on the losers … It all feels a bit like student politics and its short-term point-scoring, its payback and its intense personal antagonisms'. A government of that kind is a government which will not engender confidence in the economy. 


Perhaps we should not be surprised then that the Australian Institute of Company Directors biannual survey found that fewer than one in three company directors believe the federal government is having a positive impact on their business decisions and consumer confidence. 


This is a measure which improves transparency, and it is good to see this government supporting transparency. As Justice Brandeis said—that is not 'the-would-be Justice Brandis'; that is the real United States Justice Louis Brandeis—sunlight is the best disinfectant. I am a strong supporter of transparency, but it does strike me as strange that the government is very keen on transparency for US-Australian citizens in exchanging information between the ATO and IRS but less keen on transparency when it comes to what has happened in our detention centres, what is happening with boats. 


When it comes to the Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission, a commission set up to ensure transparency in the charitable sector and to ensure that Australian donors can see the organisations to which they are donating, the government wants to scrap the ACNC and reduce transparency in the charitable sector. 


The government is yet to hold a single community cabinet, a great transparency measure introduced under Labor. The government has said that it will not release the Treasury blue books under the freedom of information laws as they were after the two previous elections. 


The government in another anti-transparency move has taken the Family Impact Statement out of the budget. The family impact statement was put in the budget by Peter Costello, and maintained when the Rudd and Gillard governments were in office. We thought they were a good thing, so we kept them there. This year they disappeared, and families will not be surprised as to why. If you are a family in the bottom quintile in income distribution, families with children lose 6.6 per cent of their disposable income as a result of this budget; they lose more than $1 in $20. The poorest single parent families with children lose more than $1 in $10—$1 in $10 is being taken out of their wallets as a result of this. No wonder the government is backtracking on transparency with the Family Impact Statement. 


On the measure championed by Labor, which would have required the tax commissioner to publish the amount of corporate tax paid for entities with a total income of $100 million or more, the coalition has already sent out strong signals that it is not going to proceed with that particular transparency measure. They were so proud of that particular announcement that they brought it out in the first week of the new year—not normally a time in which you announce the things that you are very excited by—but the time when then Assistant Treasurer Arthur Sinodinos chose to drop the story to the Australian Financial Review.We have heard nothing of it so far, but I am deeply concerned that this transparency measure will be dropped as well. 


The opposition supports this sensible measure. The FATCA agreements were initiated under Treasurer Swan and concluded under Treasurer Hockey. I wish the spirit of this bill would better pervade the government's actions. Transparency is good enough for FATCA and it ought to be good enough for other areas of government policymaking. If it is good enough to close down tax loopholes to stop tax minimisation then it ought to be good enough to close down tax loopholes that are allowing a billion dollars of tax owed by multinationals to escape.

"Sukkar, Michael, MP",LP,2014-06-04,"



Mr SUKKAR
 (Deakin) (16:30):  I want to briefly speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Implementation of the FATCA Agreement) Bill 2014. I want to congratulate the Treasurer, Joe Hockey, on so quickly coming to the aid of Australian financial institutions and concluding the FATCA agreement. The unilateral decision by the United States has meant that Australian financial institutions with any presence in the United States could be subject to a withholding tax rate of 30 per cent. In announcing the signing of the agreement, the Treasurer highlighted the importance of this change in reducing the burden on Australian financial institutions and in particular that due diligence that would be required from Australian institutions in managing each of the accounts that may or may not be relevant to the FATCA requirements. In order to comply with the relevant reporting obligations, Australian financial institutions would have been required to undertake a range of procedures in identifying all relevant accounts. Broadly, FATCA requires foreign financial institutions to provide the US Internal Revenue Service with information on US citizens living abroad who have more than $50,000 in their accounts. So it is a wide-ranging and significant compliance burden on Australian financial institutions.


The commencement of the regime is looming on 1 July 2014, as the member for Fraser said, and it will obviously have a huge impact on Australian financial services. One of the reasons that Australia has had to enter into the agreement with the United States which is now the subject of this bill is that Australian privacy laws generally prevent compliance with these US based regulations and some Australian state and territory antidiscrimination laws could also prevent the interrogation of customer accounts based on US citizenship. In recognition of the fact that many of these domestic laws would otherwise prevent foreign financial institutions from fully complying with FATCA, the US developed an intergovernmental agreement approach to manage these legal impediments, simplify practical implementation and reduce compliance costs for relevant financial institutions. That is why I congratulate the Treasurer, Joe Hockey, for moving so quickly to sign the intergovernmental with the US in April. 


As always, this government has its eye on the ball when it comes to making sure that our businesses are not weighed down with red tape and unnecessary administrative costs. Unfortunately, that was not the case when those opposite were in government. Treasurer Joe Hockey was advised soon after last year's election that 96 tax and superannuation announcements, with one dating back as far as March 2001, had not been legislated. One of those announcements related to FATCA. The former Treasurer announced his intention to negotiate an intergovernmental agreement with US on FATCA in November 2012, but it was not signed by the former government. This slack approach was not fair on Australian businesses or consumers and it created uncertainty, particularly with the likelihood of a withholding tax applying to Australian financial institutions. That approach has changed and we have ended the uncertainty with the subject of this bill. We are listening to businesses and consumers.


Importantly, the Australian Bankers Association welcomed the signing of the intergovernmental agreement. Steven Munchenberg, chief executive of the ABA, said:


We congratulate the Australian government in securing this agreement. It will enable Australian investors and savers to more easily access the US economy without suffering a prohibitive 30 per cent withholding tax cost. 


This is an essential development in facilitating capital flows into and out of Australia while having best practice regulation. 


The current and previous governments' work in this area will ensure Australia continues to have one of the world's most competitive financial services sectors, a major factor in economic growth.


Again, I want to congratulate the Treasurer for ensuring that the uncertainty that applied with the possible application of a withholding tax in the United States is not an issue that Australian financial institutions have to worry about any further. 


There are of course compliance costs associated with this measure. As a government, we are proud that the approach we have adopted ensures that the compliance costs are the lowest of all the available options. Again, it is to ensure that capital that flows in and out of Australia can be as free as possible and not subject to interest withholding tax. I again congratulate the Treasurer.

"Giles, Andrew, MP",ALP,2014-06-04,"



Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (16:36):  I rise to make a contribution on the Tax Laws Amendment (Implementation of the FATCA Agreement) Bill 2014. As previous speakers have noted, this bill in effect requires Australian financial institutions to collect information about their customers who are likely to be taxpayers in the United States of America and to provide that information to the Australian Taxation Office which will, in turn, provide that information to the US Internal Revenue Service. This of course gives effect to the Australian government's commitments as set out in the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America to Improve International Tax Compliance and to Implement FATCA—the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act—which was signed in Canberra in April 2014, as the member for Deakin noted a moment ago.


FATCA has been described by TheEconomist as 'by far the biggest catalyst' of a movement towards global tax-transparency or, indeed, tax fairness. I note that the UK has also, in the aftermath of FATCA, taken what may be regarded as similar steps to the US, and that the OECD is progressing the implementation of a single global standard for the exchange of relevant information. This year's G20 finance meeting in Sydney endorsed common standards for sharing account information across borders, with automatic exchange taking effect by the end of next year. This is an important development—although, as is the case with the bill before us, there is obviously considerably more work to be done.


I note in that regard—and I think the member for Deakin also touched on this—the very important work that the former Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister, the member for Lilley, did in the lead-up to this bill, by commencing the formal discussions between Australia and the US following a meeting between the Treasurer and US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner in November 2012. I also note the important work that former Assistant Treasurer David Bradbury did in the area of cracking down on corporate profit-shifting and tax minimisation schemes. I congratulate him on his recent elevation at the OECD. It is well deserved and I wish him very well, though I think it is appropriate that I also say that he is very much missed in his former role in this place in the government of Australia.


The FATCA is an American law, developed to reduce offshore tax evasion and regain federal tax revenues from American account holders at foreign—that is, non-American—financial institutions internationally. It obviously, in that regard, has implications for Australia and Australia's financial institutions. The impetus for the act in America was a 2009 court case in which Swiss bank UBS was found to have assisted American nationals to evade paying American taxes. As a result, UBS agreed to pay the US government US$780 million in fines, in restitution, and also to provide the names of suspected tax cheats. There has obviously also been some significant subsequent litigation in this area. According to the US Department of Justice, the use of offshore bank accounts to avoid paying American taxes costs the US Treasury, in total, at least US$100 billion annually. This is of course a cost to American society of the same magnitude.


The wide-reaching FATCA was passed in the 111th Congress as part of the 2010 Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act, the HIRE Act, becoming law in March 2010, and requires individuals to report their financial accounts held outside of the United States; and foreign—again, that is, non-United States—financial institutions to report to the IRS about their American clients. To enforce the FATCA, it has become necessary for the US government to sign agreements with foreign governments such as Australia's, allowing the trade of individuals' financial data.


Labor welcomes any sensible steps to assist tax authorities, whether in Australia or overseas, to ensure compliance with tax regulations. The Treasurer has acknowledged that some multinationals are not even paying their fair share of tax anywhere and called for a global response. I welcome this, too. But there is more to be done—much more.


This government has demonstrated a significant gap between its rhetoric and its actions when it comes to ensuring that multinationals pay their fair share of tax within Australia. By not proceeding with similarly sensible measures, as are implemented in this legislation, the Australian people have forgone over a billion dollars in revenue. This is resulting in cuts to essential services. And, as the member for Fraser has noted, every dollar avoided by multinational companies must, in effect, be paid for by Australian taxpayers and businesses, or, of course, by cutting services—essential services maintaining the fabric of our society. We have seen with this budget which side this government is on. It asks those with the least to do the most, time after time after time, as we heard in the matter of public importance discussion only a few minutes ago.


Ultimately, I think it is important to acknowledge that cracking down on multinational profit-shifting is not just about making sure that firms pay their fair share of tax, important as that is. Critically, it is also about making sure that the burden of tax is fairly shared across businesses.


I am reminded of the comment of the Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr: 'Taxes are what we pay for a civilized society.' That was as prescient of the debate in Australia at the moment, as we argue in this place and outside it about what makes a civilised society. I note the context for that remark. It was made in a dissenting judgement in a 1927 case involving a Spanish tobacco company seeking to minimise its tax arrangements on insurance in the Philippines, then subject to the law of the United States. Even by today's standards—the standards that FATCA is engaged in working through—it was a very complicated case. But His Honour saw through the complex taxation arrangements then, and we must do our best to do likewise now. To quote him more fully: 'It is true … that every exaction of money for an act is a discouragement to the extent of the payment required, but that which, in its immediacy, is a discouragement may be part of an encouragement when seen in its organic connection with the whole.' This notion of an 'organic connection with the whole' is one that deserves some greater consideration.


I believe that this principle is at the very heart of taxation. Taxation should never be seen in isolation, as those opposite and their right-wing cheerleaders insist it should be. It is true, of course, that our roads, schools, hospitals and all of our services are, in large part, funded from tax revenue, but this is part of a broader purpose—that purpose being, of course, to build a society where people are not left behind or excluded because of the material circumstances in which they entered this life.


This is why the coalition's budget has been so devastating, because its basic message is: if you are not born into comfort then you will not get to fully participate in society. And this is why we, on this side, describe the budget as cruel. To say to someone that, no matter how hard you work or how smart you are or how well you apply yourself, you do not stand a chance to get ahead in life because your parents' wealth does not allow for it—this is cruelty. Interestingly, that seemed to be acknowledged to some extent by the former Prime Minister, John Howard, in his contribution at the National Press Club today.


Countries that have progressive taxation systems tend to have the least inequality and, in turn, tend to be more collectively prosperous and productive. One only needs to look at the Scandinavian examples as proof of this—evidence, as opposed to neoliberal theory. Can those opposite point to examples of prosperous, productive and equal societies that operate under these sorts of neoliberal regimes? I doubt it, and I again reflect on the contribution of John Howard, a former conservative Prime Minister, in his remarks on the state of the US society.


I am pleased that the US has passed laws to crack down on tax evasion and that Australia is assisting with collection. But it is somewhat ironic that the US is where those opposite look to as a model for Australia, whether it is for universities, health care or gated communities more generally. The US system is in too many respects based on concepts of user-pays exclusivity. It applies a moral lens to those who, for instance, cannot afford to take on massive amounts of debt, who cannot find work or who until recently could not afford health care. It divides their community into haves and have-nots, deserving and undeserving. This has never been the Australian way, and it cannot be so in the future.


I applaud the US administration for getting the high-roller tax evaders to pay their fair share wherever they may be. I note that these measures are permanent, not temporary like this government's deficit tax on high earners. Our government could learn from the US government to treat foreign companies and people the same as it treats Australian companies and people. What is this government doing to tackle Australians seeking to evade taxes here and abroad?


I return once more to Holmes' decision:


The result of upholding the government's action is just. When it taxes domestic insurance it reasonably may endeavor not to let the foreign insurance escape. If it does not discriminate against the latter it naturally does not want to discriminate against its own.


Indeed, getting foreign or domestic companies or wealthy individuals to contribute to the running of a society and system of government from which they derive a profit or protection from is entirely just.


And so the principles of this legislation are supported by Labor. But again, it is only part of what is needed to be done. The government wants to repeal Labor's tax transparency reforms. These reforms would have ensured the public could see how much tax Australia's largest companies are paying. They are supporting transparency for US citizens vis-a-vis their tax obligations, but not for large businesses here. If the government are serious about making sure companies pay their fair share of tax, why are they trying to let these same companies hide how much tax they are paying?




Mr Ciobo:
  This is your best speech so far!




Mr GILES:
  Well, one day it might be as good as one of your best ones. Stephen! If I am very, very lucky!




Mr Ciobo:
  I know!




Mr GILES:
  And one day I might get the same audience as is sitting behind you now too!




Mr Vasta:
  What? Quality like me?




Mr GILES:
  The coalition is also not proceeding with Labor's changes to the offshore banking unit regime or the abolition of section 25-90, which allows companies to deduct interest expenses on debt related to foreign untaxed income. According to the government's figures in MYEFO, this will cost Australian taxpayers around $700 million. So while the US is cracking down on people evading tax, the coalition government seems to be doing the exact opposite—indeed, facilitating it.


At the heart of this debate is a discussion about the revenue-raising capacity of the government and its distribution of this finite resource. Governments all over the world, faced with structurally lower revenue bases, are facing the choice of whether to accept this neoliberal dogma and go down the austerity path of cutting people loose and dividing the haves and the have-nots, or to get those most able to to do their fair share of the heavy lifting.


Most importantly, we do need to have a broader debate about the role of government which, of course, partly manifests itself in this taxation debate. To this extent, the government has started this debate with its neoliberal, extremist budget. For the record, I take this opportunity to say that I believe that there is such a thing as society, and that there is a major role for government in society. Those opposite say that government should get out of the way so that we are left with a dog-eat-dog, survival-of-the-fittest contest that punishes the weak. I believe that government can, indeed must, be a check on the unfettered power of the strong over the weak.


And so, in supporting the important principles and the intergovernmental agreement that are enabled through this legislation, I also express the hope that it might inspire further action for Australia as a responsible global actor, but also domestically, to ensure that fair contributions are made to support a fairer society.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2014-06-04,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (16:48):  I want to thank those members who have contributed to this debate. The Tax Laws Amendment (Implementation of the FATCA Agreement) Bill 2014 gives effect to Australia's obligations under the treaty status Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America to Improve International Tax Compliance and to Implement FATCA.


The bill will require Australian financial institutions to collect and provide certain financial account information as specified in the agreement annually to the Australian Taxation Office which, in turn, will provide it to the United States Internal Revenue Service. This will enable Australian financial institutions to comply with the United States Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act in the most cost-effective way possible. In particular, I draw the attention of the House to page 34 of the explanatory memorandum, which details the compliance cost saving this bill will bring about—a saving of more than $583 million over 10 years. The bill will also help to enhance the tax system integrity by providing for improved cooperation between Australia and the United States for the purpose of preventing tax evasion.


I note the amendment that has been moved by the shadow assistant Treasurer, and also take this opportunity to highlight that the government will not support the opposition's amendment. And I note that while there has been a good contribution by government members in relation to this debate, unfortunately, we see another pious amendment that has been moved by the Australian Labor Party in relation to this bill. This time, of course, it is reflecting on the fact that they believe the government should be doing more in relation to multinational tax avoidance. I cannot help but think that once again we see a situation where Labor's narrative in the House sits at strange odds with the general community perception about Labor's economic approach.


The actual amendment that has been put before the House sits, and dovetails quite nicely, with Labor's ongoing narrative that the way in which—as best as I can tell—Labor intends to pay for their multi tens of billions of dollars of additional spending is to look at being able to recoup additional revenue through the use of the kinds of initiatives that they allude to in this amendment.


And so it is that I consistently hear from Labor members opposite—and we heard it in the contribution of the shadow assistant Treasurer and from the member for Scullin—that Labor's approach in relation to now wanting to put some $38 billion to $40 billion of spending back into the budget is that it will be funded through a crackdown on multinational institutions. The amendment that has been put in relation to this debate goes to the core of Labor's attempt to try to pretend that that is in some way going to provide the revenue that they need to bring about the kind of fiscal consolidation that the government is focused on.


Unfortunately though, the facts simply do not accord, yet again, with Labor's narrative in relation to both those issues—those two issues being multinationals paying tax and the second being their ability to raise enough revenue to make sure that those additional spending initiatives that Labor would like to reintroduce into the budget are actually able to be covered off.


We have seen the Labor Party attempt, very poorly, to make changes to transfer-pricing rules in 2012 and 2013. They did it through the Tax Laws Amendment (Cross‑Border Transfer Pricing) Act and through the Tax Laws Amendment (Countering Tax Avoidance and Multinational Profit Shifting) Act 2013. It was very clear to the coalition then that the consequence of those acts was going to be that the government was going to massively ramp up compliance costs but not actually get the balance right with respect to ensuring that compliance versus the integrity of the tax system would be in fact balanced. Labor is big on rhetoric when it comes to this matter but their follow-through is, unfortunately, quite poor.


The coalition, in contrast, has a proud track record in this sense. We have long supported legislation that counters transfer-pricing, having introduced the original legislation in 1982. In fact, the Treasurer identified addressing base erosion and profit shifting as one of the key issues that G20 finance ministers are focusing on throughout this year. Indeed, in the February meeting of finance ministers in Sydney as part of the G20 process, the Treasurer was able to steer a very good outcome for those G20 members to ensure that there would be strong in-principle agreement. It actually was part of the BEPS process—that is, base erosion profit shifting process—which is taking place throughout this year. There is action by the coalition both in an historical context—having moved the original legislation—and now more recently through our activities in the G20.


I say to the Australian Labor Party a very simple message—that is, the government is actually acting on base erosion and profit shifting. Labor's approach was heavy-handed when it came to red tape and compliance. Labor's approach has failed miserably. Most importantly, not for one second should Australians hold the view that Labor's narrative, their attempt to pump some $38 billion or $40 billion back into the budget, will be covered off by an attempt to try to squeeze more money out of international institutions. The government is alert to failings in this regard. The government is making reforms and, in fact, the coalition is leading international discussions in making sure that the BEPS issue is addressed. It stands in stark contrast to the kind of political games the Australian Labor Party are playing with an amendment such as the one that has been moved by the shadow Assistant Treasurer.


Fundamentally, the Australian Labor Party needs to recognise that they need to make some hard decisions when it comes to fiscal consolidation and when it comes to putting the budget back on the right track. They cannot mask their decisions by saying, 'Well, we will find the additional revenue for $30 billion or $40 billion of additional spending by magically squeezing more money out of multinational institutions.' No, that is in fact not going to provide anywhere near the kind of revenue the Australian Labor Party is proposing. Rather, what Labor need to do is undertake some of the tough choices about making sure that Australia as a nation and the federal government as an entity live within their means.


When I hear contributions like that from the member for Scullin, who made comments that he believed the budget unfairly put too much pressure on pensioners, for example, and on those of lower socioeconomic status, I say to the members opposite, 'Why is it that Australian Labor members profess so much concern for pensioners yet will happily turn a blind eye to the fact that they are lumbering the next generation of Australians with debt that will take decades to repay?' I stand at the dispatch box here and when I look up at the Australian students in the gallery I know that those children are going to be the ones that will be paying off Labor's debt for the next 20 or 30 years. I say to the children of Australia that they are going to be responsible for paying back this government's largess for decades. I say to the Australian Labor Party we do not need lectures about there being an unfair burden on particular elements of the community. Because the reality is that the Australian Labor Party are being grossly hypocritical by making comments like 'it is unfair that this particular group is penalised' meanwhile conveniently ignoring the fact that the very real impact of the past six years of Labor's failed economic approach has been that young Aussie kids are now indebted and will take 20 or 30 years to pay back that debt.


The reason that is germane to this debate is because the fig leaf that Labor use, trying to explain how they can possibly put forward a proposal to reintroduce $30 billion or $40 billion of spending back in the budget, is to miraculously find the revenue in multinational institutions. I have heard it from the shadow Treasurer. It is not only the shadow Assistant Treasurer who comes up with these pithy little amendments; it is also the actual shadow Treasurer—the alternative Treasurer of the country—who turns around and makes comments such as 'we will find the revenue from multinational institutions who are not paying their fair share'.


I think it is important that all Australians recognise that while these kinds of amendments are fun and games for the Australian Labor Party and might tick some kind of factional box for the shadow Assistant Treasurer, the reality is that it will not provide anywhere near the revenue that Labor needs. Labor needs to actually step up to the plate, make some hard decisions and recognise that the populist approach to economics got them into trouble in the first place. It will not get them out of trouble until they have the fiscal discipline to implement the kinds of tough decisions that mean Australia can live within its means. In rejecting the opposition's amendment, I also take this opportunity to commend the bill to the House.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (16:15):  I move:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government's inaction on multinational tax avoidance that have resulted in broken promises in the budget leading to tax increases and cuts to essential services.""


In March 2010 the United States Congress enacted the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, also known as FATCA. The aim of the act was to improve compliance with US tax laws. FATCA imposed certain due diligence and reporting obligations on non-US financial institutions, including Australian institutions. Two years after the passing of FATCA, the member for Lilley, Wayne Swan, the then Treasurer, met with United States Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner in Washington and issued a statement on 7 November 2012 announcing that Australia had commenced formal discussions for an intergovernmental agreement with the United States to minimise the impact for Australians of FATCA. That statement noted that an intergovernmental agreement would also improve existing reciprocal tax information-sharing arrangements between the Australian Taxation Office and the United States Internal Revenue Service, which would help ensure Australian tax laws are effectively enforced so that Australian businesses and individuals who pay their fair share of tax are not disadvantaged by those who seek to evade their tax obligations.


Under the agreement which has been signed with the United States and was announced by the Treasurer on 28 April this year, we now have an intergovernmental agreement which sees Australian financial institutions complying with FATCA. Under this arrangement, a broad range of Australian financial institutions are affected: banks, building societies, credit unions, specified life insurance companies, investment funds, custodial institutions and some brokers. Those financial institutions are to be required to register with the US IRS. 


Under this bill, from 1 July 2014 the affected financial institutions will review customer accounts to determine whether they are reportable accounts, US citizens or US tax residents under the intergovernmental agreement and will report to the ATO in the 2015 calendar year the required account information for the 2014 calendar year, which will then be passed on from the ATO to the IRS. This bill puts in place those appropriate arrangements in order to see Australian institutions complying with FATCA. 


It is pleasing for those of us on this side of the House to see the end of these negotiations, begun under the member for Lilley and concluded under this government. The Labor Party welcomes sensible steps to assist tax authorities in ensuring compliance with tax regulations. What we are concerned about, however, is that while the government has managed to conclude this deal, it has dropped the ball on multinational profit shifting. More than $1 billion of loopholes have been opened up under this government, which will allow multinational firms to shift profits overseas. So while dual Australian-US citizens will be affected by FATCA, the multinationals will be able to continue to shift profits overseas. In a speech earlier today I listed the measures, five of them, on which the government has backtracked. The total amount is $1.1 billion.


Multinational profit shifting is a painfully detailed area and we were fortunate in government to have Assistant Treasurer David Bradbury focusing on these reforms for us. It might be helpful to the House if I outline in straightforward terms how multinational firms shift profits out of Australia and into low-tax jurisdictions. One simple example that members might think about is an arrangement in which the Bermuda arm of a company sells the Australian arm a paperclip at a cost of $1 million. The Australian company then claims that as a $1 million tax deduction and the money is effectively shifted offshore. That particular loophole has been closed, but a parallel trick can still be played with debt, in which the Bermuda subsidiary makes a multimillion dollar loan to the Australian arm and effectively $1 million a year is shifted out of Australia in the form of interest payments. Those interest payments are a tax deduction in Australia and the profit can be moved to Bermuda, where the company tax rate is considerably lower.


The concern that the Labor Party has on this is that multinational profit shifting will invariably become more tempting as industries internationalise. As more and more business is done over the internet, we are moving from a closed economy to a very, very open economy. And a government which is going soft on multinational profit shifting is a government which is increasingly going to miss out on revenue. Australia already has a higher than average share of revenue collected from company taxes, and so failing to close company tax loopholes is a significant issue for Australia. And because this government is unwilling to close corporate tax loopholes it has to do things like taking money away from children on the first day of school—getting rid of the schoolkids bonus payments, which is targeted towards low- and middle-income households, because it is going soft on multinational profit shifting. The Treasurer talks the big talk when he is at the G20, as the Prime Minister does when he is at Davos. But when it comes to actually walking into this House and passing bills which see multinationals pay their fair share of tax, this government is not up to the job. As a consequence, ordinary Australians will have to pay more tax or receive lower services. 


The total effect of the government's budget was to increase the deficit. Don't take my word for it: the member for Cook in question time yesterday said:


If I go back to the PEFO—as we know, the PEFO is where the officials tell the truth about what the budget really is from the previous government. From the previous Government, that's what it does, that's what it does.


A little repetitious, but you get the idea. PEFO is the true state of the books, so let's compare where we are at under the true state of the books, the Charter of Budget Honesty state of the books, with the current budget. 


The current budget's deficit is higher this year. It is higher next year and it is higher over the forward estimates. So what the government has done effectively in this budget is to redistribute resources—redistribute them from the most vulnerable to the most affluent. This is not only a failure of the fair-go test, because those who were most vulnerable have, after all, been doing it worse over the past generation, a generation in which incomes have risen faster for billionaires than for battlers, but now we have a budget that transfers resources from battlers to billionaires. A simple example of that: the budget raises the non-concessional superannuation cap pushing it from $150,000 to $180,000—a measure which will help some of the most affluent. 


But the vulnerable Australians do not just have low incomes; they also spend a larger share of their incomes. In fact if you look at those in the bottom income group, they tend to spend all of their incomes; and those in the top quintile tend to save about a quarter of their incomes. So, if you take $10 billion, you move it from the bottom quintile to the top quintile and then you take $2½ billion out of the economy. What would that do? You would expect it to have a hit on retail trade, and we are already seeing retail trade figures down. You would expect it to have a hit on consumer confidence, and we have the ANZ Roy Morgan Consumer Confidence measure now falling faster than at any time since the global financial crisis. We have the Westpac Melbourne Institute consumer confidence survey at nearly a three-year low. 


Part of what is going on at the Westpac Melbourne Institute consumer confidence survey is that confidence has fallen to a lousy 74.9 among Labor voters. I have news for those opposite: Labor voters may not have supported them in the last election but, if you are a retailer, a dollar coming out of the wallet of a Labor voter is just as good to you as a dollar coming out of the pocket of a coalition voter. This pessimism in the economy is hurting retail trade. 


Robert Menzies liked to say that about half the people didn't vote for him at each election and they could not all be wrong. It neatly sums up the value of bipartisanship but it is particularly important when we are thinking about economic policymaking. Governments must govern for all Australians. They must recognise that retailers are depending on the spending of coalition voters and Labor voters alike. But a government which is behaving as political scientist Judith Brett wrote recently like 'a bunch of winners taking it out on the losers … It all feels a bit like student politics and its short-term point-scoring, its payback and its intense personal antagonisms'. A government of that kind is a government which will not engender confidence in the economy. 


Perhaps we should not be surprised then that the Australian Institute of Company Directors biannual survey found that fewer than one in three company directors believe the federal government is having a positive impact on their business decisions and consumer confidence. 


This is a measure which improves transparency, and it is good to see this government supporting transparency. As Justice Brandeis said—that is not 'the-would-be Justice Brandis'; that is the real United States Justice Louis Brandeis—sunlight is the best disinfectant. I am a strong supporter of transparency, but it does strike me as strange that the government is very keen on transparency for US-Australian citizens in exchanging information between the ATO and IRS but less keen on transparency when it comes to what has happened in our detention centres, what is happening with boats. 


When it comes to the Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission, a commission set up to ensure transparency in the charitable sector and to ensure that Australian donors can see the organisations to which they are donating, the government wants to scrap the ACNC and reduce transparency in the charitable sector. 


The government is yet to hold a single community cabinet, a great transparency measure introduced under Labor. The government has said that it will not release the Treasury blue books under the freedom of information laws as they were after the two previous elections. 


The government in another anti-transparency move has taken the Family Impact Statement out of the budget. The family impact statement was put in the budget by Peter Costello, and maintained when the Rudd and Gillard governments were in office. We thought they were a good thing, so we kept them there. This year they disappeared, and families will not be surprised as to why. If you are a family in the bottom quintile in income distribution, families with children lose 6.6 per cent of their disposable income as a result of this budget; they lose more than $1 in $20. The poorest single parent families with children lose more than $1 in $10—$1 in $10 is being taken out of their wallets as a result of this. No wonder the government is backtracking on transparency with the Family Impact Statement. 


On the measure championed by Labor, which would have required the tax commissioner to publish the amount of corporate tax paid for entities with a total income of $100 million or more, the coalition has already sent out strong signals that it is not going to proceed with that particular transparency measure. They were so proud of that particular announcement that they brought it out in the first week of the new year—not normally a time in which you announce the things that you are very excited by—but the time when then Assistant Treasurer Arthur Sinodinos chose to drop the story to the Australian Financial Review.We have heard nothing of it so far, but I am deeply concerned that this transparency measure will be dropped as well. 


The opposition supports this sensible measure. The FATCA agreements were initiated under Treasurer Swan and concluded under Treasurer Hockey. I wish the spirit of this bill would better pervade the government's actions. Transparency is good enough for FATCA and it ought to be good enough for other areas of government policymaking. If it is good enough to close down tax loopholes to stop tax minimisation then it ought to be good enough to close down tax loopholes that are allowing a billion dollars of tax owed by multinationals to escape.

Mr SUKKAR
 (Deakin) (16:30):  I want to briefly speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Implementation of the FATCA Agreement) Bill 2014. I want to congratulate the Treasurer, Joe Hockey, on so quickly coming to the aid of Australian financial institutions and concluding the FATCA agreement. The unilateral decision by the United States has meant that Australian financial institutions with any presence in the United States could be subject to a withholding tax rate of 30 per cent. In announcing the signing of the agreement, the Treasurer highlighted the importance of this change in reducing the burden on Australian financial institutions and in particular that due diligence that would be required from Australian institutions in managing each of the accounts that may or may not be relevant to the FATCA requirements. In order to comply with the relevant reporting obligations, Australian financial institutions would have been required to undertake a range of procedures in identifying all relevant accounts. Broadly, FATCA requires foreign financial institutions to provide the US Internal Revenue Service with information on US citizens living abroad who have more than $50,000 in their accounts. So it is a wide-ranging and significant compliance burden on Australian financial institutions.


The commencement of the regime is looming on 1 July 2014, as the member for Fraser said, and it will obviously have a huge impact on Australian financial services. One of the reasons that Australia has had to enter into the agreement with the United States which is now the subject of this bill is that Australian privacy laws generally prevent compliance with these US based regulations and some Australian state and territory antidiscrimination laws could also prevent the interrogation of customer accounts based on US citizenship. In recognition of the fact that many of these domestic laws would otherwise prevent foreign financial institutions from fully complying with FATCA, the US developed an intergovernmental agreement approach to manage these legal impediments, simplify practical implementation and reduce compliance costs for relevant financial institutions. That is why I congratulate the Treasurer, Joe Hockey, for moving so quickly to sign the intergovernmental with the US in April. 


As always, this government has its eye on the ball when it comes to making sure that our businesses are not weighed down with red tape and unnecessary administrative costs. Unfortunately, that was not the case when those opposite were in government. Treasurer Joe Hockey was advised soon after last year's election that 96 tax and superannuation announcements, with one dating back as far as March 2001, had not been legislated. One of those announcements related to FATCA. The former Treasurer announced his intention to negotiate an intergovernmental agreement with US on FATCA in November 2012, but it was not signed by the former government. This slack approach was not fair on Australian businesses or consumers and it created uncertainty, particularly with the likelihood of a withholding tax applying to Australian financial institutions. That approach has changed and we have ended the uncertainty with the subject of this bill. We are listening to businesses and consumers.


Importantly, the Australian Bankers Association welcomed the signing of the intergovernmental agreement. Steven Munchenberg, chief executive of the ABA, said:


We congratulate the Australian government in securing this agreement. It will enable Australian investors and savers to more easily access the US economy without suffering a prohibitive 30 per cent withholding tax cost. 


This is an essential development in facilitating capital flows into and out of Australia while having best practice regulation. 


The current and previous governments' work in this area will ensure Australia continues to have one of the world's most competitive financial services sectors, a major factor in economic growth.


Again, I want to congratulate the Treasurer for ensuring that the uncertainty that applied with the possible application of a withholding tax in the United States is not an issue that Australian financial institutions have to worry about any further. 


There are of course compliance costs associated with this measure. As a government, we are proud that the approach we have adopted ensures that the compliance costs are the lowest of all the available options. Again, it is to ensure that capital that flows in and out of Australia can be as free as possible and not subject to interest withholding tax. I again congratulate the Treasurer.

"Giles, Andrew, MP",ALP,2014-06-04,"



Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (16:36):  I rise to make a contribution on the Tax Laws Amendment (Implementation of the FATCA Agreement) Bill 2014. As previous speakers have noted, this bill in effect requires Australian financial institutions to collect information about their customers who are likely to be taxpayers in the United States of America and to provide that information to the Australian Taxation Office which will, in turn, provide that information to the US Internal Revenue Service. This of course gives effect to the Australian government's commitments as set out in the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America to Improve International Tax Compliance and to Implement FATCA—the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act—which was signed in Canberra in April 2014, as the member for Deakin noted a moment ago.


FATCA has been described by TheEconomist as 'by far the biggest catalyst' of a movement towards global tax-transparency or, indeed, tax fairness. I note that the UK has also, in the aftermath of FATCA, taken what may be regarded as similar steps to the US, and that the OECD is progressing the implementation of a single global standard for the exchange of relevant information. This year's G20 finance meeting in Sydney endorsed common standards for sharing account information across borders, with automatic exchange taking effect by the end of next year. This is an important development—although, as is the case with the bill before us, there is obviously considerably more work to be done.


I note in that regard—and I think the member for Deakin also touched on this—the very important work that the former Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister, the member for Lilley, did in the lead-up to this bill, by commencing the formal discussions between Australia and the US following a meeting between the Treasurer and US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner in November 2012. I also note the important work that former Assistant Treasurer David Bradbury did in the area of cracking down on corporate profit-shifting and tax minimisation schemes. I congratulate him on his recent elevation at the OECD. It is well deserved and I wish him very well, though I think it is appropriate that I also say that he is very much missed in his former role in this place in the government of Australia.


The FATCA is an American law, developed to reduce offshore tax evasion and regain federal tax revenues from American account holders at foreign—that is, non-American—financial institutions internationally. It obviously, in that regard, has implications for Australia and Australia's financial institutions. The impetus for the act in America was a 2009 court case in which Swiss bank UBS was found to have assisted American nationals to evade paying American taxes. As a result, UBS agreed to pay the US government US$780 million in fines, in restitution, and also to provide the names of suspected tax cheats. There has obviously also been some significant subsequent litigation in this area. According to the US Department of Justice, the use of offshore bank accounts to avoid paying American taxes costs the US Treasury, in total, at least US$100 billion annually. This is of course a cost to American society of the same magnitude.


The wide-reaching FATCA was passed in the 111th Congress as part of the 2010 Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act, the HIRE Act, becoming law in March 2010, and requires individuals to report their financial accounts held outside of the United States; and foreign—again, that is, non-United States—financial institutions to report to the IRS about their American clients. To enforce the FATCA, it has become necessary for the US government to sign agreements with foreign governments such as Australia's, allowing the trade of individuals' financial data.


Labor welcomes any sensible steps to assist tax authorities, whether in Australia or overseas, to ensure compliance with tax regulations. The Treasurer has acknowledged that some multinationals are not even paying their fair share of tax anywhere and called for a global response. I welcome this, too. But there is more to be done—much more.


This government has demonstrated a significant gap between its rhetoric and its actions when it comes to ensuring that multinationals pay their fair share of tax within Australia. By not proceeding with similarly sensible measures, as are implemented in this legislation, the Australian people have forgone over a billion dollars in revenue. This is resulting in cuts to essential services. And, as the member for Fraser has noted, every dollar avoided by multinational companies must, in effect, be paid for by Australian taxpayers and businesses, or, of course, by cutting services—essential services maintaining the fabric of our society. We have seen with this budget which side this government is on. It asks those with the least to do the most, time after time after time, as we heard in the matter of public importance discussion only a few minutes ago.


Ultimately, I think it is important to acknowledge that cracking down on multinational profit-shifting is not just about making sure that firms pay their fair share of tax, important as that is. Critically, it is also about making sure that the burden of tax is fairly shared across businesses.


I am reminded of the comment of the Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr: 'Taxes are what we pay for a civilized society.' That was as prescient of the debate in Australia at the moment, as we argue in this place and outside it about what makes a civilised society. I note the context for that remark. It was made in a dissenting judgement in a 1927 case involving a Spanish tobacco company seeking to minimise its tax arrangements on insurance in the Philippines, then subject to the law of the United States. Even by today's standards—the standards that FATCA is engaged in working through—it was a very complicated case. But His Honour saw through the complex taxation arrangements then, and we must do our best to do likewise now. To quote him more fully: 'It is true … that every exaction of money for an act is a discouragement to the extent of the payment required, but that which, in its immediacy, is a discouragement may be part of an encouragement when seen in its organic connection with the whole.' This notion of an 'organic connection with the whole' is one that deserves some greater consideration.


I believe that this principle is at the very heart of taxation. Taxation should never be seen in isolation, as those opposite and their right-wing cheerleaders insist it should be. It is true, of course, that our roads, schools, hospitals and all of our services are, in large part, funded from tax revenue, but this is part of a broader purpose—that purpose being, of course, to build a society where people are not left behind or excluded because of the material circumstances in which they entered this life.


This is why the coalition's budget has been so devastating, because its basic message is: if you are not born into comfort then you will not get to fully participate in society. And this is why we, on this side, describe the budget as cruel. To say to someone that, no matter how hard you work or how smart you are or how well you apply yourself, you do not stand a chance to get ahead in life because your parents' wealth does not allow for it—this is cruelty. Interestingly, that seemed to be acknowledged to some extent by the former Prime Minister, John Howard, in his contribution at the National Press Club today.


Countries that have progressive taxation systems tend to have the least inequality and, in turn, tend to be more collectively prosperous and productive. One only needs to look at the Scandinavian examples as proof of this—evidence, as opposed to neoliberal theory. Can those opposite point to examples of prosperous, productive and equal societies that operate under these sorts of neoliberal regimes? I doubt it, and I again reflect on the contribution of John Howard, a former conservative Prime Minister, in his remarks on the state of the US society.


I am pleased that the US has passed laws to crack down on tax evasion and that Australia is assisting with collection. But it is somewhat ironic that the US is where those opposite look to as a model for Australia, whether it is for universities, health care or gated communities more generally. The US system is in too many respects based on concepts of user-pays exclusivity. It applies a moral lens to those who, for instance, cannot afford to take on massive amounts of debt, who cannot find work or who until recently could not afford health care. It divides their community into haves and have-nots, deserving and undeserving. This has never been the Australian way, and it cannot be so in the future.


I applaud the US administration for getting the high-roller tax evaders to pay their fair share wherever they may be. I note that these measures are permanent, not temporary like this government's deficit tax on high earners. Our government could learn from the US government to treat foreign companies and people the same as it treats Australian companies and people. What is this government doing to tackle Australians seeking to evade taxes here and abroad?


I return once more to Holmes' decision:


The result of upholding the government's action is just. When it taxes domestic insurance it reasonably may endeavor not to let the foreign insurance escape. If it does not discriminate against the latter it naturally does not want to discriminate against its own.


Indeed, getting foreign or domestic companies or wealthy individuals to contribute to the running of a society and system of government from which they derive a profit or protection from is entirely just.


And so the principles of this legislation are supported by Labor. But again, it is only part of what is needed to be done. The government wants to repeal Labor's tax transparency reforms. These reforms would have ensured the public could see how much tax Australia's largest companies are paying. They are supporting transparency for US citizens vis-a-vis their tax obligations, but not for large businesses here. If the government are serious about making sure companies pay their fair share of tax, why are they trying to let these same companies hide how much tax they are paying?




Mr Ciobo:
  This is your best speech so far!




Mr GILES:
  Well, one day it might be as good as one of your best ones. Stephen! If I am very, very lucky!




Mr Ciobo:
  I know!




Mr GILES:
  And one day I might get the same audience as is sitting behind you now too!




Mr Vasta:
  What? Quality like me?




Mr GILES:
  The coalition is also not proceeding with Labor's changes to the offshore banking unit regime or the abolition of section 25-90, which allows companies to deduct interest expenses on debt related to foreign untaxed income. According to the government's figures in MYEFO, this will cost Australian taxpayers around $700 million. So while the US is cracking down on people evading tax, the coalition government seems to be doing the exact opposite—indeed, facilitating it.


At the heart of this debate is a discussion about the revenue-raising capacity of the government and its distribution of this finite resource. Governments all over the world, faced with structurally lower revenue bases, are facing the choice of whether to accept this neoliberal dogma and go down the austerity path of cutting people loose and dividing the haves and the have-nots, or to get those most able to to do their fair share of the heavy lifting.


Most importantly, we do need to have a broader debate about the role of government which, of course, partly manifests itself in this taxation debate. To this extent, the government has started this debate with its neoliberal, extremist budget. For the record, I take this opportunity to say that I believe that there is such a thing as society, and that there is a major role for government in society. Those opposite say that government should get out of the way so that we are left with a dog-eat-dog, survival-of-the-fittest contest that punishes the weak. I believe that government can, indeed must, be a check on the unfettered power of the strong over the weak.


And so, in supporting the important principles and the intergovernmental agreement that are enabled through this legislation, I also express the hope that it might inspire further action for Australia as a responsible global actor, but also domestically, to ensure that fair contributions are made to support a fairer society.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2014-06-04,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (16:48):  I want to thank those members who have contributed to this debate. The Tax Laws Amendment (Implementation of the FATCA Agreement) Bill 2014 gives effect to Australia's obligations under the treaty status Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America to Improve International Tax Compliance and to Implement FATCA.


The bill will require Australian financial institutions to collect and provide certain financial account information as specified in the agreement annually to the Australian Taxation Office which, in turn, will provide it to the United States Internal Revenue Service. This will enable Australian financial institutions to comply with the United States Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act in the most cost-effective way possible. In particular, I draw the attention of the House to page 34 of the explanatory memorandum, which details the compliance cost saving this bill will bring about—a saving of more than $583 million over 10 years. The bill will also help to enhance the tax system integrity by providing for improved cooperation between Australia and the United States for the purpose of preventing tax evasion.


I note the amendment that has been moved by the shadow assistant Treasurer, and also take this opportunity to highlight that the government will not support the opposition's amendment. And I note that while there has been a good contribution by government members in relation to this debate, unfortunately, we see another pious amendment that has been moved by the Australian Labor Party in relation to this bill. This time, of course, it is reflecting on the fact that they believe the government should be doing more in relation to multinational tax avoidance. I cannot help but think that once again we see a situation where Labor's narrative in the House sits at strange odds with the general community perception about Labor's economic approach.


The actual amendment that has been put before the House sits, and dovetails quite nicely, with Labor's ongoing narrative that the way in which—as best as I can tell—Labor intends to pay for their multi tens of billions of dollars of additional spending is to look at being able to recoup additional revenue through the use of the kinds of initiatives that they allude to in this amendment.


And so it is that I consistently hear from Labor members opposite—and we heard it in the contribution of the shadow assistant Treasurer and from the member for Scullin—that Labor's approach in relation to now wanting to put some $38 billion to $40 billion of spending back into the budget is that it will be funded through a crackdown on multinational institutions. The amendment that has been put in relation to this debate goes to the core of Labor's attempt to try to pretend that that is in some way going to provide the revenue that they need to bring about the kind of fiscal consolidation that the government is focused on.


Unfortunately though, the facts simply do not accord, yet again, with Labor's narrative in relation to both those issues—those two issues being multinationals paying tax and the second being their ability to raise enough revenue to make sure that those additional spending initiatives that Labor would like to reintroduce into the budget are actually able to be covered off.


We have seen the Labor Party attempt, very poorly, to make changes to transfer-pricing rules in 2012 and 2013. They did it through the Tax Laws Amendment (Cross‑Border Transfer Pricing) Act and through the Tax Laws Amendment (Countering Tax Avoidance and Multinational Profit Shifting) Act 2013. It was very clear to the coalition then that the consequence of those acts was going to be that the government was going to massively ramp up compliance costs but not actually get the balance right with respect to ensuring that compliance versus the integrity of the tax system would be in fact balanced. Labor is big on rhetoric when it comes to this matter but their follow-through is, unfortunately, quite poor.


The coalition, in contrast, has a proud track record in this sense. We have long supported legislation that counters transfer-pricing, having introduced the original legislation in 1982. In fact, the Treasurer identified addressing base erosion and profit shifting as one of the key issues that G20 finance ministers are focusing on throughout this year. Indeed, in the February meeting of finance ministers in Sydney as part of the G20 process, the Treasurer was able to steer a very good outcome for those G20 members to ensure that there would be strong in-principle agreement. It actually was part of the BEPS process—that is, base erosion profit shifting process—which is taking place throughout this year. There is action by the coalition both in an historical context—having moved the original legislation—and now more recently through our activities in the G20.


I say to the Australian Labor Party a very simple message—that is, the government is actually acting on base erosion and profit shifting. Labor's approach was heavy-handed when it came to red tape and compliance. Labor's approach has failed miserably. Most importantly, not for one second should Australians hold the view that Labor's narrative, their attempt to pump some $38 billion or $40 billion back into the budget, will be covered off by an attempt to try to squeeze more money out of international institutions. The government is alert to failings in this regard. The government is making reforms and, in fact, the coalition is leading international discussions in making sure that the BEPS issue is addressed. It stands in stark contrast to the kind of political games the Australian Labor Party are playing with an amendment such as the one that has been moved by the shadow Assistant Treasurer.


Fundamentally, the Australian Labor Party needs to recognise that they need to make some hard decisions when it comes to fiscal consolidation and when it comes to putting the budget back on the right track. They cannot mask their decisions by saying, 'Well, we will find the additional revenue for $30 billion or $40 billion of additional spending by magically squeezing more money out of multinational institutions.' No, that is in fact not going to provide anywhere near the kind of revenue the Australian Labor Party is proposing. Rather, what Labor need to do is undertake some of the tough choices about making sure that Australia as a nation and the federal government as an entity live within their means.


When I hear contributions like that from the member for Scullin, who made comments that he believed the budget unfairly put too much pressure on pensioners, for example, and on those of lower socioeconomic status, I say to the members opposite, 'Why is it that Australian Labor members profess so much concern for pensioners yet will happily turn a blind eye to the fact that they are lumbering the next generation of Australians with debt that will take decades to repay?' I stand at the dispatch box here and when I look up at the Australian students in the gallery I know that those children are going to be the ones that will be paying off Labor's debt for the next 20 or 30 years. I say to the children of Australia that they are going to be responsible for paying back this government's largess for decades. I say to the Australian Labor Party we do not need lectures about there being an unfair burden on particular elements of the community. Because the reality is that the Australian Labor Party are being grossly hypocritical by making comments like 'it is unfair that this particular group is penalised' meanwhile conveniently ignoring the fact that the very real impact of the past six years of Labor's failed economic approach has been that young Aussie kids are now indebted and will take 20 or 30 years to pay back that debt.


The reason that is germane to this debate is because the fig leaf that Labor use, trying to explain how they can possibly put forward a proposal to reintroduce $30 billion or $40 billion of spending back in the budget, is to miraculously find the revenue in multinational institutions. I have heard it from the shadow Treasurer. It is not only the shadow Assistant Treasurer who comes up with these pithy little amendments; it is also the actual shadow Treasurer—the alternative Treasurer of the country—who turns around and makes comments such as 'we will find the revenue from multinational institutions who are not paying their fair share'.


I think it is important that all Australians recognise that while these kinds of amendments are fun and games for the Australian Labor Party and might tick some kind of factional box for the shadow Assistant Treasurer, the reality is that it will not provide anywhere near the revenue that Labor needs. Labor needs to actually step up to the plate, make some hard decisions and recognise that the populist approach to economics got them into trouble in the first place. It will not get them out of trouble until they have the fiscal discipline to implement the kinds of tough decisions that mean Australia can live within its means. In rejecting the opposition's amendment, I also take this opportunity to commend the bill to the House.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2014-06-04,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (19:30):  I rise this evening to speak on the plight of apprentices. Before the election, the Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, spent a lot of time in a fluoro vest and a hard hat, gladhanding apprentices and workers. He said: 'An incoming coalition government will help more young Australians to start a trade, stay in a trade and finish a trade.' But these were hollow words. It is now clear that the Prime Minister has treated apprentices with the same contempt he has treated everyone else whom this budget has hurt. What the Prime Minister did not say was that he would trash the tools for trade program and halve its funding which paid for apprentices' tools. He has cut the scheme's funding from about $1 billion to $476 million over four years and replaced it with the inferior Trade Support Loans Program, which is just going to plunge people further into debt.


It is very clear to anyone who works in this field or has a background in it: no tools, no apprentice. The Prime Minister has wrenched the tools from the hands of thousands of apprentices across the country. According to the Minister for Industry, Mr Ian Macfarlane, this cut is okay because apprentices were spending the money on 'tattoos and mag wheels for their cars and birthday parties'. How cynical, wrong and removed from reality can you get. 


I would like to read an email from a fourth-year apprentice called Matthew, who said: 'The changes affect me and two other apprentices in my depot along with thousands of other apprentices nationwide who rely on these payments. While I do not agree with the changes to apprentice funding, I am disgusted that they can change the system apprentices such as myself are halfway through.' Another fourth-year apprentice, coincidentally also called Matthew, said: 'The current Abbott government are just going to rip this up without any thought of how it will affect us. Every bit of money helps, especially as I am also supporting my wife and daughter, and paying a mortgage. The removal of this payment is approximately six per cent of my annual income and I could only imagine the uproar if Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey were asked to delete six per cent of their annual income.' This is what an apprentice called Luke said: 'I am grateful that I was the beneficiary of the tools for trade program throughout my apprenticeship. I used the money to buy tools like big ticket items such as drills that cost upwards of $700. Apprentices already struggle with a low income, studying and paying bills. These incentives are what attract young job seekers in the first place without the added stress of paying loans like a tertiary student.'


This is the reality and it is gut-wrenching to hear. Worse still, the Prime Minister's new loan scheme will not cover thousands of current second-, third- and fourth-year apprentices across the country for whom the tools for trade program is essential. So what happens to them? Where do they get the money from to pay for their tools midway through their apprenticeships? The Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the industry minister just could not care less. It appears that the Prime Minister has left thousands of apprentices who depend on the tools for trade program simply swinging in the breeze. What makes it worse is that the cuts to funding for the tools for trade program are completely avoidable. The Prime Minister could have kept the tools for trade scheme intact and instead ended the $12 billion taxpayer subsidy to the fossil fuel industry to fund it. The Prime Minister could have gone one better and increased the funding to the tools for trade program by, for example, not needlessly spending at least $24 billion on 58 joint strike fighters.


Earlier this year, the Greens called for a construction-led stimulus package for the south-east of the country and Western Australia. What I said in February is just as true now. Now is the time to cut $12 billion in corporate welfare from the fossil fuel sector to drive a clean economy and secure jobs in south-east Australia. By building more public housing and fast-tracking public transport projects, we can find jobs for the workers facing redundancy, address the housing crisis and care for the planet all at once. Supporting construction, design and manufacturing jobs by building 77½-thousand new houses over the next 10 years would create thousands of jobs, including for apprentices. The Abbott government could do this right now but chooses not to. What we need is a plan that reboots our manufacturing base, uses our manufacturing expertise and retools workers, apprentices and manufacturing for the new economy that is emerging right around the world. But if we take the tools away from the builders, the plumbers, the carpenters and the electricians of tomorrow, our very future is in doubt. I say to our apprentices: the Greens will fight to put tools back in your hands.

"Ryan, Joanne, MP",ALP,2014-06-04,"



Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (09:30):  I met last week with the executive team from Werribee Mercy Hospital. The Mercy deliver great service to our local community. They have a strong vision for the future of health provision in our area. Wyndham's population is about to reach 200,000. The number of households is expected to double again by 2030. The Werribee Mercy was established in 1994, when the population was estimated to reach around 90,000 in 2004. At the time the local community hospital was the correct service for the area and, despite this huge growth in population, it serves us well, but for how much longer?


Mercy Health in Werribee has an extremely well-trained and dedicated staff. Some of the top experts in Victoria choose to work at this service. What the Mercy needs are the facilities to serve this high-growth community. If you present to the Mercy Hospital today with a heart attack, the staff are very well trained to save and stabilise you, but for your long-term ongoing treatment you need to be transferred. At my recent meeting I was told of a doctor spending six hours on the phone to other hospitals trying to secure a transfer for a patient. If the hospital had a coronary care unit, this would have been avoided, meaning the doctor would have been back treating patients in the emergency department. If you are a patient in the ward who unfortunately has a critical incident, you are also likely to be transferred to the emergency department to be stabilised at our local hospital. The six closest hospitals to the Mercy where patients are transferred to are, on average, 35 kilometres away. This lack of critical care services compromises patient care and increases clinical risk.


In the electorate of Lalor, there is a huge number of young families and nearly 70 babies are born each week. There is great need for maternity services. The Mercy team know if they had the appropriate facilities they could provide care for approximately 80 per cent of local women; currently the rate is around 48 per cent. They need 10 more obstetric beds now, let alone extra needed for the predicted growth. Current estimates are that around 40 per cent of the general healthcare needs of my community are being met by the Werribee Mercy, meaning 60 per cent leave the area to obtain health care. There will always be cases that need very specialised services only available in our larger teaching hospitals. It is not appropriate for all hospitals to provide all services, but surely the percentage should be much higher than 40 per cent? Mercy Health has undertaken detailed planning for a carefully staged master plan. They take the provision of health care very seriously and their plans are based on sensible, well-targeted needs. In the past the federal Labor government has worked with this service to fund growth, most recently providing $28 million for subacute beds and a rehabilitation unit. I plan to work closely with Mercy Health to ensure this government hears loud and clear what the health service needs are for my electorate.

"Griggs, Natasha, MP",CLP,2014-06-04,"



Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (10:01):  As I was saying last night when debating these appropriation bills, I am delighted that, as part of this year's budget, we are going ahead with our community safety program to spend $300,000 on providing CCTVs in and around Darwin and Palmerston. CCTVs have delivered great benefits where they have been installed. They are invaluable tools in solving and preventing crime. I know that they will be embraced by the Solomon community. We will be enlisting help from the community during the selection process. I am actually in the process now of organising a committee that is made up of police, Neighbourhood Watch and some business groups to identify key hotspots around Darwin and Palmerston.


One really good element of the Safer Streets Program is that we are using money generated from proceeds of crime to tackle crime and the criminals who commit them. Unlike Labor, we deliver on our CCTV rollouts. This is one of a number of things that we have done since we have come to government to assist the Northern Territory Police in doing their job to make the streets of Darwin and Palmerston safer. In February immigration minister Scott Morrison visited Darwin to announce that the Commonwealth would spend $48 million to employ around 100 police officers to oversee the asylum seekers still based in the territory.


During my first term of parliament, back in the bad old days of opposition, I worked hard to achieve the best outcomes for Solomon should we win the 2013 election. When the people of Solomon put their faith in me last year for another term in Canberra I had already secured funding from my colleagues here in Canberra. One of the best promises our new government has made—and this one is close to my heart—is for the hospital for the people of Palmerston. I have lived in Palmerston for over 20 years and now my son, Aaron, and his wife, Amy, are raising their baby daughter, Evie, in Palmerston.


Providing a state-of-the-art hospital in Palmerston is a very personal wish not just for me but for thousands of others around the Top End. The $110 million for a hospital in Palmerston is a firm commitment from the Abbott government that they take very seriously developing north Australia. The Prime Minister said:


These are important, tangible short-term commitments to the people of the north. We want to back that with a strategic vision that will help to make Northern Australia one of the great contributors to the extraordinary economic developments that we see to our north in our region in China, India and elsewhere.


The Joint Select Committee on Northern Australia has travelled extensively throughout north Australia. I am proud to say that there was such overwhelming interest in the public hearings in Darwin that our committee has agreed to come back for a second visit in August to ensure that all Territorians get their voice heard in terms of north Australia.


Another display of the coalition's commitment to deliver for the people of Darwin and Palmerston is the record amount of spending on roads in the Territory. I welcome the coalition's investment in the Territory with the $90 million regional roads productivity package and the $77 million Northern Territory roads package announced in the federal budget. This comes on top of the $70 million already promised by the Abbott government to duplicate Tiger Brennan Drive, which was one of my election promises.


The budget for 2014-15 is part of the government's economic action strategy to invest in productivity enhancing infrastructure which will create jobs, improve safety, reduce travel times and, most importantly, boost economic growth. This is $237 million to improve Territory roads. I worked in opposition and in government to have these important projects funded not just in Solomon but across the entire Northern Territory. The people of Lingiari also deserve increased road funding, even if their member was not effective in his advocacy to get that.


Throughout my time in opposition I had the opportunity to advocate for our local sporting clubs and secure funding for a variety of different projects that will get the children and adults in my electorate out and about and participating in sport. We recognise that local sport is an important aspect of the Top End community. Community sports organisations encourage a healthy and active lifestyle for both children and adults.


The Jingili BMX Club just last weekend tried out their new all-weather track for the first time. The coalition provided $1.5 million worth of funding to ensure this project was finally delivered. Unfortunately, in true Labor style, the money was promised in 2010 but the Labor government did not action it until four weeks out from an election. I look forward to visiting the new track next month when it will be used in competition for the first time. This is fantastic news for Territory BMX riders, who can now ride all year long and host international standard tournaments and not be disadvantaged by the wet season.


Berrimah Riding Club is another great local organisation in my electorate. They will receive around $5,000 to construct a shade structure over their horse wash bays. Not only does this funding benefit Berrimah Riding Club; it also assists other organisations that uses the Robbie Robbins Reserve facility.


The South Darwin Rugby League Football Club will receive $99,000 for much-needed upgrades to Warren Park, where a majority of the Northern Territory junior rugby league games are held on a Saturday morning. Upgrades to the park will include installation of a demountable for officials, roller door upgrades, construction and installation of removable shade structures, plumbing repairs, irrigation upgrades and field lights.


In addition to this, the Palmerston Football Club will receive $8,700 toward construction of new locker rooms for players and the Darwin Table Tennis Association will receive $13,000 for the purchase of 15 internationally certified table tennis tables for competition.


Another key election issue in my electorate centred around the coalition's policy to stop the flow of asylum seeker boats into the Northern Territory. I am so pleased to be able to say we have delivered on that promise. We said before the election that we would stop the boats, and that is exactly what we have done. That is good governance—carrying out promises made before an election. This is what the coalition is all about.


I am delighted in particular that this policy goal has been so quickly achieved. Overflowing detention centres in the electorate of Solomon meant an added burden on our healthcare system, emergency services and other social infrastructure, which I spoke about many times in this House. Those burdens did not please the people of Darwin and Palmerston. Sadly, people were dying trying to get to our country It was our Navy personnel who were tasked with pulling deceased bodies from the water when people-smuggling vessels sank. The only humane thing to do was to stop the boats. It was the only way to be fair both to Australian taxpayers and to desperate asylum seekers fleeing their countries.


Recently, we announced that two of the Darwin detention centres would close down. This is a dividend of the coalition's policy to stop the boats. The Defence Establishment Berrimah and the Darwin Airport Lodge will cease operations this financial year. This will directly affect my constituents, with pressure easing on the Royal Darwin Hospital and other social infrastructure. As I said, this is just one example of how the coalition is mopping up the mess left behind by the Labor Party and it infuriates me that my constituents must now do all the heavy lifting for the Labor Party's laziness and irresponsible actions. The coalition government's budget is addressing the debt and deficit disaster left behind by the Australian Labor Party. This Labor Party's legacy is unsustainable and must not be allowed to continue. To fail to tackle the borrowing of $1 billion every month just to pay the interest is unsustainable.


While the coalition is used to cleaning up Labor's mess, it does not make it any easier. Nor is it fair on the hardworking Australian taxpayers. When the coalition last left office, Australia had a $20 billion surplus and $50 billion in the bank, but over six years Labor squandered this and ran up five record deficits, $123 billion in projected deficits and gross debt heading towards $667 billion. The measures outlined in this year's budget are absolutely necessary so that we can secure Australia's economic future, and the tough decisions we are taking now are necessary to avoid even tougher decisions having to be made in the future.

Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (10:11):  I am pleased to speak on this budget, which begins the important task of repairing the Commonwealth budget and delivering a credible pathway back to surplus. Consider where we were in 2007: we had an unemployment rate of four per cent, no government debt, we had budgets in surplus. When the Labor government left office six years later, they left us with 200,000 more unemployed, gross debt projected to rise to $667 billion, $123 billion in cumulative deficits and the world's biggest carbon tax. This budget is an important step in fixing up that mess.


What we see with repairing the budget is that we have a pathway back to surplus in 2018-19 and budget surpluses to build to well over one per cent of GDP by 2024-25. Rather than the debt of $667 billion, which was projected in 2013-14, in 10 years' time the debt will be $389 billion—almost $300 billion less. This decline in debt is equivalent to $10,100 per Australian. By repairing the budget, Australia will have lower debt and lower interest costs. The interest on government debt is projected to be $16 billion lower in a decade, meaning more money for health, education, roads and support for families and seniors.


There are two parts of the budget that I would really like to focus on. The first is the infrastructure. The budget will create an $11.6 billion Infrastructure Growth Package. This is important to unlock growth, unlock productivity in our economy and to boost the total infrastructure investment by Commonwealth, state and local governments, as well as the private sector, to over $125 billion by the end of this decade—or the equivalent of eight Snowy Mountains schemes.


In my electorate of Boothby, finally we are going to see work commence on South Road. The RAA, the key motoring organisation in South Australia, has long had a vision of a north-south road corridor, going from Darlington in the south to Wingfield in the north and connecting with the Southern Expressway in the south and the Northern Expressway in the north. So we are finally seeing action on South Road at Darlington. This announcement has been welcomed by my constituents who have expressed their appreciation now that this project is finally going ahead. It is great news for local traffic, and it will create jobs, which will help the South Australian economy in the future. As a focal point of the federal budget there was an extra $441 million in funding allocated to South Australia for upgrades to South Road, taking the total federal contribution to almost $1 billion and allowing both the Darlington and Torrens to Torrens upgrades to be constructed simultaneously. I want to pay credit to the Prime Minister and also to the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia, Steven Marshall, who realised, rather than a stand-off between one project and the other, indeed, why not do both.


The upgrades at Darlington are what I have been fighting for on behalf my constituents since 2007. These upgrades have been promised since 2006 by the Labor Party who have failed to deliver. In the last seven years Labor have spruiked for South Road at Sturt Road a tunnel, an underpass, a flyover, an interchange and a widening of South Road. None of these projects have been delivered. In this year's budget we are delivering on our election commitment to build the Darlington interchange by funding 80 per cent of the overall project through our Infrastructure Growth Package. The upgrades will mean free-flowing traffic from the end of the Southern Expressway to Daws Road. In addition, the project contains much needed improvement to the Marion Road and Sturt Road intersection. These infrastructure projects will create much needed opportunities for South Australian contractors and will bring our infrastructure into the 21st century. Adelaide, I think, has had the poorest infrastructure of any mainland capital city, but completion of the north-south road corridor should see that rectified.


The major South Road upgrades at Darlington are scheduled to be finished by 2018. It is planned to construct a lowered road to the west of South Road that will extend the Southern Expressway free-flowing carriageways to a point north of the South Road-Ayliffes Road intersection. Flinders Drive will be extended to connect through to Sturt Road allowing local traffic to Flinders University and the Flinders Medical Centre to be unimpeded. There will be upgrades to the remaining South Road intersections, that is, connection to the Southern Expressway, Flinders Drive, Sturt Road, Ayliffes Road and the entrance to the Tonsley Park. As I said before, the intersection of Marion Road and Sturt Road will be widened, and there is also going to be some work done on South Road through Edwardstown near Castle Plaza to cater for the morning peak-hour traffic. They are looking at an extra northbound lane on South Road. So there will be some widening there. Early works should begin later this year, with heavy roadworks to commence next year. The entire project is to be completed by 2018.


I was very pleased to be with the Prime Minister, the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure, the member for Mayo, and the Premier of South Australia and the transport minister for South Australia, Stephen Mullighan, touring the Traffic Management Centre in Norwood and having a look at what the project at Darlington will look like. It really is one of the key measures for my electorate and a complete delivery of what we committed to at the election. In addition, there is money for Roads to Recovery funding. South Australian councils will receive twice as much funding. I also encourage local councils to apply for funding under the expanded Black Spot program.


The other key measure in the budget that I wanted to talk about was the Medical Research Future Fund. This is a landmark initiative. It really is a nation-building initiative for the 21st century. Before the election we said one of the key things we would do would be to back our strengths. Medical research is one of the strengths, and it is going to be one of the future drivers for the economy. So to have a capital fund building up to $20 billion will allow an income stream in perpetuity for medical research. It is a significant expansion of medical research funding in this country.


In my home state of South Australia the SAHMRI—the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute—is well positioned to capitalise on this. It has been the named 'the cheese grater' or 'the pineapple' and it came about as a result of the Review of health and medical research in South Australia which was conducted by Professor John Shine AO and Mr Alan Young AM, who recommended the establishment of a dedicated flagship research institute for South Australia. South Australia being a small state, we had three different universities all competing against each other; but what we really needed was one flagship research institute. With the new Royal Adelaide Hospital and the University of Adelaide medical school moving to the same precinct, this co-location will build on South Australia's impressive contribution to medical research and innovation.


In his opening speech last November the Prime Minister specifically mentioned the work of two Nobel prizewinners for medicine, Dr Robin Warren and Lord Howard Florey, who are both graduates of the University of Adelaide medical school. He said that Lord Florey was possibly the greatest Australian ever for his contribution in developing penicillin for wider use. He also paid tribute to the work of the previous government and spoke of the importance of medical research.


With the new SAHMRI, South Australia has the potential to develop a biotech precinct in the North Terrace area, in the same way that Parkville in Melbourne is a long established biotech precinct and Brisbane has become one. This is an opportunity to build on our existing strengths—our renowned excellence in research and clinical trials but we need to foster a climate where that can occur. That is why the Medical Research Future Fund is so important. It will see people come to Australia from overseas as a destination of choice to do their postdoctoral research and build their careers in medical research.


The executive director Steve Wesselingh has already assembled an impressive group of individuals. We have seen people return from overseas, like Professor Prash Sanders, working in the area of heart health, and Dr Charles Mullighan, heading up the research theme in cancer. These are people who could have had a research career anywhere in the world but have chosen to return to Adelaide because of the facilities that are on offer. SAHMRI has established seven research themes: Aboriginal health; cancer; healthy mothers; babies and children; heart health; infection and immunity; mind and brain; and nutrition and metabolism. It will be a significant development in the landscape in South Australia but it is important that we have the Medical Research Future Fund to provide certainty for medical research into the future.


SAHMRI is building a team of more than 600 outstanding researchers who are working together in the search for better treatments and cures. It is creating a world-class precinct of medical research and clinical application adjacent to the site of the new Royal Adelaide Hospital. These are just two of the important developments for my electorate in the budget and we need to have the Medical Research Future Fund adequately funded.


It is a landmark initiative. I pay credit to the Minister For Health who has long wanted to make medical research a signature of his time as minister. It really builds on the theme that it has been Liberal governments that have been the great friends of medical research in this country. We well remember all the times the previous Treasurer tried to strip hundreds of millions of dollars from the medical research budget.


The Medical Research Future Fund will build to a level of $20 billion; it will then be the largest medical research fund in the world. It will provide income of over $1 billion and it is important, seeing what Labor did with some of these other future funds, that we have a structure like the Future Fund so the Labor Party cannot raid the capital and spend it.


They are the two initiatives I wanted to speak on. The South Road development will now be underway. I do pay credit to the South Australian government, because they have actually come up with an improved proposal for Darlington. It is improved from what was originally in the Darlington Transport Study, and it will be great news for residents of the south. South Road-Sturt Road has been one of the major bottlenecks and major hold-ups in traffic, so this will be a welcome development by the time it is finished in 2018. Similarly, the Medical Research Future Fund is going to be very important, right across Australia. SAHMRI is a new institution but is well poised to benefit from that fund.

"Markus, Louise, MP",LP,2014-06-04,"



Mrs MARKUS
 (Macquarie) (10:25):  I rise to speak on the budget appropriation bills for 2014-15 and related bills. The federal budget handed down in May recognises that our nation is indeed at a crossroads. It recognises that there are clear, hard choices to be made if we want to get Australia back on track. The test is that after six years of the waste, excessive spending and poor choices made by the former government, our nation has been drowning in a spiral of debt and deficit that is not sustainable. The bills before the parliament today show a clear plan to build a strong and prosperous economy and a safe and secure Australia. Those are not just catchphrases or words, they are a vision for what those on this side of the House see for our future. 


The coalition government is committed to an Australia that is strong, that is prosperous, that is growing and that is providing opportunities for all Australians no matter what age, race, gender or background. Although some tough decisions have been made, these decisions are what will best place our nation to meet the challenges ahead. Like many members of the House, I remember well the fiscal position we had established during the last days of the Howard government. This did not happen by chance or accident. When we left office in 2007 there was $20 billion in surplus and money in the bank, money in the bank to invest in this nation. In an unprecedented six years Labor turned nearly $50 billion in the bank into projected net debt well over $200 billion. This is the fastest deterioration in debt, in dollar terms and as a share of GDP, in modern Australian history.


It is disappointing that I have not heard or seen any evidence of the other side of this House taking responsibility for what they took us to. One figure that astounds me is the fact that, because of Labor's mismanagement, we are now paying more than $1 billion per month in net interest payments. If left unchecked, that would be $2.8 billion a month in 10 years time. That is staggering and shameful. One billion dollars could do so much for the electorate of Macquarie. An additional crossing, for example, over the river which would ease the traffic congestion and challenges faced by many in my community is just one of the many road projects that we could invest in if we did not have to pay that debt. 


Although there have been tough decisions made in this budget, many of the residents I have talked to in Macquarie understand that—just like a household managing a budget—we cannot afford to keep borrowing to pay $1 billion a month in interest. It is like a household paying a mortgage on the credit card. We have a difficult task at hand but the coalition government is up to the challenge. I will focus on some of the reforms within this budget that take us forward as a nation. I will also talk to some of the specific funding and investment, particularly infrastructure, for the electorate of Macquarie and indeed for Greater Western Sydney. 


Within this budget is an historic amount of spending on infrastructure that will get our nation moving. In New South Wales alone there is a record $14.9 billion in funding. Crucial to this electorate is the Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan, which will have a significant impact on Greater Western Sydney, the larger Sydney and, of course, all surrounding regions of Sydney. It includes $2.9 billion for road transport upgrades to service Sydney's second airport to be developed at Badgerys Creek. For the first time in a long time the infrastructure spend on roads will happen before we establish the airport. Building the right road infrastructure to support Badgerys Creek will benefit not just airport users but residents throughout Macquarie, many of whom already travel long distances to get to work. That additional investment will add to the tourism dollar and benefit people movements, particularly in communities in the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury.


The upgrade to the Northern Road-Bringelly Road and the $200 million local roads package will relieve pressure on existing infrastructure and release the economic capacity of the region by easing congestion and helping to create local jobs. By working with the New South Wales government we are delivering an unprecedented amount of funding for the future of New South Wales. We made a commitment to the people of Greater Western Sydney that building roads and vital infrastructure would be of utmost priority, and this budget is proof of that. Greater Western Sydney, including the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury, can no longer afford to be left behind in infrastructure. We are getting on with the job of investing for the future.


I am also pleased that we are working to deliver some key infrastructure for my local area. Within this budget is important funding that has been committed to ensure completion of a number of important projects in the region. There is a package of priority safety upgrades to the Greater Western Highway between Katoomba and Lithgow. We will see the injection of $173.5 million of federal funds over the next four years. I was able to announce this funding last week with the local state member for the Blue Mountains, Roza Sage, and look forward to working with the community and the state member to deliver this as a priority.


There is a $3 million federal contribution to the M4 managed motorway. This includes planning works for a managed motorway system on the M4 from Merrylands to Lapstone in the Lower Blue Mountains. There is a federal contribution of $18 million for the upgrade of the approach routes to the Richmond Bridge and associated intersections in the Hawkesbury. This $18 million will be rolled out over the next three years. The local state member and I are working closely with the New South Wales government to deliver this. This has been fought for over a number of years.


Finally, federal funds of $4.4 million for 2014-15 have been committed for the Springwood town centre revitalisation. These funds will enable the completion of what is a very important project for the local community. The new Springwood Civic Centre and precinct will be valuable community assets for future generations in Springwood and indeed across the mountains.


Within this budget are also some very exciting and worthwhile measures that will assist young people, who are indeed the future of our nation. There are some changes to higher education that will benefit young people, particularly those in my community. I am particularly pleased about the historic Commonwealth support for students studying higher education diplomas, advanced diplomas and associate degree courses as well as those studying bachelor degrees. This is in addition to the announcement that we will establish a Commonwealth scholarship scheme to assist access for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. These measures recognise that higher education is not a one size fits all. We want to ensure that no young person is left behind and that all young people are given the opportunity to study and learn.


We believe all young people should be learning or earning. I was pleased to announced last week that suburbs in Macquarie are part of the first 18 areas to be rolled out under phase 1 of the new Work for the Dole program. This will provide young people with opportunities. This will provide them with incentives. This will provide them with self-esteem-building and confidence-building activities and an opportunity to develop skills. From 1 July 2014, 18- to 30-year-olds in Macquarie who have been unemployed for 12 months or more and receiving Newstart and/or youth allowance will be required to do work for the dole in 2014-15. The government's reinvigorated Work for the Dole program will give all participants a chance to have a go. 


The coalition government firmly believes that all Australians capable of working should be working. They should be earning, learning or engaging in programs like Work for the Dole. Work for the Dole is an important part of our plan to help young job seekers gain skill and experience that they need to move from Welfare to Work, to make a positive contribution to their local community and to also have a sense of their value and worth. It keeps job seekers engaged and active as well as giving them an opportunity to get involved in local initiatives. 


Unlike those opposite, we do not want to see our young people fall into the trap of a lifetime of welfare dependency when they have the capacity to work and/or study. We believe in the potential of the next generation and what they have to offer but we also recognise that sometimes our young people need a bit of encouragement and an incentive to achieve their dreams and their goals. 


I would also like to highlight the key election commitments that this budget delivers for the people of Macquarie. I am thrilled that this budget contains a total of $15 million for the Greater Western Sydney conservation corridor—something that I have been fighting and working towards for about a decade. This includes $7.5 million in direct funding for the acquisition of threatened land in the Cumberland Conservation Corridor. 


This commitment is something that myself, along with the Minister for the Environment, the member for Lindsay, and others are deeply committed to and also excited about. It will be a major boost for the conservation of the area and provide a once-in-a-generation opportunity to establish a conservation corridor which will be preserved for future generations. It is a recognition of the importance of protecting the green areas within and around our cities, particularly in Greater Western Sydney and the conversation value of the Cumberland Plain woodlands. 


The 2014-15 federal budget also included funding under the coalition government's Safer Streets Program where proceeds of crime will be directed to fund local, prime-preventing crime projects, including $150,000 for closed-circuit television cameras for Richmond; $300,000 for closed-circuit television cameras for Blaxland and Wentworth Falls; $30,000 for closed-circuit television cameras for the Hazelbrook pedestrian overpass; and $30,000 for closed-circuit television cameras for Peter Carroll Field in Leura. 


This $510,000 investment to improve security in the local communities is a welcome announcement for small business owners in particular who often bear the brunt of vandalism and theft. I have already met with the local council and have spoken to local police and the various community organisations that will be involved in the rollout of this initiative. I look forward to the end result, which will provide a safer community for all. 


Also relevant to the electorate of Macquarie is $15 million in the 2014-15 federal budget for the creation of a national bushfire mitigation program. This commitment we made at the election is fully funded, ensuring no additional pressure on the budget. This program is a targeted initiative to reduce the impact of bushfires and build a more disaster-resilient Australia. Too many times Australians have witnessed bushfires that devastate Australian communities and business—and in fact for many, who would be aware, we have faced this firsthand in the Blue Mountains most recently but also in the Hawkesbury and a number of regions that are close to our communities. 


The national bushfire mitigation program will see the Commonwealth partner with states and territories to build upon their existing fire management practices and implement strategies to address risks. This program will better equip communities to be able to prevent and, if needed, withstand the impacts and effects of bushfires. 


Through this budget, the Abbott government has reduced the Labor deficits by $43.8 billion through to 2017-18. This budget is about a shift from spending to contributing, and from the short term to the long term. We are working to create a sustainable future for the next generations. 


During my former career as a social worker, I observed all too often the knock-on effects for a family when a person was stuck in a lifestyle of welfare dependency. I also observed that it was often when a Labor government was in power that people would walk through my doors needing assistance and support that should never have walked through those doors. Compassion for those less fortunate and a safety net for the vulnerable are paramount, but what is also paramount is giving people the opportunity to contribute and build.


We are a land of great opportunity but we need to allow people to pursue those opportunities and their own dreams. Repairing the budget is a key part of our economic strategy to build a strong prosperous economy and a safe and secure Australia. There is nothing more relevant to supporting the vulnerable, pensioners, job creation, education, health and infrastructure, than a strong economy. We must ask ourselves: are we prepared to let the budgetary position continue to deteriorate so that we leave a growing mountain of debt to our children, or are we prepared to rein it in now so that we can have a strong and prosperous future? I commend the bill to the House.

"Porter, Christian, MP",LP,2014-06-04,"



Mr PORTER
 (Pearce) (10:40):  Having witnessed for the first time personally, from inside federal parliament, the Commonwealth budget unfold, I must say it is an experience that I will not soon forget. The scale of what occurs and the immediacy of the effects on people's lives, and the long-run effect on all Australians of both action and inaction in a federal budget makes it a task of immense responsibility.


To be personally involved in even the most peripheral or modest way is, again, an experience of some learning. I just want to commence by thanking the Minister for Finance for seeking from me some research on the Smaller and More Rational Government ministerial paper, which I was very happy to conduct and provide. When assessing the quality of any public policy, particularly an economic policy such as a budget, the assessment must logically commence with an assessment of the nature of the problem, if any, that is sought to be solved. It has occurred to me as rather unusual that the debate about what problem might exist occurred in Australia over the period of perhaps six weeks in the lead-up to the budget and in the early stages after the budget's release. It seemed, to me at least, that that was probably a debate and a conversation that could have occurred for at least six months, because in my observation the scale of the problem is significant and its nature is complicated in the detail.


But if you understand the nature of a problem you are at least offered the starting point to assess whether the type of solution being offered is fit for the purpose. If you understand the scale of a problem you have some hope of having revealed to you whether the scale of the response is sufficient, whether it is excessive, or whether it is insufficient. 


In my observation the simplest description of the problem that is now facing Australia economically is that it is a compound problem. The problem is neither debt nor deficit in isolation; it is a very large debt, which will grow if there is no further action, running in parallel with historically large deficits. Perhaps that can be restated at its core as a structural expenditure problem in the Australian public finances.


The figures are well established and they have been put here many times. In 2007, Australia had $50 billion, in effect, in assets in the bank; a $20 billion surplus. That was turned very rapidly into the five largest deficits in Australia's history, at $193 billion cumulative—$123 billion worth of prospective cumulative deficits to 2016-17 if no action were taken; and projected debt, if no action were taken, of $667 billion. It really shows what a massive task was undertaken in the Howard-Costello government to leave Australia's public finances in the state they were in in 2007.


With respect to that problem two views have emerged, in that six-week debate, about the scale and nature of the problem. The first view is simply that this problem—the debt and deficit problem, the structural expenditure problem—is not a problem of immediate significance. I would generously ascribe that as the view that the Labor opposition appears to hold. I will simply, for the sake of brevity, describe that as the defer-the-solution view.


The second view is slightly more extreme—or, maybe, substantially more extreme. It is the view that the idea that a problem exists in Australia's public finances is deliberately confected to allow for a range of policies to be enacted which have an ideological base rather than a pragmatic or practical base in terms of solving an actual or real problem. That is the view that is clearly offered and subscribed to by members of the Palmer United Party. It is clearly the view offered and subscribed to by members of the Greens. There are some academics that have put that view—one particularly from the University of New South Wales, who I will make mention of shortly. Again, generously, I will attribute to Labor a view that there is a problem but that the solution should be deferred because the scale or quantum of the problem is not as it is being portrayed by the government.


The shadow Treasurer on a number of occasions in my observation, particularly in question time, has acknowledged that tough decisions will have to be made, which appears to acknowledge that there is a problem—although what those tough decisions might be or when they might occur is certainly less clear from the opposition.


If I am correct in generously ascribing a view to Labor that they see a problem but would prefer to defer the solution, the very interesting question that arises is: if you think that the problem is not so substantive that the solution should be immediate but rather deferred, why would you promise 500 times in your time in government to produce a surplus? Why should the problem be deferred now but not when you were in government? That is a very significant shift in rhetoric. I think it reveals some difficulties in the policy position of the opposition. 


I might just make a comment about the second view, which is that the problem is entirely confected, that it simply does not exist and has been invented for some scurrilous ideological purpose. Again, there was an academic, who I will talk about shortly, from the University of New South Wales who said, in effect, that the debts and the deficit, not even large-scale or even running in tandem, are not a problem but that productivity is the problem. The difficulty with that analysis is that it completely ignores the link between increased debt and increased interest payments and decreased capital investment on the part of government. Continuing debt and deficit and growing interest payments on debt seriously imperil productivity because they seriously constrain government's ability to invest in capital infrastructure.


That is illustrated by looking at the interest bill that has been spoken of a number of times. There is presently $12 billion of interest a year and $1 billion interest a month. It has been said that that could purchase each and every month a very substantially sized teaching hospital in every capital city in Australia. Over the course of the year, that $12 billion represents something close to half of the total recurrent expenditure of the Defence budget of Australia. Indeed, from my previous experience, it appears almost unfathomable to me that $12 billion a year in interest payments is approaching half the expenditure of the entire state government of Western Australia. So with the interest bill of the Commonwealth in a year you could run half of the entire state of Western Australia. It shows the gargantuan nature of the interest and debt problem that we have at the moment. Again, I think the idea that the problem is confected fundamentally misunderstands the link between the state of the public accounts and growth and productivity in the economy at large.


The idea that the problem is confected relies on a comparison between Australia's debt as a percentage of GDP and other OECD countries. There are several problems with that comparison. It makes immensely problematic a seamless move from the comparison being favourable to the conclusion that no problem exists and nothing needs to be done. There are four problems with the comparison. The first is that the comparison of Commonwealth debt does not take into account an accumulation of federal government debt, state debt and household debt. If you have a look at Commonwealth debt, you are looking at about 13 per cent as a percentage share of GDP. When you combine state and federal debt, that is about a 29 per cent share of GDP. Secondly, the comparison takes no account of Australia's position as a trading economy. I think David Murray said it best when he said that, as a seller of commodities, Australia 'is a price taker whereas we have a high fixed cost in our budget, mostly in welfare, which is now up to 100 per cent of the personal tax take.' In effect, what he is saying is that we cannot afford public debt and we are borrowing to fund recurrent expenditure, particularly transfer payments and welfare payments.


The third problem with the comparison is that it takes no account of the speed with which the debt arose, which is a matter that I will move on to in a moment. Fourthly, having taken no account of the speed with which the debt arose, it takes no account of the spending trajectory that Australia is now placed on unless very serious remedial action is taken. So the comparison of Australia's debt as a percentage of GDP with other OECD nations underestimates the problem. It ignores entirely where the problem will be at in two years, four years or six years time.


I want to look at comments from the Parliamentary Budget Office—in essence, an invention of the opposition designed to be entirely independent of the political process. The head of that organisation has said: 'If you just continued on the trajectory of payments and revenues prior to the budget, net debt is forecast to grow rapidly … at the highest'—growth—'rate in the OECD. … I don’t think that’s a fiction at all.' So you have the fastest deterioration in debt as a percentage of GDP in Australia's history; you have $1 billion in interest payments per month—which could become $2.8 billion in a decade, if nothing is done; you have the PBO noting that debt is growing at the highest rate in the OECD; and you have interest payments which in 2024 could, without remedial action, be $30 billion. That is, interest payments in 2024 could be the size of the defence budget, or the size of the entire current budget of a state such as Western Australia. And that is unfathomable. This seriously constrains the ability of any government who inherits it to invest in infrastructure and improve productivity. Again from Mr Bowen at the PBO: 'It is time to start coming out'—of debt and deficit—'otherwise the longer you leave it, the more exposed you become and the harder it is to wind it back.' That is an observation which I think is pertinent. The longer we delay in fixing the budget, the higher the costs will be.


If we pause here for a moment, before moving to the nature of the problem, and consider one other thing said by David Murray—who I think is an excellent commentator on these matters—which I alluded to earlier. He said, 'we have a high fixed cost in our budget, mostly in welfare, which is now up to 100 per cent of the personal tax take.' So the welfare transfer payments represent 100 per cent of the personal tax take in Australia—every dollar that is taken from individuals in Australia through tax is spent, and then some, on welfare and transfer payments.


The final matter I want to deal with is the accusation in this budget that the burden falls most heavily on those who can least afford it. In a trivial sense, that observation is understandable but, in a profound sense, it is incorrect and false, because it does not comprehend properly the nature of the problem—that is, it is not that we do not tax people enough in Australia; the nature of the problem is that we as a government, in the public accounts, are spending too much money. And largely, it is that we are spending too much money on transfer payments and entitlements.


Let me put it this way: seven per cent of the population earn between $101,000 and $163,000; two per cent of the population earn between $164,000 and $264,000; one per cent—a tiny per cent of the population—earn over $265,000, and—moving backwards—14 per cent earn between $71,000 and $100,000. That is, 24 per cent of the Australian population earn over $71,000. They are paying 66 per cent, or two-thirds, of the tax. When you have the problem we have in Australia at the moment, which is, essentially, that the gulf between our expenditure and our tax take—our revenues—is large, and without remedial action will grow, then you have two essential options open to you in the public finances. One is to extract more revenue from the economy, which is to say, to tax people more; the other is to curtail your expenditure. And the expenditure comes, largely, in entitlements and transfer payments. Another way of looking this is to say that the lowest-earning 20 per cent of the population in Australia receive 40 per cent of all the income transfer payments, or welfare, and—quite properly; which is admirable in the Australian economy—the highest-earning 20 per cent of income earners get three per cent of the income transfers. So, if you accept that the difficulty is in expenditures, it is very hard to take benefits from the top 20 per cent of taxpayers who, in essence, do not receive benefits. That leaves you with only one other option—even a deferred option, which is what the opposition propose—and that is to find further sources of revenue. And I for one think that, whilst this budget has some further sources of revenue, it does go far enough and it should go no further. People are already giving major amounts of their wages to revenue. The problem is not that they do not give enough or that the taxpayers do not give enough; the problem is that we are spending too much.


I might just finish then by saying this: the UNSW academic who I spoke of said: 'No problem. Imagine you were running the University of New South Wales business school, the Australian School of Business, where you had growing revenues and growing student enrolments, but you nevertheless were spending far more than you were earning in the business school, and you had a massive debt and were thereby borrowing to fund that debt. Would you not sit down and have a crisis meeting at the business school?'


I hope the UNSW academic I have discussed is only teaching finance and not actively engaged in the finances of that business school, because Australia is at a point of crisis in the pathological sense of the term: we are at the stage of the disease where things will either get better and we will live, or things will get worse and we will wither.


With this budget, though, there will be significant capital investment: three very major road projects in, or near to, my electorate. I am very thankful for them and for the government's decision to undertake them.

Ms SCOTT
 (Lindsay) (10:55):  It is wonderful to be here again today in the Federation Chamber to discuss Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015 and related bills. In 2007, when the coalition left office, they left behind $50 billion of gross national savings in the bank. Today we see the wreckage of the previous Labor government as far as the eye can see, and this occurred in six years. After just six years, the legacy that this Labor Party left Australia was 200,000 more unemployed; a gross debt projected to rise to $667 billion; $123 billion in cumulative deficits; and the world's biggest carbon tax.


Labor left the Australian people with a national debt costing a billion dollars a month in interest payments alone. Think of this: in just one month—one month alone—we could expand Mulgoa Road, from Glenmore Park through to the council chambers, to six lanes and still have the best part of $300,000 left over. Can you imagine? It would do so much for all the mums and dads relying on our local infrastructure if we could decongest our local roads. Under the Labor Party the jobless queues grew by 200,000. That is more than the entire population of Penrith.


The Australian public has spoken. So have the people of Lindsay, the electorate I represent, and they demand a government that will get the budget under control, repeal the carbon tax—something the Labor Party is yet to admit needs to happen—and build the roads and infrastructure of the 21st century. The Abbott government is well on its way to achieving this objective. For the most part, the people I represent understand tough decisions must be made. Indeed, during the election, I doorknocked more than 30,000 houses. Overwhelmingly, these hardworking families want to see a government that is fiscally responsible. They want to see a government that will get the budget back under control—a government that will stop the waste and start investing in the infrastructure and the services that our community really needs.


I am pleased to note that this budget will do that and I would like to congratulate the Treasurer on delivering his responsible economic action plan. Following the budget, and this week, I have travelled right across my electorate. My team and I visited every single train station, every morning, to talk to local commuters. We went to the markets. We went festivals. We pounded the pavement. We made sure we listened to as many people in the community as we possibly could before coming back to parliament for this sitting block. I wanted the residents of Lindsay to have an opportunity to speak directly—to talk about their concerns or the things they were really excited about.


What makes me most proud is being the member for Western Sydney. I look at the great legacy that being the member for Western Sydney brings. Some say our nation was built on the sheep's back; the seat of Macarthur, where John Macarthur first had his sheep, is to my south. The early colony also had the five Macquarie towns. We were an agricultural region; we grew through that. In Western Sydney we have a lot of manufacturing. We have grown through that as a nation.


Now we are looking to the next generation. We have just come through the mining boom and we are looking at where we are going to invest further. Western Sydney is the third-largest economy in our country. I am so proud to be part of a government that believes in the people of Western Sydney, a government that is going to invest in the people of Western Sydney, a government that—together with its state colleagues—is going to invest $3.5 billion, over 10 years, in major road and infrastructure projects across Western Sydney. This will ease congestion, slash travel times and create thousands of local jobs.


I have spoken regularly about the challenges my community face in commuting every day to work. Two-thirds of my community have to commute every single day—one-third all the way to the city and one-third to Greater Western Sydney. We need local jobs and we need them now, and we finally have a government that is prepared to take the heavy lifting and make it happen.


This investment will include an additional $1.5 billion plus a concessional loan of up to $2 billion to build the WestConnex motorway—linking Western and south-western Sydney with the city, Sydney Airport and port precincts—and a further $2 billion in concessional loans to get this project delivered faster. There is $2.9 billion from the federal government for the Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan, which will feature $35 million for a road extension, in Jane Street, in my electorate. There is $2.4 million of planning for stage 1 of the Werrington arterial between the M4 and the Great Western Highway at Claremont Meadows, the upgrade of the Northern Road to a minimum of four lanes from Narellan to the M4 and the upgrade of Bringelly Road to a minimum of four lanes from Camden Valley Way to the Northern Road. The contracts are already out to tender, and the project for Bringelly Road will start within the next few months. We will be improving interchanges that connect the Northern Road and the new motorway with arterial roads and there is a $200 million local-roads package that will go to decongesting local roads. This is overwhelmingly positive and fabulous news for Western Sydney. 


Last night I was with the Prime Minister and many community leaders at Rooty Hill RSL. Western Sydney is excited—Western Sydney is ready to go—and it is great to see my area so pumped and charged for what the future will bring. I would like to impress upon the House the value we will get from this investment. It will make a genuine difference to the lives of the people I represent. Speaking of value, I want to highlight the cost—$1.5 billion—to build WestConnex. That is a month and a half of current interest payments we are making paying back on Labor's debt. Imagine how we could better spend the interest payments we are making. Think of the roads we could build. Think of the ports. Think of all the other infrastructure and health precincts we could work towards.


My electorate has been chosen as one of the starting points for Work for the Dole. Last week the Assistant Minister for Employment, the member for Cowper, announced that the Nepean region would be one of 18 areas to benefit from the Abbott government's new Work for the Dole arrangements for young job seekers. In the Nepean Valley, 18- to 30-year-olds who have been unemployed for 12 months or more and who are receiving Newstart or youth allowance would be required to work for the dole. Work for the Dole has been very successful in Lindsay over the years. Many people who enjoy the river-run would know that on the western bank of the Nepean River there is a sign from when the Howard government built the running track on that western path. This is a community asset that our community love and use. We walk our dogs there and we take our families there. We are able to showcase our beautiful Nepean River. The Work for the Dole program under the Howard government also worked on bank regeneration of the Tench Reserve site. This had massive replanting programs and saved the Tench Reserve site's banks from collapsing through erosion.


These are the sorts of projects that we will once again see in our local area. In fact, the work done on this river precinct has been so helpful to the community that now the state government is having to build a $20 million Green Bridge to finish the whole lap, to provide another crossing for the Nepean River. As the Treasurer said on budget night:


…to build a workforce for the future, those who can work, should work.


The benefit of work goes far beyond your weekly pay packet.


Work gives people a sense of self, and work helps to build a sense of community.


That is exactly what we have seen under the Work for the Dole program previously in the Lindsay electorate. This has been welcomed by the community in Lindsay. Work for the Dole is an important part of the government's plan to help young job seekers gain the skills and experience they need to move from welfare to work and make a positive contribution to our local community. It keeps job seekers engaged and active and helps avoid a lifetime of welfare dependency. Indeed, I recall, under the previous programs, so many of these wonderful initiatives.


I would also like to draw to your attention today, Madam Deputy Speaker, to the fact that Lindsay is the fourth youngest electorate. We have a median age of just 34. When we look across our region, supporting our kids in our community is absolutely crucial. I am proud to see that once again we are supporting our kids: providing them with a future, giving them sport to play, giving them interaction and, once again, building the bedrock of our community. We will be seeing under the Hunter fields at Emu Plains at Emu Plains lighting upgrades of $20,000. At Jamison Park we will see $90,000 upgrades to shade cloths and canteens. Andromeda Oval at Cranebrook will see an upgrade of $25,500. Greygums Reserve will have a $60,000 upgrade of turf. Andrews Road Baseball Complex at Cranebrook will have a $26,000 safety fence. Hickeys Park playing surface will receive $45,000.


One of my proudest announcements is $12 million for the Western Sydney Community and Sports Centre. I like to think of this facility as a bit of a Western Sydney institute of sport. In essence, it will be an indoor rugby league field on a timber sprung floor. At this point in time, once it is constructed, it will be the second biggest exhibition space in New South Wales, but once Darling Harbour comes online it will be the third biggest. So it will be Darling Harbour, Homebush and then the Western Sydney Community and Sports Centre. It already has a mass of support right across our community from the Panthers teams through UWS to the Scouts and the PCYC. This will be an amazing facility. We have the disability sports getting online and all the other sports across our region that will get involved with this amazing project. I think, once again, it shows vision. It shows future. It shows believing in the people of Western Sydney—a region which is, as I stated earlier, the third biggest economy in our country.


Being a young community, the Paid Parental Leave scheme will be an amazing initiative for my electorate. Can you imagine being a mum commuting every single day for work? I have had to see friends and constituents of mine put babies into day care or leave them with parents or grandparents at three months of age. Having a fair Paid Parental Leave scheme that supports women getting back into the workforce is crucial. Could you imagine commuting 45 minutes, an hour or an hour and a half every single day away from your young infant children? It is a choice that so many women in my electorate have to make every day, and it is not fair that families have to see this. We are also investing in the safety and security of our regions. We will be seeing $300,000 worth of CCTV coming into my electorate of Lindsay—$200,000 into the main streets of Penrith on High Street and Station Street and another $100,000 into Queen Street, St Marys—once again making our shopping districts safe and making it good for families.


This is what this budget is about: building the regions for the future of Australia. It is about building where the next sheep's back is going to be, where the next mining boom is going to be, where the next manufacturing industry is going to be. And do you know what? It is going to be in Western Sydney. I can say that categorically, with my own bias of Western Sydney. I am so proud of this budget. I am so proud that we finally have a Prime Minister and a Treasurer that believe in the value of Western Sydney. They are not just there milking it. They are not putting out a Lindsay test. They are not just saying, 'Oh, Lindsay! Let's test Lindsay.' They are actually putting their money where their mouth is. That is why this budget is good. This is a budget that is getting the budget under control but investing in our country and the economic sustainability for the future.

"Tudge, Alan, MP",LP,2014-06-04,"



Mr TUDGE
 (Aston—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:09):  I rise to speak on these appropriation bills. There are three things I would like to outline in the time I have available. Firstly, I would like to outline the rationale for the budget and what we are hoping to achieve through the decisions that the government has made. Secondly, I would like to address some particular concerns raised in the community. Thirdly, I would like to outline some of the initiatives that specifically impact on my electorate of Aston. Let me start with the budget rationale.


This, as everybody knows, is a tough budget. We acknowledge that. We have had to reduce some expenditure. We have had to initiate a debt levy on high-income earners. We realise that some of these measures are not popular, but the government has done these things for a reason. The reason is that the public finances are in an absolute mess due to the decisions of the former government. We are simply spending beyond our means and this is simply not sustainable. This budget is about restoring our finances because we cannot have a strong, prosperous economy without a strong budget. Let me outline the figures to illustrate how unsustainable the financial position was before this budget.


Firstly, having gone from a $20 billion surplus in 2007, Labor ran up the six biggest budget deficits in Australian political history, totalling $191 billion. Secondly, their forecasts were for a further $123 billion in deficits over the next four years. This meant that the aggregate debt was to grow to $667 billion. That means about $25,000 for every single man, woman and child in this country. The interest alone on our present debt today is about $1 billion a month. That $1 billion represents the cost of a public hospital. So without this interest bill we could build 12 public hospitals this year, but we cannot because we are spending $1 billion per month. We are simply spending way more than we are earning and, as every householder knows, you just cannot do that indefinitely.


The coalition did not create this fiscal mess but we accept the responsibility to fix it. This budget brings the finances back under control. It eliminates almost $300 billion worth of debt. It reduces the deficit by $44 billion over the next four years, which is the budget period. It shows a pathway back to surplus, having reduced the deficit in 2017, the final year of the budget estimates, from $18 billion to $3 billion. There are tough decisions to get to this position. I acknowledge that and I wish we did not have to make those tough decisions, but we would be abrogating our responsibility as a national government if we did not take action now. We were elected to fix up the financial mess left by the former Labor government and we are doing exactly that through this budget.


I want to address some concerns raised in the community. The first one is the allegation that we have made substantial cuts to hospitals and to schools. I would like to clarify that by pointing out exactly what we are doing over the four-year budget period. Firstly, far from making cuts to hospitals, we are increasing hospital expenditure to record levels. Next year we will increase hospital expenditure by nine per cent, the year after by a further nine per cent, the year after that by a further nine per cent and in the final year of the budget four-year period by six per cent. 


Let us look at schools. Again we are increasing school funding to record levels. Next year we will increase school funding by eight per cent, the following year by a further eight per cent, the year after that by a further eight per cent and the year after that by a further six per cent. These are very substantial increases in funding to hospitals and schools, and it is simply wrong for Labor to allege that we have cut funding to hospitals and schools and placing fear in the community and leading people to believe that hospital beds will be closed or there will be fewer teachers next year as a result of this budget. It is simply incorrect; we are increasing funding to hospitals and schools to record levels. 


It is similar in relation to pensions. Let me be very clear: there are no cuts to pensions in this budget. The pension will continue to increase every six months. It increased in March, it will increase further in September. It will increase again the following March and the following September and so on. Every single pension supplement will continue as it has done previously to this point in time. The only two decisions that have been made in relation to the pension are, firstly, to increase the eligibility for the pension to 70 years of age by 2035. In that period of time, nearly every single person who is 70 by 2035 will have been earning superannuation for most of their careers; presently superannuation is accessible at the age of 60. Secondly, the other decision we have made is to ensure that pensions are indexed according to the CPI from 2017. This means that the pension will continue to increase in real terms from 2017 according to the CPI. So we have not cut pensions, as the Labor Party would make you believe. In fact, they will increase every six months, as they have always done; we have just made those two changes that I have mentioned.


In relation to universities, there are some very substantial reforms in this budget. We have deregulated the university system to enable our universities to flourish, to enable them to be world class. This will mean in some cases that some university fees will go up, but in other cases university fees will stay as they are. In further cases they may in fact come down. Importantly though, there will be no upfront fees. Even if fees do go up somewhat, they will still be part of the overall HECS, which means there are no upfront payments and every payment is only made once the person has graduated and is earning more than $50,000 in salary.


In addition to that, there are some very substantial measures that will particularly benefit low-SES students. In particular, for the first time HECS will be available for subdegrees—for associate degrees and for diplomas. HECS will also, for the first time, be available for private higher education providers. The combination of those two measures means there will be an additional 80,000 university opportunities for students across this nation, and predominantly those opportunities will be taken up by families who typically may not have had a university graduate before because sometimes a diploma is a pathway through to going on to a higher degree.


Finally, I want to touch on the Medicare co-payments. The government is asking Australians to pay $7 when they go to a doctor in order to try to make Medicare sustainable. Expenditure on Medicare is growing exponentially, a growth which is simply not sustainable. The Medicare levy covers less than 20 per cent of health costs so that is not necessarily a mechanism to ensure the sustainability of Medicare over all.


The $7 co-payment is similar to the co-payment that Labor introduced for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Labor introduced that co-payment for precisely the reasons that this government is advocating the co-payment for Medicare—that is, to make the system sustainable over the longer term. We want to see it sustainable. We want to see Medicare be a central part of our system.


Importantly, with these co-payment measures there is a safety net which covers about 40 per cent of all Australians. Everybody with a concession card and all children under the age of 16 would only have to pay a maximum of $70 in any one calendar year. Further, a doctor will still have discretion, if a particular individual has financial hardship, to waive that $7 fee. The overall aim is to ensure that there is a proper safety net but that the Medicare system as we know it today is sustainable well into the future.


I will conclude by mentioning some of the measures in the budget which are specifically targeted at my electorate. Firstly, there are some community safety measures which I have announced locally already. These were election commitments which I made, and I am very pleased to see that they are being delivered in my electorate over the course of the 2014-15 financial year. It includes security cameras for three shopping strips, better lighting at Scoresby Village and Alchester Village and some mobile security cameras for Knox police. 


There is also some infrastructure funding to support the upgrade of some of the local community sports facilities. That is important because we want to have as many young people participating in sport or other community activities as possible. If young people are participating in these activities it keeps them busy and it keeps them off the street. Importantly, the large sporting clubs are also places where young people can get mentored by older people. So I think these funds for sporting infrastructure provide a benefit, not just to the people directly using that community infrastructure but to the entire community.


Of course, there was additional funding for the East West Link—a further $1.5 billion, bringing the total federal contribution to $3 billion for the East West Link. That will have enormous benefit for residents of my electorate in Aston to ensure that they can get into the city and across the city more quickly. 


There are a number of other measures that I will continue to fight for, including important roads such as the extension of Police Road to take the pressure off Bergins Road. I am going to continue to fight for improvements to Napoleon Road. I will continue to fight to improve the Boronia Heights Primary School, which is in need of an upgrade. I will continue to support and fight for the upgrade to the Bayswater CFA. Of course, I will never stop fighting for the Rowville rail, which is long overdue.


Let me conclude by saying that, yes, this was a tough budget. I acknowledge that. In an ideal world we would not have to deliver a tough budget. We would not have to make expenditure cuts and we would not have to put in place measures such as the debt levy on high-income earners. But the simple fact is that the budget position was unsustainable. Our nation was expending far more than we were raising in revenues, and that position was unsustainable. You simply cannot continue to spend more than you raise; otherwise you get into a situation like Greece, Spain or Italy. We certainly do not want to go down that path.


So this is a tough budget but it is ultimately necessary for the public finances to be restored to a healthy position. And, overall, it is good for the nation.

"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2014-06-04,"



Mr GRIFFIN
 (Bruce) (11:24):  Many speakers have gone through the aspects of the appropriation bills that have been debated most publicly and I do not intend to focus on them. I particularly want to focus on some issues that relate to the veterans community and particularly to indexation changes that the government has announced will take effect in 2017, after the next election. There is nothing more ex than an ex-minister, although I say that with respect to my colleague the member for Fisher, who I think knows exactly what I mean. In the three years since I left the veterans affairs portfolio I have tended to maintain an interest in issues in that area, but I have also tended to stay out of the public debate—I think that is the best thing to do when you are in my situation. Having said that, time has passed and, when I look at some of the debates in the veterans community in the time I was shadow minister and also minister, there have certainly been some developments in this budget which deserve public comment and some public explanation.


Although this argument goes right across the board in terms of income support payments through the social security system, I will speak particularly in relation to the veterans community. The indexation of benefits in the veterans area has been a vexed issue for many years. It has been a vexed issue because many veterans, given their age and often give the impacts of their service, have become reliant on government support—whether that has been through the service pension, which is basically the same as the age pension, or the disability support pension, which can be accessed at an earlier age by veterans in recognition of the impacts of their service, or income support payments, whether they be compensation payments for disability, which are the various rates of pension provided for those with proven impacts from their service- or war-caused disabilities right up to and including the totally and permanently incapacitated pension, or the special rate pension. Then there have also been the arguments around military superannuation and the indexation methodology employed with respect to some parts of those schemes.


This debate has gone on almost since 1997 when the Howard government, to its credit, put in place the indexation system that linked the growth in pensions to both CPI and male total average weekly earnings, or MTAWE. However, there were some benefit payments within the veterans community that were not covered by that—particularly, disability pensions. There was a debate within the veterans community over a number of years about that. There were adjustments made in 2004 to elements of that as a result of the Clark Review of Veterans' Entitlements, and then there was a debate in the lead-up to the 2007 election on the need for the special rate pension to be indexed. The opposition—at that time I was the shadow minister—came forth with a policy in 2007 that said we would do exactly that, in recognition of the fact that TPIs in particular relied on that money to maintain a reasonable standard of living, and in those circumstances there was an erosion in relative value of their payments occurring over time as result of the difference between CPI indexation and MTAWE. The argument was all about fairness.


In the shadows of the 2007 election the then minister, Minister Billson, put forward legislation to make these changes and, to his credit, he extended them further. I congratulated him at the time. That happened in around September 2007 and it came into effect just after the election of the Rudd government. Labor then initiated the Harmer review of income support payments. That led to a significant initial one-off increase in income support payments, which was expressed as a percentage of male total average weekly earnings. This led to an argument from quite a few people in the veterans community that there should have been further adjustments to the special rate pension and disability pensions to take that issue into account. 


It also, if you like, gave added impetus to the argument by some military superannuants about the indexation for their superannuation pensions particularly those who are on DFRB or DFRDB, which are two of the schemes. The circumstances then on an ongoing basis over the last several years has been an argument around those particular issues: the issue of the Harmer review and the attempts being made by those in the veteran community to seek a catch-up payment to the special rate pension in particular, and the argument around the question of what was described as 'fair indexation' with respect to military superannuation pensions.


The current government when in opposition made commitments around the question of DFRB and DFRDB indexation methodologies. It was described by the then shadow minister, and now the minister, as being all about 'fair indexation'—and these were words which were used by members of the now government, by the now Prime Minister in the lead-up to the last election and since. 


I just want to quote from a publication from the Vietnam Veterans' Federation of Australia, a description of arguments around this bill by the then opposition and the private member's bill which was put forward by the then opposition in the lead-up to the last election. It said:


Indeed, the Bill was called the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Amendment (Fair Indexation) Bill 2010.


In berating the government Senators for not supporting the bill he explained—


that is, the then shadow minister Senator Michael Ronaldson—


'The measures in this Bill will ensure that over 56,000 retired Australian Defence Force personnel who are members of the now closed DFRDB and DFRB schemes have their superannuation pensions indexed more fairly and in a manner which better reflects changes in the costs of living.'


Senator Ronaldson rammed home the point:


'Currently, DFRDB and DFRB superannuation pensions are indexed according to the CPI [cost of living index] only. If the indexation rate had increased in line with the aged pension, in March 2010 military superannuants would have received up to an extra $28.40 per fortnight in their pension.' 



Unfair indeed.




That is the point about the changes the government is proposing now with respect to indexation. Having legislated to meet their election commitment to put in place a fairer indexation system with respect to military superannuan
ts of two schemes—
some 56,000 people
—and
 having, if you like, established and recognised the fact that the existing system for indexation is fairer and better reflects the real cost of living and movements in respect of wages and therefore the actual standards 
that people live by
, 
we now have a situation when almost within days of passing tha
t legislation the government have
 announced that what they intend to do at the first available opportunity—given their commitment not to make changes to the pension this term—post the next election, is
 in
 fact to revert to the CPI with respect to indexation for all other income support and disability pension payments. So within days of recognising the need by implementing their commitment that fair indexation required 
MTAWE
 to be included, they have then moved to remove it from everybody else.



The irony of this with respect to the actual payments we are talking about here is that, for example, in the veterans area there are basically three elements of payments in broad terms that people can qualify for. There are income support payments which are part of the safety net provided, which in this case is the service pension and the invalidity service pension, and the war widow's pension, effectively—although there is an element of compensation associated with that. There are disability pensions which relate to the impact of war caused injuries, the special rate and the disability rate pensions. Then there is superannuation. 


Some veterans would qualify for all three. They would qualify on the basis of injury or wounds for an element of disability pension, if you like, compensation for the effect of service. They would qualify for some element of military superannuation given the nature of the length of time that they were in the service, although, overwhelmingly, those who served at that time did not qualify for military superannuation because of the length of time served. And if their superannuation payment was not large enough—and for most that would be the case because the average payment per annum in these circumstances would be somewhere around $22,000 or $23,000—they would also potentially qualify for a part pension.


The bizarre thing in the circumstances of an individual in that situation now is that the base payment, which is the income support payment, will be indexed at a less fair rate, according to the arguments put by the then shadow minister, Senator Ronaldson, and by many others in the coalition and certainly by me in the context of the discussion around the issue of indexation with the TPI pension back in 2007 and since. It will be less advantageous in respect of the base income support payment. It will be less advantageous for the compensation payment that they receive in recognition of the injuries they have received as a result of their service. But it will be more advantageously and more fairly indexed for the top-up military superannuation payment, which they have every right to receive and have earnt—no question—but which is an additional payment beyond the base payment and the compensation payment.


For example, a TPI who is on the full special rate and who was a military superannuant who will receive this increase is in fact now going to go backwards once those two changes are implemented, because whatever increase occurs that is additional with respect to the movements of MTAWE in respect of military superannuation will in fact be dropped off the special rate payment. And, given the special rate payment is in excess of $32,000—as against a pension of some $22,000 or $23,000-plus on average—because the base rates are bigger what you will see is that the impact of that change will be greater; plus the increase they receive on military supperannuation will be used for consideration with respect to qualifications for income support and for taxation purposes. For most TPIs who are in receipt of a service pension at the full rate it will just be bad news.


The Prime Minister has tried to make it clear in the House that, although we have argued that this is a cut, there will be no cut and the pensions will go up every six months. That is correct, if CPI goes up—and it almost invariably does; although in the last 10-plus years it has tended to go up by a lot less than MTAWE. But he is right: pensions will go up, but they will not go up by anywhere near what they would have gone up by if we see a situation over the years ahead where male total average weekly earnings moves at a different rate, as it has in past times. There have been a number of calculations around this. A lot depends on the actual movements. For example, on Channel 7 Mark Riley estimated that with the service pension, if movements are in line with cost of living rather than current indexation in the years ahead, you will see a difference by 2020 of some $100 a fortnight.


ADSO, the Alliance of Defence Service Organisations and partners, calculated that over the four years to March 2014 the service pension catch-up has been linked to increases in the average wages, resulting in pension payments over that period totalling $2,000 more than they would have been if they had been linked only to increases in the cost of living. The question of what happens will depend on those movements. But, frankly, the circumstances are that MTAWE has been in excess of CPI for, I think, all bar the last movement in almost all of the last 10-plus years. That is going to lead to a situation where veterans are worse off. We are going to see a situation where the cuts are in effect. There will be an erosion in the value of those payments, an erosion from what they would have been, and it is going to hurt. It is going to hit people who have given much for their country. It is going to hit people who are in a situation where they are relying on these payments to have a decent future. In those circumstances, these are concerns which the government needs to address. The Prime Minister says that pensions will be going up. Yes, they will, but they will not be going up by anything like what they would have been, and the effect will be a cut in the value of the payments, a cut in the living standards of the pensioners right across the board. These measures are insidious. It is a mean act. It needs to be opposed.

"Brough, Mal, MP",LP,2014-06-04,"



Mr BROUGH
 (Fisher) (11:39):  This budget sets out some of the problems and some of the solutions to Australia's long-term concerns and how we as a nation should seek to address them. I take you back to the Howard era, when Treasurer Costello introduced the Intergenerational report. This brought to the consciousness of the Australian population the major challenges facing the country as we age and live longer—and that is a good thing. I am all for living longer, as I am sure everybody in this House is, but it does bring with it some real challenges. 


Today, there are approximately 175,000 new entrants into the workforce. That will be made up of a combination of school leavers, university leavers and people coming to Australia as immigrants. But in the not-too-distant future—in fact, in the 2020s; this position will probably peak in 2017, maybe a little earlier—we will start to see a decline in the number of people coming into the workforce, to the point where it drops off to being approximately 10 per cent of the 175,000. 'So what?' you ask. The point is that, with fewer workers coming in and a large number going out the other end and becoming retirees, we end up with fewer workers paying PAYG tax and adding to the social fabric of Australia from a productivity perspective and also a taxation perspective, and more people in the retirement phase, obviously putting huge pressure on all elements of society. So that is, on one side of the equation, a problem; it is a challenge—how we address that. 


But there is another, conflicting issue that comes into this, and that is the impact that we are seeing today—and it will continue to grow—of technology, data, the internet and all things associated with IT. Every person in this House, certainly every member of the parliament and the Senate, and almost every other person will have more computing power in the palm of their hand than sent man to the moon. Let us just reflect on that for a moment. This is in the space of our lifetime. I remember sitting watching man land on the moon in 1969 on the one black-and-white television at my primary school, with the dark velvet curtains pulled back, with some of the adults, and we marvelled at the power that made that possible. But that is less than the power that we all have today.


So what does this mean? It means that the disruption that is going to occur to our way of life, to society and to the jobs that flow from technology is something that every person in Australia, every business, every board and every politician needs to take into account.


Here is some stark reality from the US. Research has been done as to the lengths of recessions—that is, the period of time from when peak employment drops off until it comes back up to that level. From 1948 to 1980, the average time after recessions that it took for employment to get back to the level it was at before was roughly two years—24 months—or a little under.But then it started to deteriorate. After 1981, it took 28 months for the US to come back to the same levels of employment. By 1990, it was 32 months. By the 2001 recession, it had blown out to 47 months—four years. But, since the 2007 recession, the US has still not returned to the same level of employment, some 70-plus months later. In other words, the time it takes for the economy to create enough employment to fill the gaps from the jobs lost is getting longer and longer. 


The reason for that is right before our eyes. As anyone who has walked into an airport of late has realised, you no longer line up to check in with a human being; you do it yourself. Sure, there are still two or three staff there in the terminal, but there are not the banks of human labour lining up to assist us. When you check out at Coles or Woolworths today you have the option of interfacing with another human being to pay or doing it yourself with a computer. We take all of these things in our stride as they are happening, but bit by bit they are eroding jobs. 


Of course, we are seeing the demise of the car industry in Australia, and there are a number of reasons for that—the cost of doing business here, the fact that Australians are not buying Australian cars—but a large component of that is that the automation in the world of automobile manufacturing is extraordinary. We now have cars on the road in San Francisco owned by Google that are driverless. Six years ago they said it was impossible. Why do I raise this? There is a very short time lag between the introduction of experimental machinery and it becoming commercialised. What are the implications of having driverless vehicles? Do we need cab drivers? Do we need delivery drivers? In my son's own industry, mining, Rio Tinto is moving more and more to driverless trucks. This is human beings being put out of business in a way we have never seen before. 


As I said at the outset, we have a conflict. Australia has an ageing population and a shrinking number of people coming into the labour market. On the other side of the equation, technology and the internet are driving change which is shrinking the labour market. Research tells us that 47 per cent of all of the job categories in the world today are under threat as a direct result of these technologies. A lot of tertiary qualified people listening to this today will be sitting there thinking, 'I'm okay.' No, you are not. The reality is that if you are a lawyer or an accountant—or even if you are in the medical professions or you are a pharmacist—your job is under threat. We in government need to start taking this seriously, because these are the issues that are going to confront us in the next 5,10 and 15 years. We need to be careful that we do not leave people behind and create social dysfunction. Look to Europe today and see how many tertiary qualified white-collar workers are out of work.


Another issue that we need to take into account is the shifting of taxation. We have had a bit of a debate in this country about GST on imports of under a thousand dollars. I was the minister who worked on those figures back in the Howard days. Let us have a look at what is happening. There is a company called Oasis run by two women out of the UK. They have no presence in Australia. They are a fashion label. There are no stores in the High Street, but they do sell two jumbo jet loads of women's clothes into Australia every week. They do not pay any tax here; they do not employ anyone here. This is the way of the world. I am not railing against it. I am not a Luddite who says we should stop these things. I am saying that we need to be aware of them. 


Then you look at the Microsofts and the Googles—they have international platforms. Where do they pay their tax? People pay their tax wherever they can pay the least. I do not begrudge them that, but the reality is that, as the tax base is eroded as a result of people being able to make these choices—since they no longer need a physical presence in any particular jurisdiction—it means that the problems of governments worldwide are going to grow deeper. 


Ageing population; fewer people coming into the workforce; computerisation and automation leading to more job losses, meaning fewer PAYG taxpayers; and those whose platforms give them the capacity to influence the direction of the world and who can also influence the world through the amount of tax they pay and where they pay it—these are issues that we in Australia need to address now. It starts with kindergarten. It starts with the fact that we do not have enough students in this country learning science and mathematics and preparing to be part of the world as it is going to be. Sure, we all sit there on our smartphones, as the member opposite is doing right now. What he has at his fingertips at this moment is access to the world—and so do children, and they do this every single day. But what we need them to do is to be more than just consumers; we need them to be part of the innovation that is required. As part of that solution, I am suggesting that Australia now needs to look at how we use the incredible wealth within our superannuation system—not to underwrite it, but to leverage that money innovatively so that Australia can get to the forefront and hold our place in the world and not just be consumers of these technologies. 


These are big problems. I will inform the House, for those who do not know, of some of the other massive challenges just around the corner. Many of you will have heard of 3-D printers, but some will not have. A 3-D printer today can print human organs for use in the body. How much longer will it be before 3-D printers will be in businesses in your suburb and then in your house? Instead of going to the hardware store to get a bit of pipe to repair—where you need a supply chain, logistics and transportation—what you do is download a 3-D blueprint off the internet for 20c, you put it into your 3-D printer and you print it out. This is not science fiction; this is science fact that is here today. If we as legislators, as governments, as oppositions, as leaders in our communities are not aware of what is coming then we are going to condemn the next generation to be preparing for jobs which do not exist. It is going to affect the education sector, it will affect the hospitality sector and the mining sector. In fact, every single section of our society will be impacted and sooner than we think.


In the area of IT it has been said that people overestimate the impact of IT in the short term and underestimate it in the long term. The problem is that the long term is becoming shorter and shorter. Today the information we hold an our hand is superseded every six months. The amount of technology and the amount of change that we all see and we can reflect on in the last 40 years will be quadrupled in the next 10 years. All of these things are real issues that need to be exercising the minds of our nation's leaders and our boards of directors today. No longer can we rely upon our geographical isolation. No longer can we use glib phrases such as 'the Asian century'. Our locality and our close proximity will not necessarily be what saves us.


Recently I was talking to a company that set up here in Australia and they were looking at where they would have their distribution centre to distribute the product in Australia—whether it be in Sydney or Melbourne. When they did their analysis they found it was actually cheaper to remain with the distribution centre in Texas USA and bring the product to Australia from there. What does this say about some of the structural issues that face us? They are enormous.


There was a departmental staffer in the House who I ran into recently. Her son has big feet and he had to play basketball. So he went down to the local store to get himself a pair of basketball shoes and he couldn't find any. In desperation he got on the internet. He found what he was looking for from the US on Friday night. His shoes were delivered to his door on Monday morning. Monday morning! If you had managed to find a shop to order them, they would have taken three or four weeks. He managed to get them at about half the price and within three days. People say it is like the Industrial Revolution again. No, it is not. The reality is that if someone comes up with a new invention today in any part of the world it can be in the rest of the world the next day. So the impacts that we are finding are fast and they are furious.


Let me take you to an icon of Australia—Australia Post. Right now it is struggling. Its mail peaked in 2008 and since then it is sending a billion items of surface mail fewer a year. Why? Because of the impact of the internet. So this part of the fabric of Australian society which has underpinned so many communities is now under threat as a direct result of these changes to the way in which we do business and because of technology. There is no point sticking our heads in the sand and saying: 'That's no good. We need to prop them up.' That is what fools do. We need to embrace the change and we need to see what we can use those existing structures and that existing human capital for. And when we do and when we find new methods and new ways of using that base, it will be government services. Those government services today are delivered by other agencies. So no matter which way you cut it, slice it or dice it, there will be further reductions in the need for human capital.


Today as we reflect on the 2014 budget and some of the issues that are confronting us as a nation regarding an ageing population and the fact that health care is doubling every 10 years, and that someone has to pay it, we need to turn our minds to how we prepare for the changes that no government can stop. No government is going to stop the march of technology, the interference of the internet and of robotics. It is coming to a town and a society and a job near you. What we need to do is open our eyes to both the opportunities and the challenges, and across the divide of this parliament recognise that there are things bigger than our political ideologies which are going to drive the future of our nation and our world. We can decide to be part of it and embrace it or we can ignore it at our peril. I plead with this parliament, as parliamentarians, to educate yourselves to these changes and to be part of finding the solutions for the next generation.

Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume) (11:54):  I would like to start with a quote from a speech. It says:


… it is not popular to take entitlements away from millions of voters …


…   …   …


Most undemocratic nations are … unable to afford the largesse of universal entitlement systems. So, ultimately the fiscal impact … must be brought to account no matter what the political values of the government are or how popular a spending program may be.


…   …   …


… The Age of Entitlement is over.


Are these the words of a modern-day prophet? Speaking to the Institute of Economic Affairs in London in April 2012, Joe Hockey, now the Treasurer, was laying it on a plate. That was two years ago. Now all we hear from Labor and the crossbenchers is that they have had no warnings: it is all about broken promises and no time to prepare. What a load of rot. There it was laid out on a platter 24 months ago. That is when we started explaining it to Australia. On May 13 this year, we carved it up into bite-sized chunks, and we are still hearing that it is too tough to swallow.


I rise today to support this series of appropriation bills because they will start us on the path to saving a great economy. We laid out the problem well in advance of action. We have cut it up into bite-sized pieces for easier consumption. We understand there is a period of rumination, even of spitting some bits out. But, at the end of the day, it is crucial these bills make it through. I do not often play travel agent or tour guide, but if we do not get this budget passed, in complete or near-complete form, we are all going to Europe together—and not for a holiday.


Let's look a bit closer at the ruin that is rife in the European Union, Japan and the US. It always starts with private debt, particularly household debt, which then becomes public and government debt when the economy hits the ropes. There is a lot of talk about what is really going on with Australia's finances at the moment, so I want to lay the facts on the table in a pretty impartial way. It is true that we do not have the highest level of government debt in the Western world yet; in fact, we are still some way away from it. But we do have the one of the highest levels of household debt in the Western world through mortgages and credit cards. Private household debt in Australia—excuse the pun—is through the roof. Few other countries, except for Ireland, come close. This is why you hear that so many people my age, living in my electorate of Hume, are scared about their mortgages. They are worried about losing their jobs, about interest rates going up and about the cost of living going up. I hear this every day.


We are now layering mountains of government debt on top of our private debt. We have $1.84 trillion of household debt. These are such big numbers they are almost meaningless. That is bigger than the whole economy itself. It is equal to $80,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia. The interest bill is over $100 billion per year. But if we do not intervene now, within four years our public debt, on top of this private household debt, will reach $667 billion—around $50,000 per household. It is a mountain of red ink that is getting higher and higher. It is growing very, very fast. In fact, we know that Australia's public debt is rising the fastest of any country in the OECD. For us to stand by and not act on it would be incredibly irresponsible.


To see how this might play out in practice, let's look at some other countries. There is no shortage of sobering examples. During the eighties and nineties, Japan had private debt levels equal to the size of their economy—a little less than we have in Australia today. This fuelled a property boom, which many of us remember, and it was not a problem so long as property prices stayed high. But in the early to mid-nineties, the Japanese property sector collapsed and the private debt—the household debt—was transferred over to the government.


Let us put this in perspective. Before the property price collapse in Japan, government debt was equal to less than half of the economy. But, as the economy hit the ropes, the government had to step in to prevent systemic failure, and government debt increased threefold relative to the size of the economy. The following two decades have created immeasurable pain for the Japanese economy. 


We see similar patterns in the United States. By 2007 US household debt had reached about 130 per cent of disposable income. Meanwhile, savings rates had collapsed. When the financial crisis hit, federal government debt was around 45 per cent of GDP, but, again, the government had to step in to take on that household debt, and government debt moved rapidly north, towards 100 per cent of the economy.


We can debate whether these countries got the policy settings right on their day of reckoning. But what is clear is that high private debt, high household debt, is easily and often transferred over to the government. The best antidote is to run government surpluses when we can and to support strong economic growth, investment and employment. That will ensure that my constituents with mortgages and with large credit card debts are in the best possible position to survive tough times. Having high government debts and deficits when there is a towering household debt is like taking the shock absorbers out of your car. When you hit a bump in the road you need shock absorbers; and when the government already has too much debt there is absolutely nowhere to go. 


None of this is to say that I am pessimistic about the economy. In fact, given the emphasis in the budget on investment in productive infrastructure, workforce participation, research and education, there is good reason to be optimistic. Indeed, driving growth through participation, investment in infrastructure and so on is exactly the response to the situation. In this circumstance strong growth in employment is critical and it is what we are focused on. 


Every Australian with a mortgage knows the danger of losing your job. That is why this budget is enabling long-term growth rates in employment, with a shift from consumption to investment. In contrast, continuing to run up government debt in the face of this towering mountain would be totally irresponsible. Everyone in my electorate with a loan should be screaming at Labor and the crossbenchers to play their part in sorting this out. We cannot take the risk of continuing down this path. 


There is a another side to this. For decades, resource economists have studied the economic implications of a big surge in commodity investments and exports, exactly as we are experiencing today and have been experiencing for a number of years. Ironically, much of the best economic research has been done here in Australia, but the last government ignored it. The conclusions of this research are very clear and totally aligned with this budget. First, it is absolutely critical to drive productivity with investments in participation in the workforce, infrastructure and innovation. This takes pressure off the non-resource parts of the economy. In the absence of these initiatives, we see the scorching of non-resource parts of the economy, often referred to as a Dutch disease. We saw no shortage of Dutch disease in the economy over the last six years, as our tradeable sectors like agriculture, education, tourism and even resources itself struggled with a huge loss of competitiveness driven by an unduly high exchange rate. In my electorate of Hume, we saw a range of businesses—farmers, engineers and others—suffering from this disastrous situation.


As well as driving productivity, governments need to run surpluses, and, wherever possible, push those savings offshore into their own sovereign wealth funds. Of course, when you have hundreds of billions of dollars of debt and deficits of $50 billion a year, government saving is only a dream. But reducing our deficit is what we need to do, and it is exactly what we are doing.


Let us put this reduction in the deficit that we are now undertaking into perspective. Roughly $10 billion a year in deficit reduction is planned through the budget forward estimates period and the year beyond. That equates to about 0.6 per cent of GDP. Most economists will tell you that the private sector will absorb a good portion of that loss. So the reduction in economic activity that we are talking about here is pretty minimal and pretty manageable, given the starting point.


The good news with all of this is that—people often forget—when you cut government spending, a series of benefits flow. Most importantly, cutting deficits helps to contain interest rates. Interest rates worldwide are very low, and Australia's are far higher than everyone else's by two or three percentage points. But by containing interest rates, we take pressure off those with mortgages—the ones raising kids, buying houses and so on. The low global interest rates will not stay with us forever. As they climb, the risk is that ours will climb with them. The stakes are very high, but reduced deficits give the Reserve Bank the opportunity to contain interest rates. Everyone with a mortgage should be thankful that this government is working to live within its means. On top of taking pressure off interest rates, running government surpluses—or reducing the deficit—also takes pressure off the exchange rate, helping our farmers and other exporters. We absolutely have to do this.


The final reason why we have to act on the deficit is because we cannot leave huge debts for the next generation. There is one fundamental difference between government debt and private debt—and that is, you cannot leave private debt to your kids, but you can leave government debt to your kids. That creates an enormous temptation for bad governments. That is what has happened in Europe, that is what is happening in the US and, in the absence of our intervention, that is exactly what will happen here in Australia. The need to act is very clear now, and the benefits from immediate action are enormous—for mortgage holders, for exporters, and for the next generation.


Deputy Speaker, you remember the excitement—the travel brochures out on the coffee table, the suitcase flung open. Going to Europe was something to look forward to. We do not want to go to Europe now—in Greece, Portugal and Spain the debts are, arguably, unpayable. In Spain, the 18- to 35-year-olds are facing a 40 per cent unemployment rate or more. The debts owing in Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Belgium, Spain and Italy have seen the near collapse of the eurozone—and it all started with too much private debt. Australia has a huge private debt. We do not want to go to Europe. The appropriation bills before the House are the start of a different kind of journey for Australia: a journey of recovery. This is the trip we really want to be taking. I commend this bill to the House.

"Alexander, John, MP",LP,2014-06-04,"



Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (12:07):  I rise to speak on this appropriation bill and the related bills before the House. One thing that dismays me about the operation of this parliament is the propensity of those opposite to willingly and knowingly make mischief with the facts, when faced with the serious task of fixing our nation's economy. Our opponents have spent the past three weeks promoting misinformation and building contrary views to undermine what desperately needs to be done to get the budget back on track and to fix the debt and deficit disaster that they left behind.


This government is tasked with confronting the facts of our national debt and our budgetary situation. If no action is taken, Australian taxpayers are facing a gross debt projected to blow out to $667 billion within the next decade. We are currently burdened by $1 billion per month in interest on this debt—that is, one thousand million dollars every month—just to service the interest on our debt. The Treasurer has stated that 70 per cent of this money goes to people overseas. As a taxpayer, as a father, as a former business owner, as a mortgage holder and as a representative for the people of Bennelong, I cannot sit idly by and support this disastrous situation. What makes matters worse is that, should we not act—which is what those opposite want—our interest repayments could balloon to $3 billion each and every month. It would represent an absolute mockery of our responsibility to the Australian people if we, the elected government, did not take decisive action. We would be negligent in our duties if we left this kind of debt and deficit mess behind for our children's generation to clean up. And yet, incredibly, those opposite seem unconvinced of the need for action. Instead, they sit on their hands and accuse us of overdramatising our nation's economic situation. So I put it to the opposition: at what point should we start to get nervous?—when the monthly interest on our debt is $2 billion? Or $4 billion? For how long can we afford to be complacent?


What became abundantly clear to Australian taxpayers over the past six years is that the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments set this country on an unsustainable path, which continues to threaten our future prosperity. Yet again, just as in 1996, we, the coalition, have been elected to fix the economy and clean up Labor's mess. It is a cornerstone of adult economic management that we must live within our means. This budget is a mature response to Australia's economic outlook. It proposes reasonable savings and asks all Australians to make a small contribution towards our future prosperity. 


To those opposite who seek to distract the Australian people from the real issues facing the nation, I refer them to the words of ABC journalist Jonathon Green, on 22 May:


It might suit the sugary, elevated pulse of social media to deduce political and budgetary incompetence from the momentary dipping of an eyelid, but on quiet, sober reflection it hardly seems a compelling argument.


A relationship of trust between government and the Australian people is central to good governance. Six years of Labor's mismanagement has strained this relationship, but we are committed to it. Yet, as in any relationship, the government's trusted bond with the Australian people is vulnerable to gossip and untruths. So allow me to present the facts, the truth. 


The previous government created economic peril during their six years in office, smearing dirt on Australia's international image and tarnishing our reputation aboard. Their actions in government communicated a clear message to our trading partners and investors: that for the first time in our history Australia was considered a nation of sovereign risk. Labor sought to savage the economic potential of the mining boom by introducing a tax that threatened to curtail investment. They compromised relations with valued trading partners over restrictions to live exports, which hurt farmers at home and offended our Indonesian neighbours. Their failure to honour the recommendations of the independent PBAC for listings of new medicines sent shockwaves overseas.


Unlike our predecessors, the Abbott government seeks to rebuild trust, at home and abroad. We have made it very clear since coming to office that Australia is once again open for business. But to remain a country worth investing in, we must make changes. We cannot live off the credit card and pay interest on further borrowings. It is time for us to live within our means so that our children can enjoy the prosperity that is earned, not a lifestyle that is paid for on the credit card.


In the lead-up to last year's election, this government made four great promises: stop the boats, pay back the debt, scrap the carbon tax and build the roads of the 21st century. In the cut and thrust of daily conversation and endless questioning, it is easy to lose sight of these core promises. Those opposite have fuelled speculation that we have somehow been untrue to our word in areas like education, health and pensions. Yet the level of misinformation being circulated is astounding and, honestly, the Australian people deserve better; they deserve honesty. They deserve to know that the coalition government is taking funding for schools to record highs. 


We are investing more than the previous government would have spent over the forward estimates to ensure schools in all states and territories receive extra funding. In the tertiary education sector we will release the potential of universities across the country and create a dynamic industry. We are asking students to contribute 50-50 towards the cost of their degrees, recognising that the median student will earn substantially more than their contemporaries without  degrees. We are asking students to pay their fair share, only half.


To cry foul on this is a blatant misrepresentation of the facts. What could be more fair than the government offering all students a loan to cover their higher-education costs, and then asking the student to pay back just half of that loan if and when they start earning a decent salary and therefore have the capacity to do so? The other half will be paid by the taxpayer. This is truly a universal system, enabling people from all backgrounds to access a higher education and the potential financial rewards that result. Also in the interests of access and equity, we are extending Commonwealth support to an additional 80,000 students enrolled in any registered higher education institution including, for the first time, TAFEs all around the country.


The Australian people also deserve to know the truth about health. In this budget, annual hospital funding increases over the next four years. Labor made radical promises to skyrocket health funding outside the forward estimates. The fact is that this promise was never sensible nor affordable; it was a fantasy concocted by an irresponsible government that never expected to deliver it. They also promised to build the Epping to Parramatta rail link in my electorate, and that did not happen either. In contrast, this government is in the business of making sensible, sustainable commitments to the Australian people, like our commitment to raise $20 billion for a medical research endowment, which will provide incentive for pioneering developments in scientific discovery and generate further investment. The introduction of a $7 Medicare co-payment is a fair and equitable measure, designed to ensure the sustainability of our healthcare system, while guaranteeing that detailed protections remain in place to support the chronically ill and those most vulnerable members of our community. The system also gives the doctor the discretion not to charge the co-payment if they choose to do so. Just as some doctors now bulk-bill, whilst many others charge around $80 for a consultation, so will the market ensure a strong level of access for all under the new system.


Finally, the Australian people deserve to know the truth about pensions. Under this government, the pension will continue to increase twice each year to keep up with the cost of living. Recognising this commitment, it is also crucial to recognise that Australians are living longer and healthier lives. We must turn our attention to the challenges this will impose on our economy in the years and decades ahead. To cope with the prospect of an ageing population, reforms were announced in this budget to ensure the age pension system is sustainable and able to meet future demand, continuing to provide for those in need. Without policy reform, the cost of the age pension is projected to increase by 70 per cent over the next decade, up to $68 billion a year. Like other governments around the world and the previous Labor government, we will also raise the pension age so that we can sustain the increased demand for pension support for the years to come. When the pension was brought in the average male life expectancy was 63. Now it is over 80. The system must evolve and keep pace with society. Like all Australians, aged pensioners will be better off under the Abbott coalition government after the carbon tax is scrapped because they will keep their energy supplement and save considerably on their costs of living.


I have received a variety of correspondence from Bennelong constituents since the release of the budget. Much of this I have responded to personally through direct phone calls, and, with very few exceptions, people have been very reasonable and understanding of the need for the government to take bold steps to get our budget back on track. While some sections of society have been whipped into a frenzy by those opposite based on blatant misinformation, the vast majority of constituents I have spoken to recognise that we have become complacent and overly dependent in an age of entitlement. It is simply unsustainable to have a situation where the majority of Australians receive some kind of welfare payment. I fully support the notion and understand the need for a social safety net. During my previous career I saw many instances overseas of widespread abject poverty that our nation's safety net protects us from. However, it is necessary for us to ensure that people who have the potential to become productive members of society do not become dependent on welfare, spiralling into the possibility of cross-generational dependency.


Our well-intentioned safety net has increasingly become a cargo net. Australian taxpayers should not be investing in a system that carries those who have the capacity to contribute. It is time for all Australians to reflect on our privileged status as the lucky country and to ask a very important question: how can we sustain the lifestyle we are so accustomed to for generations to come? We owe it to our children, and future proud Australians, to share the heavy lifting. Weaning ourselves off dependency is a difficult but necessary process. This government is up to the task and accepts the need for sensible, sustainable economic growth. We ask the Australian people to join us in our commitment to ensure the future prosperity of this great country is prosperity earned. We ask those opposite to do what they know is right for the long-term strength of this nation, not for short-term political point scoring. This budget reinstates Australia's values of the opportunity to earn a good living, not to be handed one.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (12:20):  It is a pleasure to follow my good friend the member for Bennelong in speaking on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015. If we look at the debate in Australia at the moment and in recent weeks, it has been preoccupied with attacks on both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, their wives and their children, a wink here and a cigar there, and a harmless dance or a harmless song. These things have been blown completely out of proportion and have become the centre of debate, when really the media should have treated them for what they were and left them on the margins. In the days after the budget, we should have been debating its key themes and messages—what this budget is all about. It is about setting up Australia for a more prosperous future where our children and our grandchildren will be better off.


To me, there are two key themes in this budget. The first theme is about paying back Labor's debt and the second theme is about putting in place measures and initiatives that boost Australia's economic growth, productivity and, most importantly, jobs. 


Let us take this first issue of paying back Labor's debt. Treasury's numbers are instructive: under this budget, over the next 10 years, nearly $300 billion of Labor's debt will be repaid and nearly $16 billion a year in interest will be saved. We have to put Labor's $667 billion worth of debt and record deficits, the biggest this country has ever seen, in context. When we left office at the end of 2007, there was zero government debt, there was a $20 billion surplus and $50 billion in the bank, real wages had increased by more than 20 per cent and millions of new jobs had been created. That was the proud fiscal legacy of John Howard, Peter Costello and their entire government. Labor were bequeathed this golden fiscal legacy but destroyed it in a matter of years. As a result, we had to introduce a series of tough measures in this budget which will see nearly $300 billion repaid. Right now, as the member for Bendigo and the member for Longman, who are in the chamber, know, Labor's interest bill that they left us is $1 billion a month. That pays for Gonski. That pays for the NDIS. That is an East West Link or a WestConnex project. That is just the interest bill on Labor's debt. So that is the first job of this budget—to pay back Labor's debt.


The second element of this budget is to boost economic growth, jobs and productivity. We have done that in three ways in this budget. The first measure is a record investment in infrastructure, particularly roads—$50 billion of the Commonwealth's money, including $5 billion which will incentivise the states to recycle their own infrastructure, to sell it, to upgrade it and to ensure that they have the best infrastructure available for their constituents. In total, $125 billion worth of infrastructure will be kick-started by measures in this budget, creating tens of thousands of jobs right around the country. 


The second measure in this budget designed to boost economic growth, productivity and jobs is a record investment in education, innovation and research, with a $20 billion medical research future fund, which will be the envy of the world—and the member for Bendigo knows it will be appreciated by her constituents. We understand that Australia has a natural strength in medical research and I know that in Victoria, my home state and the member for Bendigo's home state, we have great research institutions like the Burnett institute and the Walter and Eliza Hall institute—and there are many in New South Wales too. These will be the direct beneficiaries of the $20 billion medical research future fund. For the first time, in this budget we are giving Commonwealth support to people who go to TAFE or take a sub-bachelor degree or a diploma, and we are giving up to $20,000 in a HECS-type of loan to apprentices. We say to the constituents of Australia that if the Commonwealth is prepared to support people who go to university, it should also be prepared to support people who undertake an apprenticeship. Twenty per cent of that amount will not have to be repaid if they complete their apprenticeship. We are boosting support for people who take up sub-bachelor degrees and diplomas and go to TAFE, we are giving greater support to people who undertake apprenticeships and we are investing in world-leading medical research.


The third element of productivity and jobs growth in this budget relates to the efforts we have under way to boost workforce participation for the under-30s, the over-50s and women. Those who are under 30 and have the capacity to work should not be on welfare—they should be earning or learning. For the over-50s who have been on welfare for more than six months, we will give an incentive to employers of up to $10,000 to take these people on board and give them a job where they become net contributors to our society. For women, we have an appropriate and far-sighted paid parental leave scheme which will take the place of Labor's mickey mouse paid parental leave scheme, which will hopefully keep many more women in the workforce after they have had children. 


They are the two main aims of this budget—paying back Labor's debt and boosting productivity growth and jobs. If you read the Commission of Audit, if you listen to the International Monetary Fund or you listen to the independent Parliamentary Budget Office, you will know that business as usual is not an option. Australia cannot continue on its current trajectory of spend, spend, spend instead of save, save, save. That is why we have these measures in this budget. I want to quote to you the National Commission of Audit, because its diagnosis was alarming. It found:


The fiscal situation is far weaker than it should be and the long-term outlook is ominous due to an unsustainable increase in expenditure commitment.


This problem of expenditure commitments is being compounded by the fact that we have an ageing population. Today, the number of people who are working for every retired Australian is five; by 2050 it will have fallen to just 2.7 people who are working for every one retired Australian. That is what compels us to take action today.


I want to go through the five most discussed elements in this budget, to answer the claims of those opposite and to say why we need these changes. Take, for example, the Medicare co-payments.

Mr FRYDENBERG:
  As I was saying, if we look at five of the most controversial or discussed and debated aspects of this budget—the Medicare co-payments, pensions, university deregulation, school and hospital funding—and some of the other areas, you could have thought, by the hue and cry from the Labor Party, that we have taken away the safety net altogether. Far from it. If you look at the Medicare co-payments, Australia is following down the path of European countries, Scandinavian countries, New Zealand and the Americas in having a co-payment of this kind. In fact, there is a cap of 10 visits on the co-payment for concession card holders—and in Australia there are more than eight million concession card holders—as well as people under the age of 16. For these people the $7 co-payment will be limited to just 10 visits.


If you look at pensions, pensions will go up twice each and every year. If you were to wind the clock back to 1908, when the pension first came in, the life expectancy for a 15-year-old male was 64. He never was going to get the pension. Today the life expectancy for a 15-year-old male in Australia is around 80 years of years age and for a woman it is 85. It is a much different circumstance and this needs to be reflected when it comes to pensions.


If you look at university deregulation, you could be forgiven for thinking that students were paying every dollar up-front. In fact, they do not pay a dollar up-front; they only start to pay back their HELP or HECS loan when their income reaches $50,000. What is more, our new measures will ensure that $1 in every $5 taken by a university as a result of deregulation can be put back into Commonwealth scholarships to help those from regional areas and others of lower socioeconomic advantage. When you look at health and school funding going forward, rather than it being cut it will, over the next four to five years, go up: 37 per cent for school funding and 40 per cent for hospital funding—a significant increase. 


When you look at other aspects of this policy, like the 'earn or learn' for under 30s, there are important carve-outs to ensure that if a young person does not have the capacity to work for more than 30 hours, or if they are a principal carer, if they are a parent or if they have a disability, then they are not going to be subject to these new 'earn or learn' requirements. 


If you listen to the state premiers and the chief ministers talking about losing $80 billion, you would not have known that in fact the states are going to benefit by a total of $60 billion over the coming 10 years—an extra $60 billion in Commonwealth money flowing to the states over the next 10 years. 


We had to take the tough measures in this budget because Labor bequeathed us a fiscal mess. Unemployment increased on their watch. Youth unemployment—as the member for Longman knows—went from 19 to 27 per cent under Labor, and we saw a fall in productivity and Australia's economic growth lag behind the world. We are determined to turn that around. This budget is part of a broader economic narrative which includes deregulation, industrial relations reform, tax reform, getting rid of the carbon tax, getting rid of the mining tax and reviews into competition policy and into the financial system. This is a good budget; this is an important budget. I commend this bill to the House.

WYATT ROY
 (Longman) (12:50):  It is always a great pleasure to follow the eloquence of the member for Kooyong. He and I have had many discussions about this budget. Just down the hallway in another room, the federal Treasurer is concluding his press conference updating the country on the national accounts figures. I will use this opportunity to update the House on those figures as well. 


What the national accounts figures show is that our strong economic action strategy is working, a strategy that recognises that growth and prosperity in this nation come from the private sector, not from a big, overbearing and intervening government. The national accounts figures that the Treasurer is updating the nation's media on now show that there has been 3.5 per cent growth over this year. Significantly, this growth has come predominantly from the non-mining sector. We have seen the smallest current account deficit since 1980—that is 10 years before I was born. Household spending is up, which shows that confidence is returning to the Australian economy. Most significantly, since the beginning of the year there have been 106,000 new jobs created, with 79,000 new full-time jobs. 


What all this shows is that our economic action strategy is working. We are removing barriers to private sector growth and investment, whether that is getting rid of the carbon tax, the mining tax or over $1 billion in red tape every single year. We are freeing the private sector of our economy up so that it can grow, prosper and employ more people. 


As we look at the economic narrative of our nation, it is important to see where we have come from and where we are going. In 2007, when the former coalition government left office, there was a $20 billion surplus, there was $50 billion in the bank and all of Labor's debt had been paid off. Then the Labor Party came to power and we saw our spending increase at the fastest rate of the 17 advanced IMF economies. We saw our debt increase at the third-highest rate of the 17 advanced IMF economies. That was money borrowed against the next generation. 


Where are we now? If we had not acted, the way we are acting in these bills before the House and the way we have acted through the federal budget, the debt would have reached $667 billion. The interest repayments on the debt this year alone will be $12 billion and that would have gone to $17 billion a year if we had not acted. Those are big figures, so let us put them into perspective—what it means for everyday Australians across the nation. The level of debt would have reached over $24,000 for every single man, woman and child. This year, the interest on the debt bill will be $500. If we had not acted, as I said, the interest bill would have risen to $17 billion a year, or over $1,200 for every single man, woman and child. 


The $12 billion in interest this year alone—money that is effectively dead money—would have funded the complete $8 billion upgrade of the Bruce Highway, the complete $1.2 billion upgrade of the Gateway Motorway and a $2 billion new tertiary hospital for Queensland—and we still would have had hundreds of millions of dollars left over. That is the real cost of the interest we are paying. That is what is our nation is missing out on.


As the member for Kooyong pointed out, before we deal with our nation's significant debt burden, that $24,000 debt that all Australians owe, we have to deal with the challenge—and I say it is a challenge, not a problem—of an ageing population. Today, as the member for Kooyong pointed out, there are five people working for every one person in retirement. By 2050 that will reach only 2.7 people for every person in retirement. The percentage of the population aged over 75 will go from about six per cent of the population to over 14 per cent of the population. And what the Productivity Commission has said is that if we do not do anything, taxes would have to rise by 21 per cent to fund them, and that is before we get to that $24,000 bill for every man, woman and child. 


So as a nation we have to make a choice, and that is what this budget is about. Do we say that the problems we have inherited are too hard? Do we say that we will simply run up a greater credit card bill and hand that over to the next generation? Or do we say that as a government and as a country we live within our means so that what we hand over to the next generation of Australians is a nation with as much if not more opportunity than we currently inherit. If we do not, a young Australian growing up in the decades to come will be born with that $24,000 debt bill. They will be born with the need to pay at least 21 per cent higher taxes, and they will be born in a nation where the government does not have the ability to invest in roads and schools and hospitals across the decades to come. I am not prepared to be part of a government that says that the challenges we face as a nation are all too hard, that we are not prepared to make difficult decisions today and that the next generation will pick up the bill. Those are the choices we have to make in this budget and I am proud to say that I am part of a government that is prepared to take on this challenge so that future generations can inherit a nation with greater prosperity and greater opportunity. 


But beyond simply living within our means, we have to go for growth in the private sector. Since coming to government, that is exactly what we have done and that is what those job growth figures demonstrate. We have moved to cut the carbon tax. We have moved to abolish the mining tax and we are cutting over a billion dollars of red tape every single year, from small business predominantly. In my electorate—and I have specific examples where we have gone literally door to door with local businesses—we have found those overbearing and intervening and unnecessary regulations placed on small businesses and we have removed them, saving local businesses thousands of dollars a month so that they can go out and thrive and prosper and employ more people. 


That is the role of the private sector, and it is the role of the government simply to stop being the problem. Beyond that, where the market is not best placed to do so, I believe that it is the role of government to invest in those productivity-increasing measures, those vital pieces of infrastructure that our nation needs. In this budget there is over $50 billion invested into infrastructure, which is great for jobs, great for the economy and great for commuters across our nation.


In my electorate, the Bruce Highway is the great arterial that links our region to Brisbane and to the growing population in our north. It is the economic driver as much as the social driver of our region. In this budget we are investing over $3 billion between the Pine Rivers and Gympie, which will see significant upgrades across that highway and benefit local commuters and local families. We are investing over $16 million into the D'Aguilar Highway. As locals know, this has been a death trap for many years and inaction by the former Labor government resulted in much more tragedy on that road. It is a great matter of pride that after campaigning in 2010 and finally coming to government in 2013, I and the coalition government are able to deliver $16 million for that road. So on the infrastructure front we are investing significantly so that we can go for growth, we can create the jobs and we can see economic productivity lift. 


But we are also at the individual level creating amazing new opportunities, particularly for young people across our nation to find the jobs of the future. We are creating for the first time ever the same opportunities for young people going to TAFE to get a diploma or an advanced diploma for a trade that are applied to a student going to university. If you go to achieve a diploma or an advanced diploma—and often these are people from the most disadvantaged background—you will not have to pay a single dollar upfront. This is the first time ever for our nation. In fact you only pay back the loan when you earn over $50,000, the same rule that applies to higher education. If you decide that you want to become a tradie, we are saying that we will give you $20,000 as a HECS-style loan to get you through your apprenticeship so that you can go on and find meaningful employment in the future.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley—Minister for Small Business) (16:06):  Thank you, Acting Deputy Speaker, and it is great to see you there. You look very resplendent. It is my honour and privilege to rise in support of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015 and related bills.


The budget delivered some weeks ago was a crucial statement of the challenges we are facing and the action we need to take. Not only did it present all of the financial details Australians rightfully expect but it did so with an honesty and an integrity that has been lacking in recent years, in terms of budget numbers and predictions. Beyond the reliability, the integrity and the genuine disclosure in the figures presented by our Treasurer, this budget is the first Abbott government budget. It heralds a change of direction—an important change of direction we need to pursue. It will be this government; it will be our generation; it is at this time we need to make some choices. I believe the choice to commit ourselves to strengthening our nation's future, improving the prospects of our citizens and underwriting the quality of life and security we all expect and hope to enjoy into the future is the direction we need to turn in. That is why this budget is such a significant and important statement of our strategic direction. Together we will put behind us the profligacy and the populism of the previous government and pivot to a new era of prudence, purposefulness and prosperity, where we put in place the fundamental building blocks of a strong and growing economy and a safe and secure future. That is what the budget is about; that is what these bills are about.


They are not easy choices. But they are ones we have to make if we are to fulfil the promise of a nation where our sons and daughters can reach for a better life—a better life like the one we aimed for; a better life like the one that our parents hoped for for us, and that they worked for and enjoyed. We need to make decisions today to give current and future generations the same opportunity and the same realistic chance that we love about our nation. Together we can generate the wealth we need to sustain the extremely important social and income safety net—the safeguard for those who need that support. We can generate the wealth we need to underwrite the living standards of all Australians: those who have made their contribution in the past, those who continue to make their contribution today and those who are unable to provide for themselves.


Our actions and decisions, captured in this budget, will ensure we can invest in important productive infrastructure—like the East West Link Tunnel in my city, Melbourne—not only to carry commuters but to carry commerce. Those arteries of enterprise need to be invested in and that is what this budget is about. We are making sure we can finance the important works and services that our citizens expect from their government.


We are also seeking to invest today to make sure the quality of life and the opportunities that are the envy of the world are there for our citizens into the future. Growth and prosperity matter because they give us the means to support the quality of life we are aiming for. This budget seeks to ensure that quality of life is buttressed; that it is available, secure and in reach not just for today but into the future, so that future generations can enjoy the opportunities those before us have enjoyed. That will involve us all making a contribution.


I know some have not needed to give the opportunities our nation has offered us a second thought. But now a second effort is needed from many of us to make sure that same potential and those same possibilities are available for all our citizens. That is what this budget is about. It is not just about the numbers, as accurate, truthful and honest as they are. It is about setting up this nation for the generation now and the generation to come, so we can sustain economic growth and those boundless opportunities that put a sparkle in my eye and a fire in my belly. We want to make sure that those boundless opportunities are there for the generations to come. But we need to do those hard yards now. We cannot postpone them. We know that making this choice, and this pivot to a more prudent, more prosperous and more purposeful nation—we need to do that at some point. Do we do it now, while those adjustments are modest and can be implemented so as to not cause great shocks to the economy and to our way of life? Or do we wait until they are so critical and so compelling that they cause enormous dislocation? I choose doing it now.


As I travel around my electorate—and I am been pleased to be have been elected seven times by my community—so often I hear calls for leadership, for a longer-term perspective, and for a government that is prepared to address the reality of the challenges that we face and to put the building blocks in place for the future—not to go around as if governing is like some kind of kid's party, where every child gets a prize no matter what they do. This is about the work that needs to be done now to make sure that that potential and those opportunities are in place—so that people, through their own work, effort and enterprise, can make the most of them. I choose to accept that challenge: to make those choices now, and to invest now for our future—to underwrite the opportunities and the living standards we expect.


The budget also articulates an important economic action strategy: to build a strong and prosperous economy. That will give us the safety—as a nation that is proud and able to pay its way; able to make our choices and not be pushed around by the whims of circumstance—and the security to know that we can maintain those important safety nets and support services, and the way of life that we enjoy. It does call on all of us to make a contribution; to build our workforce, to encourage participation and to get the economy growing. Wasn't it great to see those national accounts showing that the economy is now growing at a trend growth rate? That is something that we were denied under the previous Labor government. This is about the opportunities that we need for the future. It is about a path back to surplus—not a fiction, not some headline, but the hard work to deal with the economic and budget challenges that we face—and, more particularly, it is about slashing $300 billion off the projected debt that this nation would have if the policy settings Labor left us were left in place—that is, $300 billion less lead in the saddlebag that our economy need not carry, and that our citizens today and into the future need not service through interest charges and debt servicing. The Treasurer has made it clear: doing nothing is not an option. I do not think that is even contested now. We have seen the Parliamentary Budget Office embrace the concept of the need for change and the need to do it now. We have learned that the former Treasurer was telling former ministers—Minister Carr—that the budget was in a mess. We have even heard that the current Leader of the Opposition—known to be 'Captain Complaint', and to harvest grievances rather than do the hard work and put in the effort that is required to shape a better future—even he—says there is a task to be done. We are up for doing that work.


Across the budget strategy, there are many measures that are of great relevance to my community, and I will touch on those shortly. What is good for all of us is getting those broader economic settings right, and making sure that we are living within our means and targeting our support where it is needed. People in the small business community of Australia know that you cannot keep paying your overdraft interest bill on your credit card and expect everything to be rosy. They know that if you hope to leave the family enterprise to the next generation, you cannot saddle the business with extraordinary debt that limits its options into the future. Just as small business owners know that, and just as households understand that logic, the nation needs to address the reality as well. That is what this budget actually does.


I welcome the support that we have had for tackling the challenges that have to be dealt with now. We did not create this mess. We did not set the nation on a trajectory that was only going to end in heartbreak and tears. We have dealt with the challenges, and we have an action plan to get us out of the hole that Labor was digging us all into. I am encouraged—I have heard the Business Council of Australia talk about its view of the budget. It said: 'Working from a very difficult budgetary starting position, the government deserves credit for taking important steps to confront the long-term challenges Australia faces from an ageing population.' Infrastructure Partnerships Australia also addressed the issue of shifting some of our outlays from consumption to investment—preparing for the future. In a reference that I am particularly heartened by, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said: 'The budget goes a long way to restoring all-important business confidence that will drive investment and job creation, particularly for Australia's two million small businesses that employ some seven million people.'


I have shared with this chamber that under Labor 519,000 jobs were lost in small business. That is part of the legacy that saw Labor end up with 200,000 more people unemployed at the end of their term than was the case at the beginning. But rather than just recognise that and lament the lost opportunities, we are purposefully tackling the problems that Labor created and turning around that momentum. In the budget there are a number of very particular measures designed to assist small business. Getting the economy right and the broader economic settings right are crucial for all small businesses, and that is why the budget repair and the economic action strategy are so important.


But there are also particular measures. The company tax cut: 800,000 small businesses are structured as companies, and they will welcome that 1.5 per cent reduction in the company tax rate as a clear statement of encouragement to invest, to grow, to employ. The small business and family enterprise ombudsman measure: again, a practical measure to problem solve, to help small businesses navigate government programs and the opportunities for support, and to get access to reliable information. The concierge for problem solving, fixing Commonwealth procurement so that you can actually have half a chance of winning some Commonwealth work if you are smaller enterprises.


Funding the ACCC: earlier today in another place, in Senate estimates, the ACCC chairman, Rob Sims, described the budget position that Labor had left the ACCC as 'diabolical'. It was technically insolvent at the time of the election. It was scheduled to run out of cash by April this year. It needed an injection of over $90 million this current financial year and to fund the ACCC in the out years just so that it could keep doing its crucial work to support consumers and to protect their interests and to ensure there is a fair and competitive economic environment. The unfair contracts measure is to make sure small businesses are not disadvantaged by take-it-or-leave-it standard form contracts that big businesses foist on them and then say, 'Take it or leave it because you've got no option', but leaves those small businesses in a very vulnerable and risky circumstance, unable to shape their own economic choices. The restart measure is an incentive for mature-age jobseekers to bring them into employment. Small businesses know mature and experienced staff are crucial to their success.


The refocusing of the EMDG program for export support; ethics work to make sure it is there to support small business. The paid parental leave scheme—what a great measure. What great measure to see small businesses able to offer their staff the kinds of parental leave support big corporates and governments have been offering for years. I do not know why Labor are opposing that. Do they only want to look at work conditions in big corporates and in government? Is that where the unions only pay an interest? Is it because these are not union jobs and so they are not interested? But they are great jobs, and that is why we are trying to make sure a job in small business is supported and has the kinds of benefits and appeal that you see in bigger corporates. The way in which the entrepreneurs infrastructure fund will work will be to better target the support for small business. The ongoing funding for the Small Business Support Line and the Small Business Advisory Services: these are very important measures that say we value small business, we take your interests seriously, we partner with you in the opportunities and the livelihoods that you provide and you can count on us.


At a local level, I am pleased the budget funded a number of election commitments, such as the investment in the Frankston foreshore. I know you are from a great city on the coast, Mr Acting Deputy President Ewen Jones; so is Frankston. It is the Riviera of Melbourne. We are blessed to be a major metropolitan centre and you can go to sleep at night with the sound of waves—a tantalising offer, and that is something we are investing in. Support for our youth through the funding commitment to the Mornington youth; making sure our commercial centres and our shopping areas are saved by a $759,000 investment through the safer streets campaign for improved lighting, CCTV and anti-graffiti measures. 


There is funding for tourism directional signage down on the Peninsula Link. Great news earlier this week: P&O have recognised you might want to go to Vanuatu, you might want to go to those cities, but where do you really want to dock on a cruise? You want to dock in Mornington. So we have P&O cruises heading from Queensland down to the Riviera of Melbourne and docking at Mornington. When people get there they will want to know where all of those delicious attractions are, and that is why we need good tourist directional signage. There is also support for the Men's Shed, the Frankston Park Dolphins function centre, getting the aths track fixed at Ballam Park, investment in the war memorial, improving and expanding the oncology day treatment centre at the Frankston Hospital: all of these things are funded in the budget, and that is why the budget is great for the Dunkley community.


In the few minutes left I want to talk about one other area—the higher education reforms. I have spoken in this place a number of times about the vision I have for Frankston, the Fremantle of the east coast, the educational hub that builds from the great strengths of Monash University having a campus—and I declare that I am the chairman of the community advisory council—and the Chisholm Institute of TAFE. They offer good quality courses but not the variety our citizens need. Unfortunately, only 9.4 per cent of the population of Frankston city have postsecondary education in terms of bachelor degrees or qualifications above. It is 12.1 per cent in the Mornington Peninsula shire. The previous Labor government ran around talking about their policy target of 40 per cent of the Australian population aged between 25 and 34 having those qualifications. It was great to say, but they did nothing to follow through.


I have put forward the proposition of a polytechnic, a university college, that takes the great strengths of those two existing education providers but says: 'You don't need a spectacularly great ENTER score. You can invest in yourself, as we will invest in you through these higher education reforms. You can get the qualifications you need.' It will offer all kinds of courses by a range of providers on a real-time, open campus, co-hosted by those two great institutions. That is a vision for the future. It is great that our higher education reforms support that as well. I know you are excited, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am positive, pumped and very persistent about this too.

"Sudmalis, Ann, MP",LP,2014-06-04,"



Ms SUDMALIS
 (Gilmore) (16:21):  I rise today on the 2014-15 budget to inform the House of my first nine months as the federal representative of the great people of Gilmore. As every parent knows, nine months is a significant period for any new individual to present themselves to the world. It is a period of anticipation and planning, culminating in an often painful delivery. That initial pain subsides as you work and grow with the new family member and all they contribute to the family's future. I am proud to speak today on the appropriation bills that are currently before this House. I am proud because it is a budget that delivers a strong, prosperous economy and a safe, secure Australia. These actions and economic choices reflect the reason I wish to represent the community of Gilmore.


As a mother and grandmother I recognise that actions today will mean a better and brighter future for the grandchildren of us all. This budget encourages every Australian to contribute and build for our future prosperity as a nation, to participate and weave the social fabric of success for our children's children. It is a budget that takes the necessary steps towards structural reform, reform that if left unaddressed will leave our descendants with a shameful legacy of debt and financial depression. It is clear that the days of borrow and spend must come to an end. Now that we have seen the true state of the books that Labor left us, it is clearer still that the time to contribute and build must begin.


Left unaddressed and without serious reform, the budget those opposite left us was spiralling dangerously towards gross debt exceeding $667 billion within 10 years. Let us think what $667 billion could do for Australia. We could build the long-awaited Brisbane-to-Sydney-to-Melbourne bullet train with $500 billion to spare and then we could update our network of national highways across the country to a minimum dual carriageway, highway standard, still with probably about $200 billion to spare. If we take another $50 billion away from that, and that is a new world-class hospital in 25 major cities and regional centres equal in size to Nowra or Ulladulla in my electorate of Gilmore, we would still have $150 billion left to spare. We could build about 50 bridges across the Shoalhaven River and we would still have billions left over. This is the magnitude of the debt and deficit legacy that Labor have left us. Just think on that for a minute.


This is a tough budget, there is no doubt. The electorate of Gilmore has one of the highest levels of mature and wiser Australians. We have also a high unemployment level and welfare dependence issues as well as transport issues. Our region is not unique. Many other regions across our nation have similar complex needs. Borrowing money against the future of our children is not the way to solve the long-term support; however, we must provide for those in our community of greatest need.


We all knew in September 2013 that Australia was in financial trouble, which was the most important, top-of-mind issue that caused me to stand for government and caused me and many Australians to vote for this government. After six years of a big-spend, big-debt government we knew we were in trouble. Up until now nothing had changed. We are still facing an extraordinary level of national debt. With $1 billion every month being borrowed to pay off the interest, it is like getting a credit card to pay off a credit card to pay off the mortgage.


Solving the debt problem for Australia is not going to be easy. We are proud of our world standard health care, always maintaining a safety net and concessional assistance for those who are most vulnerable. The difficult proposal of a Medicare co-payment will help to maintain this very excellent support mechanism for many years to come. We want a universally accessible system of health care to lead far into Australia's future; we do not want to be unaffordable in less than 10 years.


In addition, with life expectancy extended to people living into their mid-80s, we will need significant research to cure the many illnesses and diseases that become significant as we age. The establishment of the Medical Research Future Fund will be essential for our increased longevity and having quality of life as a priority. There are many in Gilmore right now who wish this medical research had been funded before so that their illnesses could be treated with less expensive medicines and possibly cured.


Before the election, we committed to keeping age pensions out of contention for cuts. We have delivered on this. Pensions will rise every six months, just as they should. Before anything else, it needs to be reiterated that there will be no cuts or changes to pensions during this term of government. We have, however, proposed some structural changes to payments in Australia but, importantly, these do not come into effect until July 2017.


The government has made adjustments to a range of income supplements. We must keep in mind that these are not the primary source of income for a family. They were designed to help with some of the costs of raising a family. They were originally designed to support families on low incomes. This is not the case now. The government is tightening the eligibility for these payments at the highest end of the income scale. We all acknowledge that a family whose income is around $100,000 is not really in need of support. It is far better to keep support payments for those families whose income is so much lower.


Let me for a moment expand on what this budget has delivered for Gilmore. Before the 2013 election, the coalition and I made over $15 million worth of promises to the people of Gilmore, to be delivered if we were elected. I am proud to say that those commitments have all been confirmed, just nine months into my first term as federal member—and the proof is in this document. There is guaranteed funding of $10 million for the planning, design and engineering studies for the third crossing of the Shoalhaven River in Nowra, which is the economic artery for our region. Everyone in Gilmore knows why our bridge and our roads are important, and the commitment was established after lengthy discussions with the community and the local council.


There is a Gilmore roads safety package involving over $5 million to fix various black spots and substandard roads across our electorate, including $2 million towards stage 2 of Turpentine Road, an important transit road between villages south of Nowra and north of Ulladulla as well as for accessing the very lucrative Canberra holiday market. I can now add that I have achieved an additional allocation of more than $2 million for more black spot funding and $2 million to complete the next stage of Ulladulla's Dunn Lewis Memorial centre. This is a hub for local youth and community initiatives which will eventually increase sports participation, youth training and tourism employment.


There is $450,000 in grants to different councils in Gilmore to install CCTV cameras in trouble spots across the region. When you speak to small business owners who have been the victims of robbery, like Sue from Bomaderry, or an armed hold-up, like Bruce and Shirley in Kiama, or the business owners of East Nowra and Sanctuary Point where antisocial behaviour is getting out of hand, you really appreciate the benefit of CCTV cameras.


There is $450,000 to help complete the next stage of the Jervis Bay 'round the bay' walk, something which, once completed, will be a jewel in the South Coast's already impressive tourism offering. There is $300,000 to begin restoration works on the historical Berry School of Arts, a popular function centre and working building. This funding will help restore the building so that it can more effectively be used by the community and raise funds for maintenance and other local groups. There is $300,000 to go towards local youth recreation facilities in the region. Eventually these funds will be used in the establishment of three separate use facilities. There is $20,000 in equipment grants for our PCYC and the Sanctuary Point Mens Shed. Every single one of these commitments was secured by me from the government after extensive consultation with my community.


In addition to the commitments being approved, I have worked closely with the community to lobby the Commissioner of Taxation, through the Assistant Treasurer, to stop the GST being levied on relocatable homes. I have worked tirelessly with Manildra , the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Industry to help retain this vital local-manufacturing enterprise. It is an iconic industry in Gilmore that supports many local families as well as many farmers throughout the eastern states of Australia.


I have established the need for expanded mobile black-spot coverage. I have spoken at length with the Minister for Communications and related the unusual geography of Gilmore, necessitating the nomination of three separate sites. We have achieved the allocation of four Green Army projects in Gilmore—two in the Shoalhaven, one in Kiama and one in Killalea, part of the Shellharbour City Council area. These initiatives will assist some 40 young people into a work-like environment, creating an asset for the local community, learning valuable skills and developing a work ethic. Under previous schemes in Gilmore, a number of the Green Corps graduates were employed in landscape businesses. Some even set up their own businesses of removal of noxious weeds or bush regeneration.


Having invited the Assistant Minister for Employment to the area, where we showcased our local businesses, not-for-profits and job-search providers, we worked hard with the minister and participated in the task force to establish the revamp of Work for the Dole. We achieved the goal of getting a phase 1 rollout of a Work for the Dole program approved for Gilmore. We already know that Work for the Dole is a proven, effective method to assist young people into the paid workforce. 


In a region where getting a job can be difficult, an essential first step is to get work experience, while these young people will have income support from the government. They will be asked to volunteer in local organisations. In these places they will get the necessary skills and experience that will open doors for paid work. These programs build self-esteem; at the same time they build on the volunteer capacity of our community. The budget is tough, but Gilmore is well placed to make the most of the changes and adapt, as it always does, and invest in their own human capacity to create a strong and sustainable financial future not only for the Gilmore community but also as part of the national effort to fix up our country. 


The government is determined to maintain a financial support structure that will operate for years and decades into the future. A single aged pensioner can still receive up to around $26,000 per year in direct benefits. A single-parent job seeker over 30 can receive up to $28,000 in welfare benefits. A low-income family only able to earn around $30,000 can receive up to $28,000 in help. There is support for those most vulnerable. There is a plan to continue this into the future. There is a vision to empower young people to volunteer their time and energy in return for their welfare. They can build skills and self-confidence, giving them a chance to step up the rungs of the ladder of employment, so they get paid. There are opportunities for apprentices to access financial help, to supplement their wages or other expenses, up to $20,000 over four years. We know that regional expenses are difficult for our apprentices and this will definitely help. In addition, when they are able to earn more than $50,000 they will only have to pay back $16,000.


There are incentives for employers to take on employees over 50 years of age: up to $10,000 over two years. I have received many calls from our more mature job seekers who feel that age has actually been a disadvantage. But now there is a change that will inspire them to re-engage and it will encourage employers to finally give them a chance.


This is a time to rebuild, renew and regenerate. We are all responsible for this massive task, but we are Australians first and foremost—tough, resilient and resourceful. With this budget, we can get our nation back onto its strong, financial foundations and, with the community's support, push Gilmore into new levels of prosperity.

"Matheson, Russell, MP",LP,2014-06-04,"



Mr MATHESON
 (Macarthur) (16:33):  I rise today to speak about the government's 2014 budget and the impact it will have on Macarthur residents now and into the future. It is no surprise that this was a tough budget, one put together by a Treasurer who had the best interests of this country and all of its people in mind. Tough decisions were made, some that may not have been popular. Sometimes a government has no choice but to make unpopular decisions and changes to ensure the economic security and prosperity of a nation. 


Australia is a very lucky country and we have much to be proud of and thankful for. However, there was a time when Australia's bank balance was a lot healthier than it is now, giving the government of the day more opportunities to give financial support to its people. 


Today's government is not in that position. The previous government ran up five record deficits and left $123 billion in future deficits. If we took no action, debt would have hit $667 billion. Every month the government is paying $1 billion in interest costs on Labor's debt. Imagine what this government could do with that interest alone to support families and pensioners in Australia? It is imperative for our future generations that we pay off this debt and fix the mess that the former Labor government left us with. 


The coalition understands that every cent we give to support families and pensioners in Australia comes directly from the pockets of taxpayers. We also understand the importance of supporting those most vulnerable and our pensioners who have worked hard and paid taxes all their lives. But if we want to continue our support for pensioners and families well into the future then we need to make sure our welfare system is sustainable. We need to promote a working culture where people who are able to work or study do so. We need to encourage people off welfare and into employment so that more people are contributing to our wonderful country. A fair and sustainable welfare system is one that encourages everyone who can work to work. Our system will create a more sustainable age pension so we can support older generations for many years to come. Under this budget there will be better targeted payments to those most in need. 


In this budget we have also taken a positive step to build infrastructure for the future, and when it comes to infrastructure some very positive things came out of this budget for the people of Macarthur. In fact this is the first time in six years that Macarthur has even been mentioned in the budget. Under Labor we were neglected for too long. In the budget the Treasurer announced millions of dollars in much-needed infrastructure being spent in Macarthur and Western Sydney. Funding allocated to projects in my electorate in the 2014-15 financial year include: $1.3 billion to the Northern Road, $1 billion for Elizabeth Drive, as well as upgrades to Bringelly Road and Narellan Road. The upgrade of Narellan Road was announced during last year's election campaign. In total the government has contributed $53 million to upgrade Narellan Road to a six-lane divided road to improve traffic flow and road safety. Anything that will result in lower commute times for my constituents and give them more time at home with their families is a great thing. 


As part of this budget Macarthur also has three projects commencing in 2014-15 under the Community Development Grants Fund. These grants include: $500,000 towards artificial grass for Lynwood Park sporting fields, $335,000 for a new heating system for the swimming pool at Mater Dei's special needs school and $200,000 for Narellan Jets field upgrade. 


Campbelltown City Council has also received $350,000 for CCTV cameras as part of the government's Safer Streets program. This is an important investment in the Macarthur region. As a former police officer, I know that the best way to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour is to prevent it occurring in the first place. Local residents and business owners have been concerned by increasing incidence of crime in parts of my electorate. Not only do these visible cameras make potential criminals think twice before doing the wrong thing, but they will also make a valuable contribution in increasing conviction rates by assisting police gather evidence and prosecute offenders. I would like to thank Campbelltown City Council and the Campbelltown police for supporting this initiative. Macarthur is one of the fastest growing regions in New South Wales so I am very pleased to see that this Liberal government is taking my electorate seriously and delivering the infrastructure we need to cope with this population boom. 


As part of this budget we will also make higher education more accessible by expanding support to pathway courses such as diplomas for those who might not yet be ready to do a full degree. Our government will also introduce a new Commonwealth scholarship program to boost equity of access for disadvantaged students. We want to ensure that Australian universities are not left behind by the rapidly improving higher education systems of our neighbours, particularly in the Asian region. To help create more opportunities for Australians to undertake higher education and ensure that Australia is not left behind, we will extend Commonwealth funding to all students in non-university higher education institutions studying bachelor courses, costing $448.9 million over three years. We will create more opportunities for students from low-socioeconomic backgrounds through our new Commonwealth scholarship and equity initiative. We will remove all HELP loan fees which are currently imposed on some students undertaking higher education and vocational education and training. We will maintain the Higher Education Loans Program, HELP, that sees taxpayer support for all students' tuition fees upfront, and we will provide support to all bachelor and diploma students in all higher education institutions and universities, colleges and TAFEs accredited to provide higher qualifications.


At the present time, the taxpayer pays about 60 per cent of the cost of a degree and the student, the graduate, pays about 40 per cent. These changes will move it to about 50-50 and, like everything we do, there is a policy reason for doing this. We want the system to remain sustainable. We want to be able to help students for many years and decades into the future. Essentially, we are going to lend the money to the student at the same rate that the government borrows the money, with a maximum rate of six per cent. This will ensure the system is sustainable. Under this system, if an institution decides to charge additional fees, then 20 per cent of that has to go into a scholarship fund. Professor Ian Young, Vice Chancellor of the ANU and Chair of the Group of Eight, a coalition of Australia's elite universities, spoke about the changes recently. He said that right now, when a student comes to university, they do not pay a cent up-front for their tuition fees. They will not in the future either, so there is no barrier in terms of tuition fees when one goes to university. He went on to say that the barrier for many students is living costs and that is what really hits poor students. He said that in the future we will have a scholarship fund to be able to give those students funds to be able to live, so there is going to be a greater capacity to assist disadvantaged students.


Ultimately we need to make our higher education support system sustainable. We also want to help young people transition to work, and that is why we are introducing the Trade Support Loans for apprentices—to encourage more young people to take up a trade and complete their qualification. From 1 July 2014 the government will offer interest-free loans of up to $20,000 over the life of an apprenticeship. These loans will ease the financial burden and help increase apprenticeship completion rates. Those who complete their apprenticeship will be given a 20 per cent discount, so will only have to pay $16,000 for a $20,000 loan. Like HELP loans for tertiary students, the loans will be repayable once the apprentices are earning a sustainable income.


The government is also honouring its commitments and investing $64.5 billion in government and non-government schools over the next four years. This is $1.2 billion more than the previous government would have spent over the forward estimates. We have met our commitment to provide funding certainty for schools over the next four years from 2014 to 2017. From 2013 to 2018, the total Commonwealth funding to all schools in Australia, as outlined in the budget papers, will have increased by 37 per cent, a $4.6 billion increase. Funding by the Commonwealth from 2018 onwards will continue to grow but it will be based on the consumer price index and enrolment growth. The key issue is where the money should be spent. We believe the key issues are teacher quality, increased school autonomy, a rigorous, up-to-date curriculum and increased parental engagement. Mr Gonski himself acknowledged recently that Australia has not been spending its money on the right priorities. We have also kept our election commitment to invest $243.8 million over four years to revitalise the school chaplaincy program. School chaplaincy supports young people in many local schools across Macarthur. These chaplains provide a safe and supportive influence for students, especially those doing it tough or at risk of dropping out of school. The government will also invest around $28.5 billion in childcare fee assistance for families over the next four years. 


We are also strengthening Medicare to ensure that all Australians can continue to access world-class healthcare services at an affordable price. Ten years ago the Australian government was spending $8 billion on Medicare. Today it is $19 billion and in 10 years time it is projected to be more than $34 billion. The taxpayer currently funds 263 million services per year, which are free to patients under Medicare. Clearly this is unsustainable. There is growing pressure on the health system from an ageing population, the increasing incidence of chronic disease and increases in cost generated by new technologies. We are making our health system more sustainable and investing in medical research. We want to ensure that Australia remains the best and healthiest place in the world to raise a family and care for loved ones. As part of our plan we are asking Australians to make a modest contribution to their healthcare costs through the introduction of a $7 co-payment for visits to the GP. Contrary to Labor's strong opposition to this $7 co-payment in the recent budget, in previous years senior Labor Party leaders championed the introduction of the user-pays system. Labor's contradictory and continuous opposition to these measures outlined in the government's budget runs the risk of directing Australia down the same destructive economic path that the previous Labor government took. Five dollars of the money taken from each patient will be put directly into the world's biggest medical research endowment fund. This fund will find the cures of the future and be funded by the government's health reforms. In my electorate there are many families caring for loved one with a life-threatening disease or illness. The government's hope is that this record investment in medical research will find cures and better treatments for all people suffering with long-term health issues and incurable conditions. By making a modest contribution to our healthcare costs when we visit the GP, we are contributing to a research fund that could find cures for things like cancer, brain tumours, cystic fibrosis, dementia, ovarian cancer, diabetes and many more life-threatening conditions. The contribution will be capped at 10 visits per year for Commonwealth concession card holders and children under 16 to protect more vulnerable patients.


Our population is ageing and we must also make the necessary changes to ensure our age pension system is sustainable and can continue into the future. The fact is that someone who retires today can expect to receive the age pension for about 20 years after retirement. Without policy change, our spending on the age pension is expected to increase by 70 per cent over the next decade. Over the past 100 years there has been little change in the pension eligibility age, yet over the same period the average life expectancy has increased by 65 years, to around 85 years of age. Our plan is to increase the age pension age to 70 by 1 July 2035. This gives Australians time to prepare for these changes. And, despite any scare campaign from those opposite, pensions will still increase under this government: from September 2017, we are indexing pensions to inflation rather than to wages. At the same time, eligibility thresholds will be paused for three years. This will assist with the rising cost of providing the pension, while ensuring that pensions keep up with the cost of living.


We have also introduced measures to help overcome discrimination against older and unemployed Australians, strengthening incentives for them to return to the workforce. The government will introduce a new wage subsidy called Restart to encourage businesses to employ Australians aged 50 and over who have been on income support for at least six months. From July this year, employers who hire an eligible mature-age job seeker on a full-time basis will be paid a subsidy of $10,000 over 24 months. We are expecting 32,000 mature-age job seekers to benefit from this program annually. This is a fantastic thing for people over 50 living in my electorate.


Small- to medium-sized businesses in Macarthur will also benefit from this budget. We remain committed to cutting the company tax rate by 1.5 percentage points from July 2015. For large companies, the reduction will offset the cost of the government's paid parental leave levy. For up to 800,000 small- and medium-sized companies, it will provide a net boost to productivity. We have also introduced young job seeker reforms to help young people lead into employment rather than encouraging them to be on welfare. In order to reach their full potential, we believe young Australians who can work should be earning, learning or participating in Work for the Dole. By going to help young job seekers under the age of 30 to participate in JobSearch, the unemployment services activity is funded by the government for six months before job seekers receive Newstart or Youth Allowance. After six months, job seekers will be required to participate in at least 25 hours per week of Work for the Dole activities and will be eligible to receive income support for six months. However, young people who do not have full capacity to work, who are in education or training or who have a significant disability will all be exempt from these requirements, as will those with parenting responsibilities. 


Making these changes will foster a work culture in this country that we have seen in previous generations. These generations did not rely on welfare, but worked hard for the good of their families and for the good of the country. We need to move away from a welfare culture, where people do not take responsibility for themselves or for their families but rely heavily on government support. I know there are people in my electorate who are unable to work for legitimate reasons and who need support—and those people who legitimately cannot work will receive government support. But those who are able to work or learn will be encouraged to do so under these changes, so that we are all contributing to our economy and to the future of our families. Australia has been considered by many as a lucky country. I am sure that those generations who worked hard to make this the lucky country understand why this government is making these changes. We have made the tough decisions, to make our health, education and welfare systems more sustainable into the future, and to ensure that our children and our grandchildren will still have access to the support of the government for many years to come.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (16:48):  I rise to bring the second reading debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015 and cognate bills to a close, and to thank those members who have made a contribution—including the member for Macarthur, who always makes an excellent contribution. He is a member with plenty of common sense, and he is joined by a lot of those on our side. 


These appropriation bills seek authority from the parliament for expenditure of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2014-2015 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015 concern expenditure planned for the forthcoming income year. The total of appropriations being sought through these three appropriation bills is just under $88.4 billion. I would like to highlight just five proposed appropriations, relating to the delivery of the government's commitments.


Firstly, over $28.3 billion is to be provided to the Department of Defence to support the defence of Australia and its strategic interests. This funding includes funding to deliver the government's election commitment to re-establish the Australian Defence Force Gap Year program. Military service is a noble endeavour, and encouraging young people to get a taste of life in the services once they finish school is an important part of continuing to attract new personnel to our Army, Navy and Air Force—and, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, being the member for Herbert, you would certainly know that. All new recruits at the Army Recruit Training Centre at Kapooka in my Riverina electorate go through that fine establishment for their initial training. So it is also very important to those people in the Riverina electorate.


Secondly, just over $6.1 billion is proposed for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which includes appropriations for international development and a $200 million capital injection to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation.


Thirdly, just under $4.3 billion is to enable the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to manage migration and citizenship, support Australia's humanitarian obligations and manage the stay and departure of all noncitizens. Stopping the boats was one of our top priorities on coming to office, and it is a priority on which we have delivered. It has now been 167 days since we had an illegal boat arrival. In that time the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection has closed nine detention centres. That is saving money. More importantly, it is saving lives.


Fourthly, just under $3.5 billion is proposed for the Department of Communications, including just over $3.2 billion to provide funding to continue to roll out the National Broadband Network. On coming to government we commissioned a strategic review to tell the truth about the state of the NBN. Labor significantly underestimated the cost and complexity of this project and committed to roll-out schedules that were unrealistic and inaccurate. But we are getting on with the job of delivering the NBN as quickly and cost effectively as possible.


On the subject of communications, I recently had the pleasure of welcoming the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, the member for Bradfield, to my electorate to witness, firsthand, the impact of mobile black spots on local communities and the Riverina generally—and specifically around Tumut and Narrandera.


Under Labor, I wrote numerous letters to the then Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy. I do not recall ever actually receiving a response. But under the coalition government, electorates such as mine will benefit from the government's $100 million mobile black-spot program. That is just another example of how the coalition is delivering for rural and regional communities in a way that Labor never did.


Fifthly, just over $1.6 billion is proposed for the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development, including funding for the government's new Bridges Renewal Program and the Roads to Recovery Program. Those are very important. In his budget-in-reply speech the opposition leader, the member for Maribyrnong, talked a lot about the forgotten people but did not once mention rural Australia. The coalition knows the importance of the role rural and regional Australia plays in underpinning the productivity and prosperity of the country. That is where our food comes from. That is where our mineral wealth comes from. That is why we will invest in road and rail infrastructure to help expand the capacity of our regions to grow and thrive. 


We heard Labor talking a lot about our regions just merely surviving. We do not want our regions merely to survive; we want them to thrive. The budget also confirmed funding for the coalition's Safer Streets Program, where proceeds of crime will be directed to fund local crime prevention projects for closed circuit television. This was a key commitment I made to my electorate, and I was able to assure Wagga Wagga residents that the $500,000 promised will be delivered under this budget.


Appropriation Bill (No. 2) would also increase the general drawing rights limit for general purpose financial assistance payments to $5 billion. And the general drawing rights limit for National Partnership payments would increase to $25 billion. 


Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 2013-2014 and Appropriation Bill (No. 6) 2013-2014 are the supplementary additional estimates appropriation bills, and they are seeking authority from the parliament for the additional expenditure of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for this financial year. I would like to highlight two areas relating to the delivery of the government's commitments that are supported by these bills. First, just under $662 million is proposed for the Department of Defence, reflecting several matters. Those include supplementation for Operation Southern Indian Ocean, Defence real estate sales, expenditure brought forward to assist with certain purchases, and supplementation for foreign exchange movements. Second, just over $306 million is proposed for the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development, primarily for off-network roads projects, where milestones have been reached much earlier than anticipated. The total appropriations being sought through these two appropriation bills is just over $1.3 billion.


The member for Denison would have the parliament reject the government's budget. He would have the parliament vote against this package of bills, apparently to send us back to the drawing board. He has called on the crossbenchers and the opposition to support him in what I would call a futile crusade—a try-on. My understanding is that the opposition, to its credit, intend to follow convention and vote for these bills. So, in this place at least, the member for Denison will be engaging in what is merely a tokenistic gesture. However, I think it is worth being clear about  the practical effects of what the member for Denison actually proposes.


Anyone considering the member for Denison's advice would do well to bear in mind that three-quarters of total Australian government expenditure, including the age pension, the disability support pension and the Newstart allowance, is made through special appropriations under distinct legislation, not the appropriation bills before us now. Arrangements by which students repay their Higher Education Contribution Scheme debts are similarly dealt with under stand-alone legislation. Tax changes can also be given effect to through separate legislation. What these appropriation bills do, however, is fund the ongoing business of government. Without the passage of these bills, departments and agencies will not be funded to do things such as process applications for the age pension, the disability support pension and the Newstart allowance. They allow tax returns to be processed and advice to be given by the Australian Taxation Office.


Any members and senators planning on supporting the member for Denison in his bid to make 2014 the first year since 1975 when parliament has refused to give the government of the day money to fund public services should think about what that will mean for their electorate, their state and the Australian people as a whole. Anyone supporting that will have people turning up to their office asking why they would not support the local Centrelink office to stay open, why they did not think the Australian Taxation Office was worth funding and why they cannot get their application for the aged pension, disability support pension or Newstart allowances processed.


This budget sets us on a credible path back to surplus. It is a budget built on tough decisions, not on wishful thinking. If we did not make these tough decisions now, the budget would be in a much worse state, requiring much more stringent measures in the future. The people of Australia would quite rightly ask us in years to come why we did not have the courage to make the tough decisions in 2014. Without a drastic departure from Labor's tax-and-spend approach we would have remained on track to remain in deficit for at least the next decade, leaving us vulnerable to external shocks and ill equipped to cope with the challenges in the future.


The Deputy Prime Minister was asked on 15 May about how the budget was going to deliver for rural and regional communities, which are certainly important to me and to the member for Parkes, who asked the question in question time. The Deputy Prime Minister's response bears thinking about:


The Government's record spend of $50 billion on an infrastructure package covers many regional roads that link to the national transport network.


Beyond this the Government remains committed to delivering the $2.5 billion Roads to Recovery Programme. This programme provides funding straight to local councils in order to improve local roads that the community identifies as priorities.


In addition to this the Government will also provide $565 million to fix dangerous roads under the Black Spots Programme and $300 million for the new Bridges Renewal Programme.


The Government has also committed to funding a $1 billion National Stronger Regions Fund which will help communities construct and improve infrastructure. This will in turn help to support livability and drive economic growth.


Those are very important things. I commend the Deputy Prime Minister, who is the Acting Prime Minister at the moment, given that Tony Abbott is overseas, for his commitment and his strident advocacy for rural and regional Australia, and certainly for supporting the National Stronger Regions Fund because it is so important to get the infrastructure in place to help drive growth.


Our sensible budget, as we heard the member for Macarthur talk about, is in marked contrast with what Labor has to offer—no policies, no alternative and no hope; just more debt and more deficit. When Labor came into office they inherited a $20 billion surplus with no net debt and $45 billion in the bank. I think the member for North Sydney would be a little jealous of Peter Costello, because the Labor debt and deficit after the 1996 election that Peter Costello inherited from the Hawke-Keating era was absolutely nothing when compared to what we inherited.


Between 2008-09 and 2012-13 Labor delivered deficits totalling $191 billion. Labor left additional projected deficits of $123 billion over the next four years, 2013-14 to 2016-17. Over six budgets Labor increased spending by over 50 per cent—$137 billion. You cannot keep maxing out the nation's credit card. It would not be responsible. It is what the Treasurer, Joe Hockey, has called intergenerational theft. It is absolute theft from our future generations. They would then be saddled with it. Our children and grandchildren would have to pay off the legacy left by Labor.


The International Monetary Fund recently found Australia's spending is projected to grow faster than any of the 17 advanced economies it profiled. Labor's waste and mismanagement knew no bounds. There was a cost blowout of at least $29 billion with the NBN. There was simply no cost-benefit analysis ever done. There was the $6 billion to $8 billion—who would know?—blowout cost of overpriced school halls. It was a good project, but hopelessly managed. Although, I should say that perhaps only $8 billion was probably a pretty good achievement by Labor compared to some of the other things that it introduced. The disastrous pink batts program cost $2.8 billion and, sadly, cost four lives, including someone from my electorate. There were $900 stimulus cheques sent to around 27,000 Australians living overseas and, would you believe, 21,000 people who were deceased. What a waste of money.


Treasury projects that without policy change, without doing anything, left unchecked, the budget will be in deficit for the next 10 years, which would mean 16 unbroken years of deficits—the longest stretch of deficits since World War II. Every time we look across—the member for Macarthur, every time you and I look across the chamber, we see the architect of this absolute disaster. It is the member for Lilley: supposedly the world's greatest treasurer, but the member of parliament who left us, who left not only the coalition but also Australia, with such a legacy of shame. Labor presided over the fastest deterioration of our debt position in modern history.


The midyear budget update projects Australia will have $667 billion of debt in 10 years unless policies change—and they have changed. They changed the night the Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, delivered this budget. That is when they changed. That is when, as the member from Macarthur pointed out, the buck stopped. The buck stops with us, but the buck also stops with Australia—it has to. We have to get on with learning or earning; we have to get on with paying back this debt that we inherited and that Australians inherited. Each Australian's share of Australian government debt is currently $13½ thousand. That is bad enough, but unless we take action this will grow by $1,100 per year and reach $24,500 in a decade. This year Labor's debt will cost taxpayers more than $12 billion in interest payments. That is $1 billion per month in interest alone. It is like paying your credit card with another credit card. Australians cannot keep doing that.


We cannot keep affording this huge debt. One billion dollars would build so many hospitals, so many schools—not just in rural and regional Australia but also in the metropolitan cities. With this interest bill alone we could build a world-class teaching hospital in every capital city or finish duplication of the Pacific Highway. How many lives would that save? This year's $12 billion interest debt is equivalent to around half of Australia's defence budget; the government spends around the same amount on aged care. Aged care is one of those areas that is so important, particularly with an ageing population.


In six chaotic years, Labor had two prime ministers, three deputy prime ministers and half-a-dozen small business ministers—and we heard our small business minister give such an evangelical speech before about how we are going to fix up the debt and deficit and how we are going to get Australia working again. We have heard the Prime Minister—the 'infrastructure Prime Minister'—say Australia is now open for business again. Indeed we are. I commend the budget; I commend the appropriation bills. And with that, I commend it to the House.

"Griggs, Natasha, MP",CLP,2014-06-04,"



Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (10:01):  As I was saying last night when debating these appropriation bills, I am delighted that, as part of this year's budget, we are going ahead with our community safety program to spend $300,000 on providing CCTVs in and around Darwin and Palmerston. CCTVs have delivered great benefits where they have been installed. They are invaluable tools in solving and preventing crime. I know that they will be embraced by the Solomon community. We will be enlisting help from the community during the selection process. I am actually in the process now of organising a committee that is made up of police, Neighbourhood Watch and some business groups to identify key hotspots around Darwin and Palmerston.


One really good element of the Safer Streets Program is that we are using money generated from proceeds of crime to tackle crime and the criminals who commit them. Unlike Labor, we deliver on our CCTV rollouts. This is one of a number of things that we have done since we have come to government to assist the Northern Territory Police in doing their job to make the streets of Darwin and Palmerston safer. In February immigration minister Scott Morrison visited Darwin to announce that the Commonwealth would spend $48 million to employ around 100 police officers to oversee the asylum seekers still based in the territory.


During my first term of parliament, back in the bad old days of opposition, I worked hard to achieve the best outcomes for Solomon should we win the 2013 election. When the people of Solomon put their faith in me last year for another term in Canberra I had already secured funding from my colleagues here in Canberra. One of the best promises our new government has made—and this one is close to my heart—is for the hospital for the people of Palmerston. I have lived in Palmerston for over 20 years and now my son, Aaron, and his wife, Amy, are raising their baby daughter, Evie, in Palmerston.


Providing a state-of-the-art hospital in Palmerston is a very personal wish not just for me but for thousands of others around the Top End. The $110 million for a hospital in Palmerston is a firm commitment from the Abbott government that they take very seriously developing north Australia. The Prime Minister said:


These are important, tangible short-term commitments to the people of the north. We want to back that with a strategic vision that will help to make Northern Australia one of the great contributors to the extraordinary economic developments that we see to our north in our region in China, India and elsewhere.


The Joint Select Committee on Northern Australia has travelled extensively throughout north Australia. I am proud to say that there was such overwhelming interest in the public hearings in Darwin that our committee has agreed to come back for a second visit in August to ensure that all Territorians get their voice heard in terms of north Australia.


Another display of the coalition's commitment to deliver for the people of Darwin and Palmerston is the record amount of spending on roads in the Territory. I welcome the coalition's investment in the Territory with the $90 million regional roads productivity package and the $77 million Northern Territory roads package announced in the federal budget. This comes on top of the $70 million already promised by the Abbott government to duplicate Tiger Brennan Drive, which was one of my election promises.


The budget for 2014-15 is part of the government's economic action strategy to invest in productivity enhancing infrastructure which will create jobs, improve safety, reduce travel times and, most importantly, boost economic growth. This is $237 million to improve Territory roads. I worked in opposition and in government to have these important projects funded not just in Solomon but across the entire Northern Territory. The people of Lingiari also deserve increased road funding, even if their member was not effective in his advocacy to get that.


Throughout my time in opposition I had the opportunity to advocate for our local sporting clubs and secure funding for a variety of different projects that will get the children and adults in my electorate out and about and participating in sport. We recognise that local sport is an important aspect of the Top End community. Community sports organisations encourage a healthy and active lifestyle for both children and adults.


The Jingili BMX Club just last weekend tried out their new all-weather track for the first time. The coalition provided $1.5 million worth of funding to ensure this project was finally delivered. Unfortunately, in true Labor style, the money was promised in 2010 but the Labor government did not action it until four weeks out from an election. I look forward to visiting the new track next month when it will be used in competition for the first time. This is fantastic news for Territory BMX riders, who can now ride all year long and host international standard tournaments and not be disadvantaged by the wet season.


Berrimah Riding Club is another great local organisation in my electorate. They will receive around $5,000 to construct a shade structure over their horse wash bays. Not only does this funding benefit Berrimah Riding Club; it also assists other organisations that uses the Robbie Robbins Reserve facility.


The South Darwin Rugby League Football Club will receive $99,000 for much-needed upgrades to Warren Park, where a majority of the Northern Territory junior rugby league games are held on a Saturday morning. Upgrades to the park will include installation of a demountable for officials, roller door upgrades, construction and installation of removable shade structures, plumbing repairs, irrigation upgrades and field lights.


In addition to this, the Palmerston Football Club will receive $8,700 toward construction of new locker rooms for players and the Darwin Table Tennis Association will receive $13,000 for the purchase of 15 internationally certified table tennis tables for competition.


Another key election issue in my electorate centred around the coalition's policy to stop the flow of asylum seeker boats into the Northern Territory. I am so pleased to be able to say we have delivered on that promise. We said before the election that we would stop the boats, and that is exactly what we have done. That is good governance—carrying out promises made before an election. This is what the coalition is all about.


I am delighted in particular that this policy goal has been so quickly achieved. Overflowing detention centres in the electorate of Solomon meant an added burden on our healthcare system, emergency services and other social infrastructure, which I spoke about many times in this House. Those burdens did not please the people of Darwin and Palmerston. Sadly, people were dying trying to get to our country It was our Navy personnel who were tasked with pulling deceased bodies from the water when people-smuggling vessels sank. The only humane thing to do was to stop the boats. It was the only way to be fair both to Australian taxpayers and to desperate asylum seekers fleeing their countries.


Recently, we announced that two of the Darwin detention centres would close down. This is a dividend of the coalition's policy to stop the boats. The Defence Establishment Berrimah and the Darwin Airport Lodge will cease operations this financial year. This will directly affect my constituents, with pressure easing on the Royal Darwin Hospital and other social infrastructure. As I said, this is just one example of how the coalition is mopping up the mess left behind by the Labor Party and it infuriates me that my constituents must now do all the heavy lifting for the Labor Party's laziness and irresponsible actions. The coalition government's budget is addressing the debt and deficit disaster left behind by the Australian Labor Party. This Labor Party's legacy is unsustainable and must not be allowed to continue. To fail to tackle the borrowing of $1 billion every month just to pay the interest is unsustainable.


While the coalition is used to cleaning up Labor's mess, it does not make it any easier. Nor is it fair on the hardworking Australian taxpayers. When the coalition last left office, Australia had a $20 billion surplus and $50 billion in the bank, but over six years Labor squandered this and ran up five record deficits, $123 billion in projected deficits and gross debt heading towards $667 billion. The measures outlined in this year's budget are absolutely necessary so that we can secure Australia's economic future, and the tough decisions we are taking now are necessary to avoid even tougher decisions having to be made in the future.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2014-06-04,"



Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (10:11):  I am pleased to speak on this budget, which begins the important task of repairing the Commonwealth budget and delivering a credible pathway back to surplus. Consider where we were in 2007: we had an unemployment rate of four per cent, no government debt, we had budgets in surplus. When the Labor government left office six years later, they left us with 200,000 more unemployed, gross debt projected to rise to $667 billion, $123 billion in cumulative deficits and the world's biggest carbon tax. This budget is an important step in fixing up that mess.


What we see with repairing the budget is that we have a pathway back to surplus in 2018-19 and budget surpluses to build to well over one per cent of GDP by 2024-25. Rather than the debt of $667 billion, which was projected in 2013-14, in 10 years' time the debt will be $389 billion—almost $300 billion less. This decline in debt is equivalent to $10,100 per Australian. By repairing the budget, Australia will have lower debt and lower interest costs. The interest on government debt is projected to be $16 billion lower in a decade, meaning more money for health, education, roads and support for families and seniors.


There are two parts of the budget that I would really like to focus on. The first is the infrastructure. The budget will create an $11.6 billion Infrastructure Growth Package. This is important to unlock growth, unlock productivity in our economy and to boost the total infrastructure investment by Commonwealth, state and local governments, as well as the private sector, to over $125 billion by the end of this decade—or the equivalent of eight Snowy Mountains schemes.


In my electorate of Boothby, finally we are going to see work commence on South Road. The RAA, the key motoring organisation in South Australia, has long had a vision of a north-south road corridor, going from Darlington in the south to Wingfield in the north and connecting with the Southern Expressway in the south and the Northern Expressway in the north. So we are finally seeing action on South Road at Darlington. This announcement has been welcomed by my constituents who have expressed their appreciation now that this project is finally going ahead. It is great news for local traffic, and it will create jobs, which will help the South Australian economy in the future. As a focal point of the federal budget there was an extra $441 million in funding allocated to South Australia for upgrades to South Road, taking the total federal contribution to almost $1 billion and allowing both the Darlington and Torrens to Torrens upgrades to be constructed simultaneously. I want to pay credit to the Prime Minister and also to the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia, Steven Marshall, who realised, rather than a stand-off between one project and the other, indeed, why not do both.


The upgrades at Darlington are what I have been fighting for on behalf my constituents since 2007. These upgrades have been promised since 2006 by the Labor Party who have failed to deliver. In the last seven years Labor have spruiked for South Road at Sturt Road a tunnel, an underpass, a flyover, an interchange and a widening of South Road. None of these projects have been delivered. In this year's budget we are delivering on our election commitment to build the Darlington interchange by funding 80 per cent of the overall project through our Infrastructure Growth Package. The upgrades will mean free-flowing traffic from the end of the Southern Expressway to Daws Road. In addition, the project contains much needed improvement to the Marion Road and Sturt Road intersection. These infrastructure projects will create much needed opportunities for South Australian contractors and will bring our infrastructure into the 21st century. Adelaide, I think, has had the poorest infrastructure of any mainland capital city, but completion of the north-south road corridor should see that rectified.


The major South Road upgrades at Darlington are scheduled to be finished by 2018. It is planned to construct a lowered road to the west of South Road that will extend the Southern Expressway free-flowing carriageways to a point north of the South Road-Ayliffes Road intersection. Flinders Drive will be extended to connect through to Sturt Road allowing local traffic to Flinders University and the Flinders Medical Centre to be unimpeded. There will be upgrades to the remaining South Road intersections, that is, connection to the Southern Expressway, Flinders Drive, Sturt Road, Ayliffes Road and the entrance to the Tonsley Park. As I said before, the intersection of Marion Road and Sturt Road will be widened, and there is also going to be some work done on South Road through Edwardstown near Castle Plaza to cater for the morning peak-hour traffic. They are looking at an extra northbound lane on South Road. So there will be some widening there. Early works should begin later this year, with heavy roadworks to commence next year. The entire project is to be completed by 2018.


I was very pleased to be with the Prime Minister, the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure, the member for Mayo, and the Premier of South Australia and the transport minister for South Australia, Stephen Mullighan, touring the Traffic Management Centre in Norwood and having a look at what the project at Darlington will look like. It really is one of the key measures for my electorate and a complete delivery of what we committed to at the election. In addition, there is money for Roads to Recovery funding. South Australian councils will receive twice as much funding. I also encourage local councils to apply for funding under the expanded Black Spot program.


The other key measure in the budget that I wanted to talk about was the Medical Research Future Fund. This is a landmark initiative. It really is a nation-building initiative for the 21st century. Before the election we said one of the key things we would do would be to back our strengths. Medical research is one of the strengths, and it is going to be one of the future drivers for the economy. So to have a capital fund building up to $20 billion will allow an income stream in perpetuity for medical research. It is a significant expansion of medical research funding in this country.


In my home state of South Australia the SAHMRI—the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute—is well positioned to capitalise on this. It has been the named 'the cheese grater' or 'the pineapple' and it came about as a result of the Review of health and medical research in South Australia which was conducted by Professor John Shine AO and Mr Alan Young AM, who recommended the establishment of a dedicated flagship research institute for South Australia. South Australia being a small state, we had three different universities all competing against each other; but what we really needed was one flagship research institute. With the new Royal Adelaide Hospital and the University of Adelaide medical school moving to the same precinct, this co-location will build on South Australia's impressive contribution to medical research and innovation.


In his opening speech last November the Prime Minister specifically mentioned the work of two Nobel prizewinners for medicine, Dr Robin Warren and Lord Howard Florey, who are both graduates of the University of Adelaide medical school. He said that Lord Florey was possibly the greatest Australian ever for his contribution in developing penicillin for wider use. He also paid tribute to the work of the previous government and spoke of the importance of medical research.


With the new SAHMRI, South Australia has the potential to develop a biotech precinct in the North Terrace area, in the same way that Parkville in Melbourne is a long established biotech precinct and Brisbane has become one. This is an opportunity to build on our existing strengths—our renowned excellence in research and clinical trials but we need to foster a climate where that can occur. That is why the Medical Research Future Fund is so important. It will see people come to Australia from overseas as a destination of choice to do their postdoctoral research and build their careers in medical research.


The executive director Steve Wesselingh has already assembled an impressive group of individuals. We have seen people return from overseas, like Professor Prash Sanders, working in the area of heart health, and Dr Charles Mullighan, heading up the research theme in cancer. These are people who could have had a research career anywhere in the world but have chosen to return to Adelaide because of the facilities that are on offer. SAHMRI has established seven research themes: Aboriginal health; cancer; healthy mothers; babies and children; heart health; infection and immunity; mind and brain; and nutrition and metabolism. It will be a significant development in the landscape in South Australia but it is important that we have the Medical Research Future Fund to provide certainty for medical research into the future.


SAHMRI is building a team of more than 600 outstanding researchers who are working together in the search for better treatments and cures. It is creating a world-class precinct of medical research and clinical application adjacent to the site of the new Royal Adelaide Hospital. These are just two of the important developments for my electorate in the budget and we need to have the Medical Research Future Fund adequately funded.


It is a landmark initiative. I pay credit to the Minister For Health who has long wanted to make medical research a signature of his time as minister. It really builds on the theme that it has been Liberal governments that have been the great friends of medical research in this country. We well remember all the times the previous Treasurer tried to strip hundreds of millions of dollars from the medical research budget.


The Medical Research Future Fund will build to a level of $20 billion; it will then be the largest medical research fund in the world. It will provide income of over $1 billion and it is important, seeing what Labor did with some of these other future funds, that we have a structure like the Future Fund so the Labor Party cannot raid the capital and spend it.


They are the two initiatives I wanted to speak on. The South Road development will now be underway. I do pay credit to the South Australian government, because they have actually come up with an improved proposal for Darlington. It is improved from what was originally in the Darlington Transport Study, and it will be great news for residents of the south. South Road-Sturt Road has been one of the major bottlenecks and major hold-ups in traffic, so this will be a welcome development by the time it is finished in 2018. Similarly, the Medical Research Future Fund is going to be very important, right across Australia. SAHMRI is a new institution but is well poised to benefit from that fund.

"Markus, Louise, MP",LP,2014-06-04,"



Mrs MARKUS
 (Macquarie) (10:25):  I rise to speak on the budget appropriation bills for 2014-15 and related bills. The federal budget handed down in May recognises that our nation is indeed at a crossroads. It recognises that there are clear, hard choices to be made if we want to get Australia back on track. The test is that after six years of the waste, excessive spending and poor choices made by the former government, our nation has been drowning in a spiral of debt and deficit that is not sustainable. The bills before the parliament today show a clear plan to build a strong and prosperous economy and a safe and secure Australia. Those are not just catchphrases or words, they are a vision for what those on this side of the House see for our future. 


The coalition government is committed to an Australia that is strong, that is prosperous, that is growing and that is providing opportunities for all Australians no matter what age, race, gender or background. Although some tough decisions have been made, these decisions are what will best place our nation to meet the challenges ahead. Like many members of the House, I remember well the fiscal position we had established during the last days of the Howard government. This did not happen by chance or accident. When we left office in 2007 there was $20 billion in surplus and money in the bank, money in the bank to invest in this nation. In an unprecedented six years Labor turned nearly $50 billion in the bank into projected net debt well over $200 billion. This is the fastest deterioration in debt, in dollar terms and as a share of GDP, in modern Australian history.


It is disappointing that I have not heard or seen any evidence of the other side of this House taking responsibility for what they took us to. One figure that astounds me is the fact that, because of Labor's mismanagement, we are now paying more than $1 billion per month in net interest payments. If left unchecked, that would be $2.8 billion a month in 10 years time. That is staggering and shameful. One billion dollars could do so much for the electorate of Macquarie. An additional crossing, for example, over the river which would ease the traffic congestion and challenges faced by many in my community is just one of the many road projects that we could invest in if we did not have to pay that debt. 


Although there have been tough decisions made in this budget, many of the residents I have talked to in Macquarie understand that—just like a household managing a budget—we cannot afford to keep borrowing to pay $1 billion a month in interest. It is like a household paying a mortgage on the credit card. We have a difficult task at hand but the coalition government is up to the challenge. I will focus on some of the reforms within this budget that take us forward as a nation. I will also talk to some of the specific funding and investment, particularly infrastructure, for the electorate of Macquarie and indeed for Greater Western Sydney. 


Within this budget is an historic amount of spending on infrastructure that will get our nation moving. In New South Wales alone there is a record $14.9 billion in funding. Crucial to this electorate is the Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan, which will have a significant impact on Greater Western Sydney, the larger Sydney and, of course, all surrounding regions of Sydney. It includes $2.9 billion for road transport upgrades to service Sydney's second airport to be developed at Badgerys Creek. For the first time in a long time the infrastructure spend on roads will happen before we establish the airport. Building the right road infrastructure to support Badgerys Creek will benefit not just airport users but residents throughout Macquarie, many of whom already travel long distances to get to work. That additional investment will add to the tourism dollar and benefit people movements, particularly in communities in the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury.


The upgrade to the Northern Road-Bringelly Road and the $200 million local roads package will relieve pressure on existing infrastructure and release the economic capacity of the region by easing congestion and helping to create local jobs. By working with the New South Wales government we are delivering an unprecedented amount of funding for the future of New South Wales. We made a commitment to the people of Greater Western Sydney that building roads and vital infrastructure would be of utmost priority, and this budget is proof of that. Greater Western Sydney, including the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury, can no longer afford to be left behind in infrastructure. We are getting on with the job of investing for the future.


I am also pleased that we are working to deliver some key infrastructure for my local area. Within this budget is important funding that has been committed to ensure completion of a number of important projects in the region. There is a package of priority safety upgrades to the Greater Western Highway between Katoomba and Lithgow. We will see the injection of $173.5 million of federal funds over the next four years. I was able to announce this funding last week with the local state member for the Blue Mountains, Roza Sage, and look forward to working with the community and the state member to deliver this as a priority.


There is a $3 million federal contribution to the M4 managed motorway. This includes planning works for a managed motorway system on the M4 from Merrylands to Lapstone in the Lower Blue Mountains. There is a federal contribution of $18 million for the upgrade of the approach routes to the Richmond Bridge and associated intersections in the Hawkesbury. This $18 million will be rolled out over the next three years. The local state member and I are working closely with the New South Wales government to deliver this. This has been fought for over a number of years.


Finally, federal funds of $4.4 million for 2014-15 have been committed for the Springwood town centre revitalisation. These funds will enable the completion of what is a very important project for the local community. The new Springwood Civic Centre and precinct will be valuable community assets for future generations in Springwood and indeed across the mountains.


Within this budget are also some very exciting and worthwhile measures that will assist young people, who are indeed the future of our nation. There are some changes to higher education that will benefit young people, particularly those in my community. I am particularly pleased about the historic Commonwealth support for students studying higher education diplomas, advanced diplomas and associate degree courses as well as those studying bachelor degrees. This is in addition to the announcement that we will establish a Commonwealth scholarship scheme to assist access for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. These measures recognise that higher education is not a one size fits all. We want to ensure that no young person is left behind and that all young people are given the opportunity to study and learn.


We believe all young people should be learning or earning. I was pleased to announced last week that suburbs in Macquarie are part of the first 18 areas to be rolled out under phase 1 of the new Work for the Dole program. This will provide young people with opportunities. This will provide them with incentives. This will provide them with self-esteem-building and confidence-building activities and an opportunity to develop skills. From 1 July 2014, 18- to 30-year-olds in Macquarie who have been unemployed for 12 months or more and receiving Newstart and/or youth allowance will be required to do work for the dole in 2014-15. The government's reinvigorated Work for the Dole program will give all participants a chance to have a go. 


The coalition government firmly believes that all Australians capable of working should be working. They should be earning, learning or engaging in programs like Work for the Dole. Work for the Dole is an important part of our plan to help young job seekers gain skill and experience that they need to move from Welfare to Work, to make a positive contribution to their local community and to also have a sense of their value and worth. It keeps job seekers engaged and active as well as giving them an opportunity to get involved in local initiatives. 


Unlike those opposite, we do not want to see our young people fall into the trap of a lifetime of welfare dependency when they have the capacity to work and/or study. We believe in the potential of the next generation and what they have to offer but we also recognise that sometimes our young people need a bit of encouragement and an incentive to achieve their dreams and their goals. 


I would also like to highlight the key election commitments that this budget delivers for the people of Macquarie. I am thrilled that this budget contains a total of $15 million for the Greater Western Sydney conservation corridor—something that I have been fighting and working towards for about a decade. This includes $7.5 million in direct funding for the acquisition of threatened land in the Cumberland Conservation Corridor. 


This commitment is something that myself, along with the Minister for the Environment, the member for Lindsay, and others are deeply committed to and also excited about. It will be a major boost for the conservation of the area and provide a once-in-a-generation opportunity to establish a conservation corridor which will be preserved for future generations. It is a recognition of the importance of protecting the green areas within and around our cities, particularly in Greater Western Sydney and the conversation value of the Cumberland Plain woodlands. 


The 2014-15 federal budget also included funding under the coalition government's Safer Streets Program where proceeds of crime will be directed to fund local, prime-preventing crime projects, including $150,000 for closed-circuit television cameras for Richmond; $300,000 for closed-circuit television cameras for Blaxland and Wentworth Falls; $30,000 for closed-circuit television cameras for the Hazelbrook pedestrian overpass; and $30,000 for closed-circuit television cameras for Peter Carroll Field in Leura. 


This $510,000 investment to improve security in the local communities is a welcome announcement for small business owners in particular who often bear the brunt of vandalism and theft. I have already met with the local council and have spoken to local police and the various community organisations that will be involved in the rollout of this initiative. I look forward to the end result, which will provide a safer community for all. 


Also relevant to the electorate of Macquarie is $15 million in the 2014-15 federal budget for the creation of a national bushfire mitigation program. This commitment we made at the election is fully funded, ensuring no additional pressure on the budget. This program is a targeted initiative to reduce the impact of bushfires and build a more disaster-resilient Australia. Too many times Australians have witnessed bushfires that devastate Australian communities and business—and in fact for many, who would be aware, we have faced this firsthand in the Blue Mountains most recently but also in the Hawkesbury and a number of regions that are close to our communities. 


The national bushfire mitigation program will see the Commonwealth partner with states and territories to build upon their existing fire management practices and implement strategies to address risks. This program will better equip communities to be able to prevent and, if needed, withstand the impacts and effects of bushfires. 


Through this budget, the Abbott government has reduced the Labor deficits by $43.8 billion through to 2017-18. This budget is about a shift from spending to contributing, and from the short term to the long term. We are working to create a sustainable future for the next generations. 


During my former career as a social worker, I observed all too often the knock-on effects for a family when a person was stuck in a lifestyle of welfare dependency. I also observed that it was often when a Labor government was in power that people would walk through my doors needing assistance and support that should never have walked through those doors. Compassion for those less fortunate and a safety net for the vulnerable are paramount, but what is also paramount is giving people the opportunity to contribute and build.


We are a land of great opportunity but we need to allow people to pursue those opportunities and their own dreams. Repairing the budget is a key part of our economic strategy to build a strong prosperous economy and a safe and secure Australia. There is nothing more relevant to supporting the vulnerable, pensioners, job creation, education, health and infrastructure, than a strong economy. We must ask ourselves: are we prepared to let the budgetary position continue to deteriorate so that we leave a growing mountain of debt to our children, or are we prepared to rein it in now so that we can have a strong and prosperous future? I commend the bill to the House.

"Porter, Christian, MP",LP,2014-06-04,"



Mr PORTER
 (Pearce) (10:40):  Having witnessed for the first time personally, from inside federal parliament, the Commonwealth budget unfold, I must say it is an experience that I will not soon forget. The scale of what occurs and the immediacy of the effects on people's lives, and the long-run effect on all Australians of both action and inaction in a federal budget makes it a task of immense responsibility.


To be personally involved in even the most peripheral or modest way is, again, an experience of some learning. I just want to commence by thanking the Minister for Finance for seeking from me some research on the Smaller and More Rational Government ministerial paper, which I was very happy to conduct and provide. When assessing the quality of any public policy, particularly an economic policy such as a budget, the assessment must logically commence with an assessment of the nature of the problem, if any, that is sought to be solved. It has occurred to me as rather unusual that the debate about what problem might exist occurred in Australia over the period of perhaps six weeks in the lead-up to the budget and in the early stages after the budget's release. It seemed, to me at least, that that was probably a debate and a conversation that could have occurred for at least six months, because in my observation the scale of the problem is significant and its nature is complicated in the detail.


But if you understand the nature of a problem you are at least offered the starting point to assess whether the type of solution being offered is fit for the purpose. If you understand the scale of a problem you have some hope of having revealed to you whether the scale of the response is sufficient, whether it is excessive, or whether it is insufficient. 


In my observation the simplest description of the problem that is now facing Australia economically is that it is a compound problem. The problem is neither debt nor deficit in isolation; it is a very large debt, which will grow if there is no further action, running in parallel with historically large deficits. Perhaps that can be restated at its core as a structural expenditure problem in the Australian public finances.


The figures are well established and they have been put here many times. In 2007, Australia had $50 billion, in effect, in assets in the bank; a $20 billion surplus. That was turned very rapidly into the five largest deficits in Australia's history, at $193 billion cumulative—$123 billion worth of prospective cumulative deficits to 2016-17 if no action were taken; and projected debt, if no action were taken, of $667 billion. It really shows what a massive task was undertaken in the Howard-Costello government to leave Australia's public finances in the state they were in in 2007.


With respect to that problem two views have emerged, in that six-week debate, about the scale and nature of the problem. The first view is simply that this problem—the debt and deficit problem, the structural expenditure problem—is not a problem of immediate significance. I would generously ascribe that as the view that the Labor opposition appears to hold. I will simply, for the sake of brevity, describe that as the defer-the-solution view.


The second view is slightly more extreme—or, maybe, substantially more extreme. It is the view that the idea that a problem exists in Australia's public finances is deliberately confected to allow for a range of policies to be enacted which have an ideological base rather than a pragmatic or practical base in terms of solving an actual or real problem. That is the view that is clearly offered and subscribed to by members of the Palmer United Party. It is clearly the view offered and subscribed to by members of the Greens. There are some academics that have put that view—one particularly from the University of New South Wales, who I will make mention of shortly. Again, generously, I will attribute to Labor a view that there is a problem but that the solution should be deferred because the scale or quantum of the problem is not as it is being portrayed by the government.


The shadow Treasurer on a number of occasions in my observation, particularly in question time, has acknowledged that tough decisions will have to be made, which appears to acknowledge that there is a problem—although what those tough decisions might be or when they might occur is certainly less clear from the opposition.


If I am correct in generously ascribing a view to Labor that they see a problem but would prefer to defer the solution, the very interesting question that arises is: if you think that the problem is not so substantive that the solution should be immediate but rather deferred, why would you promise 500 times in your time in government to produce a surplus? Why should the problem be deferred now but not when you were in government? That is a very significant shift in rhetoric. I think it reveals some difficulties in the policy position of the opposition. 


I might just make a comment about the second view, which is that the problem is entirely confected, that it simply does not exist and has been invented for some scurrilous ideological purpose. Again, there was an academic, who I will talk about shortly, from the University of New South Wales who said, in effect, that the debts and the deficit, not even large-scale or even running in tandem, are not a problem but that productivity is the problem. The difficulty with that analysis is that it completely ignores the link between increased debt and increased interest payments and decreased capital investment on the part of government. Continuing debt and deficit and growing interest payments on debt seriously imperil productivity because they seriously constrain government's ability to invest in capital infrastructure.


That is illustrated by looking at the interest bill that has been spoken of a number of times. There is presently $12 billion of interest a year and $1 billion interest a month. It has been said that that could purchase each and every month a very substantially sized teaching hospital in every capital city in Australia. Over the course of the year, that $12 billion represents something close to half of the total recurrent expenditure of the Defence budget of Australia. Indeed, from my previous experience, it appears almost unfathomable to me that $12 billion a year in interest payments is approaching half the expenditure of the entire state government of Western Australia. So with the interest bill of the Commonwealth in a year you could run half of the entire state of Western Australia. It shows the gargantuan nature of the interest and debt problem that we have at the moment. Again, I think the idea that the problem is confected fundamentally misunderstands the link between the state of the public accounts and growth and productivity in the economy at large.


The idea that the problem is confected relies on a comparison between Australia's debt as a percentage of GDP and other OECD countries. There are several problems with that comparison. It makes immensely problematic a seamless move from the comparison being favourable to the conclusion that no problem exists and nothing needs to be done. There are four problems with the comparison. The first is that the comparison of Commonwealth debt does not take into account an accumulation of federal government debt, state debt and household debt. If you have a look at Commonwealth debt, you are looking at about 13 per cent as a percentage share of GDP. When you combine state and federal debt, that is about a 29 per cent share of GDP. Secondly, the comparison takes no account of Australia's position as a trading economy. I think David Murray said it best when he said that, as a seller of commodities, Australia 'is a price taker whereas we have a high fixed cost in our budget, mostly in welfare, which is now up to 100 per cent of the personal tax take.' In effect, what he is saying is that we cannot afford public debt and we are borrowing to fund recurrent expenditure, particularly transfer payments and welfare payments.


The third problem with the comparison is that it takes no account of the speed with which the debt arose, which is a matter that I will move on to in a moment. Fourthly, having taken no account of the speed with which the debt arose, it takes no account of the spending trajectory that Australia is now placed on unless very serious remedial action is taken. So the comparison of Australia's debt as a percentage of GDP with other OECD nations underestimates the problem. It ignores entirely where the problem will be at in two years, four years or six years time.


I want to look at comments from the Parliamentary Budget Office—in essence, an invention of the opposition designed to be entirely independent of the political process. The head of that organisation has said: 'If you just continued on the trajectory of payments and revenues prior to the budget, net debt is forecast to grow rapidly … at the highest'—growth—'rate in the OECD. … I don’t think that’s a fiction at all.' So you have the fastest deterioration in debt as a percentage of GDP in Australia's history; you have $1 billion in interest payments per month—which could become $2.8 billion in a decade, if nothing is done; you have the PBO noting that debt is growing at the highest rate in the OECD; and you have interest payments which in 2024 could, without remedial action, be $30 billion. That is, interest payments in 2024 could be the size of the defence budget, or the size of the entire current budget of a state such as Western Australia. And that is unfathomable. This seriously constrains the ability of any government who inherits it to invest in infrastructure and improve productivity. Again from Mr Bowen at the PBO: 'It is time to start coming out'—of debt and deficit—'otherwise the longer you leave it, the more exposed you become and the harder it is to wind it back.' That is an observation which I think is pertinent. The longer we delay in fixing the budget, the higher the costs will be.


If we pause here for a moment, before moving to the nature of the problem, and consider one other thing said by David Murray—who I think is an excellent commentator on these matters—which I alluded to earlier. He said, 'we have a high fixed cost in our budget, mostly in welfare, which is now up to 100 per cent of the personal tax take.' So the welfare transfer payments represent 100 per cent of the personal tax take in Australia—every dollar that is taken from individuals in Australia through tax is spent, and then some, on welfare and transfer payments.


The final matter I want to deal with is the accusation in this budget that the burden falls most heavily on those who can least afford it. In a trivial sense, that observation is understandable but, in a profound sense, it is incorrect and false, because it does not comprehend properly the nature of the problem—that is, it is not that we do not tax people enough in Australia; the nature of the problem is that we as a government, in the public accounts, are spending too much money. And largely, it is that we are spending too much money on transfer payments and entitlements.


Let me put it this way: seven per cent of the population earn between $101,000 and $163,000; two per cent of the population earn between $164,000 and $264,000; one per cent—a tiny per cent of the population—earn over $265,000, and—moving backwards—14 per cent earn between $71,000 and $100,000. That is, 24 per cent of the Australian population earn over $71,000. They are paying 66 per cent, or two-thirds, of the tax. When you have the problem we have in Australia at the moment, which is, essentially, that the gulf between our expenditure and our tax take—our revenues—is large, and without remedial action will grow, then you have two essential options open to you in the public finances. One is to extract more revenue from the economy, which is to say, to tax people more; the other is to curtail your expenditure. And the expenditure comes, largely, in entitlements and transfer payments. Another way of looking this is to say that the lowest-earning 20 per cent of the population in Australia receive 40 per cent of all the income transfer payments, or welfare, and—quite properly; which is admirable in the Australian economy—the highest-earning 20 per cent of income earners get three per cent of the income transfers. So, if you accept that the difficulty is in expenditures, it is very hard to take benefits from the top 20 per cent of taxpayers who, in essence, do not receive benefits. That leaves you with only one other option—even a deferred option, which is what the opposition propose—and that is to find further sources of revenue. And I for one think that, whilst this budget has some further sources of revenue, it does go far enough and it should go no further. People are already giving major amounts of their wages to revenue. The problem is not that they do not give enough or that the taxpayers do not give enough; the problem is that we are spending too much.


I might just finish then by saying this: the UNSW academic who I spoke of said: 'No problem. Imagine you were running the University of New South Wales business school, the Australian School of Business, where you had growing revenues and growing student enrolments, but you nevertheless were spending far more than you were earning in the business school, and you had a massive debt and were thereby borrowing to fund that debt. Would you not sit down and have a crisis meeting at the business school?'


I hope the UNSW academic I have discussed is only teaching finance and not actively engaged in the finances of that business school, because Australia is at a point of crisis in the pathological sense of the term: we are at the stage of the disease where things will either get better and we will live, or things will get worse and we will wither.


With this budget, though, there will be significant capital investment: three very major road projects in, or near to, my electorate. I am very thankful for them and for the government's decision to undertake them.

"Scott, Fiona, MP",LP,2014-06-04,"



Ms SCOTT
 (Lindsay) (10:55):  It is wonderful to be here again today in the Federation Chamber to discuss Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015 and related bills. In 2007, when the coalition left office, they left behind $50 billion of gross national savings in the bank. Today we see the wreckage of the previous Labor government as far as the eye can see, and this occurred in six years. After just six years, the legacy that this Labor Party left Australia was 200,000 more unemployed; a gross debt projected to rise to $667 billion; $123 billion in cumulative deficits; and the world's biggest carbon tax.


Labor left the Australian people with a national debt costing a billion dollars a month in interest payments alone. Think of this: in just one month—one month alone—we could expand Mulgoa Road, from Glenmore Park through to the council chambers, to six lanes and still have the best part of $300,000 left over. Can you imagine? It would do so much for all the mums and dads relying on our local infrastructure if we could decongest our local roads. Under the Labor Party the jobless queues grew by 200,000. That is more than the entire population of Penrith.


The Australian public has spoken. So have the people of Lindsay, the electorate I represent, and they demand a government that will get the budget under control, repeal the carbon tax—something the Labor Party is yet to admit needs to happen—and build the roads and infrastructure of the 21st century. The Abbott government is well on its way to achieving this objective. For the most part, the people I represent understand tough decisions must be made. Indeed, during the election, I doorknocked more than 30,000 houses. Overwhelmingly, these hardworking families want to see a government that is fiscally responsible. They want to see a government that will get the budget back under control—a government that will stop the waste and start investing in the infrastructure and the services that our community really needs.


I am pleased to note that this budget will do that and I would like to congratulate the Treasurer on delivering his responsible economic action plan. Following the budget, and this week, I have travelled right across my electorate. My team and I visited every single train station, every morning, to talk to local commuters. We went to the markets. We went festivals. We pounded the pavement. We made sure we listened to as many people in the community as we possibly could before coming back to parliament for this sitting block. I wanted the residents of Lindsay to have an opportunity to speak directly—to talk about their concerns or the things they were really excited about.


What makes me most proud is being the member for Western Sydney. I look at the great legacy that being the member for Western Sydney brings. Some say our nation was built on the sheep's back; the seat of Macarthur, where John Macarthur first had his sheep, is to my south. The early colony also had the five Macquarie towns. We were an agricultural region; we grew through that. In Western Sydney we have a lot of manufacturing. We have grown through that as a nation.


Now we are looking to the next generation. We have just come through the mining boom and we are looking at where we are going to invest further. Western Sydney is the third-largest economy in our country. I am so proud to be part of a government that believes in the people of Western Sydney, a government that is going to invest in the people of Western Sydney, a government that—together with its state colleagues—is going to invest $3.5 billion, over 10 years, in major road and infrastructure projects across Western Sydney. This will ease congestion, slash travel times and create thousands of local jobs.


I have spoken regularly about the challenges my community face in commuting every day to work. Two-thirds of my community have to commute every single day—one-third all the way to the city and one-third to Greater Western Sydney. We need local jobs and we need them now, and we finally have a government that is prepared to take the heavy lifting and make it happen.


This investment will include an additional $1.5 billion plus a concessional loan of up to $2 billion to build the WestConnex motorway—linking Western and south-western Sydney with the city, Sydney Airport and port precincts—and a further $2 billion in concessional loans to get this project delivered faster. There is $2.9 billion from the federal government for the Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan, which will feature $35 million for a road extension, in Jane Street, in my electorate. There is $2.4 million of planning for stage 1 of the Werrington arterial between the M4 and the Great Western Highway at Claremont Meadows, the upgrade of the Northern Road to a minimum of four lanes from Narellan to the M4 and the upgrade of Bringelly Road to a minimum of four lanes from Camden Valley Way to the Northern Road. The contracts are already out to tender, and the project for Bringelly Road will start within the next few months. We will be improving interchanges that connect the Northern Road and the new motorway with arterial roads and there is a $200 million local-roads package that will go to decongesting local roads. This is overwhelmingly positive and fabulous news for Western Sydney. 


Last night I was with the Prime Minister and many community leaders at Rooty Hill RSL. Western Sydney is excited—Western Sydney is ready to go—and it is great to see my area so pumped and charged for what the future will bring. I would like to impress upon the House the value we will get from this investment. It will make a genuine difference to the lives of the people I represent. Speaking of value, I want to highlight the cost—$1.5 billion—to build WestConnex. That is a month and a half of current interest payments we are making paying back on Labor's debt. Imagine how we could better spend the interest payments we are making. Think of the roads we could build. Think of the ports. Think of all the other infrastructure and health precincts we could work towards.


My electorate has been chosen as one of the starting points for Work for the Dole. Last week the Assistant Minister for Employment, the member for Cowper, announced that the Nepean region would be one of 18 areas to benefit from the Abbott government's new Work for the Dole arrangements for young job seekers. In the Nepean Valley, 18- to 30-year-olds who have been unemployed for 12 months or more and who are receiving Newstart or youth allowance would be required to work for the dole. Work for the Dole has been very successful in Lindsay over the years. Many people who enjoy the river-run would know that on the western bank of the Nepean River there is a sign from when the Howard government built the running track on that western path. This is a community asset that our community love and use. We walk our dogs there and we take our families there. We are able to showcase our beautiful Nepean River. The Work for the Dole program under the Howard government also worked on bank regeneration of the Tench Reserve site. This had massive replanting programs and saved the Tench Reserve site's banks from collapsing through erosion.


These are the sorts of projects that we will once again see in our local area. In fact, the work done on this river precinct has been so helpful to the community that now the state government is having to build a $20 million Green Bridge to finish the whole lap, to provide another crossing for the Nepean River. As the Treasurer said on budget night:


…to build a workforce for the future, those who can work, should work.


The benefit of work goes far beyond your weekly pay packet.


Work gives people a sense of self, and work helps to build a sense of community.


That is exactly what we have seen under the Work for the Dole program previously in the Lindsay electorate. This has been welcomed by the community in Lindsay. Work for the Dole is an important part of the government's plan to help young job seekers gain the skills and experience they need to move from welfare to work and make a positive contribution to our local community. It keeps job seekers engaged and active and helps avoid a lifetime of welfare dependency. Indeed, I recall, under the previous programs, so many of these wonderful initiatives.


I would also like to draw to your attention today, Madam Deputy Speaker, to the fact that Lindsay is the fourth youngest electorate. We have a median age of just 34. When we look across our region, supporting our kids in our community is absolutely crucial. I am proud to see that once again we are supporting our kids: providing them with a future, giving them sport to play, giving them interaction and, once again, building the bedrock of our community. We will be seeing under the Hunter fields at Emu Plains at Emu Plains lighting upgrades of $20,000. At Jamison Park we will see $90,000 upgrades to shade cloths and canteens. Andromeda Oval at Cranebrook will see an upgrade of $25,500. Greygums Reserve will have a $60,000 upgrade of turf. Andrews Road Baseball Complex at Cranebrook will have a $26,000 safety fence. Hickeys Park playing surface will receive $45,000.


One of my proudest announcements is $12 million for the Western Sydney Community and Sports Centre. I like to think of this facility as a bit of a Western Sydney institute of sport. In essence, it will be an indoor rugby league field on a timber sprung floor. At this point in time, once it is constructed, it will be the second biggest exhibition space in New South Wales, but once Darling Harbour comes online it will be the third biggest. So it will be Darling Harbour, Homebush and then the Western Sydney Community and Sports Centre. It already has a mass of support right across our community from the Panthers teams through UWS to the Scouts and the PCYC. This will be an amazing facility. We have the disability sports getting online and all the other sports across our region that will get involved with this amazing project. I think, once again, it shows vision. It shows future. It shows believing in the people of Western Sydney—a region which is, as I stated earlier, the third biggest economy in our country.


Being a young community, the Paid Parental Leave scheme will be an amazing initiative for my electorate. Can you imagine being a mum commuting every single day for work? I have had to see friends and constituents of mine put babies into day care or leave them with parents or grandparents at three months of age. Having a fair Paid Parental Leave scheme that supports women getting back into the workforce is crucial. Could you imagine commuting 45 minutes, an hour or an hour and a half every single day away from your young infant children? It is a choice that so many women in my electorate have to make every day, and it is not fair that families have to see this. We are also investing in the safety and security of our regions. We will be seeing $300,000 worth of CCTV coming into my electorate of Lindsay—$200,000 into the main streets of Penrith on High Street and Station Street and another $100,000 into Queen Street, St Marys—once again making our shopping districts safe and making it good for families.


This is what this budget is about: building the regions for the future of Australia. It is about building where the next sheep's back is going to be, where the next mining boom is going to be, where the next manufacturing industry is going to be. And do you know what? It is going to be in Western Sydney. I can say that categorically, with my own bias of Western Sydney. I am so proud of this budget. I am so proud that we finally have a Prime Minister and a Treasurer that believe in the value of Western Sydney. They are not just there milking it. They are not putting out a Lindsay test. They are not just saying, 'Oh, Lindsay! Let's test Lindsay.' They are actually putting their money where their mouth is. That is why this budget is good. This is a budget that is getting the budget under control but investing in our country and the economic sustainability for the future.

Mr TUDGE
 (Aston—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:09):  I rise to speak on these appropriation bills. There are three things I would like to outline in the time I have available. Firstly, I would like to outline the rationale for the budget and what we are hoping to achieve through the decisions that the government has made. Secondly, I would like to address some particular concerns raised in the community. Thirdly, I would like to outline some of the initiatives that specifically impact on my electorate of Aston. Let me start with the budget rationale.


This, as everybody knows, is a tough budget. We acknowledge that. We have had to reduce some expenditure. We have had to initiate a debt levy on high-income earners. We realise that some of these measures are not popular, but the government has done these things for a reason. The reason is that the public finances are in an absolute mess due to the decisions of the former government. We are simply spending beyond our means and this is simply not sustainable. This budget is about restoring our finances because we cannot have a strong, prosperous economy without a strong budget. Let me outline the figures to illustrate how unsustainable the financial position was before this budget.


Firstly, having gone from a $20 billion surplus in 2007, Labor ran up the six biggest budget deficits in Australian political history, totalling $191 billion. Secondly, their forecasts were for a further $123 billion in deficits over the next four years. This meant that the aggregate debt was to grow to $667 billion. That means about $25,000 for every single man, woman and child in this country. The interest alone on our present debt today is about $1 billion a month. That $1 billion represents the cost of a public hospital. So without this interest bill we could build 12 public hospitals this year, but we cannot because we are spending $1 billion per month. We are simply spending way more than we are earning and, as every householder knows, you just cannot do that indefinitely.


The coalition did not create this fiscal mess but we accept the responsibility to fix it. This budget brings the finances back under control. It eliminates almost $300 billion worth of debt. It reduces the deficit by $44 billion over the next four years, which is the budget period. It shows a pathway back to surplus, having reduced the deficit in 2017, the final year of the budget estimates, from $18 billion to $3 billion. There are tough decisions to get to this position. I acknowledge that and I wish we did not have to make those tough decisions, but we would be abrogating our responsibility as a national government if we did not take action now. We were elected to fix up the financial mess left by the former Labor government and we are doing exactly that through this budget.


I want to address some concerns raised in the community. The first one is the allegation that we have made substantial cuts to hospitals and to schools. I would like to clarify that by pointing out exactly what we are doing over the four-year budget period. Firstly, far from making cuts to hospitals, we are increasing hospital expenditure to record levels. Next year we will increase hospital expenditure by nine per cent, the year after by a further nine per cent, the year after that by a further nine per cent and in the final year of the budget four-year period by six per cent. 


Let us look at schools. Again we are increasing school funding to record levels. Next year we will increase school funding by eight per cent, the following year by a further eight per cent, the year after that by a further eight per cent and the year after that by a further six per cent. These are very substantial increases in funding to hospitals and schools, and it is simply wrong for Labor to allege that we have cut funding to hospitals and schools and placing fear in the community and leading people to believe that hospital beds will be closed or there will be fewer teachers next year as a result of this budget. It is simply incorrect; we are increasing funding to hospitals and schools to record levels. 


It is similar in relation to pensions. Let me be very clear: there are no cuts to pensions in this budget. The pension will continue to increase every six months. It increased in March, it will increase further in September. It will increase again the following March and the following September and so on. Every single pension supplement will continue as it has done previously to this point in time. The only two decisions that have been made in relation to the pension are, firstly, to increase the eligibility for the pension to 70 years of age by 2035. In that period of time, nearly every single person who is 70 by 2035 will have been earning superannuation for most of their careers; presently superannuation is accessible at the age of 60. Secondly, the other decision we have made is to ensure that pensions are indexed according to the CPI from 2017. This means that the pension will continue to increase in real terms from 2017 according to the CPI. So we have not cut pensions, as the Labor Party would make you believe. In fact, they will increase every six months, as they have always done; we have just made those two changes that I have mentioned.


In relation to universities, there are some very substantial reforms in this budget. We have deregulated the university system to enable our universities to flourish, to enable them to be world class. This will mean in some cases that some university fees will go up, but in other cases university fees will stay as they are. In further cases they may in fact come down. Importantly though, there will be no upfront fees. Even if fees do go up somewhat, they will still be part of the overall HECS, which means there are no upfront payments and every payment is only made once the person has graduated and is earning more than $50,000 in salary.


In addition to that, there are some very substantial measures that will particularly benefit low-SES students. In particular, for the first time HECS will be available for subdegrees—for associate degrees and for diplomas. HECS will also, for the first time, be available for private higher education providers. The combination of those two measures means there will be an additional 80,000 university opportunities for students across this nation, and predominantly those opportunities will be taken up by families who typically may not have had a university graduate before because sometimes a diploma is a pathway through to going on to a higher degree.


Finally, I want to touch on the Medicare co-payments. The government is asking Australians to pay $7 when they go to a doctor in order to try to make Medicare sustainable. Expenditure on Medicare is growing exponentially, a growth which is simply not sustainable. The Medicare levy covers less than 20 per cent of health costs so that is not necessarily a mechanism to ensure the sustainability of Medicare over all.


The $7 co-payment is similar to the co-payment that Labor introduced for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Labor introduced that co-payment for precisely the reasons that this government is advocating the co-payment for Medicare—that is, to make the system sustainable over the longer term. We want to see it sustainable. We want to see Medicare be a central part of our system.


Importantly, with these co-payment measures there is a safety net which covers about 40 per cent of all Australians. Everybody with a concession card and all children under the age of 16 would only have to pay a maximum of $70 in any one calendar year. Further, a doctor will still have discretion, if a particular individual has financial hardship, to waive that $7 fee. The overall aim is to ensure that there is a proper safety net but that the Medicare system as we know it today is sustainable well into the future.


I will conclude by mentioning some of the measures in the budget which are specifically targeted at my electorate. Firstly, there are some community safety measures which I have announced locally already. These were election commitments which I made, and I am very pleased to see that they are being delivered in my electorate over the course of the 2014-15 financial year. It includes security cameras for three shopping strips, better lighting at Scoresby Village and Alchester Village and some mobile security cameras for Knox police. 


There is also some infrastructure funding to support the upgrade of some of the local community sports facilities. That is important because we want to have as many young people participating in sport or other community activities as possible. If young people are participating in these activities it keeps them busy and it keeps them off the street. Importantly, the large sporting clubs are also places where young people can get mentored by older people. So I think these funds for sporting infrastructure provide a benefit, not just to the people directly using that community infrastructure but to the entire community.


Of course, there was additional funding for the East West Link—a further $1.5 billion, bringing the total federal contribution to $3 billion for the East West Link. That will have enormous benefit for residents of my electorate in Aston to ensure that they can get into the city and across the city more quickly. 


There are a number of other measures that I will continue to fight for, including important roads such as the extension of Police Road to take the pressure off Bergins Road. I am going to continue to fight for improvements to Napoleon Road. I will continue to fight to improve the Boronia Heights Primary School, which is in need of an upgrade. I will continue to support and fight for the upgrade to the Bayswater CFA. Of course, I will never stop fighting for the Rowville rail, which is long overdue.


Let me conclude by saying that, yes, this was a tough budget. I acknowledge that. In an ideal world we would not have to deliver a tough budget. We would not have to make expenditure cuts and we would not have to put in place measures such as the debt levy on high-income earners. But the simple fact is that the budget position was unsustainable. Our nation was expending far more than we were raising in revenues, and that position was unsustainable. You simply cannot continue to spend more than you raise; otherwise you get into a situation like Greece, Spain or Italy. We certainly do not want to go down that path.


So this is a tough budget but it is ultimately necessary for the public finances to be restored to a healthy position. And, overall, it is good for the nation.

"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2014-06-04,"



Mr GRIFFIN
 (Bruce) (11:24):  Many speakers have gone through the aspects of the appropriation bills that have been debated most publicly and I do not intend to focus on them. I particularly want to focus on some issues that relate to the veterans community and particularly to indexation changes that the government has announced will take effect in 2017, after the next election. There is nothing more ex than an ex-minister, although I say that with respect to my colleague the member for Fisher, who I think knows exactly what I mean. In the three years since I left the veterans affairs portfolio I have tended to maintain an interest in issues in that area, but I have also tended to stay out of the public debate—I think that is the best thing to do when you are in my situation. Having said that, time has passed and, when I look at some of the debates in the veterans community in the time I was shadow minister and also minister, there have certainly been some developments in this budget which deserve public comment and some public explanation.


Although this argument goes right across the board in terms of income support payments through the social security system, I will speak particularly in relation to the veterans community. The indexation of benefits in the veterans area has been a vexed issue for many years. It has been a vexed issue because many veterans, given their age and often give the impacts of their service, have become reliant on government support—whether that has been through the service pension, which is basically the same as the age pension, or the disability support pension, which can be accessed at an earlier age by veterans in recognition of the impacts of their service, or income support payments, whether they be compensation payments for disability, which are the various rates of pension provided for those with proven impacts from their service- or war-caused disabilities right up to and including the totally and permanently incapacitated pension, or the special rate pension. Then there have also been the arguments around military superannuation and the indexation methodology employed with respect to some parts of those schemes.


This debate has gone on almost since 1997 when the Howard government, to its credit, put in place the indexation system that linked the growth in pensions to both CPI and male total average weekly earnings, or MTAWE. However, there were some benefit payments within the veterans community that were not covered by that—particularly, disability pensions. There was a debate within the veterans community over a number of years about that. There were adjustments made in 2004 to elements of that as a result of the Clark Review of Veterans' Entitlements, and then there was a debate in the lead-up to the 2007 election on the need for the special rate pension to be indexed. The opposition—at that time I was the shadow minister—came forth with a policy in 2007 that said we would do exactly that, in recognition of the fact that TPIs in particular relied on that money to maintain a reasonable standard of living, and in those circumstances there was an erosion in relative value of their payments occurring over time as result of the difference between CPI indexation and MTAWE. The argument was all about fairness.


In the shadows of the 2007 election the then minister, Minister Billson, put forward legislation to make these changes and, to his credit, he extended them further. I congratulated him at the time. That happened in around September 2007 and it came into effect just after the election of the Rudd government. Labor then initiated the Harmer review of income support payments. That led to a significant initial one-off increase in income support payments, which was expressed as a percentage of male total average weekly earnings. This led to an argument from quite a few people in the veterans community that there should have been further adjustments to the special rate pension and disability pensions to take that issue into account. 


It also, if you like, gave added impetus to the argument by some military superannuants about the indexation for their superannuation pensions particularly those who are on DFRB or DFRDB, which are two of the schemes. The circumstances then on an ongoing basis over the last several years has been an argument around those particular issues: the issue of the Harmer review and the attempts being made by those in the veteran community to seek a catch-up payment to the special rate pension in particular, and the argument around the question of what was described as 'fair indexation' with respect to military superannuation pensions.


The current government when in opposition made commitments around the question of DFRB and DFRDB indexation methodologies. It was described by the then shadow minister, and now the minister, as being all about 'fair indexation'—and these were words which were used by members of the now government, by the now Prime Minister in the lead-up to the last election and since. 


I just want to quote from a publication from the Vietnam Veterans' Federation of Australia, a description of arguments around this bill by the then opposition and the private member's bill which was put forward by the then opposition in the lead-up to the last election. It said:


Indeed, the Bill was called the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Amendment (Fair Indexation) Bill 2010.


In berating the government Senators for not supporting the bill he explained—


that is, the then shadow minister Senator Michael Ronaldson—


'The measures in this Bill will ensure that over 56,000 retired Australian Defence Force personnel who are members of the now closed DFRDB and DFRB schemes have their superannuation pensions indexed more fairly and in a manner which better reflects changes in the costs of living.'


Senator Ronaldson rammed home the point:


'Currently, DFRDB and DFRB superannuation pensions are indexed according to the CPI [cost of living index] only. If the indexation rate had increased in line with the aged pension, in March 2010 military superannuants would have received up to an extra $28.40 per fortnight in their pension.' 



Unfair indeed.




That is the point about the changes the government is proposing now with respect to indexation. Having legislated to meet their election commitment to put in place a fairer indexation system with respect to military superannuan
ts of two schemes—
some 56,000 people
—and
 having, if you like, established and recognised the fact that the existing system for indexation is fairer and better reflects the real cost of living and movements in respect of wages and therefore the actual standards 
that people live by
, 
we now have a situation when almost within days of passing tha
t legislation the government have
 announced that what they intend to do at the first available opportunity—given their commitment not to make changes to the pension this term—post the next election, is
 in
 fact to revert to the CPI with respect to indexation for all other income support and disability pension payments. So within days of recognising the need by implementing their commitment that fair indexation required 
MTAWE
 to be included, they have then moved to remove it from everybody else.



The irony of this with respect to the actual payments we are talking about here is that, for example, in the veterans area there are basically three elements of payments in broad terms that people can qualify for. There are income support payments which are part of the safety net provided, which in this case is the service pension and the invalidity service pension, and the war widow's pension, effectively—although there is an element of compensation associated with that. There are disability pensions which relate to the impact of war caused injuries, the special rate and the disability rate pensions. Then there is superannuation. 


Some veterans would qualify for all three. They would qualify on the basis of injury or wounds for an element of disability pension, if you like, compensation for the effect of service. They would qualify for some element of military superannuation given the nature of the length of time that they were in the service, although, overwhelmingly, those who served at that time did not qualify for military superannuation because of the length of time served. And if their superannuation payment was not large enough—and for most that would be the case because the average payment per annum in these circumstances would be somewhere around $22,000 or $23,000—they would also potentially qualify for a part pension.


The bizarre thing in the circumstances of an individual in that situation now is that the base payment, which is the income support payment, will be indexed at a less fair rate, according to the arguments put by the then shadow minister, Senator Ronaldson, and by many others in the coalition and certainly by me in the context of the discussion around the issue of indexation with the TPI pension back in 2007 and since. It will be less advantageous in respect of the base income support payment. It will be less advantageous for the compensation payment that they receive in recognition of the injuries they have received as a result of their service. But it will be more advantageously and more fairly indexed for the top-up military superannuation payment, which they have every right to receive and have earnt—no question—but which is an additional payment beyond the base payment and the compensation payment.


For example, a TPI who is on the full special rate and who was a military superannuant who will receive this increase is in fact now going to go backwards once those two changes are implemented, because whatever increase occurs that is additional with respect to the movements of MTAWE in respect of military superannuation will in fact be dropped off the special rate payment. And, given the special rate payment is in excess of $32,000—as against a pension of some $22,000 or $23,000-plus on average—because the base rates are bigger what you will see is that the impact of that change will be greater; plus the increase they receive on military supperannuation will be used for consideration with respect to qualifications for income support and for taxation purposes. For most TPIs who are in receipt of a service pension at the full rate it will just be bad news.


The Prime Minister has tried to make it clear in the House that, although we have argued that this is a cut, there will be no cut and the pensions will go up every six months. That is correct, if CPI goes up—and it almost invariably does; although in the last 10-plus years it has tended to go up by a lot less than MTAWE. But he is right: pensions will go up, but they will not go up by anywhere near what they would have gone up by if we see a situation over the years ahead where male total average weekly earnings moves at a different rate, as it has in past times. There have been a number of calculations around this. A lot depends on the actual movements. For example, on Channel 7 Mark Riley estimated that with the service pension, if movements are in line with cost of living rather than current indexation in the years ahead, you will see a difference by 2020 of some $100 a fortnight.


ADSO, the Alliance of Defence Service Organisations and partners, calculated that over the four years to March 2014 the service pension catch-up has been linked to increases in the average wages, resulting in pension payments over that period totalling $2,000 more than they would have been if they had been linked only to increases in the cost of living. The question of what happens will depend on those movements. But, frankly, the circumstances are that MTAWE has been in excess of CPI for, I think, all bar the last movement in almost all of the last 10-plus years. That is going to lead to a situation where veterans are worse off. We are going to see a situation where the cuts are in effect. There will be an erosion in the value of those payments, an erosion from what they would have been, and it is going to hurt. It is going to hit people who have given much for their country. It is going to hit people who are in a situation where they are relying on these payments to have a decent future. In those circumstances, these are concerns which the government needs to address. The Prime Minister says that pensions will be going up. Yes, they will, but they will not be going up by anything like what they would have been, and the effect will be a cut in the value of the payments, a cut in the living standards of the pensioners right across the board. These measures are insidious. It is a mean act. It needs to be opposed.

"Brough, Mal, MP",LP,2014-06-04,"



Mr BROUGH
 (Fisher) (11:39):  This budget sets out some of the problems and some of the solutions to Australia's long-term concerns and how we as a nation should seek to address them. I take you back to the Howard era, when Treasurer Costello introduced the Intergenerational report. This brought to the consciousness of the Australian population the major challenges facing the country as we age and live longer—and that is a good thing. I am all for living longer, as I am sure everybody in this House is, but it does bring with it some real challenges. 


Today, there are approximately 175,000 new entrants into the workforce. That will be made up of a combination of school leavers, university leavers and people coming to Australia as immigrants. But in the not-too-distant future—in fact, in the 2020s; this position will probably peak in 2017, maybe a little earlier—we will start to see a decline in the number of people coming into the workforce, to the point where it drops off to being approximately 10 per cent of the 175,000. 'So what?' you ask. The point is that, with fewer workers coming in and a large number going out the other end and becoming retirees, we end up with fewer workers paying PAYG tax and adding to the social fabric of Australia from a productivity perspective and also a taxation perspective, and more people in the retirement phase, obviously putting huge pressure on all elements of society. So that is, on one side of the equation, a problem; it is a challenge—how we address that. 


But there is another, conflicting issue that comes into this, and that is the impact that we are seeing today—and it will continue to grow—of technology, data, the internet and all things associated with IT. Every person in this House, certainly every member of the parliament and the Senate, and almost every other person will have more computing power in the palm of their hand than sent man to the moon. Let us just reflect on that for a moment. This is in the space of our lifetime. I remember sitting watching man land on the moon in 1969 on the one black-and-white television at my primary school, with the dark velvet curtains pulled back, with some of the adults, and we marvelled at the power that made that possible. But that is less than the power that we all have today.


So what does this mean? It means that the disruption that is going to occur to our way of life, to society and to the jobs that flow from technology is something that every person in Australia, every business, every board and every politician needs to take into account.


Here is some stark reality from the US. Research has been done as to the lengths of recessions—that is, the period of time from when peak employment drops off until it comes back up to that level. From 1948 to 1980, the average time after recessions that it took for employment to get back to the level it was at before was roughly two years—24 months—or a little under.But then it started to deteriorate. After 1981, it took 28 months for the US to come back to the same levels of employment. By 1990, it was 32 months. By the 2001 recession, it had blown out to 47 months—four years. But, since the 2007 recession, the US has still not returned to the same level of employment, some 70-plus months later. In other words, the time it takes for the economy to create enough employment to fill the gaps from the jobs lost is getting longer and longer. 


The reason for that is right before our eyes. As anyone who has walked into an airport of late has realised, you no longer line up to check in with a human being; you do it yourself. Sure, there are still two or three staff there in the terminal, but there are not the banks of human labour lining up to assist us. When you check out at Coles or Woolworths today you have the option of interfacing with another human being to pay or doing it yourself with a computer. We take all of these things in our stride as they are happening, but bit by bit they are eroding jobs. 


Of course, we are seeing the demise of the car industry in Australia, and there are a number of reasons for that—the cost of doing business here, the fact that Australians are not buying Australian cars—but a large component of that is that the automation in the world of automobile manufacturing is extraordinary. We now have cars on the road in San Francisco owned by Google that are driverless. Six years ago they said it was impossible. Why do I raise this? There is a very short time lag between the introduction of experimental machinery and it becoming commercialised. What are the implications of having driverless vehicles? Do we need cab drivers? Do we need delivery drivers? In my son's own industry, mining, Rio Tinto is moving more and more to driverless trucks. This is human beings being put out of business in a way we have never seen before. 


As I said at the outset, we have a conflict. Australia has an ageing population and a shrinking number of people coming into the labour market. On the other side of the equation, technology and the internet are driving change which is shrinking the labour market. Research tells us that 47 per cent of all of the job categories in the world today are under threat as a direct result of these technologies. A lot of tertiary qualified people listening to this today will be sitting there thinking, 'I'm okay.' No, you are not. The reality is that if you are a lawyer or an accountant—or even if you are in the medical professions or you are a pharmacist—your job is under threat. We in government need to start taking this seriously, because these are the issues that are going to confront us in the next 5,10 and 15 years. We need to be careful that we do not leave people behind and create social dysfunction. Look to Europe today and see how many tertiary qualified white-collar workers are out of work.


Another issue that we need to take into account is the shifting of taxation. We have had a bit of a debate in this country about GST on imports of under a thousand dollars. I was the minister who worked on those figures back in the Howard days. Let us have a look at what is happening. There is a company called Oasis run by two women out of the UK. They have no presence in Australia. They are a fashion label. There are no stores in the High Street, but they do sell two jumbo jet loads of women's clothes into Australia every week. They do not pay any tax here; they do not employ anyone here. This is the way of the world. I am not railing against it. I am not a Luddite who says we should stop these things. I am saying that we need to be aware of them. 


Then you look at the Microsofts and the Googles—they have international platforms. Where do they pay their tax? People pay their tax wherever they can pay the least. I do not begrudge them that, but the reality is that, as the tax base is eroded as a result of people being able to make these choices—since they no longer need a physical presence in any particular jurisdiction—it means that the problems of governments worldwide are going to grow deeper. 


Ageing population; fewer people coming into the workforce; computerisation and automation leading to more job losses, meaning fewer PAYG taxpayers; and those whose platforms give them the capacity to influence the direction of the world and who can also influence the world through the amount of tax they pay and where they pay it—these are issues that we in Australia need to address now. It starts with kindergarten. It starts with the fact that we do not have enough students in this country learning science and mathematics and preparing to be part of the world as it is going to be. Sure, we all sit there on our smartphones, as the member opposite is doing right now. What he has at his fingertips at this moment is access to the world—and so do children, and they do this every single day. But what we need them to do is to be more than just consumers; we need them to be part of the innovation that is required. As part of that solution, I am suggesting that Australia now needs to look at how we use the incredible wealth within our superannuation system—not to underwrite it, but to leverage that money innovatively so that Australia can get to the forefront and hold our place in the world and not just be consumers of these technologies. 


These are big problems. I will inform the House, for those who do not know, of some of the other massive challenges just around the corner. Many of you will have heard of 3-D printers, but some will not have. A 3-D printer today can print human organs for use in the body. How much longer will it be before 3-D printers will be in businesses in your suburb and then in your house? Instead of going to the hardware store to get a bit of pipe to repair—where you need a supply chain, logistics and transportation—what you do is download a 3-D blueprint off the internet for 20c, you put it into your 3-D printer and you print it out. This is not science fiction; this is science fact that is here today. If we as legislators, as governments, as oppositions, as leaders in our communities are not aware of what is coming then we are going to condemn the next generation to be preparing for jobs which do not exist. It is going to affect the education sector, it will affect the hospitality sector and the mining sector. In fact, every single section of our society will be impacted and sooner than we think.


In the area of IT it has been said that people overestimate the impact of IT in the short term and underestimate it in the long term. The problem is that the long term is becoming shorter and shorter. Today the information we hold an our hand is superseded every six months. The amount of technology and the amount of change that we all see and we can reflect on in the last 40 years will be quadrupled in the next 10 years. All of these things are real issues that need to be exercising the minds of our nation's leaders and our boards of directors today. No longer can we rely upon our geographical isolation. No longer can we use glib phrases such as 'the Asian century'. Our locality and our close proximity will not necessarily be what saves us.


Recently I was talking to a company that set up here in Australia and they were looking at where they would have their distribution centre to distribute the product in Australia—whether it be in Sydney or Melbourne. When they did their analysis they found it was actually cheaper to remain with the distribution centre in Texas USA and bring the product to Australia from there. What does this say about some of the structural issues that face us? They are enormous.


There was a departmental staffer in the House who I ran into recently. Her son has big feet and he had to play basketball. So he went down to the local store to get himself a pair of basketball shoes and he couldn't find any. In desperation he got on the internet. He found what he was looking for from the US on Friday night. His shoes were delivered to his door on Monday morning. Monday morning! If you had managed to find a shop to order them, they would have taken three or four weeks. He managed to get them at about half the price and within three days. People say it is like the Industrial Revolution again. No, it is not. The reality is that if someone comes up with a new invention today in any part of the world it can be in the rest of the world the next day. So the impacts that we are finding are fast and they are furious.


Let me take you to an icon of Australia—Australia Post. Right now it is struggling. Its mail peaked in 2008 and since then it is sending a billion items of surface mail fewer a year. Why? Because of the impact of the internet. So this part of the fabric of Australian society which has underpinned so many communities is now under threat as a direct result of these changes to the way in which we do business and because of technology. There is no point sticking our heads in the sand and saying: 'That's no good. We need to prop them up.' That is what fools do. We need to embrace the change and we need to see what we can use those existing structures and that existing human capital for. And when we do and when we find new methods and new ways of using that base, it will be government services. Those government services today are delivered by other agencies. So no matter which way you cut it, slice it or dice it, there will be further reductions in the need for human capital.


Today as we reflect on the 2014 budget and some of the issues that are confronting us as a nation regarding an ageing population and the fact that health care is doubling every 10 years, and that someone has to pay it, we need to turn our minds to how we prepare for the changes that no government can stop. No government is going to stop the march of technology, the interference of the internet and of robotics. It is coming to a town and a society and a job near you. What we need to do is open our eyes to both the opportunities and the challenges, and across the divide of this parliament recognise that there are things bigger than our political ideologies which are going to drive the future of our nation and our world. We can decide to be part of it and embrace it or we can ignore it at our peril. I plead with this parliament, as parliamentarians, to educate yourselves to these changes and to be part of finding the solutions for the next generation.

Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume) (11:54):  I would like to start with a quote from a speech. It says:


… it is not popular to take entitlements away from millions of voters …


…   …   …


Most undemocratic nations are … unable to afford the largesse of universal entitlement systems. So, ultimately the fiscal impact … must be brought to account no matter what the political values of the government are or how popular a spending program may be.


…   …   …


… The Age of Entitlement is over.


Are these the words of a modern-day prophet? Speaking to the Institute of Economic Affairs in London in April 2012, Joe Hockey, now the Treasurer, was laying it on a plate. That was two years ago. Now all we hear from Labor and the crossbenchers is that they have had no warnings: it is all about broken promises and no time to prepare. What a load of rot. There it was laid out on a platter 24 months ago. That is when we started explaining it to Australia. On May 13 this year, we carved it up into bite-sized chunks, and we are still hearing that it is too tough to swallow.


I rise today to support this series of appropriation bills because they will start us on the path to saving a great economy. We laid out the problem well in advance of action. We have cut it up into bite-sized pieces for easier consumption. We understand there is a period of rumination, even of spitting some bits out. But, at the end of the day, it is crucial these bills make it through. I do not often play travel agent or tour guide, but if we do not get this budget passed, in complete or near-complete form, we are all going to Europe together—and not for a holiday.


Let's look a bit closer at the ruin that is rife in the European Union, Japan and the US. It always starts with private debt, particularly household debt, which then becomes public and government debt when the economy hits the ropes. There is a lot of talk about what is really going on with Australia's finances at the moment, so I want to lay the facts on the table in a pretty impartial way. It is true that we do not have the highest level of government debt in the Western world yet; in fact, we are still some way away from it. But we do have the one of the highest levels of household debt in the Western world through mortgages and credit cards. Private household debt in Australia—excuse the pun—is through the roof. Few other countries, except for Ireland, come close. This is why you hear that so many people my age, living in my electorate of Hume, are scared about their mortgages. They are worried about losing their jobs, about interest rates going up and about the cost of living going up. I hear this every day.


We are now layering mountains of government debt on top of our private debt. We have $1.84 trillion of household debt. These are such big numbers they are almost meaningless. That is bigger than the whole economy itself. It is equal to $80,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia. The interest bill is over $100 billion per year. But if we do not intervene now, within four years our public debt, on top of this private household debt, will reach $667 billion—around $50,000 per household. It is a mountain of red ink that is getting higher and higher. It is growing very, very fast. In fact, we know that Australia's public debt is rising the fastest of any country in the OECD. For us to stand by and not act on it would be incredibly irresponsible.


To see how this might play out in practice, let's look at some other countries. There is no shortage of sobering examples. During the eighties and nineties, Japan had private debt levels equal to the size of their economy—a little less than we have in Australia today. This fuelled a property boom, which many of us remember, and it was not a problem so long as property prices stayed high. But in the early to mid-nineties, the Japanese property sector collapsed and the private debt—the household debt—was transferred over to the government.


Let us put this in perspective. Before the property price collapse in Japan, government debt was equal to less than half of the economy. But, as the economy hit the ropes, the government had to step in to prevent systemic failure, and government debt increased threefold relative to the size of the economy. The following two decades have created immeasurable pain for the Japanese economy. 


We see similar patterns in the United States. By 2007 US household debt had reached about 130 per cent of disposable income. Meanwhile, savings rates had collapsed. When the financial crisis hit, federal government debt was around 45 per cent of GDP, but, again, the government had to step in to take on that household debt, and government debt moved rapidly north, towards 100 per cent of the economy.


We can debate whether these countries got the policy settings right on their day of reckoning. But what is clear is that high private debt, high household debt, is easily and often transferred over to the government. The best antidote is to run government surpluses when we can and to support strong economic growth, investment and employment. That will ensure that my constituents with mortgages and with large credit card debts are in the best possible position to survive tough times. Having high government debts and deficits when there is a towering household debt is like taking the shock absorbers out of your car. When you hit a bump in the road you need shock absorbers; and when the government already has too much debt there is absolutely nowhere to go. 


None of this is to say that I am pessimistic about the economy. In fact, given the emphasis in the budget on investment in productive infrastructure, workforce participation, research and education, there is good reason to be optimistic. Indeed, driving growth through participation, investment in infrastructure and so on is exactly the response to the situation. In this circumstance strong growth in employment is critical and it is what we are focused on. 


Every Australian with a mortgage knows the danger of losing your job. That is why this budget is enabling long-term growth rates in employment, with a shift from consumption to investment. In contrast, continuing to run up government debt in the face of this towering mountain would be totally irresponsible. Everyone in my electorate with a loan should be screaming at Labor and the crossbenchers to play their part in sorting this out. We cannot take the risk of continuing down this path. 


There is a another side to this. For decades, resource economists have studied the economic implications of a big surge in commodity investments and exports, exactly as we are experiencing today and have been experiencing for a number of years. Ironically, much of the best economic research has been done here in Australia, but the last government ignored it. The conclusions of this research are very clear and totally aligned with this budget. First, it is absolutely critical to drive productivity with investments in participation in the workforce, infrastructure and innovation. This takes pressure off the non-resource parts of the economy. In the absence of these initiatives, we see the scorching of non-resource parts of the economy, often referred to as a Dutch disease. We saw no shortage of Dutch disease in the economy over the last six years, as our tradeable sectors like agriculture, education, tourism and even resources itself struggled with a huge loss of competitiveness driven by an unduly high exchange rate. In my electorate of Hume, we saw a range of businesses—farmers, engineers and others—suffering from this disastrous situation.


As well as driving productivity, governments need to run surpluses, and, wherever possible, push those savings offshore into their own sovereign wealth funds. Of course, when you have hundreds of billions of dollars of debt and deficits of $50 billion a year, government saving is only a dream. But reducing our deficit is what we need to do, and it is exactly what we are doing.


Let us put this reduction in the deficit that we are now undertaking into perspective. Roughly $10 billion a year in deficit reduction is planned through the budget forward estimates period and the year beyond. That equates to about 0.6 per cent of GDP. Most economists will tell you that the private sector will absorb a good portion of that loss. So the reduction in economic activity that we are talking about here is pretty minimal and pretty manageable, given the starting point.


The good news with all of this is that—people often forget—when you cut government spending, a series of benefits flow. Most importantly, cutting deficits helps to contain interest rates. Interest rates worldwide are very low, and Australia's are far higher than everyone else's by two or three percentage points. But by containing interest rates, we take pressure off those with mortgages—the ones raising kids, buying houses and so on. The low global interest rates will not stay with us forever. As they climb, the risk is that ours will climb with them. The stakes are very high, but reduced deficits give the Reserve Bank the opportunity to contain interest rates. Everyone with a mortgage should be thankful that this government is working to live within its means. On top of taking pressure off interest rates, running government surpluses—or reducing the deficit—also takes pressure off the exchange rate, helping our farmers and other exporters. We absolutely have to do this.


The final reason why we have to act on the deficit is because we cannot leave huge debts for the next generation. There is one fundamental difference between government debt and private debt—and that is, you cannot leave private debt to your kids, but you can leave government debt to your kids. That creates an enormous temptation for bad governments. That is what has happened in Europe, that is what is happening in the US and, in the absence of our intervention, that is exactly what will happen here in Australia. The need to act is very clear now, and the benefits from immediate action are enormous—for mortgage holders, for exporters, and for the next generation.


Deputy Speaker, you remember the excitement—the travel brochures out on the coffee table, the suitcase flung open. Going to Europe was something to look forward to. We do not want to go to Europe now—in Greece, Portugal and Spain the debts are, arguably, unpayable. In Spain, the 18- to 35-year-olds are facing a 40 per cent unemployment rate or more. The debts owing in Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Belgium, Spain and Italy have seen the near collapse of the eurozone—and it all started with too much private debt. Australia has a huge private debt. We do not want to go to Europe. The appropriation bills before the House are the start of a different kind of journey for Australia: a journey of recovery. This is the trip we really want to be taking. I commend this bill to the House.

"Alexander, John, MP",LP,2014-06-04,"



Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (12:07):  I rise to speak on this appropriation bill and the related bills before the House. One thing that dismays me about the operation of this parliament is the propensity of those opposite to willingly and knowingly make mischief with the facts, when faced with the serious task of fixing our nation's economy. Our opponents have spent the past three weeks promoting misinformation and building contrary views to undermine what desperately needs to be done to get the budget back on track and to fix the debt and deficit disaster that they left behind.


This government is tasked with confronting the facts of our national debt and our budgetary situation. If no action is taken, Australian taxpayers are facing a gross debt projected to blow out to $667 billion within the next decade. We are currently burdened by $1 billion per month in interest on this debt—that is, one thousand million dollars every month—just to service the interest on our debt. The Treasurer has stated that 70 per cent of this money goes to people overseas. As a taxpayer, as a father, as a former business owner, as a mortgage holder and as a representative for the people of Bennelong, I cannot sit idly by and support this disastrous situation. What makes matters worse is that, should we not act—which is what those opposite want—our interest repayments could balloon to $3 billion each and every month. It would represent an absolute mockery of our responsibility to the Australian people if we, the elected government, did not take decisive action. We would be negligent in our duties if we left this kind of debt and deficit mess behind for our children's generation to clean up. And yet, incredibly, those opposite seem unconvinced of the need for action. Instead, they sit on their hands and accuse us of overdramatising our nation's economic situation. So I put it to the opposition: at what point should we start to get nervous?—when the monthly interest on our debt is $2 billion? Or $4 billion? For how long can we afford to be complacent?


What became abundantly clear to Australian taxpayers over the past six years is that the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments set this country on an unsustainable path, which continues to threaten our future prosperity. Yet again, just as in 1996, we, the coalition, have been elected to fix the economy and clean up Labor's mess. It is a cornerstone of adult economic management that we must live within our means. This budget is a mature response to Australia's economic outlook. It proposes reasonable savings and asks all Australians to make a small contribution towards our future prosperity. 


To those opposite who seek to distract the Australian people from the real issues facing the nation, I refer them to the words of ABC journalist Jonathon Green, on 22 May:


It might suit the sugary, elevated pulse of social media to deduce political and budgetary incompetence from the momentary dipping of an eyelid, but on quiet, sober reflection it hardly seems a compelling argument.


A relationship of trust between government and the Australian people is central to good governance. Six years of Labor's mismanagement has strained this relationship, but we are committed to it. Yet, as in any relationship, the government's trusted bond with the Australian people is vulnerable to gossip and untruths. So allow me to present the facts, the truth. 


The previous government created economic peril during their six years in office, smearing dirt on Australia's international image and tarnishing our reputation aboard. Their actions in government communicated a clear message to our trading partners and investors: that for the first time in our history Australia was considered a nation of sovereign risk. Labor sought to savage the economic potential of the mining boom by introducing a tax that threatened to curtail investment. They compromised relations with valued trading partners over restrictions to live exports, which hurt farmers at home and offended our Indonesian neighbours. Their failure to honour the recommendations of the independent PBAC for listings of new medicines sent shockwaves overseas.


Unlike our predecessors, the Abbott government seeks to rebuild trust, at home and abroad. We have made it very clear since coming to office that Australia is once again open for business. But to remain a country worth investing in, we must make changes. We cannot live off the credit card and pay interest on further borrowings. It is time for us to live within our means so that our children can enjoy the prosperity that is earned, not a lifestyle that is paid for on the credit card.


In the lead-up to last year's election, this government made four great promises: stop the boats, pay back the debt, scrap the carbon tax and build the roads of the 21st century. In the cut and thrust of daily conversation and endless questioning, it is easy to lose sight of these core promises. Those opposite have fuelled speculation that we have somehow been untrue to our word in areas like education, health and pensions. Yet the level of misinformation being circulated is astounding and, honestly, the Australian people deserve better; they deserve honesty. They deserve to know that the coalition government is taking funding for schools to record highs. 


We are investing more than the previous government would have spent over the forward estimates to ensure schools in all states and territories receive extra funding. In the tertiary education sector we will release the potential of universities across the country and create a dynamic industry. We are asking students to contribute 50-50 towards the cost of their degrees, recognising that the median student will earn substantially more than their contemporaries without  degrees. We are asking students to pay their fair share, only half.


To cry foul on this is a blatant misrepresentation of the facts. What could be more fair than the government offering all students a loan to cover their higher-education costs, and then asking the student to pay back just half of that loan if and when they start earning a decent salary and therefore have the capacity to do so? The other half will be paid by the taxpayer. This is truly a universal system, enabling people from all backgrounds to access a higher education and the potential financial rewards that result. Also in the interests of access and equity, we are extending Commonwealth support to an additional 80,000 students enrolled in any registered higher education institution including, for the first time, TAFEs all around the country.


The Australian people also deserve to know the truth about health. In this budget, annual hospital funding increases over the next four years. Labor made radical promises to skyrocket health funding outside the forward estimates. The fact is that this promise was never sensible nor affordable; it was a fantasy concocted by an irresponsible government that never expected to deliver it. They also promised to build the Epping to Parramatta rail link in my electorate, and that did not happen either. In contrast, this government is in the business of making sensible, sustainable commitments to the Australian people, like our commitment to raise $20 billion for a medical research endowment, which will provide incentive for pioneering developments in scientific discovery and generate further investment. The introduction of a $7 Medicare co-payment is a fair and equitable measure, designed to ensure the sustainability of our healthcare system, while guaranteeing that detailed protections remain in place to support the chronically ill and those most vulnerable members of our community. The system also gives the doctor the discretion not to charge the co-payment if they choose to do so. Just as some doctors now bulk-bill, whilst many others charge around $80 for a consultation, so will the market ensure a strong level of access for all under the new system.


Finally, the Australian people deserve to know the truth about pensions. Under this government, the pension will continue to increase twice each year to keep up with the cost of living. Recognising this commitment, it is also crucial to recognise that Australians are living longer and healthier lives. We must turn our attention to the challenges this will impose on our economy in the years and decades ahead. To cope with the prospect of an ageing population, reforms were announced in this budget to ensure the age pension system is sustainable and able to meet future demand, continuing to provide for those in need. Without policy reform, the cost of the age pension is projected to increase by 70 per cent over the next decade, up to $68 billion a year. Like other governments around the world and the previous Labor government, we will also raise the pension age so that we can sustain the increased demand for pension support for the years to come. When the pension was brought in the average male life expectancy was 63. Now it is over 80. The system must evolve and keep pace with society. Like all Australians, aged pensioners will be better off under the Abbott coalition government after the carbon tax is scrapped because they will keep their energy supplement and save considerably on their costs of living.


I have received a variety of correspondence from Bennelong constituents since the release of the budget. Much of this I have responded to personally through direct phone calls, and, with very few exceptions, people have been very reasonable and understanding of the need for the government to take bold steps to get our budget back on track. While some sections of society have been whipped into a frenzy by those opposite based on blatant misinformation, the vast majority of constituents I have spoken to recognise that we have become complacent and overly dependent in an age of entitlement. It is simply unsustainable to have a situation where the majority of Australians receive some kind of welfare payment. I fully support the notion and understand the need for a social safety net. During my previous career I saw many instances overseas of widespread abject poverty that our nation's safety net protects us from. However, it is necessary for us to ensure that people who have the potential to become productive members of society do not become dependent on welfare, spiralling into the possibility of cross-generational dependency.


Our well-intentioned safety net has increasingly become a cargo net. Australian taxpayers should not be investing in a system that carries those who have the capacity to contribute. It is time for all Australians to reflect on our privileged status as the lucky country and to ask a very important question: how can we sustain the lifestyle we are so accustomed to for generations to come? We owe it to our children, and future proud Australians, to share the heavy lifting. Weaning ourselves off dependency is a difficult but necessary process. This government is up to the task and accepts the need for sensible, sustainable economic growth. We ask the Australian people to join us in our commitment to ensure the future prosperity of this great country is prosperity earned. We ask those opposite to do what they know is right for the long-term strength of this nation, not for short-term political point scoring. This budget reinstates Australia's values of the opportunity to earn a good living, not to be handed one.

"Frydenberg, Josh, MP",LP,2014-06-04,"



Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (12:20):  It is a pleasure to follow my good friend the member for Bennelong in speaking on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015. If we look at the debate in Australia at the moment and in recent weeks, it has been preoccupied with attacks on both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, their wives and their children, a wink here and a cigar there, and a harmless dance or a harmless song. These things have been blown completely out of proportion and have become the centre of debate, when really the media should have treated them for what they were and left them on the margins. In the days after the budget, we should have been debating its key themes and messages—what this budget is all about. It is about setting up Australia for a more prosperous future where our children and our grandchildren will be better off.


To me, there are two key themes in this budget. The first theme is about paying back Labor's debt and the second theme is about putting in place measures and initiatives that boost Australia's economic growth, productivity and, most importantly, jobs. 


Let us take this first issue of paying back Labor's debt. Treasury's numbers are instructive: under this budget, over the next 10 years, nearly $300 billion of Labor's debt will be repaid and nearly $16 billion a year in interest will be saved. We have to put Labor's $667 billion worth of debt and record deficits, the biggest this country has ever seen, in context. When we left office at the end of 2007, there was zero government debt, there was a $20 billion surplus and $50 billion in the bank, real wages had increased by more than 20 per cent and millions of new jobs had been created. That was the proud fiscal legacy of John Howard, Peter Costello and their entire government. Labor were bequeathed this golden fiscal legacy but destroyed it in a matter of years. As a result, we had to introduce a series of tough measures in this budget which will see nearly $300 billion repaid. Right now, as the member for Bendigo and the member for Longman, who are in the chamber, know, Labor's interest bill that they left us is $1 billion a month. That pays for Gonski. That pays for the NDIS. That is an East West Link or a WestConnex project. That is just the interest bill on Labor's debt. So that is the first job of this budget—to pay back Labor's debt.


The second element of this budget is to boost economic growth, jobs and productivity. We have done that in three ways in this budget. The first measure is a record investment in infrastructure, particularly roads—$50 billion of the Commonwealth's money, including $5 billion which will incentivise the states to recycle their own infrastructure, to sell it, to upgrade it and to ensure that they have the best infrastructure available for their constituents. In total, $125 billion worth of infrastructure will be kick-started by measures in this budget, creating tens of thousands of jobs right around the country. 


The second measure in this budget designed to boost economic growth, productivity and jobs is a record investment in education, innovation and research, with a $20 billion medical research future fund, which will be the envy of the world—and the member for Bendigo knows it will be appreciated by her constituents. We understand that Australia has a natural strength in medical research and I know that in Victoria, my home state and the member for Bendigo's home state, we have great research institutions like the Burnett institute and the Walter and Eliza Hall institute—and there are many in New South Wales too. These will be the direct beneficiaries of the $20 billion medical research future fund. For the first time, in this budget we are giving Commonwealth support to people who go to TAFE or take a sub-bachelor degree or a diploma, and we are giving up to $20,000 in a HECS-type of loan to apprentices. We say to the constituents of Australia that if the Commonwealth is prepared to support people who go to university, it should also be prepared to support people who undertake an apprenticeship. Twenty per cent of that amount will not have to be repaid if they complete their apprenticeship. We are boosting support for people who take up sub-bachelor degrees and diplomas and go to TAFE, we are giving greater support to people who undertake apprenticeships and we are investing in world-leading medical research.


The third element of productivity and jobs growth in this budget relates to the efforts we have under way to boost workforce participation for the under-30s, the over-50s and women. Those who are under 30 and have the capacity to work should not be on welfare—they should be earning or learning. For the over-50s who have been on welfare for more than six months, we will give an incentive to employers of up to $10,000 to take these people on board and give them a job where they become net contributors to our society. For women, we have an appropriate and far-sighted paid parental leave scheme which will take the place of Labor's mickey mouse paid parental leave scheme, which will hopefully keep many more women in the workforce after they have had children. 


They are the two main aims of this budget—paying back Labor's debt and boosting productivity growth and jobs. If you read the Commission of Audit, if you listen to the International Monetary Fund or you listen to the independent Parliamentary Budget Office, you will know that business as usual is not an option. Australia cannot continue on its current trajectory of spend, spend, spend instead of save, save, save. That is why we have these measures in this budget. I want to quote to you the National Commission of Audit, because its diagnosis was alarming. It found:


The fiscal situation is far weaker than it should be and the long-term outlook is ominous due to an unsustainable increase in expenditure commitment.


This problem of expenditure commitments is being compounded by the fact that we have an ageing population. Today, the number of people who are working for every retired Australian is five; by 2050 it will have fallen to just 2.7 people who are working for every one retired Australian. That is what compels us to take action today.


I want to go through the five most discussed elements in this budget, to answer the claims of those opposite and to say why we need these changes. Take, for example, the Medicare co-payments. 



A division having been called in the House of Representatives—





Proceedings suspended from

Mr FRYDENBERG:
  As I was saying, if we look at five of the most controversial or discussed and debated aspects of this budget—the Medicare co-payments, pensions, university deregulation, school and hospital funding—and some of the other areas, you could have thought, by the hue and cry from the Labor Party, that we have taken away the safety net altogether. Far from it. If you look at the Medicare co-payments, Australia is following down the path of European countries, Scandinavian countries, New Zealand and the Americas in having a co-payment of this kind. In fact, there is a cap of 10 visits on the co-payment for concession card holders—and in Australia there are more than eight million concession card holders—as well as people under the age of 16. For these people the $7 co-payment will be limited to just 10 visits.


If you look at pensions, pensions will go up twice each and every year. If you were to wind the clock back to 1908, when the pension first came in, the life expectancy for a 15-year-old male was 64. He never was going to get the pension. Today the life expectancy for a 15-year-old male in Australia is around 80 years of years age and for a woman it is 85. It is a much different circumstance and this needs to be reflected when it comes to pensions.


If you look at university deregulation, you could be forgiven for thinking that students were paying every dollar up-front. In fact, they do not pay a dollar up-front; they only start to pay back their HELP or HECS loan when their income reaches $50,000. What is more, our new measures will ensure that $1 in every $5 taken by a university as a result of deregulation can be put back into Commonwealth scholarships to help those from regional areas and others of lower socioeconomic advantage. When you look at health and school funding going forward, rather than it being cut it will, over the next four to five years, go up: 37 per cent for school funding and 40 per cent for hospital funding—a significant increase. 


When you look at other aspects of this policy, like the 'earn or learn' for under 30s, there are important carve-outs to ensure that if a young person does not have the capacity to work for more than 30 hours, or if they are a principal carer, if they are a parent or if they have a disability, then they are not going to be subject to these new 'earn or learn' requirements. 


If you listen to the state premiers and the chief ministers talking about losing $80 billion, you would not have known that in fact the states are going to benefit by a total of $60 billion over the coming 10 years—an extra $60 billion in Commonwealth money flowing to the states over the next 10 years. 


We had to take the tough measures in this budget because Labor bequeathed us a fiscal mess. Unemployment increased on their watch. Youth unemployment—as the member for Longman knows—went from 19 to 27 per cent under Labor, and we saw a fall in productivity and Australia's economic growth lag behind the world. We are determined to turn that around. This budget is part of a broader economic narrative which includes deregulation, industrial relations reform, tax reform, getting rid of the carbon tax, getting rid of the mining tax and reviews into competition policy and into the financial system. This is a good budget; this is an important budget. I commend this bill to the House.

WYATT ROY
 (Longman) (12:50):  It is always a great pleasure to follow the eloquence of the member for Kooyong. He and I have had many discussions about this budget. Just down the hallway in another room, the federal Treasurer is concluding his press conference updating the country on the national accounts figures. I will use this opportunity to update the House on those figures as well. 


What the national accounts figures show is that our strong economic action strategy is working, a strategy that recognises that growth and prosperity in this nation come from the private sector, not from a big, overbearing and intervening government. The national accounts figures that the Treasurer is updating the nation's media on now show that there has been 3.5 per cent growth over this year. Significantly, this growth has come predominantly from the non-mining sector. We have seen the smallest current account deficit since 1980—that is 10 years before I was born. Household spending is up, which shows that confidence is returning to the Australian economy. Most significantly, since the beginning of the year there have been 106,000 new jobs created, with 79,000 new full-time jobs. 


What all this shows is that our economic action strategy is working. We are removing barriers to private sector growth and investment, whether that is getting rid of the carbon tax, the mining tax or over $1 billion in red tape every single year. We are freeing the private sector of our economy up so that it can grow, prosper and employ more people. 


As we look at the economic narrative of our nation, it is important to see where we have come from and where we are going. In 2007, when the former coalition government left office, there was a $20 billion surplus, there was $50 billion in the bank and all of Labor's debt had been paid off. Then the Labor Party came to power and we saw our spending increase at the fastest rate of the 17 advanced IMF economies. We saw our debt increase at the third-highest rate of the 17 advanced IMF economies. That was money borrowed against the next generation. 


Where are we now? If we had not acted, the way we are acting in these bills before the House and the way we have acted through the federal budget, the debt would have reached $667 billion. The interest repayments on the debt this year alone will be $12 billion and that would have gone to $17 billion a year if we had not acted. Those are big figures, so let us put them into perspective—what it means for everyday Australians across the nation. The level of debt would have reached over $24,000 for every single man, woman and child. This year, the interest on the debt bill will be $500. If we had not acted, as I said, the interest bill would have risen to $17 billion a year, or over $1,200 for every single man, woman and child. 


The $12 billion in interest this year alone—money that is effectively dead money—would have funded the complete $8 billion upgrade of the Bruce Highway, the complete $1.2 billion upgrade of the Gateway Motorway and a $2 billion new tertiary hospital for Queensland—and we still would have had hundreds of millions of dollars left over. That is the real cost of the interest we are paying. That is what is our nation is missing out on.


As the member for Kooyong pointed out, before we deal with our nation's significant debt burden, that $24,000 debt that all Australians owe, we have to deal with the challenge—and I say it is a challenge, not a problem—of an ageing population. Today, as the member for Kooyong pointed out, there are five people working for every one person in retirement. By 2050 that will reach only 2.7 people for every person in retirement. The percentage of the population aged over 75 will go from about six per cent of the population to over 14 per cent of the population. And what the Productivity Commission has said is that if we do not do anything, taxes would have to rise by 21 per cent to fund them, and that is before we get to that $24,000 bill for every man, woman and child. 


So as a nation we have to make a choice, and that is what this budget is about. Do we say that the problems we have inherited are too hard? Do we say that we will simply run up a greater credit card bill and hand that over to the next generation? Or do we say that as a government and as a country we live within our means so that what we hand over to the next generation of Australians is a nation with as much if not more opportunity than we currently inherit. If we do not, a young Australian growing up in the decades to come will be born with that $24,000 debt bill. They will be born with the need to pay at least 21 per cent higher taxes, and they will be born in a nation where the government does not have the ability to invest in roads and schools and hospitals across the decades to come. I am not prepared to be part of a government that says that the challenges we face as a nation are all too hard, that we are not prepared to make difficult decisions today and that the next generation will pick up the bill. Those are the choices we have to make in this budget and I am proud to say that I am part of a government that is prepared to take on this challenge so that future generations can inherit a nation with greater prosperity and greater opportunity. 


But beyond simply living within our means, we have to go for growth in the private sector. Since coming to government, that is exactly what we have done and that is what those job growth figures demonstrate. We have moved to cut the carbon tax. We have moved to abolish the mining tax and we are cutting over a billion dollars of red tape every single year, from small business predominantly. In my electorate—and I have specific examples where we have gone literally door to door with local businesses—we have found those overbearing and intervening and unnecessary regulations placed on small businesses and we have removed them, saving local businesses thousands of dollars a month so that they can go out and thrive and prosper and employ more people. 


That is the role of the private sector, and it is the role of the government simply to stop being the problem. Beyond that, where the market is not best placed to do so, I believe that it is the role of government to invest in those productivity-increasing measures, those vital pieces of infrastructure that our nation needs. In this budget there is over $50 billion invested into infrastructure, which is great for jobs, great for the economy and great for commuters across our nation.


In my electorate, the Bruce Highway is the great arterial that links our region to Brisbane and to the growing population in our north. It is the economic driver as much as the social driver of our region. In this budget we are investing over $3 billion between the Pine Rivers and Gympie, which will see significant upgrades across that highway and benefit local commuters and local families. We are investing over $16 million into the D'Aguilar Highway. As locals know, this has been a death trap for many years and inaction by the former Labor government resulted in much more tragedy on that road. It is a great matter of pride that after campaigning in 2010 and finally coming to government in 2013, I and the coalition government are able to deliver $16 million for that road. So on the infrastructure front we are investing significantly so that we can go for growth, we can create the jobs and we can see economic productivity lift. 


But we are also at the individual level creating amazing new opportunities, particularly for young people across our nation to find the jobs of the future. We are creating for the first time ever the same opportunities for young people going to TAFE to get a diploma or an advanced diploma for a trade that are applied to a student going to university. If you go to achieve a diploma or an advanced diploma—and often these are people from the most disadvantaged background—you will not have to pay a single dollar upfront. This is the first time ever for our nation. In fact you only pay back the loan when you earn over $50,000, the same rule that applies to higher education. If you decide that you want to become a tradie, we are saying that we will give you $20,000 as a HECS-style loan to get you through your apprenticeship so that you can go on and find meaningful employment in the future.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley—Minister for Small Business) (16:06):  Thank you, Acting Deputy Speaker, and it is great to see you there. You look very resplendent. It is my honour and privilege to rise in support of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015 and related bills.


The budget delivered some weeks ago was a crucial statement of the challenges we are facing and the action we need to take. Not only did it present all of the financial details Australians rightfully expect but it did so with an honesty and an integrity that has been lacking in recent years, in terms of budget numbers and predictions. Beyond the reliability, the integrity and the genuine disclosure in the figures presented by our Treasurer, this budget is the first Abbott government budget. It heralds a change of direction—an important change of direction we need to pursue. It will be this government; it will be our generation; it is at this time we need to make some choices. I believe the choice to commit ourselves to strengthening our nation's future, improving the prospects of our citizens and underwriting the quality of life and security we all expect and hope to enjoy into the future is the direction we need to turn in. That is why this budget is such a significant and important statement of our strategic direction. Together we will put behind us the profligacy and the populism of the previous government and pivot to a new era of prudence, purposefulness and prosperity, where we put in place the fundamental building blocks of a strong and growing economy and a safe and secure future. That is what the budget is about; that is what these bills are about.


They are not easy choices. But they are ones we have to make if we are to fulfil the promise of a nation where our sons and daughters can reach for a better life—a better life like the one we aimed for; a better life like the one that our parents hoped for for us, and that they worked for and enjoyed. We need to make decisions today to give current and future generations the same opportunity and the same realistic chance that we love about our nation. Together we can generate the wealth we need to sustain the extremely important social and income safety net—the safeguard for those who need that support. We can generate the wealth we need to underwrite the living standards of all Australians: those who have made their contribution in the past, those who continue to make their contribution today and those who are unable to provide for themselves.


Our actions and decisions, captured in this budget, will ensure we can invest in important productive infrastructure—like the East West Link Tunnel in my city, Melbourne—not only to carry commuters but to carry commerce. Those arteries of enterprise need to be invested in and that is what this budget is about. We are making sure we can finance the important works and services that our citizens expect from their government.


We are also seeking to invest today to make sure the quality of life and the opportunities that are the envy of the world are there for our citizens into the future. Growth and prosperity matter because they give us the means to support the quality of life we are aiming for. This budget seeks to ensure that quality of life is buttressed; that it is available, secure and in reach not just for today but into the future, so that future generations can enjoy the opportunities those before us have enjoyed. That will involve us all making a contribution.


I know some have not needed to give the opportunities our nation has offered us a second thought. But now a second effort is needed from many of us to make sure that same potential and those same possibilities are available for all our citizens. That is what this budget is about. It is not just about the numbers, as accurate, truthful and honest as they are. It is about setting up this nation for the generation now and the generation to come, so we can sustain economic growth and those boundless opportunities that put a sparkle in my eye and a fire in my belly. We want to make sure that those boundless opportunities are there for the generations to come. But we need to do those hard yards now. We cannot postpone them. We know that making this choice, and this pivot to a more prudent, more prosperous and more purposeful nation—we need to do that at some point. Do we do it now, while those adjustments are modest and can be implemented so as to not cause great shocks to the economy and to our way of life? Or do we wait until they are so critical and so compelling that they cause enormous dislocation? I choose doing it now.


As I travel around my electorate—and I am been pleased to be have been elected seven times by my community—so often I hear calls for leadership, for a longer-term perspective, and for a government that is prepared to address the reality of the challenges that we face and to put the building blocks in place for the future—not to go around as if governing is like some kind of kid's party, where every child gets a prize no matter what they do. This is about the work that needs to be done now to make sure that that potential and those opportunities are in place—so that people, through their own work, effort and enterprise, can make the most of them. I choose to accept that challenge: to make those choices now, and to invest now for our future—to underwrite the opportunities and the living standards we expect.


The budget also articulates an important economic action strategy: to build a strong and prosperous economy. That will give us the safety—as a nation that is proud and able to pay its way; able to make our choices and not be pushed around by the whims of circumstance—and the security to know that we can maintain those important safety nets and support services, and the way of life that we enjoy. It does call on all of us to make a contribution; to build our workforce, to encourage participation and to get the economy growing. Wasn't it great to see those national accounts showing that the economy is now growing at a trend growth rate? That is something that we were denied under the previous Labor government. This is about the opportunities that we need for the future. It is about a path back to surplus—not a fiction, not some headline, but the hard work to deal with the economic and budget challenges that we face—and, more particularly, it is about slashing $300 billion off the projected debt that this nation would have if the policy settings Labor left us were left in place—that is, $300 billion less lead in the saddlebag that our economy need not carry, and that our citizens today and into the future need not service through interest charges and debt servicing. The Treasurer has made it clear: doing nothing is not an option. I do not think that is even contested now. We have seen the Parliamentary Budget Office embrace the concept of the need for change and the need to do it now. We have learned that the former Treasurer was telling former ministers—Minister Carr—that the budget was in a mess. We have even heard that the current Leader of the Opposition—known to be 'Captain Complaint', and to harvest grievances rather than do the hard work and put in the effort that is required to shape a better future—even he—says there is a task to be done. We are up for doing that work.


Across the budget strategy, there are many measures that are of great relevance to my community, and I will touch on those shortly. What is good for all of us is getting those broader economic settings right, and making sure that we are living within our means and targeting our support where it is needed. People in the small business community of Australia know that you cannot keep paying your overdraft interest bill on your credit card and expect everything to be rosy. They know that if you hope to leave the family enterprise to the next generation, you cannot saddle the business with extraordinary debt that limits its options into the future. Just as small business owners know that, and just as households understand that logic, the nation needs to address the reality as well. That is what this budget actually does.


I welcome the support that we have had for tackling the challenges that have to be dealt with now. We did not create this mess. We did not set the nation on a trajectory that was only going to end in heartbreak and tears. We have dealt with the challenges, and we have an action plan to get us out of the hole that Labor was digging us all into. I am encouraged—I have heard the Business Council of Australia talk about its view of the budget. It said: 'Working from a very difficult budgetary starting position, the government deserves credit for taking important steps to confront the long-term challenges Australia faces from an ageing population.' Infrastructure Partnerships Australia also addressed the issue of shifting some of our outlays from consumption to investment—preparing for the future. In a reference that I am particularly heartened by, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said: 'The budget goes a long way to restoring all-important business confidence that will drive investment and job creation, particularly for Australia's two million small businesses that employ some seven million people.'


I have shared with this chamber that under Labor 519,000 jobs were lost in small business. That is part of the legacy that saw Labor end up with 200,000 more people unemployed at the end of their term than was the case at the beginning. But rather than just recognise that and lament the lost opportunities, we are purposefully tackling the problems that Labor created and turning around that momentum. In the budget there are a number of very particular measures designed to assist small business. Getting the economy right and the broader economic settings right are crucial for all small businesses, and that is why the budget repair and the economic action strategy are so important.


But there are also particular measures. The company tax cut: 800,000 small businesses are structured as companies, and they will welcome that 1.5 per cent reduction in the company tax rate as a clear statement of encouragement to invest, to grow, to employ. The small business and family enterprise ombudsman measure: again, a practical measure to problem solve, to help small businesses navigate government programs and the opportunities for support, and to get access to reliable information. The concierge for problem solving, fixing Commonwealth procurement so that you can actually have half a chance of winning some Commonwealth work if you are smaller enterprises.


Funding the ACCC: earlier today in another place, in Senate estimates, the ACCC chairman, Rob Sims, described the budget position that Labor had left the ACCC as 'diabolical'. It was technically insolvent at the time of the election. It was scheduled to run out of cash by April this year. It needed an injection of over $90 million this current financial year and to fund the ACCC in the out years just so that it could keep doing its crucial work to support consumers and to protect their interests and to ensure there is a fair and competitive economic environment. The unfair contracts measure is to make sure small businesses are not disadvantaged by take-it-or-leave-it standard form contracts that big businesses foist on them and then say, 'Take it or leave it because you've got no option', but leaves those small businesses in a very vulnerable and risky circumstance, unable to shape their own economic choices. The restart measure is an incentive for mature-age jobseekers to bring them into employment. Small businesses know mature and experienced staff are crucial to their success.


The refocusing of the EMDG program for export support; ethics work to make sure it is there to support small business. The paid parental leave scheme—what a great measure. What great measure to see small businesses able to offer their staff the kinds of parental leave support big corporates and governments have been offering for years. I do not know why Labor are opposing that. Do they only want to look at work conditions in big corporates and in government? Is that where the unions only pay an interest? Is it because these are not union jobs and so they are not interested? But they are great jobs, and that is why we are trying to make sure a job in small business is supported and has the kinds of benefits and appeal that you see in bigger corporates. The way in which the entrepreneurs infrastructure fund will work will be to better target the support for small business. The ongoing funding for the Small Business Support Line and the Small Business Advisory Services: these are very important measures that say we value small business, we take your interests seriously, we partner with you in the opportunities and the livelihoods that you provide and you can count on us.


At a local level, I am pleased the budget funded a number of election commitments, such as the investment in the Frankston foreshore. I know you are from a great city on the coast, Mr Acting Deputy President Ewen Jones; so is Frankston. It is the Riviera of Melbourne. We are blessed to be a major metropolitan centre and you can go to sleep at night with the sound of waves—a tantalising offer, and that is something we are investing in. Support for our youth through the funding commitment to the Mornington youth; making sure our commercial centres and our shopping areas are saved by a $759,000 investment through the safer streets campaign for improved lighting, CCTV and anti-graffiti measures. 


There is funding for tourism directional signage down on the Peninsula Link. Great news earlier this week: P&O have recognised you might want to go to Vanuatu, you might want to go to those cities, but where do you really want to dock on a cruise? You want to dock in Mornington. So we have P&O cruises heading from Queensland down to the Riviera of Melbourne and docking at Mornington. When people get there they will want to know where all of those delicious attractions are, and that is why we need good tourist directional signage. There is also support for the Men's Shed, the Frankston Park Dolphins function centre, getting the aths track fixed at Ballam Park, investment in the war memorial, improving and expanding the oncology day treatment centre at the Frankston Hospital: all of these things are funded in the budget, and that is why the budget is great for the Dunkley community.


In the few minutes left I want to talk about one other area—the higher education reforms. I have spoken in this place a number of times about the vision I have for Frankston, the Fremantle of the east coast, the educational hub that builds from the great strengths of Monash University having a campus—and I declare that I am the chairman of the community advisory council—and the Chisholm Institute of TAFE. They offer good quality courses but not the variety our citizens need. Unfortunately, only 9.4 per cent of the population of Frankston city have postsecondary education in terms of bachelor degrees or qualifications above. It is 12.1 per cent in the Mornington Peninsula shire. The previous Labor government ran around talking about their policy target of 40 per cent of the Australian population aged between 25 and 34 having those qualifications. It was great to say, but they did nothing to follow through.


I have put forward the proposition of a polytechnic, a university college, that takes the great strengths of those two existing education providers but says: 'You don't need a spectacularly great ENTER score. You can invest in yourself, as we will invest in you through these higher education reforms. You can get the qualifications you need.' It will offer all kinds of courses by a range of providers on a real-time, open campus, co-hosted by those two great institutions. That is a vision for the future. It is great that our higher education reforms support that as well. I know you are excited, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am positive, pumped and very persistent about this too.

"Sudmalis, Ann, MP",LP,2014-06-04,"



Ms SUDMALIS
 (Gilmore) (16:21):  I rise today on the 2014-15 budget to inform the House of my first nine months as the federal representative of the great people of Gilmore. As every parent knows, nine months is a significant period for any new individual to present themselves to the world. It is a period of anticipation and planning, culminating in an often painful delivery. That initial pain subsides as you work and grow with the new family member and all they contribute to the family's future. I am proud to speak today on the appropriation bills that are currently before this House. I am proud because it is a budget that delivers a strong, prosperous economy and a safe, secure Australia. These actions and economic choices reflect the reason I wish to represent the community of Gilmore.


As a mother and grandmother I recognise that actions today will mean a better and brighter future for the grandchildren of us all. This budget encourages every Australian to contribute and build for our future prosperity as a nation, to participate and weave the social fabric of success for our children's children. It is a budget that takes the necessary steps towards structural reform, reform that if left unaddressed will leave our descendants with a shameful legacy of debt and financial depression. It is clear that the days of borrow and spend must come to an end. Now that we have seen the true state of the books that Labor left us, it is clearer still that the time to contribute and build must begin.


Left unaddressed and without serious reform, the budget those opposite left us was spiralling dangerously towards gross debt exceeding $667 billion within 10 years. Let us think what $667 billion could do for Australia. We could build the long-awaited Brisbane-to-Sydney-to-Melbourne bullet train with $500 billion to spare and then we could update our network of national highways across the country to a minimum dual carriageway, highway standard, still with probably about $200 billion to spare. If we take another $50 billion away from that, and that is a new world-class hospital in 25 major cities and regional centres equal in size to Nowra or Ulladulla in my electorate of Gilmore, we would still have $150 billion left to spare. We could build about 50 bridges across the Shoalhaven River and we would still have billions left over. This is the magnitude of the debt and deficit legacy that Labor have left us. Just think on that for a minute.


This is a tough budget, there is no doubt. The electorate of Gilmore has one of the highest levels of mature and wiser Australians. We have also a high unemployment level and welfare dependence issues as well as transport issues. Our region is not unique. Many other regions across our nation have similar complex needs. Borrowing money against the future of our children is not the way to solve the long-term support; however, we must provide for those in our community of greatest need.


We all knew in September 2013 that Australia was in financial trouble, which was the most important, top-of-mind issue that caused me to stand for government and caused me and many Australians to vote for this government. After six years of a big-spend, big-debt government we knew we were in trouble. Up until now nothing had changed. We are still facing an extraordinary level of national debt. With $1 billion every month being borrowed to pay off the interest, it is like getting a credit card to pay off a credit card to pay off the mortgage.


Solving the debt problem for Australia is not going to be easy. We are proud of our world standard health care, always maintaining a safety net and concessional assistance for those who are most vulnerable. The difficult proposal of a Medicare co-payment will help to maintain this very excellent support mechanism for many years to come. We want a universally accessible system of health care to lead far into Australia's future; we do not want to be unaffordable in less than 10 years.


In addition, with life expectancy extended to people living into their mid-80s, we will need significant research to cure the many illnesses and diseases that become significant as we age. The establishment of the Medical Research Future Fund will be essential for our increased longevity and having quality of life as a priority. There are many in Gilmore right now who wish this medical research had been funded before so that their illnesses could be treated with less expensive medicines and possibly cured.


Before the election, we committed to keeping age pensions out of contention for cuts. We have delivered on this. Pensions will rise every six months, just as they should. Before anything else, it needs to be reiterated that there will be no cuts or changes to pensions during this term of government. We have, however, proposed some structural changes to payments in Australia but, importantly, these do not come into effect until July 2017.


The government has made adjustments to a range of income supplements. We must keep in mind that these are not the primary source of income for a family. They were designed to help with some of the costs of raising a family. They were originally designed to support families on low incomes. This is not the case now. The government is tightening the eligibility for these payments at the highest end of the income scale. We all acknowledge that a family whose income is around $100,000 is not really in need of support. It is far better to keep support payments for those families whose income is so much lower.


Let me for a moment expand on what this budget has delivered for Gilmore. Before the 2013 election, the coalition and I made over $15 million worth of promises to the people of Gilmore, to be delivered if we were elected. I am proud to say that those commitments have all been confirmed, just nine months into my first term as federal member—and the proof is in this document. There is guaranteed funding of $10 million for the planning, design and engineering studies for the third crossing of the Shoalhaven River in Nowra, which is the economic artery for our region. Everyone in Gilmore knows why our bridge and our roads are important, and the commitment was established after lengthy discussions with the community and the local council.


There is a Gilmore roads safety package involving over $5 million to fix various black spots and substandard roads across our electorate, including $2 million towards stage 2 of Turpentine Road, an important transit road between villages south of Nowra and north of Ulladulla as well as for accessing the very lucrative Canberra holiday market. I can now add that I have achieved an additional allocation of more than $2 million for more black spot funding and $2 million to complete the next stage of Ulladulla's Dunn Lewis Memorial centre. This is a hub for local youth and community initiatives which will eventually increase sports participation, youth training and tourism employment.


There is $450,000 in grants to different councils in Gilmore to install CCTV cameras in trouble spots across the region. When you speak to small business owners who have been the victims of robbery, like Sue from Bomaderry, or an armed hold-up, like Bruce and Shirley in Kiama, or the business owners of East Nowra and Sanctuary Point where antisocial behaviour is getting out of hand, you really appreciate the benefit of CCTV cameras.


There is $450,000 to help complete the next stage of the Jervis Bay 'round the bay' walk, something which, once completed, will be a jewel in the South Coast's already impressive tourism offering. There is $300,000 to begin restoration works on the historical Berry School of Arts, a popular function centre and working building. This funding will help restore the building so that it can more effectively be used by the community and raise funds for maintenance and other local groups. There is $300,000 to go towards local youth recreation facilities in the region. Eventually these funds will be used in the establishment of three separate use facilities. There is $20,000 in equipment grants for our PCYC and the Sanctuary Point Mens Shed. Every single one of these commitments was secured by me from the government after extensive consultation with my community.


In addition to the commitments being approved, I have worked closely with the community to lobby the Commissioner of Taxation, through the Assistant Treasurer, to stop the GST being levied on relocatable homes. I have worked tirelessly with Manildra , the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Industry to help retain this vital local-manufacturing enterprise. It is an iconic industry in Gilmore that supports many local families as well as many farmers throughout the eastern states of Australia.


I have established the need for expanded mobile black-spot coverage. I have spoken at length with the Minister for Communications and related the unusual geography of Gilmore, necessitating the nomination of three separate sites. We have achieved the allocation of four Green Army projects in Gilmore—two in the Shoalhaven, one in Kiama and one in Killalea, part of the Shellharbour City Council area. These initiatives will assist some 40 young people into a work-like environment, creating an asset for the local community, learning valuable skills and developing a work ethic. Under previous schemes in Gilmore, a number of the Green Corps graduates were employed in landscape businesses. Some even set up their own businesses of removal of noxious weeds or bush regeneration.


Having invited the Assistant Minister for Employment to the area, where we showcased our local businesses, not-for-profits and job-search providers, we worked hard with the minister and participated in the task force to establish the revamp of Work for the Dole. We achieved the goal of getting a phase 1 rollout of a Work for the Dole program approved for Gilmore. We already know that Work for the Dole is a proven, effective method to assist young people into the paid workforce. 


In a region where getting a job can be difficult, an essential first step is to get work experience, while these young people will have income support from the government. They will be asked to volunteer in local organisations. In these places they will get the necessary skills and experience that will open doors for paid work. These programs build self-esteem; at the same time they build on the volunteer capacity of our community. The budget is tough, but Gilmore is well placed to make the most of the changes and adapt, as it always does, and invest in their own human capacity to create a strong and sustainable financial future not only for the Gilmore community but also as part of the national effort to fix up our country. 


The government is determined to maintain a financial support structure that will operate for years and decades into the future. A single aged pensioner can still receive up to around $26,000 per year in direct benefits. A single-parent job seeker over 30 can receive up to $28,000 in welfare benefits. A low-income family only able to earn around $30,000 can receive up to $28,000 in help. There is support for those most vulnerable. There is a plan to continue this into the future. There is a vision to empower young people to volunteer their time and energy in return for their welfare. They can build skills and self-confidence, giving them a chance to step up the rungs of the ladder of employment, so they get paid. There are opportunities for apprentices to access financial help, to supplement their wages or other expenses, up to $20,000 over four years. We know that regional expenses are difficult for our apprentices and this will definitely help. In addition, when they are able to earn more than $50,000 they will only have to pay back $16,000.


There are incentives for employers to take on employees over 50 years of age: up to $10,000 over two years. I have received many calls from our more mature job seekers who feel that age has actually been a disadvantage. But now there is a change that will inspire them to re-engage and it will encourage employers to finally give them a chance.


This is a time to rebuild, renew and regenerate. We are all responsible for this massive task, but we are Australians first and foremost—tough, resilient and resourceful. With this budget, we can get our nation back onto its strong, financial foundations and, with the community's support, push Gilmore into new levels of prosperity.

Mr MATHESON
 (Macarthur) (16:33):  I rise today to speak about the government's 2014 budget and the impact it will have on Macarthur residents now and into the future. It is no surprise that this was a tough budget, one put together by a Treasurer who had the best interests of this country and all of its people in mind. Tough decisions were made, some that may not have been popular. Sometimes a government has no choice but to make unpopular decisions and changes to ensure the economic security and prosperity of a nation. 


Australia is a very lucky country and we have much to be proud of and thankful for. However, there was a time when Australia's bank balance was a lot healthier than it is now, giving the government of the day more opportunities to give financial support to its people. 


Today's government is not in that position. The previous government ran up five record deficits and left $123 billion in future deficits. If we took no action, debt would have hit $667 billion. Every month the government is paying $1 billion in interest costs on Labor's debt. Imagine what this government could do with that interest alone to support families and pensioners in Australia? It is imperative for our future generations that we pay off this debt and fix the mess that the former Labor government left us with. 


The coalition understands that every cent we give to support families and pensioners in Australia comes directly from the pockets of taxpayers. We also understand the importance of supporting those most vulnerable and our pensioners who have worked hard and paid taxes all their lives. But if we want to continue our support for pensioners and families well into the future then we need to make sure our welfare system is sustainable. We need to promote a working culture where people who are able to work or study do so. We need to encourage people off welfare and into employment so that more people are contributing to our wonderful country. A fair and sustainable welfare system is one that encourages everyone who can work to work. Our system will create a more sustainable age pension so we can support older generations for many years to come. Under this budget there will be better targeted payments to those most in need. 


In this budget we have also taken a positive step to build infrastructure for the future, and when it comes to infrastructure some very positive things came out of this budget for the people of Macarthur. In fact this is the first time in six years that Macarthur has even been mentioned in the budget. Under Labor we were neglected for too long. In the budget the Treasurer announced millions of dollars in much-needed infrastructure being spent in Macarthur and Western Sydney. Funding allocated to projects in my electorate in the 2014-15 financial year include: $1.3 billion to the Northern Road, $1 billion for Elizabeth Drive, as well as upgrades to Bringelly Road and Narellan Road. The upgrade of Narellan Road was announced during last year's election campaign. In total the government has contributed $53 million to upgrade Narellan Road to a six-lane divided road to improve traffic flow and road safety. Anything that will result in lower commute times for my constituents and give them more time at home with their families is a great thing. 


As part of this budget Macarthur also has three projects commencing in 2014-15 under the Community Development Grants Fund. These grants include: $500,000 towards artificial grass for Lynwood Park sporting fields, $335,000 for a new heating system for the swimming pool at Mater Dei's special needs school and $200,000 for Narellan Jets field upgrade. 


Campbelltown City Council has also received $350,000 for CCTV cameras as part of the government's Safer Streets program. This is an important investment in the Macarthur region. As a former police officer, I know that the best way to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour is to prevent it occurring in the first place. Local residents and business owners have been concerned by increasing incidence of crime in parts of my electorate. Not only do these visible cameras make potential criminals think twice before doing the wrong thing, but they will also make a valuable contribution in increasing conviction rates by assisting police gather evidence and prosecute offenders. I would like to thank Campbelltown City Council and the Campbelltown police for supporting this initiative. Macarthur is one of the fastest growing regions in New South Wales so I am very pleased to see that this Liberal government is taking my electorate seriously and delivering the infrastructure we need to cope with this population boom. 


As part of this budget we will also make higher education more accessible by expanding support to pathway courses such as diplomas for those who might not yet be ready to do a full degree. Our government will also introduce a new Commonwealth scholarship program to boost equity of access for disadvantaged students. We want to ensure that Australian universities are not left behind by the rapidly improving higher education systems of our neighbours, particularly in the Asian region. To help create more opportunities for Australians to undertake higher education and ensure that Australia is not left behind, we will extend Commonwealth funding to all students in non-university higher education institutions studying bachelor courses, costing $448.9 million over three years. We will create more opportunities for students from low-socioeconomic backgrounds through our new Commonwealth scholarship and equity initiative. We will remove all HELP loan fees which are currently imposed on some students undertaking higher education and vocational education and training. We will maintain the Higher Education Loans Program, HELP, that sees taxpayer support for all students' tuition fees upfront, and we will provide support to all bachelor and diploma students in all higher education institutions and universities, colleges and TAFEs accredited to provide higher qualifications.


At the present time, the taxpayer pays about 60 per cent of the cost of a degree and the student, the graduate, pays about 40 per cent. These changes will move it to about 50-50 and, like everything we do, there is a policy reason for doing this. We want the system to remain sustainable. We want to be able to help students for many years and decades into the future. Essentially, we are going to lend the money to the student at the same rate that the government borrows the money, with a maximum rate of six per cent. This will ensure the system is sustainable. Under this system, if an institution decides to charge additional fees, then 20 per cent of that has to go into a scholarship fund. Professor Ian Young, Vice Chancellor of the ANU and Chair of the Group of Eight, a coalition of Australia's elite universities, spoke about the changes recently. He said that right now, when a student comes to university, they do not pay a cent up-front for their tuition fees. They will not in the future either, so there is no barrier in terms of tuition fees when one goes to university. He went on to say that the barrier for many students is living costs and that is what really hits poor students. He said that in the future we will have a scholarship fund to be able to give those students funds to be able to live, so there is going to be a greater capacity to assist disadvantaged students.


Ultimately we need to make our higher education support system sustainable. We also want to help young people transition to work, and that is why we are introducing the Trade Support Loans for apprentices—to encourage more young people to take up a trade and complete their qualification. From 1 July 2014 the government will offer interest-free loans of up to $20,000 over the life of an apprenticeship. These loans will ease the financial burden and help increase apprenticeship completion rates. Those who complete their apprenticeship will be given a 20 per cent discount, so will only have to pay $16,000 for a $20,000 loan. Like HELP loans for tertiary students, the loans will be repayable once the apprentices are earning a sustainable income.


The government is also honouring its commitments and investing $64.5 billion in government and non-government schools over the next four years. This is $1.2 billion more than the previous government would have spent over the forward estimates. We have met our commitment to provide funding certainty for schools over the next four years from 2014 to 2017. From 2013 to 2018, the total Commonwealth funding to all schools in Australia, as outlined in the budget papers, will have increased by 37 per cent, a $4.6 billion increase. Funding by the Commonwealth from 2018 onwards will continue to grow but it will be based on the consumer price index and enrolment growth. The key issue is where the money should be spent. We believe the key issues are teacher quality, increased school autonomy, a rigorous, up-to-date curriculum and increased parental engagement. Mr Gonski himself acknowledged recently that Australia has not been spending its money on the right priorities. We have also kept our election commitment to invest $243.8 million over four years to revitalise the school chaplaincy program. School chaplaincy supports young people in many local schools across Macarthur. These chaplains provide a safe and supportive influence for students, especially those doing it tough or at risk of dropping out of school. The government will also invest around $28.5 billion in childcare fee assistance for families over the next four years. 


We are also strengthening Medicare to ensure that all Australians can continue to access world-class healthcare services at an affordable price. Ten years ago the Australian government was spending $8 billion on Medicare. Today it is $19 billion and in 10 years time it is projected to be more than $34 billion. The taxpayer currently funds 263 million services per year, which are free to patients under Medicare. Clearly this is unsustainable. There is growing pressure on the health system from an ageing population, the increasing incidence of chronic disease and increases in cost generated by new technologies. We are making our health system more sustainable and investing in medical research. We want to ensure that Australia remains the best and healthiest place in the world to raise a family and care for loved ones. As part of our plan we are asking Australians to make a modest contribution to their healthcare costs through the introduction of a $7 co-payment for visits to the GP. Contrary to Labor's strong opposition to this $7 co-payment in the recent budget, in previous years senior Labor Party leaders championed the introduction of the user-pays system. Labor's contradictory and continuous opposition to these measures outlined in the government's budget runs the risk of directing Australia down the same destructive economic path that the previous Labor government took. Five dollars of the money taken from each patient will be put directly into the world's biggest medical research endowment fund. This fund will find the cures of the future and be funded by the government's health reforms. In my electorate there are many families caring for loved one with a life-threatening disease or illness. The government's hope is that this record investment in medical research will find cures and better treatments for all people suffering with long-term health issues and incurable conditions. By making a modest contribution to our healthcare costs when we visit the GP, we are contributing to a research fund that could find cures for things like cancer, brain tumours, cystic fibrosis, dementia, ovarian cancer, diabetes and many more life-threatening conditions. The contribution will be capped at 10 visits per year for Commonwealth concession card holders and children under 16 to protect more vulnerable patients.


Our population is ageing and we must also make the necessary changes to ensure our age pension system is sustainable and can continue into the future. The fact is that someone who retires today can expect to receive the age pension for about 20 years after retirement. Without policy change, our spending on the age pension is expected to increase by 70 per cent over the next decade. Over the past 100 years there has been little change in the pension eligibility age, yet over the same period the average life expectancy has increased by 65 years, to around 85 years of age. Our plan is to increase the age pension age to 70 by 1 July 2035. This gives Australians time to prepare for these changes. And, despite any scare campaign from those opposite, pensions will still increase under this government: from September 2017, we are indexing pensions to inflation rather than to wages. At the same time, eligibility thresholds will be paused for three years. This will assist with the rising cost of providing the pension, while ensuring that pensions keep up with the cost of living.


We have also introduced measures to help overcome discrimination against older and unemployed Australians, strengthening incentives for them to return to the workforce. The government will introduce a new wage subsidy called Restart to encourage businesses to employ Australians aged 50 and over who have been on income support for at least six months. From July this year, employers who hire an eligible mature-age job seeker on a full-time basis will be paid a subsidy of $10,000 over 24 months. We are expecting 32,000 mature-age job seekers to benefit from this program annually. This is a fantastic thing for people over 50 living in my electorate.


Small- to medium-sized businesses in Macarthur will also benefit from this budget. We remain committed to cutting the company tax rate by 1.5 percentage points from July 2015. For large companies, the reduction will offset the cost of the government's paid parental leave levy. For up to 800,000 small- and medium-sized companies, it will provide a net boost to productivity. We have also introduced young job seeker reforms to help young people lead into employment rather than encouraging them to be on welfare. In order to reach their full potential, we believe young Australians who can work should be earning, learning or participating in Work for the Dole. By going to help young job seekers under the age of 30 to participate in JobSearch, the unemployment services activity is funded by the government for six months before job seekers receive Newstart or Youth Allowance. After six months, job seekers will be required to participate in at least 25 hours per week of Work for the Dole activities and will be eligible to receive income support for six months. However, young people who do not have full capacity to work, who are in education or training or who have a significant disability will all be exempt from these requirements, as will those with parenting responsibilities. 


Making these changes will foster a work culture in this country that we have seen in previous generations. These generations did not rely on welfare, but worked hard for the good of their families and for the good of the country. We need to move away from a welfare culture, where people do not take responsibility for themselves or for their families but rely heavily on government support. I know there are people in my electorate who are unable to work for legitimate reasons and who need support—and those people who legitimately cannot work will receive government support. But those who are able to work or learn will be encouraged to do so under these changes, so that we are all contributing to our economy and to the future of our families. Australia has been considered by many as a lucky country. I am sure that those generations who worked hard to make this the lucky country understand why this government is making these changes. We have made the tough decisions, to make our health, education and welfare systems more sustainable into the future, and to ensure that our children and our grandchildren will still have access to the support of the government for many years to come.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2014-06-04,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (16:48):  I rise to bring the second reading debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015 and cognate bills to a close, and to thank those members who have made a contribution—including the member for Macarthur, who always makes an excellent contribution. He is a member with plenty of common sense, and he is joined by a lot of those on our side. 


These appropriation bills seek authority from the parliament for expenditure of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2014-2015 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015 concern expenditure planned for the forthcoming income year. The total of appropriations being sought through these three appropriation bills is just under $88.4 billion. I would like to highlight just five proposed appropriations, relating to the delivery of the government's commitments.


Firstly, over $28.3 billion is to be provided to the Department of Defence to support the defence of Australia and its strategic interests. This funding includes funding to deliver the government's election commitment to re-establish the Australian Defence Force Gap Year program. Military service is a noble endeavour, and encouraging young people to get a taste of life in the services once they finish school is an important part of continuing to attract new personnel to our Army, Navy and Air Force—and, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, being the member for Herbert, you would certainly know that. All new recruits at the Army Recruit Training Centre at Kapooka in my Riverina electorate go through that fine establishment for their initial training. So it is also very important to those people in the Riverina electorate.


Secondly, just over $6.1 billion is proposed for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which includes appropriations for international development and a $200 million capital injection to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation.


Thirdly, just under $4.3 billion is to enable the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to manage migration and citizenship, support Australia's humanitarian obligations and manage the stay and departure of all noncitizens. Stopping the boats was one of our top priorities on coming to office, and it is a priority on which we have delivered. It has now been 167 days since we had an illegal boat arrival. In that time the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection has closed nine detention centres. That is saving money. More importantly, it is saving lives.


Fourthly, just under $3.5 billion is proposed for the Department of Communications, including just over $3.2 billion to provide funding to continue to roll out the National Broadband Network. On coming to government we commissioned a strategic review to tell the truth about the state of the NBN. Labor significantly underestimated the cost and complexity of this project and committed to roll-out schedules that were unrealistic and inaccurate. But we are getting on with the job of delivering the NBN as quickly and cost effectively as possible.


On the subject of communications, I recently had the pleasure of welcoming the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, the member for Bradfield, to my electorate to witness, firsthand, the impact of mobile black spots on local communities and the Riverina generally—and specifically around Tumut and Narrandera.


Under Labor, I wrote numerous letters to the then Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy. I do not recall ever actually receiving a response. But under the coalition government, electorates such as mine will benefit from the government's $100 million mobile black-spot program. That is just another example of how the coalition is delivering for rural and regional communities in a way that Labor never did.


Fifthly, just over $1.6 billion is proposed for the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development, including funding for the government's new Bridges Renewal Program and the Roads to Recovery Program. Those are very important. In his budget-in-reply speech the opposition leader, the member for Maribyrnong, talked a lot about the forgotten people but did not once mention rural Australia. The coalition knows the importance of the role rural and regional Australia plays in underpinning the productivity and prosperity of the country. That is where our food comes from. That is where our mineral wealth comes from. That is why we will invest in road and rail infrastructure to help expand the capacity of our regions to grow and thrive. 


We heard Labor talking a lot about our regions just merely surviving. We do not want our regions merely to survive; we want them to thrive. The budget also confirmed funding for the coalition's Safer Streets Program, where proceeds of crime will be directed to fund local crime prevention projects for closed circuit television. This was a key commitment I made to my electorate, and I was able to assure Wagga Wagga residents that the $500,000 promised will be delivered under this budget.


Appropriation Bill (No. 2) would also increase the general drawing rights limit for general purpose financial assistance payments to $5 billion. And the general drawing rights limit for National Partnership payments would increase to $25 billion. 


Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 2013-2014 and Appropriation Bill (No. 6) 2013-2014 are the supplementary additional estimates appropriation bills, and they are seeking authority from the parliament for the additional expenditure of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for this financial year. I would like to highlight two areas relating to the delivery of the government's commitments that are supported by these bills. First, just under $662 million is proposed for the Department of Defence, reflecting several matters. Those include supplementation for Operation Southern Indian Ocean, Defence real estate sales, expenditure brought forward to assist with certain purchases, and supplementation for foreign exchange movements. Second, just over $306 million is proposed for the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development, primarily for off-network roads projects, where milestones have been reached much earlier than anticipated. The total appropriations being sought through these two appropriation bills is just over $1.3 billion.


The member for Denison would have the parliament reject the government's budget. He would have the parliament vote against this package of bills, apparently to send us back to the drawing board. He has called on the crossbenchers and the opposition to support him in what I would call a futile crusade—a try-on. My understanding is that the opposition, to its credit, intend to follow convention and vote for these bills. So, in this place at least, the member for Denison will be engaging in what is merely a tokenistic gesture. However, I think it is worth being clear about  the practical effects of what the member for Denison actually proposes.


Anyone considering the member for Denison's advice would do well to bear in mind that three-quarters of total Australian government expenditure, including the age pension, the disability support pension and the Newstart allowance, is made through special appropriations under distinct legislation, not the appropriation bills before us now. Arrangements by which students repay their Higher Education Contribution Scheme debts are similarly dealt with under stand-alone legislation. Tax changes can also be given effect to through separate legislation. What these appropriation bills do, however, is fund the ongoing business of government. Without the passage of these bills, departments and agencies will not be funded to do things such as process applications for the age pension, the disability support pension and the Newstart allowance. They allow tax returns to be processed and advice to be given by the Australian Taxation Office.


Any members and senators planning on supporting the member for Denison in his bid to make 2014 the first year since 1975 when parliament has refused to give the government of the day money to fund public services should think about what that will mean for their electorate, their state and the Australian people as a whole. Anyone supporting that will have people turning up to their office asking why they would not support the local Centrelink office to stay open, why they did not think the Australian Taxation Office was worth funding and why they cannot get their application for the aged pension, disability support pension or Newstart allowances processed.


This budget sets us on a credible path back to surplus. It is a budget built on tough decisions, not on wishful thinking. If we did not make these tough decisions now, the budget would be in a much worse state, requiring much more stringent measures in the future. The people of Australia would quite rightly ask us in years to come why we did not have the courage to make the tough decisions in 2014. Without a drastic departure from Labor's tax-and-spend approach we would have remained on track to remain in deficit for at least the next decade, leaving us vulnerable to external shocks and ill equipped to cope with the challenges in the future.


The Deputy Prime Minister was asked on 15 May about how the budget was going to deliver for rural and regional communities, which are certainly important to me and to the member for Parkes, who asked the question in question time. The Deputy Prime Minister's response bears thinking about:


The Government's record spend of $50 billion on an infrastructure package covers many regional roads that link to the national transport network.


Beyond this the Government remains committed to delivering the $2.5 billion Roads to Recovery Programme. This programme provides funding straight to local councils in order to improve local roads that the community identifies as priorities.


In addition to this the Government will also provide $565 million to fix dangerous roads under the Black Spots Programme and $300 million for the new Bridges Renewal Programme.


The Government has also committed to funding a $1 billion National Stronger Regions Fund which will help communities construct and improve infrastructure. This will in turn help to support livability and drive economic growth.


Those are very important things. I commend the Deputy Prime Minister, who is the Acting Prime Minister at the moment, given that Tony Abbott is overseas, for his commitment and his strident advocacy for rural and regional Australia, and certainly for supporting the National Stronger Regions Fund because it is so important to get the infrastructure in place to help drive growth.


Our sensible budget, as we heard the member for Macarthur talk about, is in marked contrast with what Labor has to offer—no policies, no alternative and no hope; just more debt and more deficit. When Labor came into office they inherited a $20 billion surplus with no net debt and $45 billion in the bank. I think the member for North Sydney would be a little jealous of Peter Costello, because the Labor debt and deficit after the 1996 election that Peter Costello inherited from the Hawke-Keating era was absolutely nothing when compared to what we inherited.


Between 2008-09 and 2012-13 Labor delivered deficits totalling $191 billion. Labor left additional projected deficits of $123 billion over the next four years, 2013-14 to 2016-17. Over six budgets Labor increased spending by over 50 per cent—$137 billion. You cannot keep maxing out the nation's credit card. It would not be responsible. It is what the Treasurer, Joe Hockey, has called intergenerational theft. It is absolute theft from our future generations. They would then be saddled with it. Our children and grandchildren would have to pay off the legacy left by Labor.


The International Monetary Fund recently found Australia's spending is projected to grow faster than any of the 17 advanced economies it profiled. Labor's waste and mismanagement knew no bounds. There was a cost blowout of at least $29 billion with the NBN. There was simply no cost-benefit analysis ever done. There was the $6 billion to $8 billion—who would know?—blowout cost of overpriced school halls. It was a good project, but hopelessly managed. Although, I should say that perhaps only $8 billion was probably a pretty good achievement by Labor compared to some of the other things that it introduced. The disastrous pink batts program cost $2.8 billion and, sadly, cost four lives, including someone from my electorate. There were $900 stimulus cheques sent to around 27,000 Australians living overseas and, would you believe, 21,000 people who were deceased. What a waste of money.


Treasury projects that without policy change, without doing anything, left unchecked, the budget will be in deficit for the next 10 years, which would mean 16 unbroken years of deficits—the longest stretch of deficits since World War II. Every time we look across—the member for Macarthur, every time you and I look across the chamber, we see the architect of this absolute disaster. It is the member for Lilley: supposedly the world's greatest treasurer, but the member of parliament who left us, who left not only the coalition but also Australia, with such a legacy of shame. Labor presided over the fastest deterioration of our debt position in modern history.


The midyear budget update projects Australia will have $667 billion of debt in 10 years unless policies change—and they have changed. They changed the night the Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, delivered this budget. That is when they changed. That is when, as the member from Macarthur pointed out, the buck stopped. The buck stops with us, but the buck also stops with Australia—it has to. We have to get on with learning or earning; we have to get on with paying back this debt that we inherited and that Australians inherited. Each Australian's share of Australian government debt is currently $13½ thousand. That is bad enough, but unless we take action this will grow by $1,100 per year and reach $24,500 in a decade. This year Labor's debt will cost taxpayers more than $12 billion in interest payments. That is $1 billion per month in interest alone. It is like paying your credit card with another credit card. Australians cannot keep doing that.


We cannot keep affording this huge debt. One billion dollars would build so many hospitals, so many schools—not just in rural and regional Australia but also in the metropolitan cities. With this interest bill alone we could build a world-class teaching hospital in every capital city or finish duplication of the Pacific Highway. How many lives would that save? This year's $12 billion interest debt is equivalent to around half of Australia's defence budget; the government spends around the same amount on aged care. Aged care is one of those areas that is so important, particularly with an ageing population.


In six chaotic years, Labor had two prime ministers, three deputy prime ministers and half-a-dozen small business ministers—and we heard our small business minister give such an evangelical speech before about how we are going to fix up the debt and deficit and how we are going to get Australia working again. We have heard the Prime Minister—the 'infrastructure Prime Minister'—say Australia is now open for business again. Indeed we are. I commend the budget; I commend the appropriation bills. And with that, I commend it to the House.


Question agreed to.
